welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick thanks for joining us for episode 21 I'm Leila and I'm shell and today we are going to talk about a message that we've received we get emails we get Instagram messages and this one we wanted to actually address so this came uh from one of our our Instagram followers super cute I just got to say okay so we got this message we'll say it's from AJ who admittedly said that uh they just came across our podcast hey AJ wanted to hunt us down you know you know how many people Ila how many people want to hunt us down I feel a lot and I'm really sorry I'm behind on the emails if you've emailed me recently and I haven't gotten back to you it'll be a day or two Festival season is here man I'm busy we'll get there we'll get there but AJ has some questions and some stories so we're gonna dive into this real quick she asked if we could actually do an episode about this so we decided that tonight we're going to talk about your abilities channeling your psychic abilities your psychic abilities channeling your in inner abilities so we want to kind of touch on some channeling your psychic ability stuff as well as kind of addressing uh AJ's message so this is going to be great I think so too especially because this is one of the most common questions that I would get from students whenever somebody would start in one of our classes sh they all want to know how psychic am I do I have this ability or the other option is we hear the I've had AB andc happen does that mean I have psychic abilities and my answer to those people is yes yes yes you do have psychic ability everybody has a psychic ability I mean how often especially when you're a kid in school shell how often were you sitting in class and you could feel someone stare at you all the time all the or how often could you stare at someone to get them to turn around and look at you I still do that now right that's a psychic ability that we all have that we all kind of take for granted and so I think that there are a few things that a person can do in order to enhance those abilities or to control those abilities like in the case of AJ here she's having a little bit of trouble and it seems like maybe they're running away with her and she'd like to have a little help learning how to be more in control of that ability and I think that's one thing that folks who are new to Witchcraft and magic and all that that is once you kind of light that spark it's like a firecracker things are kind of pinging all over and it's like almost like you are all of a sudden aware of all these things and it's almost overwhelming I think if we can cover some steps to kind of help then we're doing our part and the things that someone can do if you have psychic ability and you're kind of having these experiences are the exact same thing that you can do if you would like to develop psychic ability or to develop a talent that you're not sure if you even have now I know you have the most excellent relatable analogy so throw it on us talk to me about baseball analogy because I know that one yes I do this is one I used to use a lot back in my tarot reading days because very often I'd be doing a Tarot party and people would be like oh my gosh this is so cool how you can do this you must be so special to be able to read tarot not really I mean I but exactly though that's the thing and that's what I would tell them is no I'm not special and I would relate it to baseball because everyone can play baseball some people are born with an excess of talent and they can seemingly pick up a bat and a ball and are instant Superstars seemingly without ever having to practice other people have to work really really hard to get to that point but they can still get to that point and then the rest of us kind of fall in varying ways but everyone no matter who you are whether you're differently abled no matter who you are you can play baseball in some way practice makes perfect practice makes perfect it just takes work and that's the same thing with with psychic abilities or divination or or what have you practice makes perfect the more you do it the better you're going to be at it just like with baseball in my family and I think in yours too shell women's intuition was a really big thing oh my my spiritual ual grandmother who was very Christian but also very much believed in spiritualism and ghosts and uh divination I mean she gave me my first Tarot deck um she was very big on women's intuition and if she had an inkling that something would happen she would vocalize it my family history is more I I used to call it superstitions you know God forbid you drop a butter knife in my grandma's house because if you drop a butter knife someone's coming I think it was something like if you dropped a fork it was someone with ill intent and if it was butter knife it was just someone was coming like there was like this whole scheme to it depending on what you dropped or the other thing is don't stand behind my grandma when she's cooking or you're getting salt in your eye because you put a pinch of salt in the dish you put a pinch of salt over your shoulder these are the people that thought I was crazy when I got into witchcraft but boy were they sure doing would she stuff I'll tell you they really did and let's go to AJ's DMS let's talk a little bit about that okay so AJ sent the message and kind of starts off with um when she was young her dreams would come true in some way shape or form you know there's many types of of psychic abilities and this is absolutely one of them there was uh the Claire's as we like to call them yes I actually got that from a book that we'll talk a little bit here um later that I'm also going to recommend it's called psychic witch and it's by Matt Ain and we'll get into that a little bit but the term Claire's I think is his term to describe this group of different types of psychic ability so there's the Clare audience that's when you hear things whatever that may be divinatory information there is CLA Augustus which means tasting that is not something I am personally familiar with but is definitely a thing I have never heard of that until we started researching this I have never heard of Claire augustin's or well I have heard of CLA tangency but i' never heard it called that that was psychometry CLA tangency is psychometry so I've never heard it called that so some of these were new to me which by the way um clar tangency is through touch so some people get it through touch there is the clear empathy which is through emotion which I think that a lot of people have and don't realize um is is the CLA the Clare epithe there's the Clairvoyance seeing again I think Clairvoyance is is something that a lot of folks experience that's seeing things um apparitions things of that nature like say when my grandpa comes and visits me there's the clar cognizance that's a big one that is just kind of knowing that intuition that gut feeling that sense when you're in a situation and you know it's a bad situation you know it's it's just that that six sense and if you're having dreams like AJ is now AJ described several different dreams that she had had and those could be a type of clear cognizance or Clairvoyance depending on how she's receiving these dreams it could be clear empathy we're not really sure it doesn't really matter this is where I think journaling comes in you know she had a situation where there was a in a dream um and and woke up actually with some scratches I would take that more as symbolism what is the symbolism of the tiger um how did you feel during that experience in the dream jot down those feelings and and you know what you felt from that tiger that's important I actually want to stop you right there and and mention how you feel about the tiger sh you nailed that one because as someone who has done dream interpretation in the past and also has worked with hypnotic symbolism to work with people in Alpha states there are Universal symbols we all have some things that are very very common but no matter how common a symbol is it is always highly personal what it means to you in a vision state or in a dream state so if you're looking up online what does a tiger mean you'll find that it can mean strength it can mean protection it can mean it's trying to protect you from danger it could be maybe that was that's her feline um her feline strength maybe that's her spirit maybe that's part of her magic or it could be something entirely different you need to write it down like sh said and really write how you felt about it were you scared of the tiger were you not scared of the tiger did a look in the tiger's eye catch your attention you know write down all those little details before it disappears from you because those are the things that are important and that's what's going to help you interpret your visions and then she she kind of goes on about a couple of different dreams where um she actually dies in the dream or is about to die in the dream and I think again symbolism and writing it down um and kind of seeing where you can kind of connect those dots you know in one of her specific stories she talked about shortly after the dream of death she was evicted from a house you know sometimes death isn't death first of all it could just be the end of a phase the start of a new one you know you're closing one door as another one opens so I think a lot of especially with with AJ's message specifically a lot of it is about symbolism and what what do these events symbolize to you and how did they make you feel so I think those ones kind of go into maybe a change in life for me personally I saw those two visions um and I'm going to read them just a little bit here because I thought those were actual visions that she had of the future that read very much to me like she was seeing a future possibility but because she changed her actions those possibilities didn't come through and that kind of gets to a point um that I want to talk about but the first Dream she had a dream about a house in particular that was killing her family one by one every time she would wake up she kept going back to this same dream years later she moved into the house that she had dreamed about so she had what seemed like a nightmare it was actually premonition of a house that she moved into she says that she remembered the dream when she moved in but the weird part is is that her neighbor told her that her landlord had been trying to sneak in the back door while she was gone and so because of the intervention of this neighbor I think that prevented what could have been a very nasty situation so personally I felt like that was an actual premonition I felt the same way about her second Vision she talks about where one night she was taking the garbage out and and was stopped by a vision while she was awake she saw a bright light saw a stop sign heard screaming and a car breaking and she says she refused to drive for a month month after that vision and I think in both of those cases those were actual clar sentients I think she was actually having visions of the future where she changed the outcome she changed the outcome and that's another thing I used to tell tarot clients is the future is not set I mean I do think some events are but that's for a different podcast but the future for the most part is not set just by learning you know talking to a terror reader or doing your own meditation or divination and learning of something if you change your behaviors you can change that outcome and I I think that's what happened there and it would really depend on how she felt about them what did the vision look like to her did it look like a Future Vision or did it feel more like a symbolism because exactly like shell said this could be a symbolic death where all these changes are happening and it's really going to depend on how the person having the vision you know really works through and pays attention to those details and figures that out for themselves now a couple of things that I think would help is you know you want to do things like grounding cleansing again journaling especially for AJ I know you're out there listening girl Journal this stuff you know you want to do some circling some protection you know these kinds of things get you to get you to be in some feel-good space and damn AJ should have journaled this because she says she had had a dream where um she saw something happening in the water and she was all upset she woke up having this dream about something bad happening in the water and that same day was when the Titan the submersible that ended up unfortunately imploding went into the water and so if you write these things down the date the time how you felt what you saw you can start to look back through it and see where you were right right that that that self-affirmation that self those self-affirmations are so important you know like shell said the first things that we teach people some of the first lessons you learn when you come into a coven or when you come into a magical group is how to ground grounding cleanse and protect your right I mean those are the first things you learn control your own energy you know because the thing is is that you you know yeah you can have these abilities but you don't want them to take over your life you know I can't be I can't be receiving messages when I'm working I got a job to do so you know you got to be able to kind of think of it as a light switch kind of turn it on and turn it off yeah so you know this this grounding and cleansing I I think is really your best step one and practice practice practice I mentioned earlier a book that I'm currently reading and there's actually a Reddit group right now with the author in that Reddit study group where they're going chapter by chapter and the book is called psychic witch a metaphysical guide to meditation magic and manifestation and it's by author Matt Ain and it's really really good I'm very much enjoying it as you go through it there's actual workings that you should do as you go through it AJ this book would be a lifesaver for you girl because it has some great stuff in here and one of the very first exercises that he has people do is to sit and relax I would tell you to get into a meditative State and then count down from 100 to one and try to just focus on that and it's more difficult than you think it is because getting into that meditative Focus State can be hard for us you know we we're all doing all these different things and bouncing from thing to thing kind of really focusing is difficult but it's the first step towards being able to harness all of these abilities absolutely because you know again otherwise it's just going to be coming at you just all day every day and and and it's it's a lot so you want to be able to kind of build up that light switch that you can turn on and off yes and um we've spoken before about grounding and meditation and what that is grounding is just a way where you can sit with yourself and let all the excess energy just kind of flow through you and literally into the ground it's a great way if you're feeling jittery if you're feeling nervous or if you have excess energy after maybe doing a magical working you kind of let that energy flow through you and just kind of Let It Go not so much that you're depleted but just anything extra you return that back to the Earth and visualize that going back into everything and it can be easy sometimes and sometimes it can be hard and you know also while you're doing that throughout that process sometimes the message you get comes in a different form and while you're kind of trying to do that cleansing and grounding you get a clearer message of what the message is if that makes sense does that make sense oh gosh yes absolutely I can see that right now you're totally right sometimes when you ground that excess energy you're literally stripping away the things that are distracting you and so that can make the message come through it clears the message up yeah kind of clears the lines basically you know I think that first and foremost trust your damn intuition I cannot say that enough I I think what made me feel bad about this whole message from AJ was the fact that she thought she was going crazy I hate that you're not that's a terrible feeling it's ter CRA if anything you just got some abilities that you just need to think of it as a wild horse you know you got to just put the saddle in the harness on and get that under control you know you you just need to put some time in practice into getting it under control and whatever you do do not think you are crazy because you are not and I highly recommend learning a meditation that helps you get into an alpha State future Lila will either add a meditation at the end of this episode or I will write one out and put it in the show notes or maybe both I don't know depends on how busy I get this this week with all the festival stuff but what I want to talk to you about AJ and everyone else who wants to practice developing or harnessing their psychic ability is you want to learn to love the alpha State you want to learn to be able to get into an alpha State at will and what an alpha state is is your good way to describe it as the early morning stairs shell you know you wake up in the morning you haven't had your coffee yet and you're you're just kind of staring out the window not really thinking about anything you know you're there but you're not really there yeah you're kind of you're kind of just like huh let me get acclimated to the day yeah that's that's an alpha State uh when you're driving and you're kind of on autopilot and your brain is just kind of going off somewhere and and you're driving on autopilot and you miss your exit because you know you're you're just driving on autopilot that's an alpha state so it's that kind of feeling that is when you're able to tap into your subconscious that's when you're better able to talk to that lizard child brain where all your magic ability resides you're highly suggestible this is when magic works this is when you give yourself your affirmations you give yourself you know I am a powerful witch you know I am calm and stressfree and able to handle anything that the world throws at me this is when you really listen to those things your brain really wants to hear that and will remember is when you're in this Alpha state so doing meditations to get here is a wonderful practice because then you can bring it up at will like in in other episod we've talked about it's one thing to say well I'll just get into an alpha State and do it and you know I can do it at the drop of a hat and you can but it takes practice and time to get there just like being the star baseball player that's right that's right and the next state is a Theta state which is you're more sleepy you're not really conscious in that state so the best place to do magic is at the high end of an alpha state right before you get into a Theta State the high end of of Alpha the low end of theta exactly exactly and that's a that's a state where you're very calm you're usually more relaxed and and that's an excellent place to begin any magical working and like I said I'll do I'll have a meditation we used to do a crystal countdown meditation which I have no idea where I learned it back in the day but uh it was something that we would do to get into a light hypnotic State before we would do U magical workings and affirmations and if you would like a good reference for a great Crystal countdown to get you in an alpha State um definitely check out Lorie cabbits power of the witch um it's the book that started it all um that has a great uh meditation in it to do the crystal countdown in the alpha state so another good recommend you know I guess in conclusion shell we both agree trust your intuition write your down in your book of shadows put as much detail as you can muster oh and my favorite tip read people you don't know yeah yeah yeah I know it sounds counterintuitive but if you choose to do a type of divination if you choose to read palms or tea leaves or tarot cards or astrology whatever you choose to do please please please please please read people you don't know and trust yourself when you're reading them just let it flow just let everything go through you don't worry about it don't question it just speak it everything let it be let it be natural because the more you think about it probably the more accurate you're going to be I cannot tell you how many times something came to me and I'm like I am not saying that and then I regretted it because it it was perfect so just say it speak it and if it's someone that you don't know it's easier to do that because you have no preconceived notions it's almost like there's less pressure and there's less pressure you know like how many times have I called you and I am the most annoying friend on the planet Lea I need a Tarot read hey because I can't do it myself because I know myself too well and then B you're no help because you know me too well yeah it's almost counterintuitive when I ask it is it's hard to read you because I have to preface a lot of it with all right shell I know we were just talking about XYZ but XYZ came up in your reading so I'm not sure if it's because I know that or if it's because it's here you don't have that problem with a person you don't know right which kind of makes you I think it's easier to hone your abilities with strangers to be honest I agree I absolutely agree study study study practice practice practice and absolutely trust yourself trust what you're saying and go with it now I'm not saying I know there's a whole Tick Tock controversy particularly among tarot readers with people just kind of throwing cards out and being like well I felt that this is what it meant so I'm just GNA say that wait isn't that what we've done for like 30 years a little bit Yeah but we've also still studied I think there is still a responsibility if you're reading it for yourself do whatever you want want do it your own damn way do it however it feels good to you if you're doing it for yourself if you're doing it for another person if you're writing about it if you're speaking about it please please please don't just throw out there because you can hurt people you know this people take this stuff very very seriously and you need to respect that and you need to respect yourself and them enough to be responsible one thing you know I'm very guilty of is I have a boundary uh with the public and I will not give a Tarot customer any sort of we'll call it death defying news I feel that's irresponsible of me and I I just won't do it it depends on the setting if I have been hired to come do a Tarot party for a client I I will talk about it I won't say you are going to die right right right right but we'll talk about it we'll talk about what it means and I will mention to them you know there's some heavy coming up in the future you know let's let's discuss this are you ready for this are you prepared for this see yeah that absolutely I totally agree with that but I I am not the don't get in the car on the way home because you're gonna crash you know well there's ways to say that too you can say be cautious you know you can you can warn someone to be cautious around cars to be cautious driving and I think that's important to say um but you can say that without scaring someone so so yes you should maybe censor yourself a little bit and think about what you say before you say it because you don't want to just be hey your husband's cheating on you because but you could say something to the effect of you know maybe you and your husband should have a talk maybe you and your spouse really need to have a heart to heart and so there's ways to be ethical about it things that you would learn if you were studying with someone so I I really think that studying and paying attention and journaling all these things are so important particularly J Journal journal and a journal is what's going to leave you to your first book of shadows that's right that's right or if you're you know hey little witchlings if you already have a book of shadows write all your divinations your thoughts your dreams put them down in there and you'll be surprised at how many are true you know people always ask what do you put in a book of shadows this is the type of thing this is exactly the type of thing everything that interests you anything that you want to and definitely all of your practices and all your exercises so AJ I hope we kind of touched on your questions and gave you a little bit of clarity we appreciate all the love from you but for for tonight I think we're just going to hop back on the broomstick and take a little ride thank you all so much for joining us if you have questions like AJ please send us a DM on Instagram our Instagram
