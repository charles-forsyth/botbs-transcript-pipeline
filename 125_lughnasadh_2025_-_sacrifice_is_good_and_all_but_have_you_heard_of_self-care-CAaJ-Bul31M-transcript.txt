welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick and happy lughnasadh to all of our listeners in the Northern Hemisphere and happy in both to our listeners in the southern hemisphere I'm Layla and today we talkin about the history and ways to celebrate the first Harvest Festival of the wheel of the year lughnasadh and I'm show and I am not prepared for it to be August 1st rest if you know definitely not especially since we just got back from wonderful Festival I'm not ready to let go of that or the summer yet everybody is so sad to come back to mundania and I think I even mentioned to you that I'm very sad that I don't have fire circles and drum circles at night anymore I need more of those in my life but on the flip side of that I am glad to be back for my coven ritual so there's something to be said for that wild and  free Festival environment and then there's something to be said to coming back to a little bit of structure and as I pointed out to you in a text message the day you came home there's a bad yeah yeah that's actually true and I'm quite excited because on lughnasadh on the day that this episode comes out I'm coming back to starting to create a local community in which I am very very excited about I met someone right before we left for festival and so we're having a little get-together on the 1st and I'm very excited to see what kind of local community we can create a super excited for you and by the way I am also proud of you for like putting yourself out there because it's one thing to be a part of a community or Covington or group it's another thing to try to start one so kudos to you  it's hard it's hard so if we have any listeners that are either in North East PA or South Central New York keep on the lookout cuz Layla was trying to start some shit yeah and you don't honestly August 1st is a good time for that I really do think to get us back to at lughnasa  did we get back to that it's a good time to kind of reevaluate your kind of look at where you're at I think we kind of both did that coming back from Festival re-evaluating where we're at in our witchy magical lives and where we want to go from here to call it like mid-year reflection but there's going to be that person who's going to send us a message and say shut up and you're talking August 1st like I hear you but summer is like it's like a mystical and it's like Avalon you know it's like between its between the world and so summer is kind of hazy and so I look at this is like a mid-year reflection it's the first time you're starting to reap what you've sown throughout the year you know it's that first okay this is what I put into it what am I getting back is the first of three Harvest festivals on the wheel of the year of the modern Pagan celebrations what is also a very old Festival  this is one that has been celebrated for a very long time it's a Gaelic seasonal Festival is celebrated in Ireland Scotland and the Isle of Man it typically falls on August 1st but you would calculate it is about the Midway Point like you said half way it's about the Midway point from the summer solstice to the Autumn Equinox this is a good time to make those Reflections that first that Midway Point not only is it kind of that that Midway point but it's one of the considered one of the four Celtic fire festivals other three correct and when I think of the unfortunately when I think of the four Celtic fire festivals it's like the seasons shift to the next turn of the Season it technically this is how I look at it in my mind  the fall but in my mind obviously we're not moving on to follow we still got another month or so of Summer left but technically I'm paper we're shifting to the next season of things I love about this season and you mentioned that it was kind of an in-between time like a liminal space and I really feel that because it's hot it's summer everything is green and gold a little bit gold to Android auto setup Festival season had a part of the liminal feel a little bit  but you know I get home and there's some flowers growing on my front patio because my husband is obsessed with birds and toss us out sunflower seeds and a whole bunch of them germinate and grow a little tiny sunflowers all in my front yard I love it actually unexpected bonus and across from me is Fields tons and tons of fields and farms and I watch them as they cut down the hay and roll it into the big huge fail so I'm seeing firsthand this type of you know Seasons Gaelic Scottish type of weather I guess the cutting down of the grain the change of the season but it still feels hot it still feels like summer but the Green Man John Barleycorn has gone from the bright young man who took off to the woods into the hidden spots in the fields with the goddess in the spring and early  he's older now he's hair is Gray he's gone from Green's gold he's kind of getting Bolder now even the days are getting shorter half the dark half but you know it's also a time to kinda you know you give that quote on quote mid-year reflection it also gives you a time to be thankful for what you have reaped out of what you're selling do you know you did that whole be a little bit too. But where do I go from here I got you know x amount of time left till the end of the year whether you look at the end of the year of Stalin or the calendar end of the year in December what's left what it would have to shift how do I have to readjust and that can be in any aspect of your life and in your job and your spirituality whatever the case may be where do I have to shift to get to where I am  acted to be from a year-long plan this is the first of three Harvest is in the final Harvest everything still abundant depending on where you are you can still grow things for a late summer crops you can start to grow things for a fall crop so taking that metaphorically in that whole doctrine of signatures like-for-like magic in your life that matches this is the time to see where you're at just like you said with all the seeds but you still have time to change it if you need to so that's why it's a perfect time to take stock because if you need to plant new seeds or go in a slightly different direction now is the perfect time to do it or just lay out in the sun and have a good day lughnasadh is a great time to look within and initiate some self-care and I'm going to related to the story of the start of this Festival as long as you don't  nope not a journal to be had here until later in the episode believer in this story one of the things about lughnasa is it's named after the god Lou is the first part and NASA basically means assembly or gathering so it's the Gathering of Lou what is a festival that he started for his foster mother tall to the goddess tall to she was a queen of the firbolg and she was an Earth goddess very powerful very strong and she looked around the land and she saw that it was wild and it was unpaid and she knew that people would need it to be more orderly and to give them food so she gathered herself is Earth Mother this Great Goddess and she went through the entire land and she cleared it and prepared it and created agriculture so that the people could grow food but she used up all of her energy all of her power and might on this great task  I feel that by the way you're right you know she just didn't stop she saw what needed to be done and day and night until the job was completed she did it and then she laid down to rest and died and so that kind of follows along with the god of the grain only in this case has the goddess who created the agriculture you do all this great work and then there's a sacrifice right you know you grow the screen and then you cut it down and sacrifice it to create bread she created Agriculture and sacrificed herself in the process so even though this Festival this this day is about work and sacrifice it's also lose chance to honor his mother through games and crafts and he decided he wasn't going to mourn his foster mother he was going to celebrate her and do all these wonderful things to celebrate her so what I'm saying is instead of like tall to giving all of yourself and then dying only to be celebrated after your death let's  take this opportunity to take stock of where we're at to re-evaluate and who celebrates Paul to she should be around to celebrate herself to to celebrate that hard work that she did why do I feel this yeah you know I think we all do we all have times in our life we have given so much of ourselves and sometimes it can be hard to stop whether you've given enough and you need to take a rest now before you get more or like you said you've given enough and you realize that this isn't working and you need to take that break you need to give yourself that space and be like hey I'm so proud of the work I've done now let's see if it's still what I need if I'm still going in the right direction it'll give yourself that space and that Grace magically in your life do that for you some of the goals used  we are in this is the reason you want to re-evaluate some of the girls who said at the beginning of the year so a good time to re-evaluate where you are isn't for any other reason than you've checked enough of your boxes are you either need to add new boxes or figure out what station without overextending yourself and sometimes you need to take a step back from her project sometimes I'm doing work or you know working on a workshop where I'm working on one of our next episodes I like to give it time and I'll come to a point where I feel like I'm stuck away from it for a minute and give it a little time to rest give myself time to rest and to think about other things do other things and then I can come back to it fresh with new I respect of not only have you rewarded yourself for a job well done you stopped before you spent yourself too far and you've given your  space kind of reevaluate if you need to go to honor the sun wherever where at in the world and honor ourselves and honor the work that we've done so far this year has magic in the most simple things and it's a busy time of year you know it's Festival season in there still such a thing as a side jobs this is generally the one holiday where it's just about being out in the sun no frills I don't always have time for the extras no yes I've done the baking bread thing and all of that but sometimes I just have time to just sit and seal the Sun for what could be I don't want to say like one last time cuz it's not one last time  just as your plants and stuff need need that sun in that energy to grow for you to harvest you need that sun energy to grow out and sit in it or maybe you're like first initial Kar listener from East Texas and the sun is not super happy with you being superhuman it it's super hot it's very strong you can still go out early morning or late evening and watch the sunset or go out in midday just for a second and feel with that sun is like honor the strength of it like me with my sunflowers my my unexpected bonus sunflowers in my front yard go to a farmers market if you can or just as you're driving by some flowers on the side of the road admire them a little bit you know just take a moment to take a breath and it just appreciate where you're at in your life and appreciate where the Suns at where you live however it shows up there and there's also at least around here in the Northeast there's a lot of  local pharmacies that will let you do the you pick I think that's more gratifying you know obviously if I'm having a lower energy day I'm just going to go buy it from from the farmers market but that you pick gives you that sense of I am the one harvesting it and you know me zero greens, which by the way plants are doing fabulous whether it be do you pick wildflowers could you pick fruits and vegetables in a moment to give thanks for what you have give thanks for what you're still working towards if you were to break Thanksgiving up into a season I look at this is like Thanksgiving send like now until November you know thanks Thanksgiving to me it is it is you know you are harvesting and thankful for  what did this didn't work out this year so it works out next time it's a time to kind of be thankful for all the things that are falling into place the season I love that you said it's Thanksgiving see because August 1st is this like Thanksgiving light to me and then Babin's like fall on Thanksgiving celebration but faced Holiday City and I fucking love food so much on Thanksgiving is like my gym  Ryder baking bread going to a farmers market if I can just eating and knowing that somewhere along the line you keep some berries you can taste the sunlight in them practically even if you're eating like some fresh Berry ice cream that's still a taste of Summer and it taste of that sunlight and especially eating a meal with friends or meal with family it doesn't have to be like a full-on Thanksgiving me I'll just having an intentional meal even a small snacks with friends is a beautiful way to celebrate lughnasadh particularly if there's bread involved in the Northeast August tends to be I don't know if it's a weird thing that I just noticed but the moon seems super huge August probably the tilts towards the Earth than and all of that scientific stuff that is a lot of math for me but the moon always seems huge in August and that's always been something that his his kind of captured my attention about August  in general but that you're starting to do the 1st Harvest and then you've got this huge huge Moon August it really is it's that it still feels like summer but you have the first hints of cool nights it's a great time to have fires at night to celebrate the light and the sun in the growing season X the fyre festival can you do the other thing I love about this is much like imbolc which the southern hemisphere is celebrating right now this fire Festival also celebrates water you'll often find people will leave offerings this is a great time to celebrate your land spirits to celebrate animistic nature of all things you do leave offerings of fruits vegetables maybe a little bit of bread it doesn't have to be a lot just a little bit out by a tree or by a river or buy a pond something natural something that's biodegrade  it's not going to hurt the land obviously you want to give good things as offering but offerings by water you know you don't have to build a bonfire if you can have a little candle in your house or even if you can't get in by water for this fire Festival oddly enough is another good way to celebrate lughnasadh holy Wells holy streams were very popular this time of year  grab onto your broomstick witches back after these messages  Cosmic Music Volume 1 your voice Mercury Stern tuna Probz poetic rituals and Mercury's magic you'll reconnect with the truth that's been waiting to ride with an you download now and panties and pros.com begin the journey back to your voice  it's also you know I like getting a thing of flowers the yellow the yellow the the red candles you know just it's almost like you're flirting with so that's the best way to describe that you're flirting with prayers pop with a little chant or read a poem outside to Nature's with a great time like I said to give offerings to the land Spirits into the natural world around you you can journal on abundance you couldn't you couldn't just stop yourself could you I couldn't was very thankful for all too and so he had all these celebrations you can write all the things that you're thankful for and gratitude rituals sometimes it's nice to just take a moment and just striking a lot I appreciate  every segment his good bad or indifferent happened because the bad and indifferent or for a reason and has fabulous when you have a little bit of bread with whatever meal you're eating before you take that bite of bread think about the sacrifices you've made think about the work that you've done think about the things that you're proud of and what you're grateful for before you eat the bread because bread itself is part of this holiday it is a symbol of the growing grain that then gets cut down you know the growing God's then dies and gives himself and sacrifice to us to create that bread so that you can have that and so it encompasses the whole meaning I guess the whole purpose of the season so you know maybe you just want to take a minute before you take a bite of bread and just think of all the things that you have done all the sacrifices that you have made for the Year big incense time for me you know I've been  a crazed Maniac with making loosen sense forever and you are at a point now where you can Harvest those things like I have so much meant right now I lack such a green thumb I feel like someone should have told me that that stuff grows like wildfire like I feel like I needed that warning but anyway so you know if it's going to it's going to Basil's going I have more staged I don't want to say I tried to kill the same age but for lack of a better phrase I think I tried to kill it and it won't die so now it's generally a time and then starting to you know use the old mortar and pestle trying to get my herbal mixes go in my incense my loosen send splendas going because I do like to get them cut fresh get him right dried-out get it made get them sealed up so it's also kind of  timer fiorelli it's time you start canning things so anything that you do like that honors Lewis on my going to take a picture for social media because I love how it looks so much I have mugwort in bundles and leaves I have Mullen and lavender was just thinking of that and meant catnip is also a minute but all these things drying in my office and I absolutely love it I have something bundle for my have some beers just hanging everywhere and it's just perfect and I do think about Lou because you know these through outside the girl in the Sun and he is all about crafts and craftsmanship and you know I'm a maker you're a maker we like making things and sends all sorts of stuff  what is standing there you know I got this look at this little Sage bundle you're going to die laughing by dry it out I do what I do with it and then I slipped through this and it didn't die so philosophical and I'm just like holyshit lives long enough for me to do what I wanted to do with it you know I'm more just like super happy cuz I like how it looks all hanging drying in my office that and quick tip speaking of trying and your office I have not yet gotten a dehumidifier like a dryer they called that like a you know that machine you can dry herbs and stuff to hydrate hydrator I have not got in a food dehydrator pounds to super fast drying my nerves check this out so I have you know like a cooling rack that you have for cookies it's like a mesh screen like take that and I lay out  all my herbs in single file all nice on that and then I put it on the dashboard of my car interested interesting and I leave it there for hours I did it with dandelions in the spring I've done it with Mullen I've done it with mug war is fantastic it works so good they drive perfectly every time so funny story cuz you never told me this so me and my sweet love we're out and about and I clip a couple of these wild roses and I dried them out on the dashboard of my car and after a few days my sweet darling says are you leaving those there and I was like you know  he probably smelled good every time you open the car door to that's what I thought but you know we are underneath and on top and just single layer on there so we have those cooling racks in the dashboard of your car nice hot day for birthday July definitely out of day you're not driving around or you know I've heard that thing where people you go to work and you put cookies on the cookie sheet on the dashboard of your car and you just leave it there while you go into work and when you come out of work you have fresh baked cookies could do that with your arms right put them up on the dashboard when you go into work and you leave your car parked and then when you come out you have nice dry herbs and your car smells like lavender Sun bakes cookies on your dashboard  I'm not going to attest to whether that works great or not cuz you need a nice hot day but herbs however most hot days will be more than plenty to try your herbs out no need for a food dehydrator perfect I like I do too but I did have a little trouble last year I found blue Asters and bee balm that I harvested yeah and I I didn't drive him well I didn't know. I didn't know the dashboard trick last year and I still didn't have a food dehydrator so I didn't drive him well enough I thought I had left them out long enough to dry but after I charged them Unfortunately they are enough before I have to have them super dry or you get mold off until they're super dry but the very first thing I dried that way was dandelion heads this spring and those are  did you see you know there's a lot of moisture in a dandelion flower and they dried out beautifully I've had them Jarred up since the spring not a hint of moles they're perfect sure where the chamomile for this year it was almost like you know how the little I don't know what the heck it's called but the thing in the center that took a long time to dry out that is our crappy thing that we've been doing a lot of lately because there's so much abundance out there everything is growing and popping and trying to get flowers and if you got meant it's everywhere because that's what time of year is this is the first harvest everything is abundance our old Community would bring their first fruits communities right now that we gather with are doing Feast just because Thursday night at the bar at one of the bonfires that we did was about three 4 in the morning and they brought out of Taco feasts and everybody had a taco feasts at The Roundhouse because I love tacos  oh yeah taco feast at The Roundhouse yes please do that again let's do that every night feasting with friends is a fabulous way to share in that abundance and she kind of bring that into your life especially if you can involve games so you and your love to come over we'll have some food will have some bread and look at an all-night and that'll honor Loop, some tacos. Oh yeah we can do tacos I love me some good tacos Then I'm game go to your local farmers market try a new skill try something new hey if you haven't dried herbs before try make your own insensitive maybe that could be a skill that you tackle in honor of Lou and Tall to this year no Layla before we go before we let the fine people get on with her days and nights I would be remiss if I did not bring this up and I did not mention this to priors this going to be a total shock to you too but I feel like I just want to take a moment  to say to all the Gen X folks out there to all of the music lovers across the world we feel you with the passing of Ozzy I've cried I laughed I reminisced about my childhood I just I just wanted to say alright pyasi funny son of a bitch with some good songs he was sad news when generally don't take time out for that type of thing but we did for the Queen We Are For The Prince of Darkness so alrighty I'll see the episode hopefully you'll get out there have a little bit of feast play some games maybe learn a new skill try some crafting the honor Lou and take care of yourself don't burn yourself out do the work but take a break before you give to  like talk to wear modern pagans witches and magical people here we do not need to give all of ourselves to the point of sacrifice take care of yourself do the work but do the self care as well and be grateful for the work you've done appreciate the work you've done and pat yourself on the back and re-evaluate see what you need to do what you need to change but you need to alter and get a move on with the rest of the year check on where those seeds you planted it in bulk are see if you need to replant see if you need to give him something a little boost but yeah this is the time to re-evaluate see where you're at you still have time there still time before the end of the year to make changes on your make new goals and to move forward with that we have some super excited plan for the next couple of episodes guys we are going to do an episode series  we're going to do a five-part series on the elements we're going to go with elemental energy starting with r or Earth and then I said Earth you said are will discuss and we'll discuss what we're going to talk about earth air fire water and spirit maybe not necessarily in that order  so we will talk about all of those different types of energies how you can use those energies in your magic practiced we're not going WIC in here this is more a month or Elemental Magic face show magic face so don't you worry we're not going to go down any strange that we're going to try to go through all those different correspondences and how you can use those energies in your purpose so stay grateful and keep it Richie
