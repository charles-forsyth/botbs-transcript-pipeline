welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to a 2024 edition of back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I am shell who has freaked the hell out that it is 2024 whoa yeah I think every single newscaster has been like it's 2024 can you believe it no no none of us can thanks for asking no no it has been a wild ride I would have to say 2023 was let's just say I'm happy to put it to bed both for for good and bad reasons and I'm very much looking forward to 2024 what a freaking roller coaster of a year literally a roller coaster first you know like a roller coaster but last episode we talked about how I think New Year's resolutions are  that's true we did did you make any on New Year's Eve no in that vein I do believe in New Year's prosper it spells and things of that nature oh I I do feel that they are different I agree I do want to put out there that I have seen all over social media all these weird New Year's Day superstitions and I I I just want all of our listeners to be rest assured I did not do laundry on New Year's Day wooo yeah that's my favorite one the no cleaning on New Year's Day that's because I'm lazy not necessarily because I think anything will happen but hey whatever though I've seen a lot of superstitions of folklore kind of come into prominence in the last few years and I think a lot of these New Year's Eve ones or New Year's Day ones are really just like old folkore superstitions that people have kind of blown up everyone's looking for what am I supposed to do it's the New Year I'm a witch let me do something and we all want something to do and I think the no cleaning came from the idea of you wash your luck away if you clean and just an old Superstition I think in American Superstition hoodoo Superstition some other culture I get it and I'm all for it because you know hey it's a day off and who wants to clean on a day off exactly they take it all the way to the point of showering and yeah no can do I did take a shower on New Year's Day not gonna lie zero Bill zero guilt some of the others that are rooted in Old superstitions are wearing red on New Year's Day because because in a lot of Asian cultures in particular China red is considered a lucky color and I know for Chinese New Year they do a lot of things with money Prosperity Red Envelope red envelopes the color red is considered to be very lucky actually for this episode we both did Prosperity spells that we had not done before or we tried to enhance Prosperity spells that we have used in the past no I have to laugh because we both did a social media post and you pick on me for throwing cinnamon sticks out the door but I have cats and cinnamon is toxic to cats so yeah I throw that right out the door same thing you're supposed to throw it in the door the idea is you throw it in your door or blow the cinnamon so what we're talking about is the cinnamon What's called the cinnamon blow spell and a lot of people do this on the first of the month it's gotten to basically cult status on the first of the month everybody's saying rabbit rabbit rabbit and everybody's saying did you blow your cinnamon and the idea is you blow the cinnamon into your door from outside into your house to bring in prosperity and to allow abundance and prosperity to enter into your home all right dear listeners sh this one up and I did it all out I got all of the 2023 out and yeah I I threw my cinnamon out the door I don't know what to tell you if you're throwing it out your door the idea is well some people say you're throwing your money away but most people will say that if anything you brush out your door is you're getting rid of so you want to get rid of any negativity you can use that cinnamon or herbs or whatever from inside to out your door to cleanse your space to get rid of anything negative I do have a backup I did repent a little bit so okay maybe I threw my damn sticks out the door sorry but my intentions were good I did however make a cinnamon and baile Lea Prosperity spell jar because I can seal the jar and keep it away from my kitty cats the information that I've seen on Cinnamon is basically don't blow it in your cat's face but if you're blowing like a teaspoon or so into your door and onto the ground that's not really going to hurt anything as long as they're not sticking their face right into it and you're not blowing it into their face you should be fine with the cinnamon blow but better safe than sorry you can Chuck that stick of cinnamon in you can use it like a whistle and blow through the Stick of cinnamon into your house if you don't want to throw it and as shell found out in a very not so great way you can light it on fire it stinks it does not smell like cinnamon so if that is your expectation forget about it the cinnamon stick is kind of hard to get lit on fire I do recommend using a longer lighter like one you would use for a grill or something like that because you're going to want to hold that flame on the end of the cinnamon stick for a minute it'll flame and then it'll kind of smolder like an incense stick and you can use it just like incense um wave it around the front of your door blow it into the front of your door walk through your home cinnamon can be used for Prosperity protection cleansing and I know shell hates the smell I kind of like it it smells more like bark than cinnamon but it it smells nice now do you know why people use cinnamon well I mean it is a herb that promotes prosperity and and good luck but if there's another reason in do nope that's exactly it uh cinnamon back in the day was very expensive it was considered a rich people thing the symbolism means that if this is a rich people thing and you blow some of it into your door you're blowing expensive luxurious Goods into your house and so the energy that it carries is of money it's also a very fiery and strong so that can help give you the energy that you need that get up and go to make money well if that is the case my driveway is going to be very prosperous you know like I said I also did a spell jar and and I'll post pictures of that I put cinnamon and a bay leaf two bay leaves actually and I wrote little things on my bay leaves and that I have on my window s so the way I look at it and you know I'm a weirdo I do things to my own pace that we are now at a point where the sun is growing and gaining and I put my cinnamon and bay leaf little jar thing in my window to kind of coincide with that you know the sun is growing and gaining and my jar is for growing and gaining so to kind of amplify that energy yeah amplify that with the sun in the window sill I like that a lot better than the cinnamon blow because it rest strengthens it gets stronger every time you look at it you know every time you look at that jar it's going to reactivate that spell and kind of bring that energy out again and so I like that even more than just the once a month cinnamon blow well you know how I am you know how I roll I kind of make my own up and that just I was like hey that's a good idea and just went with it you have to kind of follow your instincts a lot of Witchcraft is following your instinct following what's right for you and I know some people get very frustrated with that because it can be it can be very frivolous and it can also feel very unknown and scary a little bit if someone says oh just do what feels right and you're like I don't know what feels right sometimes that can be a scary place to be but it can also be empowering so I don't know you got to kind of trust yourself like shell does trust yourself do what feels right do your research and then do what works well as much as you can and you can trust a lot of the books out there they're not the end all be all and just like a shoe different sizes for different folks you know Different Strokes for different folks and for me throw those sticks out the door that was my intention so I guess in my mind it's going to work as much as if I was outside throwing them in it really does because honestly when you think about it you walk out that door every day to go to work right and so you're kind of following the cinnamon sticks you're you're getting that get up and go that energy to get up every day and do what you need to do to make that money following the money Trail so you can make it work you can pretty much make anything work so what I did is kind of similar to the jar that you did I did the very popular money bow spell now you can do a money Bowl spell at any time but a lot of people like to do it at the beginning of the year either make one new or a fresh an old one and to keep that money Bowl in a prominent place where you can feed it and to refresh it regularly to keep that energy going through the whole year now I already have a question that I know a lot of our listeners already probably have too so we preemptively posted on both Facebook and Instagram pictures of your money bows okay so I need you to take a moment and explain to me why the hell was one of them empty those are just the parts that was the before when I had assembled everything to put the spell together so I will actually once this episode airs I will actually put a picture of the money bow put together so the picture that's on our social media right now is kind of like you know how chefs have all the ingredients like on TV to their their different components of the I Goa so I just put everything kind of around so could have it all together so when I do my spell I have my charcoal there and I have some loose incense I'm going to do um a smoke cleanse of every item first and then put them together so when I did the spell I did a smoke cleanse of every item and then put them together and I'll post a picture of it all together so what a money bowl is is again this one is something that I did long long time ago more following the Chinese New Year celebrations because I really liked the idea of the red envelopes of money for luck and something I had heard was one common thing that people would do is put a small bowl with money in it by the front door and the idea is I guess it's part of funu and it allows the money to come into your home honestly I thought that's just where people emptied their packet of change when they got home from work maybe maybe it is but so I have a very small little cauld that I would keep by my front door no matter where we moved that little cauldron would get set up by the front door and and some money would be put into it and not necessarily every time we came in we emptied our pockets of change into it but when I would think of it I would refresh it you know and quote unquote feed it a little bit of change throughout the year so this money bow spell which you know I've seen a few mentions of it here and there but the last five years my goodness that cinnamon blow and the money Bowl spells have exploded in popularity if I don't see that eight times in the first day or two of the month strike me down and quick side note they do it at the beginning of the month not really for any particular reason you can do it any time most people do it at the first for a couple different reasons one is because it's easy to remember if you get in a habit of okay it's the first of the month I'm going to do my money spell or refresh my money bowl that helps you to set a ritual and to set a habit and your magical brain really likes that and it also starts at the beginning it's for New Beginnings it's for increasing numbers because what happens after the first every gets bigger and bigger so that's another symbolic reason for doing it on the first these money bowls seem to be kind of more of a an advanced version of the the Chinese lucky money bowl by the door and it incorporates a bunch of different symbology the round Bowl which its roundness symbolizes fullness bowls hold food they hold things and then usually what you'll see in it is rice money a green candle and sometimes other green stones or green herbs I Ed those and a couple other things as well now I I I beg to differ for a second on one of your ingredients okay what ingredient rice oh what do we differ about it you know I'm not a cooker my children were raised on a toast ribon okay and they're proud of it and you don't I never always had rice around I did beach sand in money bows why because I wanted to does it matter not to me again I just kind of beat to My Own Drum and and I like the sand better I don't know that works that's fine the the inclusion of the rice is because rice itself is a symbol of wealth having rice meant you could eat and so historically rice has come to be very much associated with money we even in America how often do people throw rice at weddings to symbolize abundance and fertility in the marriage you know that's not good for the Wildlife just saying no it is not we don't do it so much anymore but that's why people used to do it it was that idea because rice itself symbolized fertility and abundance that when you threw it on the couple that they would get Prosperity fertility and abundance in Hindu mythology it's a symbol of fertility and good health in Japan rice was supposedly a gift from the goddess Amat tasu and so it's associated with the sun goddess but in lots of cultures rice is considered to be Prosperity so that's one ingredient you could include or I also use sand one of the bowls you'll see in that picture has a little bit of sand in it and that's from a very sacred place that's very magical and special to me so I wanted to include that as well I also have sunflower seeds that I got at the parliament of world religions and I included sunflower seeds because the bright big gold sunflowers symbolize the sun they symbolize coins and wealth sunflower seeds themselves can be considered a form of wealth so I wanted to add those in uh Seeds New Beginning I also have salt I also put salt in there and salt is used a lot of times for preservation for uh protection to keep things cleansed and grounded and going in the right way but salt has also been used historically as money as currency um Roman soldiers were paid sometimes in Salt the money that I chose I have a a silver certificate dollar bill and I have a $2 bill because it's real money but it's fantastic and I wanted some fantastic money to come to me um and a green stone a white candle three bay leaves to write my you know Prosperity abundance and success on maybe a Sigil but yeah so I did that and I also the bowl that looks empty has a shed cat's claw in it that's the bowl that I use to put everything together and create the money Bowl do you know why I use a shed cat's claw why cats claws symbolize tenacity and they symbolize strength and protection and have you ever tried to pick up a cat off of a couch or a bed and try to put it like in a kennel oh yeah yeah and their claws digging and they don't let go and so I wanted to bring that strength I have a tendency sometimes to I get scared I get impostor syndrome or something and I and I I tend to let things go and I didn't I don't want to let things slide this year I want to make sure to to stick with it to have that tenacity and so I saw this shed cat claw and decided to include that to bring those energies into the spell and just like shell said you don't have to go with what you see online those are a good place to start and there's reasons behind every single thing that someone picks I mean green is a pretty easy Association here in America a lot of our money is green we call Green the color of money so you can put green things in there you can put real money in there whatever that you associate with wealth and success or like me I need something to give me some tenacity and some kind of stick tutiven and that cat claw worked perfectly so you just really have to pick your symbols and what works and just like shell it doesn't have to be the same thing that everyone else does if something screams money to you or says hey I need to be in this spell Just go with it now I wanted to do another thing and it didn't work out but I had an amazing Discovery this is like the craft discovery of the of a lifetime here so you know how people do the pine cone thing and you write things on the pine cone you write things on paper and stick it between the I don't even know what to call it not branches of the pine cone petals the petals oh yeah that's a great spell and you know how it needs to be really dry to like open up wide to get the paper so I wanted to start with a new pine cone I have a couple but I wanted a new one so I went outside they're all moisture filled but so I get a a pine cone and I'm like how can I dry it out space heater now I am showing Ila a pine cone that was very tight earlier today and in afternoon in the space heater it is drying out and opening up who knew you'll have to put pictures of that I did not know either so those pine cones where all the petals are closed up tight and you can't get anything into it right off the tree basically little fresh so you dried them out on your space heater and now those petals are starting to open up so you can use it to roll up your wishes or write them on bay leaves and then stick them in between the the little Petals of that pine cone that's a great way to make a little fire starter or um a little spell bomb to put in your fire pit and I would like to point out I had eyes on this all day like I didn't walk away from it like I ain't starting no house fire here but holy who knew now aside from our little TR it stuff I wanted to bring out the coveted Book of Shadows oh this is going back to my third book of shadows the very first page is dated 2000 in the year 2000 wow Blast from the Past taking it back a minute and as you know all of my books of Shadows I did something special or to signify that moment or or what have you for page one this page one I am not calling it resolutions because it's not but I like circling back to yourself at the new year and this is ways to honor yourself and the new year is a good time to remember yourself because by New Years you have spent half the year forgetting about your damn self so I just wanted to touch some points that I had in my book of shadows from the year 2000 things you can think about and and not just in January but all year long but you know January for whatever reason is kind of a good restart a reset so just a couple of these and and add any input if you'd like trust your intuition oh that's a good one a good way to honor yourself is to trust your damn self which is yes this means you yeah right shell is talking to you right now trust yourself especially when it comes to Magic don't worry I'm talking to me and Ila too so don't live your truth and speak your truth preach it that's a hard one that's easier said than done sometimes but so good even if it's something you can't just start doing be cognizant of it even if you're like you know what I should have done that you know be cognizant here's a good one give yourself permission sometimes you are Your Own Worst Enemy folks create space now create space I just want to elaborate on this you want to create magical space personal space what we mean by create space means a lot of different things in a lot of different spaces be who you really are that's a good way to start the new year pretty deep there shell you really making people dig deep for their New Years wherever you are in life be there fully oh yeah that's a damn good one right choose to evolve consciously you know I don't like change you don't like change nobody likes change but bottom line is it's there it's happening you know I I was kind of laughing with my sweet love because new year were we were kind of reminded of our age him and I have a milestone birthday in 2025 and part of honoring yourself is realizing every year that goes by you are a different person like it or not just because and your birthday might not be right now but it is a good time to take stock in where you've been and where you're going just like the January 1 New Year is a worldwide reset your own birthday your personal one-year marker of a trip around the Sun that is also a very powerful reset time so you can harness this energy at the beginning of the year at the beginning of the month or at your birthday it's a fantastic transformative time you can also do it on a random Tuesday nobody cares yeah that's right that's exactly right do it whenever you feel moved to but I thought it would be a a a good episode and fit in with uh you know Prosperity putting out there what what you want what you you know reaping what you seow his part part of that is honoring yourself if you don't honor yourself who the hell is gonna that's exactly right and you know shell doesn't believe in New Year's resolutions what she does believe in is taking stock of who you are and where you're at in your life and moving towards goals that work for you you are not a wishy-washy fluffy bunny I want to wish for something kind of wish you're a no you're a put on my pointy hat get my hands dirty whip up a spell or five and get done kind of make that happen that's right and so I wish everybody to have a little bit of that kind of get up and go witch and self-reflection you know that can be hard for us but from 2000 shell those are some really amazing self-reflection and lessons for the year you know what a good place to start who the hell was I preaching that in the year 2000 geez well it was definitely a weird time we probably needed all those lessons then sure as I know I need them now I was going to say I think they they are more taken to heart now than in 2000 okay now I don't know if this is going to make it into the episode or not but right around 2000 Byron Ballard also was talking about having visions of something she called Tower time what is that a lot of change like she kept seeing the the tower tarot card she had an actual vision and kept seeing the tower and things falling especially here in this country shortly after that the 911 attacks happened but she didn't think that was it she feels that the time Tower time is now and she's got some essays out about it it's interesting that you're pulling up something from right around you know year or so after that that has all these self-reflective introspective things and personal you're freaking me out man right I don't know I just think that this is going to be a transformative year it is the year of the green dragon which starts on February 10th so we're ending the rabbit year and starting a dragon year which is always auspicious and and you know that is kind of a bummer for me because I was born in the year of the rabbit so I feel like my year is coming to an end you know yes so your year is ended but dragon is wonderful energy for Beginnings people like to have children in the year of the dragon because it it's such a good sign and it's so auspicious and from what I understand having it be a green dragon year is even better New Beginnings change wonderful things could be happening we'll look into it more I'll ask a couple experts and we'll come back and we'll talk a little bit more about the year of the green dragon but that's what 20124 is and it has some really good signs yeah we're gonna we'll we'll have to uh around the Chinese New Year here in a week or two we'll have to investigate that yeah we'll talk about that a little more next month so what we'll do is I will post up some pictures of our prosperity jar and bowl and we'll put up a spell or two that you could do if you want to try it yourself don't worry folks I I'll show you a picture of me chucking my uh cinnamon sticks out the door and just remember intention it's all about intention it is but also remember that the items that you choose can definitely help get you into the right head space and get you into the right magical place so that that intention can be even stronger so go ahead and grab what works for you grab the things that have the correspondences with what you like and put them together but if you don't have a green candle shell says it's okay to use a pink one it is as long as in your freaking you think it's green it's green right as long as you find a good reason for it it will definitely work in your magical practice oh can I point out one one really quick thing that I have done before because well I'm like that I have done back in in the day when my kids were little I had done a Prosperity spell and didn't have a green candle and you want to know what I used did you use I used a green crayon just saying have you ever had a Prosperity spell work I have as a matter of fact maybe not to the extent that my hopes and dreams were but I have had one work it was at a point where I really needed to get a different job and it did happen within about two months of doing the prosperity spell the very first Prosperity spell I did I kept finding change really I didn't yeah I think part of it is um I didn't word it very well it was something to the effect of you know I hope I find a little bit of money and the universe took me seriously and I found a little bit of money but the next time I was a little more serious about it and I have used them you know before big interviews or you know when wanting a change in job and and they've worked pretty well for me in the past and and that was the the context in which I used it actually this was when I lived with you and we had a shared employer and I was not happy with that shared employer anymore and I wanted something different and I also needed something with a little bit higher pay and I landed it and that was about two months after I had done something yep so they definitely work I've seen a lot of anecdotal things online where other people have mentioned that they work this money bow one seems to be very very popular I see people do it a lot so we will keep you guys updated on the success or failure or what happens with the money jar and the money Bowl going forward so we'll see what happens maybe I'll win the lottery what is it 800 million well I was thinking I'd be happy with like just some land in the woods is that all that's all you want it's like a little Homestead in the woods yeah yeah we'll call it the like back on the broomstick covenstead or some I don't know there you go but we hope you all have a great and prosperous New Year we hope that your Prosperity bowls work your money bowls work we'll put some good vibes out in the universe for all you guys in your Prosperity spells and cheers man here's the 2024 let's make good
