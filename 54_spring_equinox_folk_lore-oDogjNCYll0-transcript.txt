the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila bringing you a spring equinox episode and I'm shell bringing out the old Book of Shadows for this episode oh I love it when you bring out the Book of Shadows I know you've got all sorts of old rituals and spells and recipes in there I'm actually going to post a picture of this because this thing is about ready to fall apart and people need to see this nothing like a good old Book of Shadows with the binding half fallen off hey that just means it's loved well loved but tonight we're actually going to crack it open to the ostara section we're going to talk about some folklore tonight we're going to do a two-part ostara episode so buckle in because we've got some good info for you yeah we're going to be talking about the holiday of the Spring Equinox that's coming up March 19th of this year when day and night are equal you know I kind of love this because not only are day and night equal I love the Autumn Equinox as well because you know who doesn't love fall and pumpkin everything but this Equinox is different because you know that you're on the downhill to Summer oh yeah the days get longer who doesn't love a sunset at 900 p.m come on now so this is like the beginning of the the the glory time of the year for me imul itself is more the first glimmerings of spring for me imul is the very very beginning of Spring so the Equinox doesn't necessarily Mark beginning of Spring for me even though it's called like the first day of spring here in the northern hemisphere but it's more to me when spring is really sprung it really has started you can tell that the first shoots are up the animals are out there's more birds and there's more sunshine you know it's the baby bunnies the minute you see them baby bunnies you know spring has sprung you know one of the first interesting folklore bits I'm going to tell you has to do with hair hairs you ever heard the saying as mad as a March hair yes I have as a matter of fact yeah weird saying but apparently it goes back to the fact that March is when the hairs are in mating season so they're all horny and Twitter ped and hopping around and I guess they act not as shy and careful as they normally do they're all jumping around in the grass wanting to catch the eye of the other cute hairs in the neighborhood who's actually having their right mind during the breeding cycle come on the breeding cycle I didn't know a nice tactful way to say that humping like rabbits this is this is humping like rabbit season folks well from one extreme to the other show exactly and this is probably why people want us to do an episode on Sex Magic maybe closer to belain right but this is also kind of the you know we we've talked about planting the seeds and these are those Sprouts these are that first sign that all of your efforts are coming to fruition you know they may not have totally come to fruition but like you can see it happening now and the best part about this time of year snow crocuses love them daffodils all the first spring flowers start to come out and the Equinox was celebrated in a lot of different cultures because it is kind of noticeable you know the day and night are equal it's a it's a great Celestial event things are starting to wake up it's the astrological New Year we start all over with the signs in the sign of Aries so Aries season is really nice lots of fresh energy here's a good one sh we used to talk a lot about how we wanted to go see chichin you remember that yep yep on the Spring Equinox at chichin there is a temple it's called the kulan culan and on this Temple there are 365 steps just like the days of the year right and on the Equinox the Sun hits those steps in just the right way to make a Shadow serpent there's like a Stone serpent head at the bottom of the temple and the step the Shadows of the steps make it look like it's a shadow serpent that's going up the temple only on the Equinox interesting right that's pretty cool we still need to get to chitsu nitsu right exactly so it was a very important date for people it wasn't necessarily celebrated throughout the whole world so I decided tonight because you know what fun is this always every time I'm cracking open the old BOS the old Book of Shadows we're talking some 30-year-old ramblings of mine okay but I did want to touch on some things in here because when you do a book of shadows a lot of it's just I don't want to say note taking but you know I ain't writing a novel here and first of all pro tip don't ever do your book of shadows in pencil you'll regret it um but I actually have something interesting this is the time when winter gives way to Spring ice melts rivers run full leaves begin to Bud and grass turns green we also have in here this is why we shouldn't write in pencil it's getting hard to read eggs I wanted to bring up eggs because I did a little thing in here that eggs are a big symbol because it is that I don't want to in utero is that a good way to say it it's kind of this that life is growing but it hasn't quite like it's waiting like it's at that expectant stage right I kind of look at belane as like the popping out and with the eggs and this is what I used to do with my kids we would put in like little things that were like I don't want to say trinkets Stones rocks leaves little stick figures and that was just kind of a honoring the things that are coming out the things that are becoming new the things that are sprouting I mean we loved the candy don't get me wrong I'm a candy fanatic kids love candy we'd fight over the Easter candy but I kind of wanted to make sure that they knew that this was kind of almost like the beginning like the Fresh Start the starting over I mean we all know January 1 that's the new year but doesn't the new year really start when the sun is out longer than 400 p.m. mm some cultures celebrated uh the Spring Equinox as the new year because just like you said you're coming out of winter and it's spring cleaning time and Fresh Starts but finding the little plastic eggs with like little trinky type things in it was more about kind of the hatching of things hatching of I can't say ideas I mean they were kids for Christ's sakes I mean you can only get them to grasp so many Concepts but like the hatching of things and things starting over and newness ostara reminds me of newness do you know where the eggs came from the idea of the eggs and the bunny if you ask me what came first the chicken or the egg I'm a Swatch you no I don't no I'm asking you what came first the bunny or the eggs the eggs oara was mostly a germic tradition this isn't like a Celtic tradition it wasn't celebrated necessarily in that area it's more tonic but it started in germic folklore and a lot of that like a lot of things at the time were word of mouth right so not a lot was written down until funnily enough the Grim Brothers wrote down the story of ostara and the hair and the legend goes that ostara was a goddess she's the goddess of the dawn of the east of transformation of new beginnings fertility and spring so she was out walking one winter day and she found a bird that had fallen into the snow and was freezing to death and so in order to save it she transformed it into a hair it was still able to lay eggs and because of its magical transformation those eggs were beautiful and stunning and gorgeously designed and so every spring the magical transformed hair would lay eggs and The Good Children of the German towns would get eggs on the Equinox where did the candy come into play that's what I want to know I imagine it came into play much like you said kids like candy I think kids from time immemorial have always liked treats so the idea was that on the Equinox if you were good you would get candy or you would get colored eggs from the spring hair now there's another story that doesn't paint the goddess oara in quite the same light do tell and this one says that there was a fantastic bird gorgeous in every way and it laid the most intricate beautiful delicately designed eggs that anyone had ever seen and because it was so bold and uh shoffy the goddess oara was upset with it and so to punish it she turned it into a hair then she felt bad because it was so sad afterwards so she allowed it to continue to lay eggs so very weird story but there you have it now I just found in Ye Old Book of Shadows an oara chant we used back in the day oh nice what is it it's only four lines I don't remember the tune and if you think I'm GNA sing it y'all crazy but we wrote somehow for an ostara ritual chant the fire within the passion without Bast she is laughing Flames dance about where the hell did we come up with that I have no idea but I like it in retro ECT I love it actually short sweet to the point why did we pick Bast I don't know but you know funny story I laughed in the reason I wanted to point that out and read it to you I've been seeing a lot of uh stuff on Bast on all the socials recently I I'm not terribly deep into Egyptian lore so I was wondering if maybe this was like her time you know um I have seen a lot about her on socials lately and we happen to write that in reference to noara ritual I don't know what our mindset was but it ain't too shabby not too bad I'm just trying to figure out I guess why we would pick Bast and fire do you know what the elements are for the Equinox it doesn't seem very Oar alike I know the Spring Equinox and oar are actually associated with air the reason being is because it was associated with fairies and butterflies as well as obviously Rabbits and Eggs um and spring FL hours so probably because the whole fairy butterfly thing I don't know it's an air Festival what the heck were we thinking I don't even remember that chant like what were we thinking I don't know it's written down as 1999 and that was part of our ostara that was our oara chant yeah well okay okay okay I have an idea I got an idea okay so oara you know balance renewal new beginnings new possibilities maybe we were thinking burning away the past burning away the old to start the new you know the whole Phoenix the whole Phoenix thing you know rise to I don't know what the hell we were thinking I'm gr is there anything else in about the ritual or about the literally it literally in my book of shadows it says oara ritual chant 1999 all right no ritual because you know how sometimes I would actually write down the rituals word for no ritual with it no ritual just a weird fire Bast chant that we're not sure why maybe we were just yeah burning away the past to start new beginnings that sounds something like we would have done back then it does it does okay it actually does all right so we know that the Spring Equinox is on the 19th we know that some people call it ostara and I know that there is a lot of controversy kind of like with mabin over naming a holiday after a goddess right right right and I've also heard you know because this isn't celebrated in a lot of Celtic history I mean they they celebrated the spring and things like that a lot of cultures did but it wasn't really a big day for the Kelts a lot of times the wheel of the year is pretty heavily Celtic what I think really it was is I think that they kind of more celebrated the actual Equinox itself which is you know kind of like how you can say about mabin completely separate and apart like mabin as a holiday is separate and apart from the Autumn Equinox and ostara is technically separate and apart from the Spring Equinox not I'm not saying they're two different things but kinda you get what I'm saying yeah celebrating the astrological event of the Spring Equinox I think is pretty important even if it doesn't have its roots int I do believe that the Kelts celebrated the Equinox that portion of it but maybe not so much the quote unquote ostara portion of it the ostara portion is definitely germic she was a a goddess from that area and she would not have been in the Celtic lore right so because the lore was a lot of Word of Mouth there's not a lot of information some people think that ostara is a very recent creation however she has been mentioned prior to the 1800s by a monk named be be de so bead or Bey he transcribed some of the local folklore and he did did talk about the goddess ostara goddess of the spring and that she was with a hair and also the brothers Grim the fairy tale Brothers yep yep they also wrote down folklore possibly from Bey possibly from Word of Mouth much like they got some of their other tales about eost ostara with her hair that laid eggs on the Equinox so it it's been around for hundreds of years and whether it goes further back than that we can't be sure again because of the nature of folklore tales that go from you know generation to generation and aren't written anywhere so that doesn't change the fact that we can celebrate it because it is a day of equality of Harmony of balance day and night light and dark you know within you and without you can use those energies in your magic so whether you follow the germic folklore of the goddess oara or not there is still magic in this day I want to put a challenge out there am I allowed to do that can I put a challenge out there to our listeners you can do whatever the you want sh you're shell okay and you know me I love to just do because I'm crazy so I got a challenge for all of our listeners in the northern hemisphere for oara now we always tell you about our socials you can find us on Facebook you can find us on Instagram hell you can email us we'll talk about all those addresses in a moment but I want to know how many people out there do the thing where on the Equinox you you try to get your broom to stand up on its own you try to get the egg to stand on its end on its own if you're doing this I want pictures okay so you need to get me pictures of that send it to our socials because I'm curious if people like do people actually do this on the Equinox I want to know I would like to know myself s me your I'm going to be trying to stand a broom up I can tell you that I am absolutely loving broom lore and ostara is about sweeping away the old what better time to break out your magical Bome then oara the Equinox spring cleaning is spring cleaning for a reason this has been around for a very long time you open your windows to let in that first breath of spring air again out with the old and in with the new Sweep with your Bome uh sweep out the old energies to make room for the new get rid of old clothes old things again get rid of the old to bring in the new follow that type of magic if you are living a magical life these are the things that you do to stay in rhythm with the seasons to stay in rhythm with the cycles of the Moon and of the seasons and of your life I swear to God that's exactly why we use Bast and fire in that damn thing just literally explained it any who we must have had something going so I have one okay I have a quick one written down in my old Digital Book of Shadows so it goes like this awaken awaken Earth's rebirth ostara's light brings joy and Mirth as nature wakes from winter sleep New Life emerges Roots Run Deep blessings Bloom with the Rising Sun oara dance New Life begun oh I love that isn't that nice so we must have come up with that in amarat back in the early 90s but that's in my digital omarro Book of Shadows I'm so glad you trusted that because I never did although now regretting the pencil thing the pencil thing is scary and the digital thing was scary too because as much as we had that big huge amarat website back in the day it was difficult to find even on the way back machine so I I was glad I was able to recover some of that I did want to just mention you know I always love the whole herb tea thing I just wanted to mention um some herbs that are associated with this that you know if you're looking for like a a spring tea or an incense to make what have you daffodils daisies honeysuckle Jasmine d liion this is a good time have you ever had dandelion tea I have and I've had dandelion wine and dandelion salad I love dandelion do you know I've literally been making dandelion tea since I was freaking four I believe it and I used to actually my mother used to tell me I was drinking poison because she thought if I drank the dandelions I was going to get sick so of course I did it despite her but this is kind of a good time to I like to batch incense around this time of year I don't know if it's because because Summer is kind of busy you know vacations kids Festival season but this is kind of a good time to like batch make incense or you know if you're talking tea you can batch make tea because as long as you store it properly it's good for like up to two years or so but this is a good time to kind of batch some of that stuff because these things are sprouting they're starting to to grow depending on what ingredients you're using it it can be a good time to harvest them and then kind of batch them away dandelions are great this time of year too because if they start poking out they're one of my first reliable signs of spring they're so bright and sunny and beautiful and they are so nutritious and like shell said you can use them to make tea you can eat them in salads you can cook them you can make wine out of them somewhere I have flow crowns flower crowns they're the best for flower crowns I have a a dandelion wine recipe somewhere in the old amarat Digital Book of Shadows I will try and dig out you can also take the juice from the stems if you break open that white sap that comes out of dandelions you can use that as magical ink draw on your skin and it stains it light brown or light tan and you can draw sigils or magical signs on your skin as part of a ritual or part of a spell and so I just love dandelions they are an amazing harbinger of spring I do have a a little PSA about dandelion so what's that don't be plucking your dandelion for another for like the first couple of weeks let them kind of sit there for two or three weeks don't spray them or do whatever because those first dandelion are legit the very first fresh food out there for the bees that are starting to come around and got us save the bees damn it yes oh bees thank you shell you know I love the bees so yes definitely leave them for the bees for sure whenever you're harvesting anything if you're a wild Harvester make sure you leave a bunch for the Wildlife and so it can propagate itself but yeah writing on your skin you know once whole summer comes along and you can pluck dandelions with impunity that white sap is really fun to use for sigils on your skin and spell work absolutely so I I definitely think that this is a good time to year to start stuff so you know start those plans get those things going let's do this people so next week we will be talking to you about things you can do during the spring equinox for ostara different spells and rituals that you can do correspondences just to make that day extra magical for you have I found a recipe that I'm gonna share with you guys you know digging through this old Book of Shadows I'm finding some freaking gems here so I got
