welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode we'll be talking about Ule folklore Christmas Cryptids and a couple of candle rituals to help you get in the solstice Spirit I'm Lea and I'm shell and can I start off by saying I love every holiday every Notch that wheel that involves a crypted Christmas Cryptids are some of my favorites and if you haven't listened to our Ule episode from last year I highly recommend you check out the Ule folklore episode because we do talk about quite a few of them you need to know about that U cat you you need to know about the Yu cat okay and if you're not wearing those new socks your nana got you for Christmas you're getting eaten that's right you're just getting eaten nobody likes that so if you want to hear more about Christmas Cryptids check out our episodes from Ule last year episodes 41 and 42 we talk about Ule the winter solstice Cryptids and so much more I'll put a link in the description of the show and hopefully those will help you get into the solstice mood and I'm already in the solstice mood and I love talking about ulle stuff and stuff to kind of lighten the dark mood oh I love how you said lighten because candles are one of my absolute favorite things for this time of year and I have two two candle ceremonies to tell you about later in the episode now we want to touch on some things that we know we've talked about in past episodes but who doesn't love Krampus when this episode airs we will have just had Krampus knocked which is Krampus night and I love that that creepy non- capitalist dude who runs around with the big long tongue and the Birch switch sounds like my kind of guy right seriously that sounds like a date I'm there well you know anyway so Krampus is kind of like the devil of Christmas he's from Austrian and Bavarian folklore he looks kind of like a like a half goat half monster you know goat feet and the Big Horns big long tongue and what he does is he goes around on December 5th and if you've been bad Krampus will whip you with his stick or sometimes he'll toss you in his basket and take you down to Hell don't threaten me with a good time right you know I've been seeing all over like people are starting to go all out I thought in the last three or four years it was really ramping up but I feel like this year people are embracing Krampus like nobody's business and I love it to be honest with you who doesn't love the big horned guy in the Santa coat but I think part of his his appeal is he's kind of like the anti-hero of Christmas we talked a little bit about it last year where Santa Claus is a little too sweet you know I love that description the anti-hero Santa Claus like that like nails it he's the one that when Santa Claus is so sweet and sugary and giving everybody everything and capitalism this and buy me that grandpas is out here just saying be good or I'm going to smack you with my switch it's you know what think it's we've reached a time in society where we're looking a little more for realism and not some fantasy  because we kind of been in a fantasy world for a while and not I I am a Santa Claus lover do not get me wrong but I think this year I'm feeling like I want a little more realism and Krampus is it be a good person or get your ass whooped bottom line and it can't always be about sugar plum dreams and overflowing wrapped present we don't always get that that's not how it is except in the movies so I think Krampus like you said brings in that dose of realism and you know he's the he's the Yang to Santa Claus's Yin I guess you got to have balance in all things and Krampus really brings that him and Santa are like the ying and yang and I think he's becoming very popular because of that because Christmas has gotten a little too sugary sweet it's gotten a little too capitalistic and so here comes Krampus to help us I guess you know get back to Our Roots get back to Folklore it keeps us in check honestly it keeps us in check yeah do you have any Krampus lore that we didn't go over last year because I've heard of Krampus being called the Christmas devil not that I know what a Christmas devil is but I I've heard that Krampus would be kind of that like quote unquote monster um whispering in the shadows to children I don't know I don't know I I I feel like he's almost the same as Christmas because wouldn't he put potatoes and their boots if they were bad the kids would put out their boots or their socks I guess on Krampus night and if they were good theyd get sweets and if they were bad they'd get a potato or a stick can I just say now that I'm a parent and now that I've had children and have had to be in the adult world I wouldn't really shun a potato I'm just saying I you know crunchy potatoes are definitely a good thing who doesn't love a good potato for real you know actually the potato kind of highlights why I think Krampus is so popular now and that's I think we're all looking for a return to simpler times I mean Christmas has really become way overc commercialized and in my family we're really trying to push back against that a little bit like we're trying to not buying new things this year and so we're doing a couple natural gifts like a handmade gift one secondhand and one from a small business and just try to keep it very simple and very small you are a better person than I no I'm a broke person that's what it is I'm a broke and you know I know we've talked about this um on Ule episodes of the past I kind of do this mixture of ulie Christmas yeah I think that's a reality for a lot of witches you know it it it's the way I am I love trees I love ornaments I will decorate like an obsessive fiend okay I just love presence under the tree and you know it's not about the money spent but I am big on get people what they want because I'd rather get you what you want than waste money on something you don't want absolutely it's all about not being wasteful right while still honoring the giving part of the season and I think because Christmas and Ule are so similar there's so many shared Traditions that they borrowed stole shared whatever you want to say with each other like my family has never been very Christian I mean we have Christians in the family but Christmas itself has always been pretty secular it's mostly about family and the return of the light and giving and being together so it was very very easy for me and you you know to marry those to kind of do a a Osa you solula Christmas yeah yeah solaa Christmas yeah that kind of thing that's what we do for sure now I did a little more digging than I've usually done and the similarities are uncanny to you the the deeper you dig the more uncanny it gets now if you just do a quick search you're going to you're going to find where it tells you that U um originated in Germany or the German part of Europe uh back then which I believe incompass part of Scandinavia Poland but that region but if you dig a Little Deeper you'll actually find that youu is got Norse Origins which I never knew um until recently believe or not and on Ule and for that period of time Odin is kind of the quote unquote Santa figure so I found this this picture actually super cool of Odin riding through the sky and what the Norse uh called the wild Hunt and I can talk about that in a second and so Odin goes into the sky on this wild Hunt on this eight-legged horse and in the picture you know long beard like dude look like Santa Claus very reminiscent of what we think Odin does kind of look like a like Santa Claus on a bender that that did a lot of weightlifting yeah like a buff Santa on a bender right right and he liked horses and not Reindeer the only difference I don't know so what the wild Hunt basically symbolizes is kind of chasing the dead to the underworld almost like letting them realize okay it's time to move on similar to the wild Hunt of the Fay and the Tuan in in Celtic and basically it's exactly the same thing because if you read about that it talks about you know how different different societies had their own version and this is just the north Norse version Gotta Love folktales because they they change from town to town you know even just over the next Hill it might be a little different now the Kelts weren't thinking it was Zin you know they had their own their own deity symbol but you know whatever and I think that's where Sometimes some of these ghost stories come into play like we've talked in previous Ule episodes about in Victorian era they would do like the scary stories the ghost stories it was traditional because they looked at this time of year you know I think in modern times we look at sa is really kind of that time to commune with the dead Ule is very similar but it's also the time where okay now you've immuned move on so in the OR are basically Odin moving them on I see okay that's kind of cool this might be another good time this time of year if you are working with ancestors or with beloved dead this might be a good time of year to symbolically let them go or to write them a letter to say goodbye you know this might be a very good time of year to try to work through some of that and also you know I'm glad you kind of said kind of said it that way because this was looked at as a joyous time I don't want to call it like a final farewell but kind of I mean obviously I know you and I believe that you know you can you can call upon your ancestors and you know my grandpa comes and visits on the regular but it's like that formal letting go right like saying goodbye to this relationship and maybe hello to a new type of relationship right right right but then over time you know that's kind of a downer a little bit and then it got kind of transformed into focusing more on we have now reached the darkest time and we are moving into greater light more light the light half of the year and then you know the oak King in the the Holly King story that you know we've talked about in the past so it did originate with Odin in this wild Hunt but it's kind of even though it's kind of transformed throughout the centuries it's kind of got that same intimate and I think that we might not realize it but we do think about our dead at U time who doesn't sure you know people that have gone before that you miss that you wish were there sure yeah you get together with family you know there are some of us I have certain family members uh obviously not all that I only see at this time of year at Christmas time at U time and you kind of Reminisce about who you've lost over the year you know remember when Grandma used to do Christmas Eve you know those kind of stories tend to come up I think we do it subconsciously and we don't realize that we're kind of really keeping those Traditions you know that's another really good reason why maybe having the candles or candl light ceremonies can be really helpful this time of year because it's dark it's gloomy we're thinking about our dead maybe somebody just told us a ghost story and now we're depressed and scared right you know maybe we have Seasonal effective disorder which is you know can be a big problem this time of year maybe our family is crapp I don't know but candles can really help to lift a mood to set a mood to do an easy simple spell we've had a couple episodes where we' talked about very simple candle magic because they're so magical in and of themselves and you know I also think that candles play an important role this time of year here's me going off on a tangent folks you know we all tend to be a little more happy and peppy in the summer who wouldn't be and this time of year it's cold you don't want to go out it's you know it's shitty and it's dark all the time and people are more prone you know you talk about seasonal depression like that's a thing man and people are more prone to just being a funk this time of year and sometimes just lighting a candle is a reminder literally that there's a light at the end of the tunnel kind of thing you know what I mean oh yeah that's reflected in the natural world with the days getting shorter and the nights getting longer and that's also a cycle that we see within ourselves as well you know we start to go within and we we do more things internally you know because the weather is so crappy here in the northern hemisphere here in the United States right but it's not just literally though sometimes that candle gives you the figurative light at the end of the tunnel yeah and that's what I'm saying that it marries perfectly with this time of year and there is a ceremony that I've started hearing about more and more in the last couple years but uh I guess it kind of started around 2017 is now you were you started telling me about this what the heck is this because I'm looking for a new tradition speak to me woman this one is called Sun weight and I love the name it's very cool and it originated in Sweden and it's kind of a it's a mashup between a lot of different wait are you talking we G HT or W AI t w AI T like waiting for the sun okay I just wanted to clarify and it's the idea of lighting candles every week starting six weeks before the winter solstice and you light them on Thursday Thor's day one a week each candle represents the first six Runes of the Elder fuar this sounds like a drawn out version of Hanukkah candles pretty much yes it's very similar and it's kind of similar to my family's candles but I'll get into the differences a little later wait a minute how many weeks do you do this for sun weight it's six weeks it starts this year it would have started November 14th  I missed it well you can still do it you know you can catch up no problem you can start now and you would light each candle on a Thurs the idea is that for the last 6 weeks of the darkest part of the year as the days are getting shorter and darker the idea is that for these last six weeks you're lighting a candle every week to help to keep the light in your life to help to bring the sun back now you know I kind of beat to My Own Drum does this have to be on Thursdays absolutely not actually our favorite Heaven Irene glass she does hers on Sunday I believe or Monday love her so much but yeah people will do them on Sunday because this uh this does celebrate saana the goddess of the sun because the Norse are some of the few people that have a sun goddess and a moon God funny how we're going circling back to the Norse right so some people will do it on Sunday to honor saana so you can do it any day but Thor's day is quote unquote traditional on this very new tradition so the runes that you use and again these can be different because again our favorite Heathen uses slightly different runes but Trad additionally it's Fu for the first and that's for abundance safety and shelter and then Urus which is the second week and that's for resilience stability and determination and then third week is thoras or gibo and gibo is the giftgiving Rune and that's for harmonious relationships let's see the fourth is anus then Radu and then kenaz so and they each have different meanings can you seriously post that online because me and the people aren't going to remember this I will absolutely post that on our website we'll try to post a a shortened version on our socials but yeah it's called Sun weight and it's very cool you know it's very pretty you can see people with their Sun weight candles online now you know I like to again beat to My Own Drum if I'm using the same sentiment week by week could I use my own sigils instead of runes well yeah I could but yes you could I'm asking but I'm I would do it anyway while I was researching Sunway I did see a couple different versions including a a Wiccan or Witches version where they did the elements air fire water Earth and then god and goddess I like that yeah so you could do your own sigils you could do something different you could do it five weeks four weeks however you want to do it the idea is to light the first candle and then the second week you'll light the first and second third week first second third so that your candle light is growing as the dark is growing so that's called Sunway I like that isn't that nice and that's a that's a heathen tradition and it's very beautiful but it's very modern which I love new doesn't make it less effective that's right I love that isn't that great now I am G to jump to I saw a post today from one of our lovely listeners and I apologize that I can't remember who posted it but it was someone lovely T the season for simmer Poots friends you know darn well that's my go-to this time of year smells so good it smells good but it's also it's multi-purposed I've drank them actually I've I've strained them out and drank them before yeah depending on what you put in there if you put all food safe ingredients right I have used it just to make my house smell good and I've used it kind of in in in spell form but it's an easy kind of throw things in you know I don't know it is the season to have the stove on all the time I don't know I just like doing it this time of year it's my thing we do have a discussion group on Facebook called back on the broomstick podcast Discussion Group it is fan Ren uh and we are not too far away from a thousand members and it is all witchy wonderful people and it is run by the wonderful the amazing the very magical Helen Jojo and we adore we love her she's awesome but everyone there is so witchy and cool and the person shell is talking about is Heather who posted a gorgeous simmer pot it has apples it has cinnamon it has cranberries looks like cloves and Bay oh she's written some spell work on her Bay and cinnamon sticks oh my gosh it just looks fantastic that is a lovely way like shell said to get that scent permeating through your house and if like Heather you put it in there with some intentions written on your bay leaves as that smell permeates through your whole house it carries that spell that energy through your whole home and it that's a beautiful beautiful way to basically Infuse your house with a spell another thing I like to do and this is also multi-purpose you know the phrase spring cleaning I do I do a a a pre Ule cleaning yeah because I need the house clean because the holidays are coming people are com but it is a good time I feel like a lot of heaviness comes with s maybe it's a me thing and it's kind of like you're not just dusting away the dust but you're dusting away kind of the old energy you know sin is the The Witches New Year January 1st is the modern world New Year oh talk about a Lial space between witch's New Year and modern calendar New Year that's a pretty magical space what could you do with that time it's time to clean people I do a deep clean this time and in Spring you know so I kind of have that that free winter because maybe it's because I know I'm going to be hunkered down and you know we're all inbound and I don't know but it's just something that's kind of a this time of year and you know how I clean everything has intent and purpose and it's when I redo all my altars you know I I clean off all of my statues and all of my Trinkets and you know all of my altery stuff it's just a good time for that it's almost like when the light comes back it's shining on cleanness oh I like that image there you go that's pretty good I could use some light de don't like dirt people there you go you know if that's what it takes to get me to clean off my altar then that's what it takes but it's also time when I make my my I guess you call witchy crafts I will make incense and bulk um this time of year sometimes because I give them as gifts I will make oils and bulk this time of year again because sometimes I'm giving them as gifts so I will be Crea magical things and again it's because it's cold and I don't want to leave the house and it's a good time to get done yep the same thing this is the time of year I get super crafty and start doing all sorts of things indoors because I can't get out it is snowy and cold and terrible and I don't know if you have but I have started the year of the dark goddess by Lara Vesta that book we reviewed it on a Solarium and I've actually started the work this past Dark Moon and uh I'm pretty excited about it I have not started it yet I am actually um I'm doing a little side project with my local coven and I have been kneed deep in cing stuff oh well that's a terrible thing that has prevented me from starting uh the book in in in that Journey but that is on my list of things to do once I get a couple more things off my plate I think uh myself and a few thousand of our listeners would wish we had that problem but in the very beginning one of the first things you're supposed to do is a meditation that's a journey to the underworld and I know you hate that I know you do so I had planned on recording it to make it easier for you and I think I saw a couple of our our listeners in our discussion group were having a little bit of trouble with the meditation so I think I've decided I'm going to record it because I was going to record it for myself anyways so that I could just listen to me and do the guided meditation that way so I think I'm going to record and release it out just to people in our podcast discussion group so now folks let me just say once you hear Lea's voice giving you a meditation you will never listen to another voice again thank you listen you'll know what I'm talking about well I was always the the meditation go-to person back in our old community and in our coven and it's something I think I'm good at so you are very good at thank you so yes I'm going to do that but uh this is the time of year like you were saying to go in word you know to to do your crafts to do your journaling you know to kind of get into that or to start the year of the dark goddess if you want to and you know I say this for every holiday it's like a broken record I don't I don't know why you're not expecting this one um again good time to do divination you know is there is there a time that's not good for divination let me think um no no no there is no bad time exactly but I guess with every you know tick of the wheel every notch of the wheel you're you're kind of hitting a new segment and I guess I think that every time you hit that new segment that new notch in the wheel is a good time to be like all right where am I at you know what I mean yes oh it's a great time to self-reflect I love it perfect get out your cards pull your cards pull one card pull three cards and then even if you have to take three days to to figure out that card do it but again T the season for for divination I say pulling cards do whatever you want use pendulum but is the season and I just wanted I I don't know why I thought of this but a lot of listeners lately have been asking on the discussion group and on our page about where to get decks okay this is my obsessive deck tip Buy Local if you can if you can't buy local try to buy from a shop via the Internet that is a locally owned small business that happens to ship worldwide and when all outse fails Amazon is not a bad option my two favorite places to get decks are Facebook Marketplace because I have found so many amazing secondhand Decks that way it's been wonderful and the other place I like to go is Kickstarter because you can find some really cool absolutely phenomenal decks out there that you won't find anywhere else so I highly recommend funding somebody on Kickstarter who's deck you fall in love with and you will my only issue with Facebook Marketplace is it's it's location dependent like with me being here in Salem no one's selling tarot on Facebook Marketplace you know you know what I'm saying I'm guessing that's a problem that myself and a few thousand of our listeners wish we had all these places in Salem they ship worldwide folks just ask me a store I'll tell you where to buy them there you go all right back to you so another candle ritual that I'd like to talk about is one that I have talked about before on the podcast uh it is my family's personal ritual and this is one that I came up with when my children were very small because they went to public school and they came home saying why don't we celebrate Christmas who's Santa Claus and I needed something to I wanted them to celebrate Ule and the solstice too you know I wanted them to have fun with that tradition and while we had a Christmas tree and we had presents on the 25th you know we really didn't make a big deal about it and the children wanted to so anyway I came up with this idea to bridge the two holidays and it's something that my kids now that they're almost grown absolutely love and is one of their favorite parts of Christmas it's very easy you take four candles you start on Ule and you turn out all the lights in your house and will say something like a poem or a story or just something short about the solstice being the darkest night the shortest day and that we're looking forward to the return of the Sun and we light a gold candle in honor of that and that represents the Sun and rebirth the next night December 22nd we light the gold candle and then we light a silver candle for the moon the third night December 23rd we light the gold candle the silver candle and we light a red candle to stand for the goddess or for uh the creative life force the next night December 24th Christmas Eve we light all the other candles and a green candle to represent the god or Nature's Bounty uh the changing season however you want to look at that energy so we'll do that to go from the solstice to Christmas Eve and that helps to bridge the two holidays and it also represents the growing light and the strengthening Sun I love that and I love your kids not that I don't love you and your husband but I love more we all love you too and it's definitely a fun uh tradition that we have and and we look forward to it does not have a cool name like sun weight I tried to throw a couple ideas at my kids like um like soul ring or burning light that would be a good one oh there you go uh I was trying to I was trying to do something like sun weight I wanted it to be cool if anybody has a good idea for Leila's tradition and has a good name for it let us know let us know I was actually told no that those ideas were dumb and we're supposed to leave it nameless so I that sounds like a a mid to older teenage answer yeah there you go let me refer back to I love your kids but if you do have an idea please email it to us back onth broomstick gmail.com but you know don't feel bad if if your life and your situation and and yada yada yada makes it difficult to unmerge Christmas andle yeah because you know my my kids grew up in a two- parent household with four grandparents household so they had to go see four grandparents their mother and their father like Christmas was like a travel time and we just kind of had to Jumble all that together and sometimes you was celebrated on December 25th that's okay that is okay the world isn't ending and and sometimes we would just make it one big holiday and we just didn't have the time honestly with two parents and four grandparents to visit like it just sometimes you have to compact that into one one thing and and that's kind of how my kids were kind of brought up that we're celebrating Christmas anuual and just not the Jesus stuff but when you get to Grandma's that's where celebrate the Jesus stuff you know what I mean you know and that's the beauty of this time of year is the winter solstice is the celestial event of the longest night and the shortest day and that's honor about the 21st but Ule the celebration of Ule that can be all of December if you want actually some cultures make it the whole month of December and part of January exactly so celebrate youle whenever you want to and if you'd like to either be under the radar or still celebrate Christmas just lean really hard into the natural side of Christmas you know look for those older versions of St Nick and use all natural elements to decorate your home the pine bows and the cinnamon sticks wrapped in Bows Oh My Gosh the dried orange slices and cranberry stuff is everywhere nowadays mistletoe all of it you know just lean hard into that really natural side of Christmas get a real tree get a real tree you know hey get a real tree get a secondhand uh fake tree whatever you want to do get 25 trees like shell if you want to hey it I think the most I ever had was like what 16 and included my bathroom tree and in my bathroom bathroom tree yeah yeah bathroom 16 in a bathroom tree okay I love it I love it other people do it other people do it I'm sure there's at least one other person that does and you got to admit my house was banging it looked sweet it looked like Christmas and youle puked in every room in my house yep exactly your house looked like an army of gingerbread men and the entire Workshop of Santa Claus elves had some sort of rer it was perfect now I would remiss if I didn't mention the Ule cat briefly oh I gotta love the Ule cat I still can't pronounce his name I can't pronounce my name half the time okay um we'll just call him the Ule cat so just as a reminder make sure you get your kids a new outfit or the U cat will eat them that's right the Ule cat gives no whether you're good whether you're bad all he cares about is you're wearing brand new clothes on Christmas morning so get yourself something new or you get eaten yeah you know be bad all year long but wear something fashionable and fabulous and brand new on Christmas morning and you're golden with the Ule cat I love it so whether you like the Ule cat and want to get eaten or not Krampus poish tongue or Santa in his Rosy cheeks or whatever it is you like about the celebrate you all be healthy and remember there is a light at the tunnel did you get any of that some of it you'll get through it folks my internet connection won't get through it though so thank you so much for listening to back on the broomstick we hope you enjoy your December whatever holiday
