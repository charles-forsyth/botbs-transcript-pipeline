join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick in this episode we'll be speaking to George lios a Greek Pagan priest of helenic polytheism he's also a spiritual teacher a psychic healer a podcaster best-selling author and has been named one of the top 50 health and wellness influencers so shell and I would like to welcome George lisos to the show hi both thank you so much for having me we're glad to have you here you're in Cypress is that correct I am based in Cyprus indeed yes nice nice before we get into your book one of the things that I first noticed when I read in it and I was quite surprised I saw that helenic polytheism wasn't legal in Greece until it was recognized by the Greek government in 2017 is that actually true yes exactly so the Greek government would not legalize helenic polytheism as an official religion so in 2017 when they finally did so that's when the the Greek polytheist that had been running I mean Greek polytheism never really stopped evolving it just went underground when Christianity took over back in the like late Antiquity but in 2017 when it was finally legalize the Greek polyes finally put up the first ever priesthood training the official priesthood training and that's the first one that I attended back in 2017 and I actually became like the first uh certified priest here in Cyprus what was it that Drew you there had you been practicing helenic paganism or was that something that called to you after you moved there so that is a long story but the short version is that my entire life I had been exploring my spiritual path I I grew up Christian I let go of that religion even though I like was was really like into it when I was 15 years old because it just didn't make sense for me and I started a whole journey of like exploration and I went through so many different types of religion spiritual practices and many of which I still practice and then in 2017 by that time I was had already published my first book I had my spiritual business I was coaching people but I was working also a full-time job in London while also running my spiritual business part-time and when you're like building a new business you put in a lot of time a lot of like of your free time into it so I would go to work 9: to 5 come home work on my business until midnight repeat the following day the weekends were dedicated to my business so three years later I had exhausted my body so much that I woke up one morning intending to go to work but my body just refused to work so I burned myself out like to the point of exhaustion so that's when I realized something had to change so I went on a retreat to glassenberry in the UK which is like a magical Town not the party version of it like the the little town version of it which is like full of fairy shops and crystal shops Etc so I did a past life regression while I was in glassenbury and I saw myself as a prostitute who became pregnant with one of my clients babies and when he found out he stopped me in the womb killing the baby and in that moment I made the promise to reject my feminine energy and solely depent and abuse my masculine energy because that's what I experien and therefore lifetime after lifetime I kept rejecting feminine energy and over depending on masculine energy and the way it manifested into these lifetime is when I was 15 I tried to take my life because I couldn't accept the fact that I was gay and and therefore like embracing my rejecting my feminine energy and then years later I was still rejecting my feminine energy by overdependence on my muscle energy and over working myself and burning myself out so I I come out of the past life regression tears running down my cheeks and I'm like I need to connect with the divine feminine right across the street was the goddess Temple of glassenbury oh little synchronicity so I Rush In And I go to one of the priestesses and I'm like can you please help me connect with a divine feminine and she told me all about the Celtic goddesses which I love but then I realized that's not my culture I wonder whether I can find the equivalent within the Greek culture I go back to my hotel I search online and I find out the Greek government had just legalized Greek polytheism and the workshop was running and hence I traveled to Greece to do that so it came out of the desire to connect with the feminine but what I found was balance because that's essentially what the ancient Greeks practiced they practice a Balan spirituality between the feminine and the masculine not just depending on one I love that I actually like that synchronicity of how your your kind of Enlightenment to that synchronized with the legalization in Greece which by the way blows my mind that it took until 2017 yeah and they're still rejecting it they're not really like they had to accept it legally but the church is still fighting it one of the things you said George about finding balance in deity it it kind of hits on something that I read a little bit in your book is that we talk a lot about god and goddess but there are no absolutes like that in deity it's it's so much more of a spectrum there's so much more to it than that it's less of a binary system than people really think that it is yes we get so caught up into god and goddess when it it's really it's really about balance you know there there is no absolute binary here yes and I think it's easy to forget that and to forget that balance is really what we're striving for yeah the gods and goddesses don't really have genders this gender is just what we've assigned to them we we assign gender to certain characteristics so that we can relate to them on a more personal level and that's why we personify the gods the gods and goddesses what they are who they are they are Universal functions they're universal laws they're not just energies they're not just archetypes they are not separate daes they are extensions of the universe and universal laws when we work with Aphrodite for example she embodies the law of form she is the law of form and therefore that who creates things and gives form to things therefore so you cannot put a gender on the law of form and the law of creation it's just the way we've related to the gods but even with the ancient Greeks they had gods and goddesses that we for example hermaphrodites the example is aphroditus who is the the hermaphrodite version of Aphrodite who was celebrated here in Cyprus actually Cypress was a cult the biggest Cult of Aphrodite in the ancient times and we have a bigger the biggest temple of aphrod here where they celebrated afroditus and it was basically the way they people thought about it and portrayed that being was a de with breasts but also fallos and therefore it was hermaphrodite now the word hermaphrodite itself is an offspring of Hermes and Aphrodite right and therefore another like interex d now that kind of Segways into a question I had you talk in the book about why we pray to the gods why we pray to the deity so from your perspective why do we pray to deity yes there's a misconception both historically with like the scholar studying the ancient Greeks and also people in general who practice their religion or spirituality that people had a transactional relationship with the gods oh I want something and therefore I'm going to make a sacrifice or an offering and I'm going to get something back that's not how it worked of course many people the mes may have understood it that way because I mean not everybody in a society understands religion and spirituality on a deep level but really the the spiritual people at the time they did not have a transactional relationship with the gods nor did they teach that the gods couldn't care less about our offerings and our sacrifices and the Libations these are just ways for us to feel closer to the gods it's a way for us to create a bridge between the profane and the sacred world so that we can communicate with the gods so when I'm doing my ritual and I'm making a liation of wine or when I'm making an offering of grains the gods don't care about that it's for me to feel connected and to feel like I am in the presence of the Gods because the gods don't give us anything the gods have already given us it's just a matter of us to realize the gods have graced us with their gifts and presence rather than receive them it's a matter of understanding and realizing it's already happened aligning with that thought process of the Gods exactly that's why I love that how you pointed that out in the book it's more of that alignment than that give and take exactly that's why in the chapters with the gods and goddess says I have a a practice where I say I am a frety I am Apollo to remind people that we are the gods we're swimming in the ocean of the Gods and therefore they're not separate from us so when we say I am Hermes I immediately embody the energy of the law of Hermes that aligns with a lot of what I have learned as far as spell work and energy work and even the current popularity or I guess Resurgence of the law of attraction that type of thing it's when you align yourself with these energies and when you when you phrase spellwork in the present tent I have this I am this this is mine this is what I'm doing now that's when you get more in tune with what the gods what the universe has in store for you you put yourself into that flow into that space by saying it in that way and I love how you put that in the book it it's a good reminder that you know you have to kind of shift your mindset into right now I have this right now not I want it but I have it yeah because often when we when we read about the gods and goddess say we we read about their myths for example and mythology and theology are two different things but the the myths make the god seem like these like bigger than live superhuman beings but really we are also part of the Gods right we're not separated from them so that understanding also helps inform spell work and prayer work and affirmative work and manifestation work because we realize that if we are one with the gods that means we are also one with our desires and what we want to manifest and by making the same affirmation I I am my desires then you bring that into the Forefront actually my my next book that comes out in November it's called ancient manifestation secrets and it's about the seven laws of the universe according to the ancient hermetics and I talk about the low vibration and exactly that and how to take the frequency of your desire and make it part of your energy field so you can manifest it because if you're in that frequency then you are you are manifesting that as you go exactly and that's why I'm a big fan of energy based manifestation this is my own kind of practice where of of course I love my vision boards I have one behind me I I use all the like the belts and whistles of manifestation and like spells Etc but I also like working with my energy field and getting that frequency planting it essentially in my energy field and letting myself manifest by magnetizing something to me I love that and now that kind of goes hand inand with another point I wanted to talk about where you talk about finding your guardian uh god or goddess because that's another way that I feel people can align themselves with a way they want to be or something they want to learn by choosing a deity or being chosen by a deity to walk with them in their particular energies uh you spoke about you needed to connect with that divine feminine the feminine within yourself so you had Aphrodite as a guardian for a while to heal from that trauma and to find that selflove and then you worked with Apollo again for a different energy you know and each time you look for something you can choose at one of these 12 deities 12 gods or goddesses that have that energy that you want to embody and work with that energy in that way so could you talk to us a little bit about finding a guardian god or goddess and how someone would go about doing that yes I want to preface this by giving people a gift basically when you go to Greek mysticism tocom when you order the book and you enter your order number I have a free Workshop that people can get for free all about meeting your guardian god or goddess so Greek mysticism tocom where you can get that but essentially our Patron God or a guardian god or goddess is someone we're born with we we're assigned to at Birth or even before birth to guide us through our life and it's basically the god or goddess that holds a frequency of the purpose that we have in this lifetime and our sole purpose over many lifetimes for those who believe in reincarnation I do I do but at the same time we can work with different gods throughout our lives based on what it is we're working on but really what I'm trying to encourage people to do is work with all 12 gods because there are there's a reason why the Ancients focus on 12 gods and I talk about that in the book ancient philosopher salus divided the gods into four categories based on the four like steps of creation so the different types of gods and in each like um Step there are three gods and therefore three times four it's 12 gods which is why I had to exclude Dionysus because he's not one of the of the 12 Steps according to salus and I wanted to base it on on that so by working with the 12 gods first of all you get to work with the whole of you you get to work with the whole of the Earth because the gods and goddesses they are representations of universal laws that is that is that are part of nature so by only choosing one God and saying I only work with one God that means you're working with one universal law and you're excluding all the different aspects of nature whereas by embracing everything and working with a different God every single month you get to find this sense of wholeness within you and develop all sides of you not just one side just that tunnel vision I love that yes and you you Embrace different aspects of yourself the idea of choosing one God to focus on that is patriarchy that is trying to limit us and tell us you can only do one job for example in this lifetime whereas I'm of the perspective right now that yes we have a single purpose but we can have many expressions of that parles I'm an actor I'm a singer I'm also spiritual teacher why can't I do both P want say choose one Focus there and therefore choose one God Focus there no let's work with all the gods I love that I love that actually because that that's so true and it's if you work with all of them there's a better chance that you'll work with the ones that you're afraid of you'll work with your Shadow side you'll be able to better incorporate all of those parts not just the ones you really like not just the comfortable aspects yeah like Hera for example Hera the queen of the gods she I mean mytholog Al she's a so people don't like working with her like oh why would I work with Hera I remember watching Zena the Warrior Princess and Hercules a Legendary Journeys that didn't make it any better they did her dirty no I I didn't like Hera until I connected with her in when I went to my temple hopping DP trip to to Greece and I found so much love in connecting with her and I'm like where is this where where was this in Zena Warrior Princess I'm a Gabrielle fan all the way love her oh my gosh I'm going to be on a Zena Warrior podcast soon talk about yeah it's a fan podcast like for the fans and I'm gonna talk about how the gods were portrayed in Zena I'm so excited so it's it's an excuse to like watch like the first two seasons right now so I can comment well I'm gonna be looking out for that because I was a huge fan back in the day I loved those shows I haven't seen that in so long as WR as they were I still love yeah very wrong by the way I saw runes runes Pandora's Box it was supposed to be jar first of all but Pandora's book had runes like Norse runes on it and she was like throwing the runes on like what are you doing no so we can still have fun with it even if it's not right I suppose yeah yeah now love me some Zena warrior princess but getting back to the topic of the Gods yeah you did mention working with all 12 and that kind of follows through with the the Greek wheel of the year if you want to kind of call it that you know one deity and I I like how you broke that down in one deity per month because that gives you a lot of time to work with those aspects of yourself if you dedicate yourself to a whole year of study which is a great idea anyways you can just one deity a month and just immerse yourself in those aspects each month and then you know by the end of the year you've come through this whole cycle and learned a lot about yourself and about deity as well can you tell us a little bit about the wheel of the Year aspect of it yeah so most people are familiar with the Celtic wheel of the gear that has eight festivals around the changing of the seasons so the Greek will of the Year follows that it's based on that like most Pagan religions are and it has 12 festivals around the the year one for each lunar month essentially because the ancient Greece followed lunar months now it's important to note here that the ancient in ancient Greece it wasn't like ancient Greece was not a unified country there were city states and each city state had a different will of the Year their own will of the year with their own festivals but they all kind of like coincided when when it comes to like the changing of the Earth but what the Contemporary polytheists have done they've created a unified calendar and that's the one I include in the book starting in January and ending and ending in December and there's logic behind it when you see nature in January we have the theia the sacred wedding between Zeus and Hera and therefore it's a beginning of a new journey and therefore balancing the masculine and feminine energy and then as the year grows and there is increased solar light coming in we celebrate Deiter because like in February because nature starts blooming and then then pfon comes up uh to the Earth mag mythologically and then we go into hephestus we go into Apollo we go into Aphrodite when Nature blooms and everything is is fully materialized in April then we go into Apollo in in May and now while we're recording this in June we're into summer soltice and Hermes and there is correlation between the Gods the festival and how the Earth changes so it does make sense and helps you align with it but on a personal level each god and goddess has their own virtues and this comes from ethical philosophy all the philosophers talked about living a virtues life they called it aradi in Greek which basically means virtue it's all about being a good human and each God has virtues that we can use to embody and live as the god each month for example now with um summer solce let me just look at my cheat sheet over here it's upside down so it's fair dealing and sociability so hermiss as um virtues is fair dealing and therefore being fair with ourselves and with people and sociability like being outgoing communicating and it makes sense think about the summer soles like everything is in full bloom our manifestations are materializing so we want to be social we want to get out of our comfort zone we want to be fair with every body so it does make sense now one thing I like about your book is it kind of it almost dubs as a workbook and I love that about books when they're like part informational but part like workbook so if someone if if someone is going to kind of follow and go through the months in the deity each month how do you recommend if at all they incorporate other deity into that yearly cycle that maybe aren't mentioned in the book say they want to add some hiate or dianis and they're not necessarily a part of the 12 how could they incorporate that into their learning year for lack of a better phrase ah great question and nobody asked me this question before and I love it because that's something that I also wondered and this is something that we do when we do our public ceremonies every month so let's say for example this month we're going to celebrate the summer sources dedicated to Hermes and he's uh the female component Hestia so we're celebrating both a male and a female deity every single month to balance the scale okay so we have Hermes and Hestia at the same time we're going to recite orphic hymns which is how we like honor the gods and make Libations and offerings to other gods as well that are related to Hermes and hesia for example for the sber sses we're also going to include Helios the Sun God and other Sun gods were also May honor Aphrodite as well because it's related so we see mythologically who related to those gods and we bring them in for example when we celebrate deer we also bring in pany we also bring in the nymphs that are in nature we also bring in Pan the god of nature so we bring those secondary deities into the practice as well because they make sense and they add their unique qualities so when we celebrate an Olympian we don't just celebrate the Olympian we also celebrate the second very got related to that Olympian okay okay because I anytime I I touch anything Greek the first thing I'm looking for is some info on hkat and when I opened this I'm like wasn't added and and so I was like how would I take this and add her into this rotation of yes of that yearly cycle but that makes absolute sense let's talk about hiti because she's very popular within the the witchi community because of the Greek magical papai now the Greek magical papai they were discovered they were basically in Egypt it was they were written at in late Antiquity when there was syncretism between Greek spirituality and Egyptian spirituality so they're not 100% Greek they're a mix of Egyptian Greek Jewish and Christianity okay like it's a melting part of all the religions in late Antiquity and for some reason The Magicians in late Antiquity they took heate who was a very ancient goddess and they claimed she was the best goddess to work with when it comes to Magic not just hea there were certain gods that were favored helos was one of them Hermes was one of them they excluded a lot of the Gods and they focus exclusively on hear and a few other gods and therefore modern pagans witches specifically they've taken that information and they've called heati the the queen of of witches and the goddess of Witchcraft she can be that but she's not just that she's much anci yes there are other aspects of her that don't get any like any attention because she's so popular within magic because I haven't done my research into that I didn't wan to include her in the book and also she's not one of the main Olympians although I do love her and work with her now we've talked about her before and I have to say I see her as as the epitome of the ri or die best friend because one of the Homer stories was about her when pranie was kidnapped and deer was searching for her hak was the only goddess who went and helped and she helped search and then found pranie and helped bring her back out and then said that when PR had to go back to the underworld every year she'd go with her and and that's where she is with her torches and and so I that's like a best friend thing right there I think that's something that you would do for somebody that you really cared for so for me she is the epitome of the ride or die best friend I will do what I can to help you no matter what and you know what I think it's really important for people to have this personal relationship with the gods because yes we can look to the Ancients yes you can read my book and understand certain things about the gods and goddesses but your relationship with the gods is most important because when I connect for example with with Aphrodite I feel something completely different to what somebody else feels when they connect to Aphrodite and that's the beauty about earth-based religions is they're not dogmatic it's about our personal relationship with the gods and that's the most important thing abolutely if there was one thing that someone could do in your opinion to help them feel a connection with deity to maybe have the that Guardian that was assigned to them or or all of of the goddesses if there's one thing that they could do what would you recommend someone do so in the book as you've seen I have like many different practices for at different levels of like complexity people can set up a simple Altar and connect with the gods or they can follow the wheel of the year and practing the mon practice the monthly Festival they can do a new moon ritual and a full moon ritual to combine that with manifestation I have mantras I have Journal prompts I have symbolism about the gods and goddesses I have like simple practices and more complex practices but my most favorite practice is something I talk about in the epilog of the book so this was me writing trying to finish the book at at the time last year I was just I finishing my first year in drama school so I was rehearsing for for exams and then I was practicing for a Greek production of Mama Mia and I was trying to finish the book and I was trying to have a social life and failing at most things and I'm like I was advising people to like do three rituals every single month and there I was I hadn't done a single ritual in three months and I'm like I felt like such an imposter so in a moment of desperation I go back to my notes that I had taken in 2017 and I read something that my teacher said which was stop trying to search for the gods outside of yourself stop trying to think that you need to do any rituals to feel connected with the gods you're already swimming in an ocean of the Gods you're part of the Gods in that moment I closed my eyes I placed one hand on my heart hard and I said wake up to myself and my intention was wake up to my inner Divinity wake up to the realization that the gods are here that I am connected with the gods that I don't need to do anything to connect with the gods because I'm already swimming in the ocean of the Gods I could do something if I wanted to but I don't have to that for me was liberating and that's the number one thing that I advise everyone I love that I love that so so much thank you for that that's perfect I think that's something that a lot of people need to hear and and that's beautiful thank
