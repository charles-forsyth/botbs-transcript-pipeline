welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode we're kind of continuing our last episode's conversation where we talked about grounding and centering so if you haven't heard that one yet check out our last episode I believe it's episode 50 then get back to this one where we're going to be talking about energy work and how to power your spells hey you didn't tell them who you were oh that's right I'm Leila and I'm shell and I just want to point out if you go back to our last episode our last posted episode it's a little different we're talking about our last regular episode but Lila let's just recap our salarium real quick I'm Fang girl and I oh yeah gin you cannot bring up our Solarium with Kendra without me getting a big ass grin on my face because she is very cool and that's all I'm gonna say this time I'm gonna play it cool this time she's she's awesome I Ain playing it cool I'm fan girl in here like like nobody's business like I'm fan girl and like I just left the Super Bowl and sat next to Taylor Swift okay it was an amazing conversation I really loved hearing the behind the scenes witchy stuff that she did I loved hearing all the astrology stuff that I don't know much about but she obviously does as well as what she's currently doing living in Hawaii kind of getting in touch with herself doing readings for other people and really just living this witchy lifestyle Vibe which I'm I'm So Into right now the best part I think for me was I mean we are admitted Survivor fans have been since season 1 episode one when we'd sit at my damn house on Thursday nights at 8:00 but aside from her association with Survivor the reason I loved that interview so much is cu she is just a awesome badass genuine extremely witchy talented person and those are the type of people I love and her having been on Survivor is just like the cherry on top so aside from Survivor she is one badass witch that I just I just love her to pieces and then you put Survivor on it and that's where the fan Girl part starts so we hope that she's doing well love you Kendra but the episode before that our last numbered episode episode 50 on how to ground and Center yourself is kind of a prerequisite to this episode where we're going to talk about raising energy or maybe the subtitle should be shell why didn't my spell work well we've got a good answer for that and you know we are going to kind of circle back and briefly touch back on the grounding piece again as a reminder but people do say that we see it on the internet all the time people ask us all the time I followed what was in the book or I followed what was in the video and nothing happened well we talk about intent until we're blue in the face I swear we mention the word intent in every single episode but aside from intent the second most important part of the pieces here is putting the energy into it and to put energy into something you have to actually raise energy to have energy to put into it so exactly we're gonna talk about a few ways and some of them are super fun by the way ways to raise energy and to to give your spell that oomph for lack of a better phrase exactly why is it something that people either forget or like the unspoken piece of the puzzle I feel like you don't see it as much in newer books that you did in older books you're not seeing it on Tik Tok you're not seeing it on websites that are giving you like the howtos or if you do it just says raise energy well what if you don't know how the hell to do that you know you hit on something that I hadn't really realized until you said it you're right the older books did talk about raising energy as part of of spellwork and newer books don't as much and there are some like psychic Witch by Matt Ain but we'll talk about that a little bit later that specifically are about raising energy but you're right people publish spells with no mention at all of how to raise energy or why the items that they've chosen are part of that energy like think back 20 or so years ago when we were reading like Janet and Stuart Ferrar books like they were giving you damn step by step this is how you rage energy step one and this is what you do with it step two like I'm not finding that in books and I'm not Downing anybody I'm not doubting any authors but I feel like it's a piece it's like it's like Nickelback man so it it like people forget and it's underrated but super important okay I'm trying to wrap my head around the Nickelback reference but underrated underrated and deserves more praise than it gets just like raising energy underrated and deserves more praise than it gets my guess is when we learned about this it was all under Wiccan constructs Wiccan Concepts and people have very much gotten away from that so maybe they've moved away from some of the what they see as Wiccan but I don't see I don't see raising energy is Wiccan I can see maybe how you raise energy could be sure I'm talking more like the concept of creating a circle create casting a circle a container for that energy and then what people would call the cone of power like you mentioned it when we were talking earlier those particular things were part of Wiccan rituals and so I wonder if when people were trying to get rid of all things Wiccan without even realizing it yeah they threw the the circle and The Cone of power out with the wiccan things just like we all threw nickel back away see that's right that's right just the exact same but if you were gonna throw a bunch of stuff away you know great but this wasn't the thing man no because we do see a lot of people saying I followed every step in the spell and it didn't work and the reason is because you're you're missing the part where you actually raise energy to empower the spell and we've spoken in previous episodes about how real life energy and everything has a cost no matter what you want to do in this world whether mundane or magical it has some type of cost whether it's your time your energy your attention your emotions your soul actual money any of those things everything has some type of of cost and spells are no different how you pay that I mean you can pay with cash credit card and time you know and so in a spell you can do that too there's mundane things in the world that you can do to power your spell you can have crystals and incense and tools that have their own energy that can help power your spell you can entreat deity or the universe or your ancestors to help you power it or you can use your own energy to push into that spell see now I kind of look at it as like two different things I understand like obviously being an herbalist for a couple decades I get the whole you know I'm G to make an incense and add that energy to it but I don't necessarily look at that as I see it as is those herbs or those tools or what have you have an energy that adds to it but I don't look at those energies as my piece of raising energy for it that's right because it's not enough oh yeah I totally agree and raising energy I just want to make sure we're clear raising energy and putting energy into things is different than intention correct your intention can help direct your energy your intention is more like the container it's the statement that you've made and then you really need yeah yeah so all right well let's talk about what are we what energy are we talking about like what does this feel like what are we specifically talking about when we say use energy to power your spells gez I guess I should have had a better answer because now I'm like how do you explain this to people well your body is is energy we have like an orc field that's electromag energy field yeah we have we have magical energy within you your emotions are energy have you ever like right before you do something really exciting like maybe go on stage or speak in front of people and you get like those Jitters like those super excited maybe it's right before your birthday and you get those super excited Jitters where your whole body feels like tingling and electric and you have to keep walking around and pacing because you have all this energy Oh you mean like right before we did our interview with Survivor 45's Kendra exactly yes exactly like that that's how it feels when you're powering a spell and you have to create that type of feeling that sensation in your body just different extents and different flavors in order to push that energy out to the universe to fill that container of your intention and to power your spell and you know you can pull that energy from within or without you know you have that oric energy field you have you know those those chakra points you have ways to kind of muster it from within one visual I I'm good with visuals I guess was that remember that ball of energy in the pit of your gut right behind your belly button and yes imagine it growing from behind your belly button through your body and then creating this bubble around you that is a good example of kind of pulling out and creating that energy from within I like that one too because starting the ball in your gut is something that's easy for people because that's where we feel those butterflies you know that that excitement build right behind your belly button right behind your belly button it builds at that core at your Center and so that can help people really feel and visualize that energy as it starts to move in their body and I think when I was a a newer witch it was things like having those visualizations you know kind of being able to close my eyes and imagine this little white ball of energy you know right in right in my core kind of exp the more you kind of visualize it in your mind it's almost like you can feel it growing through you yes just like you can feel that excitement growing right before you're going to interview Kendra from Survivor or open your birthday present I'm still fan Girling by the way same same and that's why that tree meditation that we talked about before that tree visualization is so important because not only are you grounded and centered when you connect your feet or or your root to the Earth you can also reach down to the Center of the Earth where that molten energy that life energy is and you can tap into the Earth's energy that is pure and clean and very very powerful and you can pull on that energy to help aid you rather than Tire yourself out just by eating up your own energy to charge that Cent that ball of light you know you can do that not just with with the ground and with the Earth itself you know we we had a listener inquire about water magic and Ocean Magic you can do the same thing you know go down to the beach during high tide safely by the way and kind of have that high tide water rushing over you and bringing you that energy that's a fabulous way if you're looking to work with with those types of energies but again please be safe don't get wased out into the ocean well speaking of that not too long ago just a month or so ago you and I both without realizing it on a very windy wavy day you went down to the ocean I went down to the shores of Lake Ontario because the wind was gusting the waves were crashing and just standing on the beach I could feel that energy the wind is so wild and the waves are so loud and passionate and just you can feel that energy in a storm or or in experience like that and you were having the same experience in Massachusetts on the ocean but it's almost like you can almost I don't want to say you can kind of suck it in and save it for later but you can kind of suck in some of that energy um and and utilize that you can and people store that in jewelry they'll store it in crystals they'll store it in water they'll store it in Earth or plants but when people talk about powering a crystal or powering items you can take in that energy and direct it into to your alter items or into your magical tools to charge and power them and store that like shell said store it for later for a later date basically yep Bank it that's what moon water does that's when everybody puts Moon water out to collect the full Moon's water you're colle energy just banking energy that's right and so later when you use that in your spell that has extra power because it has it absorbed the energy from the moon so you can use a little bit less of your own you know or you can just use that in a pinch in our old Community my favorite memories are of the part of ritual where we would all chant together where we would sing together where we would do spiral dances where we would beat on the earth stop my god when was the last time we did a spiral dance I missed that and just everyone chanting I mean I don't know if you've ever had the opportunity to sing with other people but when everything goes together beautifully you can feel that it's it's like what athletes call being in the flow or if you've ever you know had a a hobby or something that you do where you just really get into the zone you know you can do that with chanting and with magic and you can just feel that energy flowing around the circle of people and then we would direct that energy up and into a cone to either honor the season or to power a spell or to send energy to a certain intent to work our will and then we would release the rest of it to the Earth so that we weren't caring too much so that we didn't deplete ourselves too much that we came back to balance I think that was probably how I originally very first first learned how to raise energy and I learned it out of a book Lori cabat power of the witch we've talked about this before chanting chanting because you know we we do like the dancing and and and the singing and all of that but not everybody not everybody has the opportunity to be with a group you can chant all by your damn self and nobody cares if you're toned deaf even if you're with a group nobody cares if you're toned deaf you might fumble the words it don't matter chanting I think is is a good place to start because it's really something everybody can do and I love chanting I am a terrible singer I cannot hold a note if you gave me a basket to put it in but love it and it makes everything feel very magical when I do it and that's why I like simple spells because if you write your spell very simple and rhyming You Can chant it as you chant it over and over again you can get more and more intense with it until you can feel that power building and then push that into your spell and I've actually I've actually done chance where I I've done it in cycles of three six or nine um depending on my intent what I'm doing uh whatever the case may be but I I do love chanting but drumming let's talk about drumming to raise energy druming my favorite there is something to be said under the full moon around bonfire where drumers going right and just bare feet on Sand dancing to the Rhythm and everyone either chanting or just shouting and feeling that energy there's nothing like it and I am so looking forward to Summer right now now for any of you folks that have never been um exposed to Ritual drumming we are not affiliated with these folks whatsoever but go check out Dragon ritual drummer they're fabulous they are so good and they will give you if if you've never experienced ritual drumming these folks will blow your ass away man I'll put some links in the show notes even simple things like I've sat on the ground and kind of felt like I was mustering it up and then kind of slowly got up on my knees mustered a little more and then got almost like I was raising my body as I was raising the energy that makes sense or am I just a weirdo makes sense and I think while you were doing that you were visualizing right you were visualizing the energy coming up from the earth into your body as it touched the ground and pulling that just like a tree pulls pulls nutrients pull the water out y up into yourself and just visualize that and you could chant it can be something as simple as earth air fire water and just re chant that over and over again or deity names or just chant your simple spell that you wrote or the spell you found find lyrics to a song that you like and play the song and sing the song I know there's a song that you can belt out the lyrics to that really gets you riled up I know there is that's a way to pull energy not to give out some random shout outs here but if you've never been experienced or or been witnessed to chanting and have only read it in a book and are kind of like I've never heard you know whiches chant I don't know check out Selena Fox all of her social she has plenty of videos where she she does a lot of awesome chanting I love her so yeah Selena Fox she she's like the chanting goddess of the world right now I think I love her and there's also breathing just using your breath can be a really great way to raise energy as well getting into a meditative State and paying attention to your breath and just going with that can be a great way to raise that energy just pulling that energy in with each inhalation all right ilila we're going there okay so another fun way to raise energy wait for it is sex okay we're going x-rated here yeah honestly anything that you do where you break a sweat where your heart gets pumping that's a that's energy you've just raised and sex honestly well I guess if it doesn't get your heart pumping maybe you're doing it wrong so anything that gets your heart racing really is great way to raise energy and sex is a phenomenal way just be really cautious because if you're using it to raise energy with a partner who doesn't know what you're doing you can create ties with that person that you might not intend now for those they get what we're saying but they don't get what what we're saying let's explain this for real quick without being too risque people might be asking especially some newer newer folks um to this whole life what do they mean raising energy with sex how do you do that well kind of like think of it like if you were drumming or chanting you know that whole starting out slow and getting getting faster and then before you know what the fireworks and the energies out there that's a nice way to explain it right yeah that sounds good we might have under 18 listeners I don't want to be too vulgar there you go anything that raises that raises your blood pressure anything that gets you breathing heavy that's a good type of energy to raise I promised you the other day when I walked to work I was not raised an energy okay I don't care what you say well you know I guess it depends on how fast you're walking but you could have used that energy for a magical working or it could have just powered your walk to work people might have their other ways that they do it and and just because it might not be something we've mentioned doesn't mean that's not a way to do it or that's a wrong way whatever works for you man however you think you can get that what' you call it butterfly feeling in your stomach that excited yeah however you get that way roll with it there's another way that I really like this is a way that I taught a lot of people how to feel energy and and it's a really good meditation simple exercise that you can do to help you learn how to raise energy feel energy and direct that energy tell us so great one [Laughter] I don't know how great it is I thought it was so original and cool and then I found out like everybody does this but I have a good way to explain it that I think makes it a little easier so sit someplace comfortably make sure that you're in a cleanse Sacred Space whether you choose to cast a circle or not um I do like casting a a circle a safety bubble around you when you're working with energy just because it helps to contain that energy in one space yeah and then yeah that you know if you're raising that energy into a space it makes it easier to direct it so sit comfortably in your circle get into a meditative space however you do that with your breath work with a meditation that you like but get into an alpha State and then take in a couple deep breaths do your grounding techniques and visualize energy coming into your body in through your root chakra in through your crown chakra and down into your arms and then Direct that energy down your arms into the palms of your hands and just focus on that and keep thinking about that visualization and while you do that you should start to feel a warmth a tingling in the center of your palms and once you reach that point where the center of your palms feel very warm feel very tingly place them in front of you Palm to Palm about 6 inches apart and then I want you to visualize have you ever in a bubble bath shell picked up like a big scoop of Bubbles and played with them between your hands I have because I'm I'm I'm juvenile like that yeah same so imagine that you have just picked up the thickest foest most wonderful smelling scoop of bubble bath bubbles ever in between your hands about six inches thick and move your hands back and forth just a couple inches at a time you know back and forth really fast just like you're kind of playing with those soap bubbles and you can feel the energy the air between your hands will be thicker it'll feel you can feel that energy and your palms will get very warm very tingly and you can feel that energy so play with that push more energy into it pull energy out of it work with it until you can really get a good ball of energy and then work on making that energy feel a certain way make it feel happy make it feel calm and then once you've done that take your hands run them over your head down your body and push that energy back into yourself that calm happy energy whatever you've created it and then back into the Earth and ground yourself and that's a good exercise to do and to practice so that you can learn to not just sense the energy but focus it in an area flavor it for lack of a better word to whatever you need it to be to power your spell and then use it you know in this case to put back into yourself to give yourself that energy and then ground and Center yourself so that you're back to an equilibrium so that's a good exercise you know it is a good exercise but kind of a funny side comment it was doing that exercise over and over and over way back when that actually got both my ex-husband and I into raiki it was literally because of that one exercise that we we ended up getting an raiki which is a different conversation but still like an energy working thing but that one thing was the Catalyst I'm so glad you mentioned raiki because there are a lot of different um modalities there's a lot of different cultures where people talk about the energy of yourself your body having energy centers and using and manipulating that energy it's it's a very common thing you know people who who hear about you know your chakras and doing Shakra work and know you got a blocked one or you got clear ones the concept of of your your chakras is if they're all clear that energy is freely flowing through you and around you um and those blocked chakras can kind of block that energy from that free flow so this is all really intertwined honestly yes and as you're doing these exercises if you do that soap bubble meditation where you're pulling energy in through your root chakra through your crown through your hands or through your feet you'll start to feel blockages as you start to move this energy and practice moving this energy through your body you'll be able to start to feel where it stops or it gets stagnant or it hangs up on something and that's when you know you have to work on visualizing cleansing or clearing that energy space and you know kind of a side a side note to that is if you are having a hard time kind of creating that energy within you to project out for whatever your your reason maybe you need to take a look at your inner energy energ to see if there's some blockages that are stopping you from mustering that energy from within for your spell or your ritual or what have you and that's why I really like smoke cleanses water cleanses you know going out in the earth you know grounding literally putting your feet on the ground can really help you to clear your your oric energy to clear your energy body so that you can better move energy for your spell work and you just feel more centered and and calmer once you start to work with those energy centers in your body and start to cleanse them and get them moving freely I Used to Love Smoke cleanses until that one time I singed my hair little too close with a smudge stick little too close but like we were talking about earlier you can also you know maybe if just moving the energy on your own doesn't work for you grab a crystal maybe there's crystals that really feel vibr or zingy or you know like they have an energy and hold that maybe you have a magical tool that you feel like has good energy or just a particular object you know we we had this conversation recently when we were physically together keys I have put energy into Keys before and it doesn't have to be uh alter tool per se you know I do have keys on my altar but I kind of use those as energy holders for specific magic like doing stuff with hiate so it doesn't have to necessarily be a tool it can just be a thing actually one of the very first times I had a very strong energy experience was I didn't meet any other witches until like the early 90s when I first went to Salem Massachusetts and I met some high priestesses there particularly um a woman and her husband uh Kate and Frank they were high priestess and high priest of a coven and I got to work with them a little bit after meeting them in Salem which was very cool because I had never had any type of real interaction everything I learned came from books or what I could scr at what passed for the internet at the time and she did this thing where what she called a stoning and she put me into a meditative State and then would give me different crystals and have me just kind of do a meditation with that Crystal and really feel the energy of the crystal itself and I had a very powerful Vision she put a piece of um Blood Stone in my hand and I had my eyes closed I didn't know what type of Crystal she'd put in my hand and I immediately had this powerful vision of running Barefoot through the woods this whole powerful Vision around this Crystal and I could really feel the energy of it and very much tune I do you would but that was the first time I had felt the energy of an object that clearly and that strongly so sometimes you'll have an object like that that can really help you to feel the energy and that can help you to fuel or power all sorts of spells I've got two comments to that first of all are you literally telling us a story about how you went to Salem Massachusetts and got stoned haha had to put that in there and second of all you know there's there's a lot of folks that were raised in a Christian atmosphere and I equate this to the rosary or the crucifix or what have you a lot of a lot of Christians put energy into you know when they're doing I have no frame of reference with this you know they have the the one with all the beads on it and they pray on all the beads around the the crucifix that's basically what they're doing they're putting energy into those beads and energy into that crucifix for whatever they're praying for at the time same thing same damn thing they're putting energy into an object just like I put it into a key or you put it into a stone yeah and so that energy can then be used later when you have that on your altar you'll have these cleansed ch charged items that you can use for your ritual or your spell work but it all begins with learning to ground learning to Center and learning to manipulate and move energy through yourself or into objects or to power your spell but if you're having trouble with your spell work that's probably the missing component but then you know the equally important piece is so you raise all this energy you project it out to the universe for whatever your intent is now what now we talked last time about how I had done some ritual work and did not ground afterwards and was a Breck we need to just re reiterate the you raise energy you need to ground after like it isn't just you raise it and you put it out there and you walk away you're you're going to get a universal slap for that it's what all I can call it just like a magical hangover is that a good way to describe it like a magical hangover it's an excellent way to describe it because you you feel sick you might feel physically hung over you might have a headache you'll feel a little spacey people feel it in different ways but you definitely feel something is off in like a regular hangover the older you get the harder it hurts just saying you want to ground and Center at the beginning you want to ground and Center at the end so that you are back to an equilibrium you are back to feeling comfortable and secure in your own body and so one way to do that after you've you know visualized the grounding and centering is to eat something or to go for a short walk or something like that kiss your significant other something that gets you back into your body just even if even if it's just stand in the dirt Barefoot and just visualize all the excess energy draining down your body and right out of your feet into the Earth that just made me think of one of the other exercises that I was taught is to as you're standing there um pull the energy in up one like into your left foot and up the left side of your body and then down the right side of your body and out and see if you can visualize the energy moving through you that way as a circle and then see if you can reverse it and see where it feels sluggish where it feels strange and practice doing that to see if you can cycle energy through you that way as important it is to raise it it's equally important to then ground the ESS yep make sure that you get back into that state of equilibrium that state of balance where you don't have any extra and you don't have any less and what you do have has left you refreshed energized cleansed and stable people always say why is there always like bread and cakes it rituals here's why friends this is why there's carbs up the yingyang cakes and Ale one of my favorite parts so yeah cakes and Ale is what that part of a ritual is called particularly if you're old school or Wiccan uh you'll have cakes and Ale at the end and it's a great way like shell said to get you back into your body and we very often had a lot of grounding things maybe before spell or ritual maybe you don't want to eat things that are so heavy in the belly maybe you just want vegetables or broth or fruits or lighter things again because you don't want to be in your body so much you want to be working in the in the Ethereal in your energetic body but then when you're ready to get back into your body you need those heavy carbs give me the carbs give me the bread give me the cheeses give me all the good mac and cheese and the good food oh y actually one thing that the cuff and I'm in currently what they do is we actually have like a legit fullon dinner after ritual yes my coven here does that as well usually after ritual we will then sit down to either a partial meal or a full meal for the same reason they don't call it cakes and Ale we're just used to calling it that but Wicken DNA can't help it it is it is but it's it's a fun not only does it help you get back into your body and it's you know who doesn't love carbs but it also it's there's a social aspect of it as well so if you're lucky enough to be with other people that really helps to bring the circle together too but I also look at it is a good way to kind of know your role for lack of a better term like you know how when you go to work the minute you walk in the door at work you're now in work mode and you're in work mode until you walk out the door at five o'clock kind of the same thing when you're raising energy you're getting in a magic mode and when you're grounding the energy afterwards you're getting ready to kind of go back into mundane World it can be difficult and stressful to try to be riding both of those realities at the same time as you know it's kind of like the raising is getting you there and the grounding is getting you out yeah I love that that's a great way to look at it and if you're solo if you're a solo practitioner you can still have cakes and ale at the end you know have a snack set aside before you do your spell work you know if you're like shell and you're just whipping off a little spell off the top of your head to get a good parking spot when you're going downtown you don't necessarily need to do a fullon dance around a bonfire stomp your feet and chant for half an hour to raise the energy just to get a parking spot that's right you can just use the energy of your frustration or your anger use that energy feel it in a ball like shell said in your belly and then throw that with your spell that's what sh does when she's whipping her Bome around over her head and casting spells from the hip it you use the energy of yourself of your emotions I promise you if I have to resort to the itchy spell there ain't no formality to it that's right but if you maybe you have a bigger working maybe you're somebody who needs to curse the moon or I don't know maybe you need to move maybe you need maybe you're looking for something bigger in your life and you really need to put a lot of energy in the spell you're going to spend more time raising that energy and powering the spell it's a little spell maybe you know just a little chant or maybe just the candle that you charged on the full moon last month will be enough now I do I I put energy you know we talked about putting energy into things I actually put energy into my tarot especially if I am using that particular deck for me and me alone oh yes I was going to say that exact same thing yeah but you know when we have done tarot professionally we're really asking them to do the same thing here take my deck shuffle the cards put your energy into it and let's see where you know where do the cards fall it's really the same thing you know there ain't no formality to it we're just saying Shuffle these cards and put your energy into it that is a form of raising energy to help the cards help us to tell you what your message is exact same concept and obviously we don't ground our cards after but for for I don't know if you call it grounding I mean I cleans after exactly because you let all these people you know especially like remember when we used to go to the colleges and you know maybe do 200 reads in four hours we weren't cleansing in between people but let me tell you like I was doing some hardcore exorcisms on my tarrow after those sessions because I had like 80 people putting their energy into my deck I was cleansing between people that was one of the best practices I ever had that was like rapid fire tarot reading by the way yeah but for moving energy that that's a really good point because especially when I read for other people I start out with my cards I talk to them I give them a little charge I hand it to the person so that they can put their energy into it and then when I'm done I shuffle and cleanse the cards before I hand them to the next person and so like you said when we were doing some of these bigger um promotional things or these bigger workshops it was very fast rapid fire put energy into the cards cleanse that energy put energy into the cards cleanse that energy and you're right I didn't exactly ground my cards at the end but I would do a very heavy duty cleansing and centering of the cards themselves before I then WRA them or put them in their case yeah know I was taking them home I was you know saging them freaking  I was making special incense recipes to to cleanse them down to the The Bare Basics again like might as well have given him a bath and that's all part of the cleansing portion of this is you use that energy to cleanse yourself to get to a centered balanced State and you do use the grounding the cleansing and the centering to get there raise your energy however you're going to raise it whether it's through chanting or dance singing or sex whether you're using visualization to push that energy and to make it grow like a flower or a cone or a tornado or if you're using energized tools that you're taking the energy from that tool and then projecting it out for your use exactly and it's the same thing that we're doing with the cards you know you Center them cleanse them and then charge them so that they're ready for the next reading whether it's for yourself and I totally agree actually I charge Decks that I use for myself and personal divination differently than I cleanse and Ready Decks and I didn't think about that until just now but I totally do well I actually at the time I loved and I still love this deck actually someone asked me the other day what deck do you love the most The Witches tarot Ellen Canon Reed just saying I loved that deck so much I wanted to use it personally and publicly I ended up buying two decks because I don't like to read myself with a deck that I read for other people nobody could see me doing it but as soon as you said you were trying to use that deck personally I'm like shaking my head no when you said personally and publicly I was like no don't do that yeah no I bought the same deck so I had two of the same deck and one of them was for me and one of them was for public meetings because they're they have very different feeling it's a very different feeling and I've spoken before about my love for Phyllis kurat Deck The Witch's wisdom tarot but that's very much a personal deck right that's not something I I mean I would read you but I wouldn't really read other people with that deck that's like a you would never do a paid public reading no no no no it's too too personal much too personal but I have lots of other that I love to read other people with they're they're energized for that they have a really good feeling for that and that's something I guess that's the last part of learning to move raise and manipulate energy is learning to feel energy you know when you walk into a metaphysical shop and something catches your eye and you can just feel the energy or feel like it belongs to you or you know something like that we can't teach you what that feeling is though because it's I think it's different for everyone El for everyone you know it that's like the one piece of this that we can't tell you yeah it's that you know we kind of talked about how it feels like like that frion of energy like that excitement the butterflies the the soap bubbles between your hands or the heat the tingles on your palms you know we've talked about that type of raising energy in your body like energetic energy like when you're running or walking to work or dancing around a bonfire that energy that actual physical energy is is how it feels like but in an object it's hard to describe but you can kind of feel that same energy coming off of the object it's like emanating it almost almost like it's that objects Aura and you're feeling almost that objects Aura yeah like when um in our other podcast the stone Witches Hour we talked about cursed objects or people finding a doll or a mirror or something that just has a bad Vibe you're feeling the energy of that object like the voodoo doll on The Brady Bunch episode I don't remember that but yes exactly whatever but you can practice feeling that energy if you know if you go to an antique store you can kind of just go through and see if you can feel a Vibe or feel energy from different things but it's especially great if you have a witchy friend or an energy worker friend where you can each push energy into an object say I go over to Shell's house and she hands me a key and I can hold that key meditate with it work with the energy with it and try to feel if she has pushed energy into that key to be angry energy or happy energy or calming energy and see if I can sense that and do that back and forth and do that exercise until you can really get a distinct feel for different types of energy on objects or in places or even you might even be able to sense someone else's spell to sense words that they have put up somewhere but unless you practice it it's very difficult to notice or to describe yeah like I said there's some things that that I don't know we just can't explain and this is kind of one of them and some people are going to pick up on it very quickly and for some people it's going to take more practice don't be discouraged everyone can do this it's like baseball everyone can play baseball some are naturally good at it some need practice it's kind of like the people that they'll walk in a room and be like all right bad vibes this I I I I can't be here I need to get out because you're feeling other people's energy and it's not where you're at and you want a bolt or you walk into a room and you're like oh my God I love the energy here this is so great same thing you're just feeling others energy and if you can feel those energies those vibes in a room or a place work on that practice that try to hone that journal it you know me in journals write it down you freaking love journaling I do but write down where you were how you felt what it was what the energy was and see if you can duplicate that that and keep track of it but once you've done all the lessons on how to ground Center cleanse move and manipulate energy the last piece is to start to try and feel it and to sense it other places you know I think really kind of the moral of the story is there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle to kind of make your spell work or make your ritual work and this is one of them and it's an important big one yeah yeah you know this is definitely something that you want to work on and you can actually do this as a ritual in and of itself you know raise the energy put it out there ground it and be done and kind of make it its own ritual you know hell you could put energy out there for good weather or you know energy out there for World Peace whatever and have it be its own ritual so to say yeah that that's why I like the soap bubble or the energy ball at your core meditation or ritual or spellwork if you want to call it that but that practice that meditation the idea of raising that energy shaping it into a ball and then giving it an energy that can help you of calmness relaxation energize uh love self-love whatever energy you want and then pushing it back down over your body and then reentering is a really great it's more inward I guess and less outward so if you just keep practicing that and pay attention to your breath you know work on ground do that tree meditation that shell talked about where you put your roots down into the ground and reach your branches up to the Starlight my favorite one yeah love that you know and then you get that push and pull of that diamond energy from the center of the earth and the Starlight energy and and once you've practiced that and done that over and over and over again that's when your spell work is really going to start hitting that's when things are really going to start moving for you but it does take practice and I know we don't all love that but you know on the flip side like everything else you know do it 21 times and it's a habit you do this over and over and then it's like it's like second nature it's second hand like when I do it I don't even think about it it's just kind of a part of the process it's just second nature and we had a coven mate that when we would start talking about magical things he would say oh my hands are on because oh my God yep he could feel that energy start to build in his palms and I know I've said it to since then you know you can feel that energy you said it today what the hell are you talking about I did as soon as we started talking about this I felt it happen but just like shell said because it becomes a habit once you do it over and over again it becomes second nature and that's why we can whip off those parking spot Spells at the drop of a hat or hopefully not the itchy spell but you know if needed but you know the funny thing about that and that person was able to do that a lot better and a lot quicker at the time than I was and it annoyed me because he would just literally like a freaking light switch okay let me turn on my hands like what and it took me a lot longer than it did him to be able to be in that same place but it is kind of like a light switch you know you can kind of turn it on and then be done and ground it and turn it off he had a natural talent and so it was very easy for him to do that you worked your ass off and now you're better than him well yeah but like I said you know that type of thing is is kind of what led me down the raiki master path because it's it's the same thing you know you're mustering this energy throughout you and directing it out your hands to you know do healing work or chakra cleansing or whatever the case may be it was really it really went hand inand with raiki because it's the same type of energy manipulation so that's something that if you wanted to get a raiki certification you would definitely get a lot of practice in manipulating and mov moving energy right that's kind of the basis of what raiki is yeah and going through those attunements but if you practice these things these meditations on your own you know you don't necessarily need the raiki Attunement in order to be able to do these right just you know you certainly could a lot easier I think once you practice for me that that that type of energy work is what led me down that path once you start moving energy like that the sky's the limit you know your spells do work better your manifestations do happen faster you know it works better once you're able to push the energy into the spell to power it do you remember when uh way back when my kids were little we used to have our my kids do that have them kind of create that energy ball and play with it and and you know my kids were significantly young at the time and they were just amazed because they could feel it and they were like whoa and we'd be like it's magic it was just something fun we would do with the kids to get them to kind of visualize that energy ball MH and it's something very easy to do you know when you're sitting and meditating pay attention to your breaths work on that energy ball it's so easy to pull into your Center because that's where the butterflies sit so pull them there and it's also easy to pull in your palms you'll be surprised at how easy it is to feel that energy once you put your hands together and start squishing that squishing the invisible soap bubbles just don't throw that ball at people please yeah that's rude it is it is oh so before we end our show today I just wanted to say a very quick announcement we now
