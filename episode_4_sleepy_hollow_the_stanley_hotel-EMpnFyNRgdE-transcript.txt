and i can't remember what else and i'm like do i need a grocery list for this sometimes being over prepared can come in handy i mean look at what just happened with all those people that were stranded for like 24 hours on the interstate in virginia yeah i think we're more prepared for that in the northern northeast you know we're we're new yorkers we're ready for that [ __ ] we're going to be snowed in at any moment in the summertime so we're prepared true that true that i don't know i guess you have to be from the depths of new york to be able to a drive and be acclimate to extreme weather changes on a dime so true so true so we dropped our first episodes and even better i was looking at the different states people have been listening to us all over the country admittedly more east coast come on west coast gotta step it up here but because we know we're scarier duh that's right new york connecticut massachusetts kansas california ohio florida all over the place people have been listening to us from all over i'm super impressed that's awesome that's awesome i was expecting you know maybe fives of listeners we're at tens we're tens of listeners so i we've already exceeded my expectations shell i'm very happy we're doing well we're doing well yes we are and i'm having fun with it so what else could you ask for exactly exactly and i'm here once again hi eating my snack factory pretzel crisps i love those pretzel crisps right now i'm eating the everything ones but i found at the store the other day i found regular buffalo and everything so i restocked on a bag of each smart woman smart woman things are addictive and these everything ones you can eat them in the morning and it's like you feel like you're eating a bagel because it's everything but you're not getting all that bread of a bagel i don't know it's like just the good parts of the bagel just the good i love pretzels they're so good i had those everything bagels with some really spicy guacamole on new year's oh it was so good it was the best not a big guacamole fan avocados yeah no no what you just spoke blasphemy you know where i live right i like salsa have you ever had guacamole salsa yeah and i didn't like it really okay yeah okay i just i just don't like avocado to each their own right to each they're okay i won't even eat sushi that has avocado chunks in it oh now you're just limiting yourself that's okay when we go have sushi i'll eat those just give them to me i got you so speaking of new years happy new year happy new year this is our first episode that we are recording in the new year it is it's been a it's been crazy we're only a little ways into january and it has already been insane we've first of all we've dropped our new podcast we've gotten tens of listeners thank you by the way all of you thank you thank you love it and just everything that's going on it's just so much but what did you did you make any new year's resolutions show no why why torture myself why tell myself lies i tell myself lies come on now that's true most people actually give up their new year's resolutions right it doesn't usually like i've never met a person yet who has followed through with a new year's resolution i think i always make my new year's resolutions as vague as possible so that i can be like oh yeah i'm still following that sort of you get the people who are like i'm going to change my diet i'm going to lose weight i'm going to do this more i'm going to do this less like do you need new years to make that stuff happen if that's what you really want no so if you've been duping yourself all along you're gonna dupe yourself even if you call it a resolution very good point very good point and i think people expect too much of themselves i mean the new year is fun and all and everybody putting their intention towards that really does help make it kind of special gives it that you know that magical energy of intention because everybody's thinking about it but that's not enough to overcome a whole lifetime of habits you have to start small you can't make these huge i'm going to change everything about myself you're frustrated i think people put over expectations on to themselves that are kind of unrealistic to reach and why put that pressure on yourself like you said there's so much already in the new year you know you just gotta every day wake up and figure out what the hell can i do better oh that's a good way to look at it i like that i just want to be a little bit better today than i was yesterday even if it's in august and not january 1st you know i make resolutions on the witches new year on samhain i actually did make resolutions then i didn't make resolutions at the january new year see that's different though i try to make magical resolutions then like you know i'm going to try to put more intent into things or i'm going to try to to focus on this aspect a little more that's different than like changing my whole lifestyle and i'm going to lose 75 pounds in the next 40 days and you know i'm gonna never say a swear word ever again oh starting yeah like that would ever happen you know like like these unrealistic things i do try to to set upon myself magical expectations uh on the witch's new year yes same i i think i found that the intentions that i make on samhain are tend to be very personal and they do tend to be something that i check in with myself on my new year's resolution is to continue to eat these snack factory pretzel crisps i love these things i don't know if i'm happy or sad that you introduced me to them because i'm addicted to the same three you mentioned the buffalo the plane and the everything so good so good love them well you know how i get these weird like high thoughts oh hold on okay high thoughts from chill high thoughts from i love that this isn't like a good i don't know a brain teaser so we were talking about how we have tens of listeners hi friends we love you hi tens we love you and i was thinking about my children my adult children and how i know one of them has listened to it and thinks it's fabulous and the other one has been busy in life and hasn't had a chance to listen yet um i love them both but i love the younger one more exactly so but then i got to thinking the younger one that has listened and loves it doesn't like roller coasters but likes scary things and the one who hasn't had the time to listen yet hates scary things but loves roller coasters like this child like if you say oh you want to go to a haunted house at a carnival she will not and it's like you know this is fake these are actors and like she's petrified but yet she'll hop on a roller coaster that me in my younger child will not and him and i are the ones that would run to that haunted house so i love that is there a correlation between you like paranormally hunted ghosty things and not roller coasters versus you love roller coasters but hate everything scary oh that's a very good question i like them both i love roller coasters and i love scary things you just killed my high theory i know i'm sorry but there's maybe we need a bigger sample size we need more people maybe people should email us at the stone witch's hour at gmail.com and tell us do you like roller coasters or do you like haunted houses or do you like both it's just an interesting thing i was thinking about well hi i'm curious i'm curious to know what what the what the ratio is if there is one maybe it's just some weird correlation between my two children i just i just i don't know i find it interesting because my daughter thinks that the ghosty paranormal thing is the scary thing that'll kill her and me and my son think that it's the rollercoaster that's plunging us to our death that is going to kill us and i just love them both yeah yeah scare me the scarier the better do you remember when we were kids and all of a sudden there were like whole house haunted houses that you could go to like yeah like way before the big theme park haunted stuff all of a sudden instead of just like a little you know the local fire department would do a cute little haunted house or whatever somebody would turn a whole house into an experience and from the moment you step out of your car walking across the yard or whatever it's an experience there's actors and people yeah i went to one of those as a teenager with my boyfriend maybe 17 at the time and where he had parked you couldn't get in or out of the passenger side door it was like kind of a ditch up against a little hill so i had to slide across the bench seat and get out the driver's side door so we go through this whole haunted house and it was super scary and spooky and i kind of loved it but i was being all cool and macho you know because i'm macho i'm all cool and you know brave and like i'm not scared this is just fun and so we're coming across and we're kind of laughing and i'm continuing my cool act we get to the car and i open the driver's side door and i slide across the bench seat and i turn around to say something to my boyfriend and there's a zombie face two inches from mine in the center of the bench seat of this car i lost my [ __ ] i screamed so loud i forgot where i was i forgot who i was i just i thought i was about to die in that moment and my boyfriend i thought he was gonna pee himself on the outside of the car you know i i i think that those those types of haunted houses are few and far between but i am happy to report that i actually went to one just like that right before the pandemic started but it's it's called spooky world shout out to spooky world and i got chased across the parking lot to our vehicle by a guy with a chainsaw it was i was kind of scared oh wow that sounds very scary i love that stuff though but yeah what do you like do you like scary movies and scary haunted houses are you the first one to dress up for halloween and spook your friends and you hate roller coasters or do you love roller coasters the scarier the better the steeper the hill the bigger the loop-de-loop but you will not set foot inside a haunted house or are you weird like me and you just like everything let us know email us slide into our dms ooh that sounds kind of weird spooky slide into our dms for the spooky stuff here's the spooky details spill the spooky tee spill the spooky tee hey and then we can do tea leaf readings hey there you go see perfect it's perfect fill the spooky tee we need to talk about ghosty stuff we do let's get into some of that let's see i think we're too high that we're stuck in talking about right and what are you talking about today today i'm going to talk about sleepy hollow oh sleepy hollow sleepy hollow new york the legend of sleepy hollow sleepy hollow cemetery the whole the whole kitten caboodle was sleepy yellow nice well i'm lighting a joint i've been smoking these chillums again but what i've been doing is i've been grinding my own and packing my own chilums instead of buying them pre-packed oh that's so sustainable of you i love that that's why i had to get with the times news and grinder updated technology look at you 2022 you've got a grinder you're reusing chiloms shell you got this maybe that was my resolution was to use more sustainable methods to smoke my weed that is not a bad resolution to have and one that you know you can just keep trying to work on it's not like oh i bought some packaged weed i'm [ __ ] up for the year i'm done you just do better next time do better next time i might have to buy it shitty packaged but at least i will sustainably smoke it that's right and like you said earlier tomorrow when you wake up just be a little bit better exactly i want to talk about sleepy hollow because this is like the the og of american folklore sleepy hollow is from like i don't know like 17 1796 i believe um 1786 something in along those lines it's like a hundred years or so after the salem witch trials yeah actually about about that so the legend of sleepy hollow you know it everybody talks about it about halloween similar to the salem witch trials big halloween story i don't know i like spooky stuff all year long me too funny how this seems to only pop up around halloween like i like this stuff all the time well it's january and we're talking about it now so i don't know i guess it's like you think about santa claus and december kind of thing maybe you only think about spooky things during october i don't know fair enough i don't know um but the legend of sleepy hollow actually comes from washington irving's 1820 tale of a headless horseman who terrorizes the real life village of sleepy hollow so sleepy hollow the town is a real place it is the real place um you might have sometimes heard of it as north terryton new york oh i have heard of that kind of the same place um you know how like new york likes to rename towns sometimes to better confusing and sometimes like the official name of the town is different than what everybody calls the town exactly exactly this is one of those deals absolutely washington irving was like this author used to write books in the early 1800s but this is it's not a fictional story it was based on folklore he heard when he moved to sleepy hollow so basically he moves to sleepy hollow for i don't know i didn't check out why he moves to sleepy hollow and all the townspeople start telling him all these stories and he decides to write a book about it so that's kind of how the book came about in the legend of sleepy hollow as we know it today but there is there is some truth behind it and there's there is a story that prompted that legend and there are things that happen on occasion to this day that i thought might be interesting and fun to talk about very cool well what is the story of sleepy hollow it is a revolutionary soldier that is supposedly murdered in the vicinity of the sleepy hollow cemetery on a bridge a little you know the little bridge that crosses the creek kind of thing he was killed as almost like think of it as a prisoner of war and got his head blown off by a cannon holy [ __ ] he got his head blown off by a cannon got his head blown off bike why were they firing a cannon who the [ __ ] firing cannons just for fun is this like those people that on new year's go out and fire their guns like do people in this carry to new york just fire cannons for no reason no this was during the battle of white plains which was a battle i know white plains new york it was around 1776. i don't now a couple of stories i i looked into said that it happened around halloween of 1776 that could be the halloween association but i wasn't there i don't know what month it was kind of like ouija boards dates like halloween i think attract things or just attract our imagination pretty much pretty much so this this soldier has been decapitated by a cannonball during the battle of white plains around halloween 1776 how sad for him that's terrible yeah so he basically his spirit was pissed off and he never left and haunted that bridge in that cemetery i'd be pissed too if i lost my head to a cannonball like that's like how geez how did he see that coming you're like oh well there's no dodging that apparently not nobody said duck i mean come on apparently not and strangely enough there was actually a historical figure named ichabod crane so that was actually based on a real person oh so there's more so real town real person real town um and there actually was this soldier that was how did his head float wow okay so there's a lot of fact to back this up so you know it's actually yeah it's actually based on some revolutionary wartime facts so you know this guy washington irving comes to town hears all this and really what he wrote is kind of really what they say happen you know around the time where he got his head blown off he reappears on that bridge he will chase people folks have claimed to be chase folks have disappeared there's been in the mid to late 1800s several instances where people would go courting in the cemetery is the words they used recording do people still recording courting in this cemetery going courting in the cemetery is probably like a first date at a horror movie right i guess yeah yeah a little scare you know get a little nervous get a little close feeling close um so there there was instances reported of uh teenagers going in there to do their thang and disappearing and never being seen again do you think all these make-out spots being haunted is because they're actually haunted or it's because the grown-ups want to scare the kids away from these dark secluded places you know i think it's i think it's a mixture because if you are going to go according to a place that has paranormal activity you're asking for trouble i think so and you know a lot of this paranormal stuff happens at night in secluded dark places and where are you going to go make out at night in a secluded dark place so right i guess it's just like same location kind of thing you're bound to run into one or the other right right okay and i guess it's a 50 50 chance if you're going to disappear well you're gonna get some kids making out or you're gonna find a ghost one or the other right [Laughter] so apparently there were documented instances where people felt like they were being chased by a revolutionary soldier that was carrying his own head there were instances where people felt that he threw his head at them imagine walking through a cemetery at night now picture us a little high a little giggly walking through a cemetery in this apparition of a guy on a horse is standing in front of us and it throws its head at us like i'd [ __ ] i guess it depends on how high i am i would either alternate between oh horsey look there's a cute horsey completely ignoring the apparition while you're grabbing me by the back of my sweatshirt and pulling me away right see i guess the problem is is that most interactions with the headless horseman appear to be a spirit seeking revenge and yeah it does not sound like i would be happy with the horse for very long as it comes bearing down on me trying to kill me he feels that his head was basically unfairly taken from him well no [ __ ] it was can't fall to the head that is very unfair how do you defend against that seriously i'd want a do-over i'd be like okay hello that's i'm restarting this game because that's unfair so i don't blame the guy so the horseman it's almost like he's still seeking answers and retribution can't rest you know the whole haunted ghost thing but i was digging and as recently as 2008 someone had a sighting of the headless horseman right outside the sleepy hollow cemetery wait 2017 was one two five years ago four years ago 2017 was five years ago shel yeah so where are the scam near the cemetery in the bridge same place same place it's always been seen so somebody went down to the cemetery and they saw the headless horseman on his horse right near that bridge and felt like they could feel the breath from the horse oh wow unfortunately the person who had that encounter has since passed away oh [ __ ] did the ghost get them like what did they die on no it didn't really say um i don't know if there was anything spectacular behind that person's death but they are ultimately my point about that was that it's not someone that can kind of publish more experiences or stories or be investigated or interviewed or anything of that nature right there's a lot more to sleepy hollow than the headless horseman really like that's all you ever hear about sleepy hollow headless horseman there's more there's more because actually like the whole i i've come to find out which is kind of cool like the whole town is seems to be haunted really there's a a instance of a girl about six or seven years old that lived around 1916 that is around the sleepy hollow cemetery as well she's crying they all you always hear a woman crying and a child crying the girl it's almost like the girl is looking for her mother people can hear a woman kind of crying in one direction but yet the six or seven year old girl seems to be in a different direction almost like they're seeking each other out but can't find each other wow does anyone know their history that sounds i mean as a mom that scares the [ __ ] out of me does any has any psychic or anyone tried to like find out not that i have found but there is a statue of a woman that is seated and it's described as twice life size i'm telling you when you come to new york we need to go to sleepy hollow yeah yeah we're going so there's like double life-size statue of a seated woman and the weeping girl her ghost always seems to climb into that statue's lap and the the statue seems to be crying multiple people have experienced this the folklore goes if you look at the statue if you crawl into her lap you will be forever looked after if you look at her and don't crawl into her lap you will be cursed so if you look at this statue you have to like get up in its lap or you're in trouble apparently and i'm sitting in that lady's lap a woman's family heard this through 10 generations of her family the story had been passed on passed on and her and her friend went to this cemetery and sometime in the early 70s teenagers going to check it out have a little fun they decided that they were going to go to this i guess it's like a bronze kind of statue and they both went up to the statue and were obviously scared you know you freak yourself out anxiety the one girl just looked at the statue and kind of touched it and then ran away and the other girl actually did crawl up into its lap when she was there by herself oh [ __ ] shortly after oh [ __ ] the girl who did not crawl up into its lap was hit by a car oh [ __ ] yeah and that was in like the 70s how's the other kid doing absolutely fine wow wow so there's there's a superstition about this particular statue in the cemetery which yes it's still the same cemetery but it is separate and apart from the legend of the headless horseman got its own legend right there are actually a lot of famous people um in this cemetery william carnegie was one of them there was a couple other it's definitely old and kind of creepy it's got its own life to it above and beyond the the headless horseman there was another part now this is where i have to laugh you know i kind of joked before that everything goes back to a ouija board well in this instance everything goes back to witches it's the witch's fault they actually used to accuse people of being witches because of some of the spooktacular things that were happening there in 1770 there was a a story a legend of someone called hulda the witch um she was supposed to be some german witch person probably just a medicine woman or a healer that was wrongly named they actually hold a festival now in her honor but they thought that at some points she was like summoning evil spirits to kind of haunt the town there was some accusations of witchcraft yeah probably because she washed her hands before she midwifed somebody ooh evil yeah right but you know luckily like i said this was around 1710 or so 1720 so at that point the witch craze had kind of simmered down and although they called her a witch she was never persecuted or you know anything in that way one more cool one uh is called spook rock it's sometimes referred to as raven rock or spook rock and this is actually on a different side of town than the cemetery but it's still in the same still in sleepy hollow and it's supposedly haunted by a native american girl who is roaming the land um laminating her death lamenting her death laminating is covering in plastic lamenting i'm stoned i'm so stoned i just smoked a whole joint that fire og straight to the head and i i'm surprised i caught the laminating at least you know what i was talking about see so this native american girl walks around lamenting her death like how did she die again a colonial girl stole her man she got into a kind of uh jumping to her death situation to she was pushed to the brink she was pushed to the brink and her soul kind of roams the land at this place called spook rock so she committed suicide she jumped to her death and spook rock over a man [ __ ] broken-hearted yeah broken-hearted girl there are better guys out there what's worse is there was a baby whose baby her baby that she left behind no was it hers and the cheating dudes it was hers and the cheating dudes oh and that that baby died of starvation oh so she committed oh so it was like a that's so sad so she is angry and she cannot cross over and she can be heard crying all night on the riverbank she can be seen kind of in a native american type outfit walking along the river up and down the riverbank generally if approached by a female she's just weepy and sobby but has been known to attack males that her spirit has encountered men have felt being choked they have felt being strangled like they're losing their breath losing air can't breathe um type of attacks she's she's angry and she's hurt and she's still there wow that's that's sad you gotta figure you know the legend of sleepy hollow the headless horseman that's a great story you know but when you're talking about a town in america that's been around since the early 60s or the early 1700s there is bound to be a lot of death a lot of heartache a lot of a lot of ghosty paranormal stuff just based on the history of what's happened on that land well we're a baby country in a lot of ways that we haven't been around for very long and however the oldest the oldest colonial settlements are in the northeast in places like massachusetts and so like you said they're bound to have a history of of death and torment and right and then you figure you figure you know what the colonial folks did in terms of commandeering land from native americans a lot of blood loss a lot of blood lost in the northeast and a lot of a lot of sad spirits up in this neck of the woods yeah that makes a lot of sense sleepy hollow has a lot of haunted histories that that run deep and are very relevant to this day as far as experiences and sightings and things of that nature that don't necessarily have to do with the headless horseman i honestly think with sleepy hollow in particular i just think it is so much for so many years i don't necessarily think it's has any attractant or you know any sort of portal type things going on i think it's just a place that has a long kind of shitty history at some points a lot of heartache just some people that are stuck that just can't leave i just think it's just an old town not necessarily an attractant but an old town you know an old town with a lot of sad history sleepy hollow as a whole if you are looking for ghosty paranormally experiences i think it's a a must-go-to so so what is it that you're smoking today you seem to be puffing on a cutie little pipe love when you smoke a pipe i am smoking a cutie little pipe this is one that my husband got me because he knows i like cutie little things it's gonna love it little lizard you see my little froggy lizard guy that is cute i like your little lizard looks like a little it looks like a lizard on a birch tree yeah i was a an artist that we saw back before the pandemic we used to go to a lot of the um a lot of the cannabis festivals in california we'd drive around because you know being from a prohibition state it was really nice to come out here and not only have pot shops that we could go to but we could go to marijuana festivals and just walk right in high times festivals everybody had a festival and there was a nice girl with sitting there with some glass that she had flown and this was one of the pipes very cool yes tonight i'm smoking some fire og fire og kush what's in your pipe tonight banana punch now very good like the high does not taste like neither banana or punch i had the greatest experience the other day at my local marijuana shop oh good experiences at pot shops do tell do you tell you know you're you're in a state that has kind of pioneered a lot of this stuff whereas i'm in a state that it's a little newer so i go in and they're like oh do you want to go to our bud bar and i'm like what is a bug bar you know me i'm just like just give me the weed come on people so i go over to this bug bar and what it is so previously you would go in you'd look at a menu and you know just like a restaurant and you'd pick something and they'd go get this pre-packaged amount um you could either get you know like a a half gram or gram pre-roll an eighth a half you know there was set amounts you could get so i go over to this bud bar brand new they have like big jars all along the wall like not mason jars but think mason jars like those cheese puff containers you know the ones that come in that big plastic container the round cheeks and like glass glass yeah i'm like hey wow so they don't have a menu they just have all the jars labeled and what this sheet is that they give you it gives you like every single measured increment you could think of so you could go in there and be like hey i got 26.34 can you give me 26.34 of banana punch and they will with these little tweezers go into this jar and weigh out 26 and 34 cents worth i was just i i don't know i was taken aback i was like this is so great how old school am i where i was so like flabbergasted that you could just go in there in any amount you wanted or any dollar amount you wanted so i'm like you know oh like give me an eighth of this so you know i still got the same amounts that i got normally even in the prepackaged stuff but you could literally go in there and say i've got 12.72 and they will give you 12.72 worth i love it i love that and it's funny that they're coming up with that now in massachusetts where it went the opposite of that here when we moved here it was still only medically legal everything was in jars like that not a lot of it was pre-packaged in these little a plastic jar that's been shrink wrapped inside cardboard inside more shrink wrap there were very few that were like that most stuff was in the jars and they would just weigh out however much you wanted which i i enjoyed it was much more similar to what you and i are used to where you just be like i want an ounce or two ounces or a half or whatever um and you would just get it in a baggie and you were happy now you have to have an engineering degree just to get it out of the packaging yes and then shortly after it became legal here they started to move away from having it in the big jars and into it had to be in individually wrapped packages and i loathe that i hate it with the burning passion of a thousand fiery suns see that's what i was used to so because that's how it started here in massachusetts i think we're in our third going in our third year of legalization if i'm not mistaken this is just this is the first time i've seen this and and we're going on i believe year three of legalization here i think that's the right direction i think massachusetts is going in the correct direction i think all the packaging is horrible sometimes i'll go get pre-rolls i can either get three or five in a package now each pre-roll is individually packaged in a like hard plastic container the shape of the pre-roll and then that is in like a hard hard cardboard box with all these plastic mechanisms to avoid children from getting into them so when you take the pre-rolls out and just pile up the garbage you got a stack of garbage this big this wide for you know five little pre-rolls i understand the theory behind keeping it out of the hands of people who shouldn't have it but for god's sakes you're killing the environment that is a lot of garbage the sheer amount of packaging garbage and most of it is the non-recyclable type of plastic and the non-recyclable type of cardboard especially with so many hemp products available hemp paper hemp cardboard hemp plastics even that are super recyclable i just think it's a shame one option also is like these thick heavy glass jars they are recyclable but that's a lot of glass for a little amount of weed it is a lot of glass and the other thing too is just put it in a [ __ ] baggie get some hemp plastic baggies and just put it in a [ __ ] baggie or if you go back to the same dispensary all the time or you have the same delivery place reuse it like how hard would it be for me to hand my delivery guy the container i just emptied as he's handing me a new full one and then i'll put it that way i kind of rotate around between maybe four or five different different dispensaries different stores and they should all have a recycle bin right out front where you can drop off used packaging just this one and like i said this is the first time i've seen it just this one has that bud bar option um so it's not even like every place has that option you know if i went in there with that same container kind of thing honestly i say vote with your dollars go to that place more often you wanna you wanna hear an irony about that particular store yes that is the one that is owned and operated by sheamus cousin and they also promote as a veteran run and veteran employer business well good for them kudos for them shout out what's their name cna all right cna shout out to you guys you're doing it right two locations amesbury and haverhill just saying and these buds can i just talk about the buds i got please do tell me so they were like that light light green super compact i actually had to get a little hip with the times and break out my grinder oh yes because a grinder is cutting edge technology for me it is for me it is so i broke out the grinder for this stuff but it is like that pale green beautiful white crystally like i could see why it maybe okay so maybe the banana name came maybe it kind of could look like a banana maybe the buds surely doesn't taste like one but i could see how maybe if you're high the bud could look like a banana so what do you what do you think you're gonna what do you think you're gonna put out there tonight tonight i'm going to take us to colorado to a grand old old all right i'm lighting a joint to a grand old hotel there was actually the inspiration for a movie ooh what movie the shining no [ __ ] no [ __ ] now i don't know about you this is considered one of the scariest movies of all time even though the author of the book stephen king that the movie is based on hates the movie he did not like it i thought most of his movies were based out of maine a lot of them are this one is based out of colorado as i try to light my joint so back in the 70s stephen king and his wife tabitha were traveling in colorado it was like 1974. it was snowing in colorado which honestly could be soccer right summertime but this was late fall early winter and when they got to the stanley hotel it was actually the last night they were in operation before it was being closed down for the winter season because it didn't have any heat in the hotel ouch their credit card machines weren't working because again it was the last night and everything was being shut down and was very late at night when he and his wife tabitha had gotten there luckily stephen king had cash and enough cash to cover a night the only room they had available was suite 217 which was the presidential suite at the time because it was the only one that had sheets still on the bed not like the dude couldn't afford it let's be honest so the author and his wife are wandering through this hotel no other guests in this enormous hotel hey guess how many rooms this hotel has shell how many 420 really i'm not even joking that's awesome so 420 rooms so 420 rooms amongst ballrooms and other types of rooms music rooms and so they're wandering around this deserted hotel with only a few a few very busy quiet employees kind of vertically scuttling around when they ate dinner they were the only people in the enormous dining hall and all of the other tables had the chairs up on top of the tables you know kind of like you're getting ready to go home after school where was everybody else it was the last day was that it was the night that they were closing up before the whole entire hotel was going to be closed for the winter season so they're the only ones in the in the dining room and hardly anyone else is there and after dinner his wife went up to their room because it was just a little too creepy for her and stephen king decided to kind of wander around a little bit more and he came upon a bar and he says that there was a bartender there and but because they had closed everything up the bartender refused to take any money saying that all the registers had been closed out for the season and so allowed him to drink for free and that's very nice yeah who doesn't love some free whiskey he says it was very eerie and he thought maybe he had imagined the bartender because no one was there when he went back later and he hears some music in the ballroom but there's nobody there and all the electricity seemed to be off but he would occasionally hear notes of music playing and he found himself up on the fourth floor on the fourth floor he saw two children not twins but two children wandering around and he went down and found someone at the front desk and asked them about the children up on the fourth floor a person at the front desk told stephen king that there were no children staying at the hotel that mr king and his wife were the only guests and that none of the employees had children there insisted that mr king must be mistaken so after he finishes wandering around he ends up back in his room a little disturbed he says the the hallways were very eerie and they made him feel uncomfortable and he went to sleep in room 217 and had a nightmare and in this nightmare he saw his three-year-old son running through the halls of the hotel terrified for his life as if something evil was chasing him and as his son ran through these hallways stephen couldn't get to him and he heard his son let out a blood curdling scream and that's what woke him up out of this nightmare in a cold sweat he got up out of bed and went up went out onto the balcony and as he was smoking a cigarette recalling that dream and his eerie experiences in the hotel that day that's when the entire that's when the entire manuscript that's when the entire novel the shining came to him oh wow so this was like the real stephen king based on a real story that he really had in his life this is yes absolutely 100 true this is based on stephen king he stayed in room 217. no [ __ ] i didn't know that i didn't know that yes this is an actual place now a lot of what happened in the book he did take liberties with some things but there's no denying that the stanley hotel is extremely haunted oh my god can you stay there you can you can even stay in room 217 there is a wait list to stay there because it is considered one of the more haunted rooms of the hotel stephen king is not the only famous person to have stayed in that room whose else has stayed there jim carrey that guy's kind of nutty i love him i love that guy too during the filming of dumb and dumber they filled some filmed some scenes in the stanley hotel oh i didn't realize that yes like i believe in the bar and there's a couple other locations there so during filming jim carrey requested to stay in room 217 knowing the history behind it however he didn't last the night no [ __ ] really yeah i think that he seems like the type of guy that would muscle through it you'd think what happened was apparently three hours after checking into room 217 a nervous mr carrie shows up at the front desk and asks if there are any available rooms and when he finds out that the hotel is sold out he left and went to another hotel rather than go back into the room reportedly on the next day of filming he refused to enter the hotel except when it was absolutely necessary to film the scene and left immediately after and did not go back into the hotel at all during filming what happened tell me what happened he has been asked about it several times and he refuses to speak on it and has even gone so far as to walk out of an interview when asked what happened in room 217. no [ __ ] no [ __ ] makes me want to watch dumb and dumber so here's the fun thing about the stanley hotel there's no ouija board there's no demons there's no there's no witches there's no murder there's no satanism there's no there's no connection to the underworld as a matter of fact it's actually a very happy place and no more people have died there than have died in pretty much any other hotel then what what the stanley hotel was built in 1909 by f.o stanley which is like a weird name right freelan oscar stanley he was an american inventor entrepreneur so you know all good things that we love as americans right and have you ever heard of the stanley steemer that ring anybody yeah yeah yeah he he invented the train car the stanley steemer that was like faster than any other train car at the time so he was like a multi-millionaire but he was dying of tuberculosis so his doctor's like hey dude you've got six months to live all i can tell you is try to get some fresh air maybe that'll help so he went out to colorado to live in the mountains and die there his doctor even made plans to come get his body six months later to bury him back east so he goes to estes park colorado and he doesn't die as a matter of fact he gets super healthy and takes hikes and he loves it man lived till he was 91. oh wow wow so he was cured in the mountains of colorado and he decided everybody all his fancy friends needed to go there but it was a little too provincial so he just he was going to build something that rich people would want to come to in estes park so he builds this huge hotel only it wasn't a hotel was the time was only invite only it was finished in 1909 and in 1911 there was a power outage and one of the maids mrs wilson went into room 217 which was a suite at the time to light the candles and lamps unbeknownst to her does anyone even say unbeknownst sometimes i don't know maybe unfortunately for her there had been a gas leak and as soon as she went to light the lamps an explosion occurred that destroyed 10 percent of the hotel the explosion was so bad it knocked mrs wilson through the floor and down into the first floor of the hotel but miraculously she only broke both her ankles she survived ouch no one was killed they gave her her they gave her her job for life and she reportedly worked there until she passed away and her ghost haunts room 217. however what she does there is she puts people's luggage there she puts people's clothes away she unpacks their luggage there's reports of her straightening their shoes she's like a nice ghost she's like almost like a living maid right so it's room 217 which i guess is room 237. in the movie because stanley kubrick thought that nobody would want to stay in a haunted room yeah people do but people do so yeah so she died in room well she didn't die in the room 270 but she died and still haunts from 217 but she only does nice things wow so the concert hall is another very haunted area and it's haunted by flora stanley which was efo stanley's wife at the time and she can often be heard playing the piano she loved being in the concert hall when she was alive she didn't die there but in death she stays there quite a bit another ghost that's there is paul and he was the handyman for the stanley up until his death and he did die on the job in 2005 of a heart attack one of his duties was telling people that the that it was curfew time the 11 pm curfew and actually you can hear him say get out no [ __ ] can you really yeah people have recordings they have those um evp electronic voice phenomena right recordings of him saying get out to people in the ballroom and that's a very common thing oh wow oh wow yeah another ghost that wanders around the hall this one i've heard two different backstories for is lucy and everyone agrees that she's a young woman and she want by one account she was a young girl by another account she was she was a homeless woman who was staying in the boiler room or in the basement of the hotel or she was a young child that had wandered into the basement of the hotel and when the staff threw her out she froze to death outside and it said that her ghost still haunts and goes around in the uh the concert hall there's even pictures of her online you can see pictures of many of the ghosts of the stanley hotel what i thought was the most haunted however if we go when we go to the stadium rather than wait in line to stay in room 217 which is booked months in advance i would much rather stay on floor number four what's floor number four 4-4 used to be the attic where the nannies would stay and the children and a lot of the maids and their children would stay it's been separated into rooms and that's the area where from what i could find most people experience hauntings they hear footsteps above them even though the roof is slanted and you can't walk on it there they'll hear nannies telling children to be quiet or to get in line they'll hear children giggling and laughing or calling out names i i was watching a video of people that were doing an investigation and they were speaking to some of the staff and when they asked us one of the women on the staff if she had ever experienced anything she said she had always on floor four that she wasn't afraid of any of the areas in the hotel that were reported to be haunted but she always experienced something herself when she went to floor four oh wow one of the rules that i found for the staff is it is a fireable offense if any of the staff fake anything or hoax any type of paranormal or ghost events at the hotel it's pretty sad that they have to actually put that in writing with their staff members well it's kind of interesting to me that that's kind of a protection if you see or hear something unusual you know it's not because the staff did it right but on the fourth floor there's several rooms i won't do them individually but there's like room 401 407 413 i mean it could go on but there's a lot of children up there and there's there's experiences where kids staying in these rooms like this one little boy staying in one of the rooms which kept kicking his covers off and a little boy ghost would tuck him back in one of the other rooms is particularly haunted by children and they'll move objects around the room you know you'll set your brush down and it'll it'll be on the opposite table the next time you look wonder why so many kids are there it's a good question and again one of the theories is that even though not a lot of people passed away there it was a sight of a lot of happiness it it healed that man of tuberculosis who built it and a lot of people had found a lot of joy there so one theory is that there are caves underneath the stanley hotel they're used for storage they're used for travel back and forth between things and it's known that these caves are consist mostly of limestone and courts and so there is a theory that something in the stone something in the courts there possibly creates a vortex there's a staircase that people call the vortex and it's it's a lot of sensitive say that it's a highway for spirits to go through there so it's thought that maybe a combination of of the type of stone underneath or something to do with the area i believe there's a a holy site for native americans that's nearby so wow yeah so it's considered that it might be a waypoint of sorts and so happy people are there so children who had a good time you know who enjoyed their lives there there with their nannies or or with their mother who was a servant there may have had a very good time and so their soul went back there so kind of that the exact opposite of sleepy hollow basically the exact opposite one of the ghosts that people can't find a history for but is a common theme is the cowboy again on the fourth floor in a particular room the cowboy will appear but usually to women he likes to kiss women or he'll run his hand up up their back or on their head yeah he's a he's a pervert he is however he's a polite pervert i guess one couple asked him to leave and he disappeared and didn't come back the cowboy often people will describe him as appearing at the corner of their bed or pacing back and forth at the end of their bed so no one knows what his story is but he's been reported by so many people so many various people in that same room there's no reports of any cowboy ever dying or any cowboy in particular ever having been there but yeah but if it's kind of considered like a like a spirit super highway rest stop you don't know who you're gonna get from where or for how long that's that's exactly right there's even one of the ghosts the person who originally owned the land was an irishman uh lord dun raven and he sold the land that the stanley hozel resides on to f.o stanley he also did not die there but there's an irishman in room 407 and dressed in old clothes that people are pretty sure has to be lord dunraven so something about this site just keeps attracting ghosts to it makes me want to go there you know how you get those little cards like you can write about your stay but one of the hotel managers said that one in four of their response either through cards or some other way one in four people reported some type of unexplained event happening while they were there doors opening and closing things not being where they put them their luggage being unpacked for them in room 217 mrs wilson doesn't like unmarried couples unmarried couples have often reported a cold presence between them in bed wow yeah people they they see shadows going from one wall to another they'll hear things they especially children and giggling especially on the fourth floor so it's just a lot of it's a lot of fun it's interesting that this is a place where not a lot of bad things happen but a lot of spiritual things happen and continue to happen well i am planning to go to this location you and i me too it's a date we're gonna have well we'll have to do a live broadcast and see what we can find because this sounds like fun
