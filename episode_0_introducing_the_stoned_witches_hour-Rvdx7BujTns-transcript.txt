here to get high and spooked [Chelle] hey I'm Chelle [Laylla] and I'm Laylla [Chelle] and we're here to get high and spooked [Laylla] and I still don't know 
what I'm going to say here. *laughs*   we're going to bring you stories every 
week from the east coast and the west coast   the creepiest scariest most mysterious weirdest 
things that we can find we are going to   smoke our faces off and 
try to creep each other out [Chelle] I'm east coast [Laylla] and I'm west coast [Chelle] we're also going to talk 
about what we're smoking over here [Laylla] oh absolutely and I am definitely 
enjoying myself right at the moment   smoking a little bit of Bruce 
Banner got me a little forgetful [Chelle] see i've got this ecto cooler 
but i think in the spirit of our show   tonight it's going to be called east coast ecto [Laylla] *laughs* I kind of like 
how we both went with like green   superhero type things. you've got the ecto 
green ghost and i've got bruce banner who [Chelle] like like the incredible hulk man [Laylla] right absolutely so both of them are like 
green superheroes in their own way or i like it [Chelle] basically a little bit about us is 
we've we've been friends for ever like 25 years [Laylla] yeah yeah definitely a little 
more than that and i we have been   smoking since the day i met you [Chelle] i know and being spooky [Laylla] and being spooky i think we have told 
more scary stories at night over a bowl than [Chelle] and gone to more scary 
places and done scary shit. High. [Laylla] Some of the ghost investigations 
that we have done.. Remember   back in the 90s when we were doing 
speaking engagements on Tarot,   witchcraft, paganism as a spiritual practice, 
paranormal, that type of thing, and we, after   one of those events… i think it was at a college 
i won't name it but a college in upstate new york   and we met a young woman and she told us 
how her house was haunted and was like [Chelle] yes [Laylla] you're, you know 
who I'm talking about right? [Chelle] yes yes yes yes yes [Laylla] house was crazy haunted she was 
having all these problems she wanted to know   if we could come and help her out. 
and so we went and we did some *falsetto* exercise the demons [Laylla] right and we did a cleansing and 
to be honest that one turned out to have   like a very actually mild ghost 
presence and most of it was her. [Chelle] yeah [Laylla] like most of it was like her 
kind of emotional issues and sometimes   that's kind of what's behind a lot of this 
we're not really going to focus on that but   we're going to focus on stories 
of hauntings try and tell people   like what's behind that and tell 
people i guess the facts that we can  find out are there stories who's 
told the stories where's the   where's the articles on it? you know like was 
there a movie you're doing one that a movie   was based on it so we're going to try and focus 
more on trueish tales of creepy american stories [Chelle] there's a piece to my story where and 
especially back in the early 1900s they addressed   the fact that a lot of folks that believed in 
paranormal experiences and things like that   and they'd get essentially institutionalized for 
saying that they had this experience or saw this   apparition or what have you and one of the things 
i found was that they specifically said as mental   health services became more of a thing there 
actually were less exorcisms in the united states [Laylla] well yeah in some 
of the stories that you find   there's clearly a mental illness 
component you know there's [Chelle] right [Laylla] and that might be 
a creepy story that we tell   we like hey this is a super creepy story that we 
tell. And we’re like hey this is a super creepy   story, and it was perpetrated by a super creepy 
person, but there's no paranormal thing here. [Chelle] right [Laylla] it sounds like it but some 
of these paranormal stories you and i [Chelle] are legit [Laylla] there's no explaining 
it we're not exactly sure   how it happened or why it happened but 
so many different people from different   walks of life have experienced 
the same thing in the same places [Chelle] Right [Laylla] and and we want to talk about that. 
we've had weird experiences in weird places [Chelle] Right [Laylla] from the house my father's house that 
has a whole history from multiple families   and multiple family members of mine to your 
personal experiences with supernatural that   can't be explained i mean there's a lot out 
there and it's pretty interesting and so yeah   some of the stuff that we're going to find 
is clearly going to be sounds spooky and   paranormal and really isn't and some of it's 
going to be truly unexplained and we don't know [Chelle] right [Laylla] What the fuck that is. [Chelle] what the fuuuck, pass the bong! [Laylla] *laughing* exactly! and that's what we're 
gonna be like i am not high enough to hear that   story because it's creeping me out I'm getting 
chills and i need to turn on a few more lights.   some of the things we've seen have been absolutely [Chelle] sometimes i think that if we weren't high   we might have been way more 
scared than we probably were [Laylla] oh oh 100 i would totally 
have been terrified and you would   not have gotten me to go to those 
places if i had not been that high [Chelle] Exactly, exactly [Laylla] so i don't know if that's a good 
thing or a bad thing but it's definitely   helped get us into more interesting escapades. and 
i swear i walk into some situations and I'm like   oh my god oh my god and you're 
like Laylla smoke this bowl   and fucking woman up. you 
got it. and if it wasn't okay [Chelle] just fucking smoke it. how bad can 
it be, just take a hit and it'll all be good [Laylla] it'll be fine and then 
laugh at me when I'm an idiot. So. [Chelle] we figured we uh would 
would just kind of share our stories   share our high high giggles and and and talk 
about the things that make us go ooooooohhh [Laylla] oh absolutely and now that I'm 
living west of the mississippi I'm finding   so many scary places so many scary stories 
out here things that go bump in the night um   i didn't think it was going to be as interesting 
as the east coast but it certainly is i think [Chelle] there's a lot here there's a lot 
east of the east of the mississippi like a lot [Laylla] I'm surprised i was i was blown 
away when i started looking america is just   we're creepy
we're just creepy people [Chelle] Spooky [Laylla] yeah why we're spooky   we have superstitions and weird creatures so so 
tell me like what are some of the things that   uh that you found what are some of 
the things we can look forward to [Chelle] some of the things I'm going to 
be talking about you know neither of us   are are in the location that we had spent 
a long long long time being friends at [Laylla] That’s true! we're both 
freaking transplants you live in   a totally different area and i live in a 
completely different area than when we were [Chelle] you live on a totally different 
coast what are you talking about [Laylla] that's right *laughing* 
completely opposite coast [Chelle] i really wanted to 
take it back to the beginning   take it back to our roots and I'm starting out 
with a couple of places in rural upstate new york [Laylla] mmm all right [Chelle] so forest park 
cemetery near troy new york [Laylla] oh i've heard of that [Chelle] you have heard of it i don't know 
if you know much about it but we're gonna   we're gonna spend an episode 
talking about forest cemetery park [Laylla] i need to get more high hold on 
*lighter & bubbles* the only things i've   heard about that place are super creepy i don't 
know a lot but just some creepy shit so that's [Chelle]oh it's getting better so then we're 
gonna go to another part of new york state   rolling hills asylum [Laylla] i've never heard of that but if it 
has the word asylum in it I'm already scared [Chelle] you're in you're in [Laylla] I'm so scared I'm ready to hear it [Chelle] i don't i don't care what west of the 
mississippi has this is one you can't trump [Laylla] oh we can absolutely beat you i know 
we can you keep going we've got the best,   i mean we have roswell out here come on [Chelle] another new york staple 
the amityville horror house [Laylla] that's a good one oh my goodness we were   raised on that. it's like the 
mother's milk of horror stories [Chelle] oh no no we're going up a notch again [Laylla] Really [Chelle] we're we're gonna 
stop in sleepy hollow cemetery [Laylla] Ah! sleepy hollow no shit! no shit!   that's like the og of scary stories. is that like 
one of the oldest american horror stories ever? [Chelle] new york [Laylla] yeah yeah so you 
can't really beat new york [Chelle] now we're gonna broaden out a little 
more in in the northeast and we're gonna talk   about the lizzie borden house
 
[Laylla] oh my god [Chelle]come on you [Laylla] Lizzie Borden took an axe [Chelle] yeah yeah [Laylla] did you skip rope 
to that when you were a kid [Chelle] yeah [Laylla] Yeah me too, are we like twisted? [Chelle] yeah i mean but i didn't 
realize what the story was until i   was older and then I'm like oh my god 
why did adults let me talk about that [Laylla] right what is wrong with children 
they're so creepy okay go on, that's a good one. [Chelle] trans allegheny 
lunatic asylum in pennsylvania [Laylla] again i have not heard it but 
you said *whispers* that asylum word [Chelle]i said that asylum word [Laylla] creepy shit [Chelle] and then i have to do it it's it's 
definite it's a definite staple in the east coast [Laylla] all right tell me one more [Chelle] we're going to salem [Laylla] no! Yes, the Witch capital of the world! [Chelle] and there'll be places 
we'll talk about in salem   so we're definitely going 
to do an episode on salem [Laylla] fantastic [Chelle] east coast has gettysburg man [Laylla] they do. you have all 
the battle sites those are crazy   actually there's some battle sites 
out here that are super super haunted [Chelle] you got the alamo [Laylla] oh yeah there's definitely the alamo   that's the first one that 
comes to everybody's mind [Chelle] pennsylvania coal mines those places 
are creepy. You ever been to the coal mines? [Laylla] Creepy as hell. Isn't there 
something that's still burning out there? [Chelle] yeah [Laylla] Those places are probably like   full of ghosts. Like full. why 
would you even go in a coal mine [Chelle] ya know [Laylla] It’s just scary [Chelle] my father always took us to the 
coal mines it was such a creepy thing [Laylla] why would he do 
that? *laughing* that's bad [Chelle] it's a tourist attraction [Laylla] you're kidding me [Chelle] unfortunately no [Laylla] there's a coal mine 
that's a tourist attraction [Chelle] like when i was a kid i got a certificate   from the place that like i went through 
the coal mine like it's a tourist trap [Laylla] you are such a nerd. 
We’ll talk about that later  but you know we've got some of that out here 
we even have shanghai tunnels up in oregon  yeah it sounds like exotic 
right? right they were used as, [Chelle] It does. [Laylla] it does! all sorts 
of smuggling and piracy and   murder and and creepy stuff like that. 
so we definitely, we have Alcatraz [Chelle] i got a more supernaturally thing, um [Laylla] ooh what have you got? [Chelle] jersey devil [Laylla] the jersey devil? you 
mentioned that to me and i was   super intrigued tell me about the jersey devil [Chelle] i can't believe you don't 
know what the jersey devil is [Laylla] I, i've never heard of 
it until you said it the other day [Chelle] think of like new jersey's 
version of bigfoot but like meaner [Laylla] We have like the chupacabra out here [Chelle] kind of like that but this is 
like apparently confined to new jersey [Laylla] I gotcha, I gotcha, okay [Chelle] to the point we'll go like weird 
nerd hockey fan info on you for a second   um the new jersey nhl hockey 
team is the new jersey devils   like this whole devil thing 
is a big thing in new jersey [Laylla] It’s a THING in New Jersey. 
You know what's interesting to me,   one of the things that i ran into when i 
was researching topics was how much is,   you know, americana is woven into these 
stories. like how many of them seem to crop   up; like my first story that i am absolutely 
going to make you keep the lights on when   you go to bed when i tell you this story in 
our first episode but you know these ghost   stories these these different like the new 
jersey devil you know there's bigfoot there's   the wendigo there's the chupacabra similar 
types of stories pop up all over the country [Chelle] yeah [Laylla] you know and it's just amazing to me how 
it gets woven in and the story that I'm going to   again absolutely scare you 
way more than you scare me   when i tell you is you'll find 
similar stories in other places   but this one has kind of proof that maybe 
it started there so but it's interesting [Chelle] i think that the final thing on my 
short list to uh start off with you're gonna   be jealous and i have good reasoning for being 
able to steal this story as an east coaster [Laylla] okay let's see [Chelle] i am actually going to uh separate from 
talking about salem we'll do an episode on salem okay but then we are going to do a a 
separate chat about ouija boards which [Laylla] hey [Chelle] yeah [Laylla] how do you get ouija boards [Chelle] because they were 
originated in salem massachusetts [Laylla] oh. well yeah [Chelle] yeah bummer *cackles* [Laylla] yeah all right all right you got me there   i'll give you that one i'll give you 
better i get aliens though i get aliens [Chelle] you get aliens yeah you get aliens [Laylla] and i have roswell i 
have area 51 so i get aliens then [Chelle] wait can we get david 
duchovny as like a a guest on here [Laylla] he's still kind of hot. we 
probably could. wow i didn't think of that!   David Duchovny, if you're listening, you 
have an open spot on our show anytime [Chelle] anytime anytime [Laylla] all right the truth is out there [Chelle] so what it so what are some things that 
that you think you're you you you think are going   to be spooktacular and scare me out of my wits 
from the west coast? what you got what you got? [Laylla] well besides the ones that i already 
mentioned we absolutely are going to go   to the have you heard of the most haunted 
ship in the entire us? the queen mary? [Chelle] you were telling me about it oh 
my gosh but isn't it like a british ship [Laylla] is it a british ship holy shit hold on i   need to know a little more about 
this before we talk about it so [Chelle] happens when you're high [Laylla] i know it has it's in long beach let's 
see the rms queen mary served as a luxury ocean   liner from 1936 to 1967 and during that 
time it was the site of at least one murder. [Chelle] dun dun duuuuun! [Laylla] right?!? People have been crushed 
to death children have drowned there it was a   convalescent ship at one point. So many people 
have died there. It was turned into a hotel   and it now sits docked in long beach. 
so that is actually some place that   i can go to maybe we can go to and visit 
but there's so many hauntings there [Chelle] oh my god i would love to do that [Laylla] right they have a ghost tour 
so we're definitely going to do that   but there are so many sightings and stories 
there's also the winchester mystery house [Chelle] i've heard of that!! [Laylla] Yes! You actually told me about 
that a million years ago it was some place   that you said you'd always wanted to 
go so when i knew i lived kind of close [Chelle] stairways to nowhere! [Laylla] stairways to nowhere doors that open 
out into the open air from like the fifth floor   someone who had to keep building or she was 
going to die! i mean what how cool is that? [Chelle] yeah [Laylla] we've definitely got some interesting 
places out here can you talk about that [Chelle] can you tell us who owns that house now? [Laylla] sure! yeah! i know that um 
i actually looked into going there   over halloween because they have a whole 
thing on halloween and they have tours [Chelle] ooooh! [Laylla] yeah they have tours all the 
time but on halloween it gets extra spooky [Chelle] all right where else we going? [Laylla] all right so colorado in early 
mining town this gentleman J. Dawson   Hidgepath he was an amorous dude and he fell 
off a cliff, so sad, but he loved women so   much he still is a hopeless romantic even 
after death and he haunts women at a hotel [Chelle] ooh [Laylla] yeah so different ghosts [Chelle] is he cute? [Laylla] no i would not say so [Chelle] no? okay then that's 
kind of creepy *laughs* [Laylla] so you've got gettysburg 
and we out here have sand creek [Chelle] what’s that? [Laylla] blue creek massacre so many people 
were killed and mutilated there that the   place is just absolutely covered in ghosts and 
creepy things continue to happen to this day [Chelle] ooh [Laylla] let's see i should have been 
more prepared to give you this list   so we have haunted minds and haunted hotels 
there's a lot of stuff from the wild west   out here you have asylums and we 
have the traverse city hospital [Chelle] Ooh! Nothin like a good creepy hosp [Laylla] it was a foreign asylum that's 
full of ghosts we have the menger hotel   pivot mansion… see so many of yours are like well 
known, you hear about these east coast places,   you don't necessarily hear about the whaley 
house in san diego that's full of ghosts.   you know the point sir lighthouse or the 
moaning caverns in vallecito. so there's a   lot of interesting stuff here so that might be new 
to you so I'm kind of excited to introduce you to   ghost stories and spooky stories that maybe 
you're not as familiar with as the stuff   that we grew up on from east coast so 
we'll get to some really interesting things [Chelle] I'm definitely 
intrigued, definitely intrigued [Laylla]Alright, so are you gonna tell us   what you're doing for your first 
episode are you gonna make us wait [Chelle] I'm starting og here so i figured 
i'd start with what actually pulled me in   and started this all right you know when 
we're kids you know you may see things   hear things you don't know if it's real there 
was a movie when i was a child that i watched   and even though i was scared i was scared because 
i knew that this was real so but it wasn't even so   much that it was i knew it was real but i knew 
that those things could happen in real life and   it wasn't just fake movie we're going back to the 
1973 ninth most grossing horror movie of all time [Laylla] oh wow! what do we got? [Chelle] the exorcist [Laylla] oh man oh man it's so creepy oh my god [Chelle] because you know little 
known fact not everybody knows this   actually two true stories 
combined what is what made that [Laylla] no i've never heard 
what what do you mean two stories [Chelle] obviously there was a kid and we'll talk 
about the kid um and we'll talk about the true   story of the kid. but interestingly enough, 
other portions of it were melded together   with a true story in loudon 
france. um from 1634 yeah it was a [Laylla] For the movie or for 
like the the legend like the real [Chelle] no for the movie okay okay [Chelle] so for the movie they took the 
true story of this kid and meshed it [Laylla] Like merged it? [Chelle] they merged it with this incident in 
1634 in france with a bunch of nuns and priests   put those two stories together and 
you have the 1973 classic the exorcist [Laylla] the exorcist. holy shit [Chelle] so we're gonna we're gonna we're 
gonna we're gonna talk about the real true   documented events that led to one of 
the scariest movies of our lifetime [Laylla] wow wow i I'm intensely curious i've seen 
the movie it scares the crap out of me and yeah it   was one of the first movies i had such a hard time 
with as a kid i mean it was so creepy so creepy [Chelle]But to know that 
like like this stuff happened [Laylla] Yeah. like that was 
based on actual events oh my god.   and i've never heard the france connection like [Chelle] yeah and you know this is this is 
you're going to be surprised about some things [Laylla] I'm ready to be surprised I'm ready 
to get high and get creeped out *laughs* [Chelle] hehehehe [Laylla] absolutely [Chelle] so so where what 
are you gonna do what what   what do you think is a good what's your 
first what do you think is going to scare me? [Laylla] all right i gotcha I'm 
going to start with a ghost story   and i guess I'm going a little og too because 
honestly when i first heard this story it sounded   so familiar i know i've heard this before so the 
trope itself again tell me if you've heard this   driving along late at night and you see 
a hitchhiker almost always a young woman   almost always either scantily clad or 
wearing some sort of sheer white dress. [Chelle] been there done that [Laylla] Right [Chelle] thousand times thousand runs. 
like every state in america has that story [Laylla] yes, yes! so yeah the regular trope 
that like there you go that's the whole story.   But i found the original and i found 
there's actually newspaper articles and   really old story from a book that was written 
in 1943 it's one of the first retellings of   this story although they say that kids in 
school were talking about it from the 1930s   and even neiman marcus gets involved and i'll 
tell you how that gets involved. but yeah [Chelle] a fun fact here that i've noticed [Laylla] what's that? [Chelle] so you've you said your story 
is like originated in the 1940s, right? [Laylla] mm hm [Chelle] my story originates in the 1940s! [Laylla] whoa coincidence so we 
both went og straight to the 1940s [Chelle] i guess the 1940s were like spooktacular [Laylla] *laughs*maybe or maybe our stone 
brains went 4:20 for 1942 i don't know   that entirely could have happened but yeah so 
1940s it's great ghost story certainly has its   roots in, and again that whole americana thing 
where it's like found all over the place but   there's some specific facts here in dallas 
texas particularly the lady of the lake legend [Chelle] oooh [Laylla] right i love how can 
you not be intrigued by that name [Chelle] i didn't even know there was 
a lady of the lake legend in america [Laylla] well not that lady of 
the lake this unfortunately is   a dead lady of the lake *both laugh*
and even better this lake is like a   hotbed of deaths like wait do you hear some 
of the stories it's insane and very creepy [Chelle] oooh [Laylla] yeah yeah you're gonna be so 
creeped out I'm totally gonna win this [Chelle] i've never heard of any of these places [Laylla] right how fun i love the 
fact that we're getting some of the   the og stuff that you and i or at 
least even maybe have heard of or   like kind of familiar with some stuff 
that I'm not exactly as familiar with [Chelle] yeah out here so I'm 
intrigued, this will be fun [Laylla] i think so too so yeah get some more 
information.tune into our first episode we'll do   an episode weekly of creepy scary paranormal 
stories see if we can creep each other out one other thing this is so dumb i know 
this is going to be an absolute stoned   thought so please feel free to laugh 
at me if you need to so i wrote this   and I'm like hey thanks for listening if 
you thought our stories were spooking okay thanks for listening if you thought 
our stories were spooky enough   for a late night bowl-fright send us a message 
and tell us what you liked what you thought was   creepy or interesting and which story east 
coast or west coast you thought was scariest I can’t say late night bowl-fright, 
it looks better on paper [Chelle] late night bowl-fright? the 
fuck is that? What's a bowl fright? [Laylla] i don't know! I was high! I 
don't know i was like writing really fast   and i was really stoned and i was 
trying to think of something fun and *coughing* [Laylla] Chelle, this has been so 
much fun i can't wait to do it again   next week i'll have to pack something 
maybe slightly less potent so i   don't forget where i was all the time 
*lighter click and bong bubbling* [Chelle] happy 4:20. [Laylla] all right Chelle i know we are not 100 
on a name yet but we're kind of getting there   and we've got some stories ready to go i 
know i do on the west coast how about you [Chelle] i got a lot of great
