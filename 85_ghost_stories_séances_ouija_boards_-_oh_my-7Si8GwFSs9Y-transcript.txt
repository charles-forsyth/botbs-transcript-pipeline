welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick what are we talking about today ilila tonight we'll be talking about seances Ouija boards and Things That Go Bump in the night we're going to be talking about all things spooky and ghosty for this very last Friday episode of the witchy season of the spooky season I love ghosts can I just say that I wanted to start out with the fact that we have a ghost story of our own to share let's see it was quite a while ago I'm not going to say how long ago shell and her significant other at the time and my were we married yet my husband we all went on a trip yeah where'd we go Lea where'd we go we decided to go up to a place in Upstate New York where my dad lived that I had lived as a child my family house and this house happened to be very haunted it was well known amongst my family and friends that this house had so many ghosts in it everyone that went there had some type of experience and there was even a spooky backstory to go along with it so imagine this folks picture it Upstate New York 199 what and Leila says hey you want to go spend the weekend at my dad's haunted house and we were like yeah that'd be fun yeah yeah yeah so the backstory of this house which I'm not exactly sure is true and in a previous episode of the stoned Witches Hour we did try to research this family Legend and see if there was any truth to it and we found some hints that it might possibly sort of kind of in a roundabout way be true but anyway I don't care about the history the bottom line is that shit's haunted very haunted so family lore says that when this house was first built a young man and his wife moved in and the young man goes to work comes home early one day and finds his wife in the middle of a very compromising position in one of the upstairs bedrooms with the neighbor typical 18 00s rather than stop them he very quietly does not disturb them goes outside to the shed and gets his hunting rifle and then goes upstairs and unfortunately um deceases both of them in the bedroom good way to put it Bravo yeah so I'm trying to be I'm trying to be like less spooky here but gentle so after doing that he then takes a rope that he'd also gotten from the the garage out back and hangs himself in the stairwell now people people have claimed to see Shadows of his ghost to hear them fighting upstairs to hear the gunshots there's all sorts of spooky stories that happen in this house so we get there and we use my grandmother's old Ouija board that was in the house again another great idea and we decide to use this at night in the room at the top of the stairs which is where all of this supposedly happened it also happens to be the room that shell decided she was going to spend the night in hey Ka [ __ ] around and find out that is like your middle name I'm pretty sure for real so we get there we do the whole thing we've got candles going we've got the oua board in the middle of the bed we've got incense we're calling spirits and casting circles and tell them what happened nothing nothing nothing nothing but smartass decided we were going to record it you had this old VHS freaking camcorder oh my God like the the rest on your shoulder kind and we had that sitting on a dresser near the door to this bedroom facing the bed so we could capture the entire room and the entire Ouija board Seance you know I think I I have that video still that that little cassette in a storage unit I know and I'm going to make you dig it out because here's what happened so we already said we set up the Ouija board candles circles the whole nine we had the camera set up to record all of of it and then despite the fact that we all could feel the energy in the air we all could feel like there were ghosts or someone waiting to talk to us nothing happened like the Ouija board planchet did not move at all like not even a little bit not what you had promised you had promised a weekend full of Mayhem I did I totally did and it was a dud it was an absolute dud so after long hours of nothing happening when the camcorder shut off because the battery died we decided to call it quits we pack everything up and go to bed now the next morning we got out of that house pretty quickly early in the morning and I wasn't sure why until we got in the car and started talking now let me tell you why we wanted to get out of that house fast why did we get out of the house fast shelle because you're a jerk so Lila puts me to bed in this bedroom and she's like oh you know this is where the guy found his wife and the L and the other guy I'm like yeah whatever how bad can it be yeah nothing happened with the Ouija board yeah right I got abruptly woken up and I'm not generally a wake up abruptly person and I got abruptly woken up and it was like there was this man hovering over me with like both of his hands like coming at me almost like they're going to strangle you and I felt like if I stayed in that bed I was going to get attacked I didn't sleep all goddamn night you jerk and yeah nothing happened with the Ouija board cuz he was like oh yeah I'm going to wait till they're in that bed and my ex-husband husband at the time was in that room with me and he was just like we can't stay here and I'm like yeah but we can't wake up Leila you know you're at your dad's house I'm trying to be a polite guest and we're literally freaking sweating bullets in this room just trying to make it till dawn like this guy was angry you shouldn't have put me in that bed man no one should sleep in that bed he was mad he was mad now I'm I'm not surprised to put two psychically sensitive people in that room was probably a very bad idea but I wanted to get the [ __ ] out of there so while we're hearing these stories I'm fiddling around with this camcorder now here's the thing while we were recording our dud of a Ouija board session you know we're we're trying the Ouija board nothing's happening and suddenly we hear a click and we check it out and it was the camcorder stopped and we had determined it was probably just the batteries battery or something yeah so kind of packed it up it was really late at that point we figured nothing was happening so while we're in the car I'm fiddling around with the camcorder and it turned on the batteries were fine they were almost completely full I thought that's weird and I rewind and play back what we had recorded and interestingly as we were doing our last Ouija board session you could hear someone come up the stairs really fast and really mad you ever had like you know your dad come home for work and you know you're about to get in trouble stomp stomp stomp yeah and you could hear them get louder and louder as someone stomped up the stairs and then there was a huge bang and a no and then the video the picture Shook and shut off but in the moment we didn't hear that all we heard at the time was the click of it shutting off and we just assumed it was the batteries being dead because we heard nothing else real world ears so to say didn't hear that and when we saw that I was shook I have chills right now it's freaking me out because that man was angry when he came up the stairs and he was angry when I was in that bed and yeah like I was okay never going back to your dad's house again and you never have yeah know I haven't I haven't but you know some people are like oh yeah you know that wasn't real no like I was scared like in the middle of the night when I got woken up that face was right in front of me I was shook I was shook yeah and you're not the only person who's had experiences in that room I've had experiences in the entire house people in my family I have a million cousins like no joke a million cousins they have all everyone every family reunion we all have stories of ghostly activity in that house and I mean you know you know ever since my late teens my Grandpa's been following me around yeah you know I I grew up with a ghost in my mother's house so it's not like this was like my first encounter and it spooked me this guy was pissed he's angry he's not a happy guy but you know experiences like that have been happening to people in every culture in all parts of the world for hundreds if not thousands of years people have always been fascinated with those that have gone before us our beloved dead and maybe have come back I just want to point out something that is kind of a seasonal thing you know they say well you know the veil is thinner and you know for for sin and and for belan is really the thinnest time I'm on that bandwagon that that Veil is relatively thin all the time um I know not a lot of people follow that train of thought but I do and I I don't think Spirit contact is limited to October and May and I do believe that it's thinner in those times but I don't believe that means that it's inaccessible at other times right you know I think it's accessible like you said all year round you can always cross the veil depending on their strength your abilities you know what you're doing we talk to our our ancestors all the time but I do feel that because of the energies of life and death that that makes it easier more common you know more likely to just kind of slip and happen but kind of like instead of the door being floppy it's just like propped open yeah yeah that's a good way to look at it yeah I love that actually that's that's exactly how I think you know what I mean yeah but I I do agree I think it's definitely not blocked off I don't feel at any time of the year so people have been trying to contact their dead all the time particularly back in Victorian era back in the early 1800s it kind of reached a peak you know they were fascinated with death they had the momento Mori the little charms of death that people would wear of loved ones they had all these Customs about dressing in black and how long you should mourn for your dead and they tried to contact them a lot because death was so close you know the infant mortality rate was extremely high then you hit you the mid 1800s and I mean the the the Civil War I don't have to tell you it was freaking traumatic okay like you woke up and your son and your husband were there and you went to bed and they were dead you know and then I don't know if you've been to Gettysburg well I know you have but listeners don't know if you've been there but like you feel like these people are walking around and don't know they're dead like it's almost like their death was so shocking that they don't realize they're dead and like Lincoln's wife Mary Todd Lincoln during that time period was always trying to contact her son you know people were devastated at losing people you know they didn't lose them to disease or or thing you know health issues like you wake up and they're fine and you go to bed and they're dead and and that trauma really drove a mass population to want to contact their dead it was at the late 1840s in Upstate New York actually in the Rochester area when the the fox sisters that's really where the spiritualism movement and the whole popularity of seances began and the word Seance is a French word and it means session and I don't know why they named it Seance but I think they were fascinated with the whole idea of French culture I'm not sure but it sounded fancier than a ghost session so they so when we smoke do we call it a seance I mean you could if because we used to call it a session May s yeah right I guess when we're being fancy you have to get me one of those big long cigarette holders for my joint and then we could totally do that that would be so fun right that would be great we could have a little tea party that way I me but do you realize and a lot of people don't know this that they actually because Mary Todd lincol was grieving her son she used to actually have seances at the White House Y imagine if they if if you saw in the news oh yeah so you know last weekend there was a sance at the White House yeah and she is not the only first lady to do that um let's see so Mary Lincoln did and let's see also Edith Wilson and Florence Harding two other first ladies also had sances in the White House nice yeah so the fox sisters in Upstate New York really kind of started this whole thing uh they were three young women that said that there was a ghost in their house of a a peddler who had been murdered and they could communicate with him and he would communicate from the spirit world through knocking or rapping and that was how a lot of different mediums would talk to their Spirits back then with some sort of table movement or knocks or knocking and it was very limited to mostly yes no and I can't answer uh you know one knock for yes two for no and three for I can't answer that question boy have ghosts advanced in communication right so that was kind of limited and then they started doing other things like really bad they would wrap out the letters of the alphabet so like one for a two for B three for C that's like Morse code man right so you can see that that would get very convoluted and very difficult they were always kind of looking for ways to make it easier because that obviously would take a very long time sometimes they would State the alphabet like they would just say a b c and then the spirit would knock when they got to the right letter but that also took a very long time so into this came automatic writing so some medium started you know capitalizing on the fact that their counterparts were just listening to knocks and people would get bored at these seances and they started doing different types of automatic writing which is basically holding a pen pencil piece of chalk and closing your eyes or going into some type of trance and letting Spirit work through you to write out a message now I've never done that myself but what I have done is I have transcribed what someone was saying while they were kind of invoking a a greater spirit so I mean that wasn't really automatic writing but they were channeling and I was transcribing what was being said now seances in the 1800s were less channeling and were more the idea of lights flickering or Spirits trying to to knock on things or move things more of a I'm going to prove I'm here versus have a conversation right and I think that was part of it is it really helped people to feel like something spooky or Supernatural was happening you know if someone just starts saying something you might not know that that's a ghost or a spirit speaking through they gave the impression that they were still physically there and that was you know quote unquote proof If something knocked on a door where no one's next to it that's proof of a ghost and so that kind of went crazy in the 1800s that was like super popular everybody had seances it was like the thing to do but then that cyber report kind of put Wren in it cyber report yeah 1887 the Cyber commission report started to kind of take away the credibility of spiritualism and Seance type stuff and kind of made it into you know there's always going to be those fakes and they highlighted The Fakes and cast doubt on the people who are really providing mediumship and it kind of went away a little bit but then there was a different type of resurgence in the 40s and 50s you know the same type of thing but then the Ouija board comes out or Ouija board or talking board or spirit board whatever you'd like to call it well the Ouija board came out in 1886 I mean I'm I'm talking mainstream Ouija boards mainstream was more of the 30s and 40s it did become more popular there but in 1886 in Ohio it was even reported in the papers that people were mediums instead of using this wrapping thing were actually using a board of sorts that had an alphabet on it and they were using a a pointer what they called a planchet and what this started out is is the planchet originally had a pencil attached to it and the medium would put their fingers on it and spe like a combination of automatic writing and talking board kind of exactly except there was no board it was just paper and then Spirit would move the planchet and write with the pencil attached to it and someone somewhere in Ohio I guess decided that these writings with this planchet and pencil were too illegible apparently ghosts have bad writing you die and your writing goes to [ __ ] I'm alive and my writing is [ __ ] so they determined that like putting out nice neat letters and then just having the planchet point to them was easier to understand than actual writing and that's where it took off and a Gentleman a coffin maker Undertaker named EC rice started making Ouija boards I mean a lot of people did I just think it's wild that this guy started making them as a coffin maker ironic right he took up with a businessman named Charles Canard to try and sell these boards to a wider audience Charles Canard as many American businessmen are want to do then cut R out completely took the Ouija board idea and went to a man named Elijah Bond the American way right woohoo go America in 1890 Kenard and bond patented the boards and that became known as the Ouija board where were the Ouija boards first produced not Salem really because we were told Salem uh nope actually the the Ouija board that we know today was first produced by the Canard Novelty Company in Baltimore Maryland interestingly enough they Incorporated the day before Halloween and the Ouija board that they made looks a lot like the one that we use today so Ouija boards continued to be made in Baltimore until the fold family sold it to the Parker brothers and the Parker Brothers then moved Ouija manufacturing to their base of operations in Salem Massachusetts so it didn't start to be manufactured in Salem until 1967 and that year it sold 2 million boards before that it was manufactured in Baltimore Maryland oh cuz see I thought it was the opposite in 1890 Kenard and bond patented the board and fun fact in the patent office is where they named it and they had a medium there named Helen Peters nosworthy and she used the board and they asked the board itself what its name was and it spelled out o UI J A what does that mean does that mean something in a language do we know well that depends on who you ask supposedly they asked the board what it meant and the Ouija board said that it was an ancient Egyptian phrase meaning good luck which is complete [ __ ] um right Charles Kenard has been known to say that Ouija uh was revealed to him through the board and it's the combination of the French and German words for yes we and yah but nobody really believes that some people say that there was like a some cultural icon at the time that had a name that was similar and that Helen just misspelled it and was trying to spell out that person's name nobody really knows it reminds me of how they come up for names of weed right no Rhyme or Reason no Rhyme or Reason they just kind of pull it out so after that uh its popularity absolutely soared they use it as a parlor game and then after World War I you know like you were saying earlier with the Civil War it became popular after that and then after World War I you know people again were grieving and having a hard time processing the loss and wanted to connect so it became became popular I think it outsold the Monopoly board which is the only time anybody has ever done that right after World War I you and I are of an age where our grandparents were whooping it up in the 40s and 50s and my grandmother was an Entertainer you know how that generation they entertained you know they have people yeah and people would come over and my grandparents had a Ouija board which is so funny because that was the grandma who thought me being a witch was just like Satan's job which I actually when my grandma passed away I obtained that Ouija board copyright 1949 but that's what you did you know everybody got together and went to Joe and Sally's house on a Saturday night and you drank shots of whiskey and played with Ouija board and played cards that was like normal fun back then yeah exactly it was marketed as like a a family like a social game and a way to contact the dead you know it's like oh go hang out with your dead relatives have a good time yeah let's go ahead and do that it was even um on an I love Lucy episode did you know that no in 1951 there was an I love Lucy episode where Lucy uses a Ouija board with a businessman trying to get him to do something I'm not sure what but she uses the Ouija and it's all light-hearted fun like there's no evil or Terror associated with it at all that came later that was actually the first witchy thing I ever got in life when I was 14 years old I asked for a Ouija board for Christmas and I got it a see yeah I still have it good clean family fun right so where did this whole idea because we all know the idea that the Ouija board is it's demonic it's evil you're going to let in terrible Spirits if you use it whatever so why do people think that you know I think that there comes a point in time where every generation is kind of swayed by TV and whatnot and I just think that somebody decided they didn't like it and projected that to the world and the world went along with it like World contend to do you know my grandparents it was a parlor game and then you know if you and I pulled out a Ouija board 30 years ago good Lord I don't even know what would happened to us you know what I mean yeah like it just it went from a fun family game to like taboo I'm pretty sure and we've talked about this before but I'm pretty sure it was the movie The Exorcist in 1973 that really really [ __ ] up the reputation of the weij board only movie ever scared me right super [ __ ] scary now there was a another movie called The Uninvited in 1944 that also featured a scary Ouija board but that didn't like grab the culture and and freak the [ __ ] out of them like the Exorcist did and that's really where people started thinking that if you use a Ouija board you're going to let demonic spirits in and that idea has just been cemented over and over again by movies and media you and I have always used we boards yeah actually I have a collection of maybe eight or 10 and you know I get what you're saying that you know not every otherworldly being out there is all nice and happy and L and sunshine like the angry ghost at your dad's house but you get what you call if you're gonna call some Angry Angry Spirit then you're gonna get one you know I I think it's kind of you get what you call but I also agree with sometimes you might call your sweet loving cookie bacon grandma and some angry [ __ ] Spirit comes in because they got something to say and you're the only one picking up the phone to listen I mean yes that's possible but not very likely like you said you get what you call and it's not like the Ouija board has some extra power that automatic writing or other forms of communicating with Spirit don't have so it's not very likely I agree with you it's definitely not the fault of the Ouija board okay quick tangent one of the times that I went to visit chef in Salem we went to one of my absolute freaking favorite places in Salem where talking board Museum we did it was fabulous if anybody comes to Salem go to the museum go it is amazing absolutely amazing and they change the exhibits once in a while because he has so many boards that he he's able to put them he said every three months yeah it's just fantastic like he has even the original printing plates from like the very first board made back way back I mean his collection is just amazing and and he'll talk your ear off about all anything about it it's just absolutely fantastic so neither shell nor I have a collection like that but it's fantastic okay so tangent over but talking boards Ouija boards started out is simply an easier way for people to communicate with those that have gone before us with Spirit it started out as a way to make contacting Spirits easier there's nothing inherently evil about it if you're calling something crazy you might just get something crazy and all right well let's talk a little bit about how do you use a Ouija board safely like how would you call people whether you know if you're trying to just be like who's here in this house rather than say an ancestor or someone like that like what would be good way to go about that again it depends on your intent you know if you're looking to talk to an ancestor call an ancestor if you're looking to [ __ ] around and find out ask who's here you and I have always generally you know at least put up some sort of magical Shield whether it be cast a circle or just put that bubble around us whatever the case may be but as with talking with any type Spirit doing any type of spirit communication you don't know if you're going to get a stranger or your cookie BAC and Grandma you know you got to kind of proceed with caution good point if you're going into a house where you don't know what kind of spirits are there there it it's pretty much a mixed bag you're going to get whatever is there and you might not know if they're cranky or if they just want to offer you a cookie just like going out and chatting with people in New York City proceed with caution you know what I mean I mean you like everything just be smart you know so we always like I said we either cast a circle or kind of put that protective bubble over us cut ties at the end that's another thing we do we always kind of do the we're done here you need to go you know in the movies they're like always say goodbye I don't like the way they word it but the the sentiment behind it yeah yeah you know you kind of have to close that door don't bring them home with you right yes you said in an episode a while back about something you like to do say when you leave a working like that or when you leave a place that you know is haunted you will Envision and Empower like scissors in your mind and cutting that cord and cut that cord you know cut around you to make sure nothing follows you home uh some people like to wipe their feet on a carpet until they get a static charge to make sure that that will sever any ties but yeah the goodbye thing is pretty important I think that's a good part of it when doing any type of spirit working and it doesn't have to be fancy you don't have to like scramble to wipe the planchet over the word goodbye or anything literally just say goodbye any type of symbolic ending or formal ending will work the important part is making an ending you know set an end point and be firm about it that's really all it is but more in the magical way and not the Hokey Hollywood Way yeah yeah exactly I mean it's it's it's like doing any type of spell you want your set and your setting and your intention to all be very clear you know it say you're going to try and contact something that's in the house and you don't know who it is like shell said you do your circle maybe you'll have protective herbs and crystals you'll have your candles you'll have your protective symbols or charms that you feel are empowered would keep you safe and also things that will call to the spirits that you want to come you know if you know anything about them if you know it's a child maybe you'll have a toy if you know it's a mother maybe you'll have a baby blanket or you know if you know they were an artist maybe you'll have a an artist brush or something like that but you know set it up to be most conducive to that Spirit coming and and also to you being protected but you know again I think it a lot of it goes with intent and and a good example is one time when you were here last fall you and I made homemade Ouija boards because you know if you're going to [ __ ] around and find out go big or go home um so you know we made homemade Ouija boards and went up to Gallows hill we didn't cast a circle for that but I remember that night at your dad's house we did because we knew we were dealing with some nasty [ __ ] whereas at Gallows hill we were like yeah let's take caution of the way and see who we get but before we did that when we created these boards oh yeah yeah yeah we like protected them well like we protected them from like nobody's freaking business we had the salt we had garden sage we had all sorts of herbs on them we uh yeah yeah we protect them if I if I've never posted those pictures before I will post those pictures for this episode yeah those were a lot of fun didn't work gray you know we haven't had exactly great luck with Ouija boards when we've used them true I mean everybody I think has their own way of spirit communication and not every way works for every body I just find conversation not not conversation through a board actual conversation you know what I mean yeah and and that's actually a really good point because not every tool is for every witch there are some witches who will find that automatic writing or that that just communicating like you do through conversation with Spirit works best for them maybe you'll find that the pendulum is the one that works for you but you have to try these you know get into a meditative State get into an alpha State and work with these different ways of communicating with Spirit until you find the one that fits until you find the one that works for you and for your subconscious and your magical brain you know some people get more thoughts and ideas especially if you're in a meditative state it can be very easy and and that's one of the reasons I kind of like automatic writing because you know not everybody is as good at having a a conversation with Spirit um as say you or someone else might be and so you know kind of get yourself into an alpha State a little bit with a pencil and paper and just let your pencil start writing just let your hand start writing and just let it go you know you might be surprised at some of the different things that you get there I I I just think that you also don't want to think too much about it because if you think too much about it you almost stop it from happening yeah and I I think that's why it's good to be kind of in a meditative State when you do that but how you you know how you communicate with Spirit really kind of I guess defines what name you're going to call it by you know with with sances you got that dark room candle it table generally around four to six people whereas Ouija boards you know that could be anywhere from two to whoever many people right down to you know the Long Island Medium go into stadiums and doing mediumship to crowds you know different people have different methods and I think that no method is invalid we just all get it different ways like I said I I kind of more in the conversational I know a lot of people will get visuals some people it'll be all like smell-based I think it's all valid it's just different ways Over The History of Time have had a different Focus because they worked better or not as good for a wider majority of people does that make sense makes me think of you know when the Ouija board first came out they were used by a lot of different people for different reasons you know it wasn't just for contacting Spirits right it was marketed as a game you know they would use it to get in touch with their creative side they'd use it for creative writing they'd use it you know people would use it by themselves which is one of the rules you're told now not to do yeah whatever I think that's another one of those Hollywood rules it is it is there's a little bit to that I mean I you know there's times I wouldn't want to try and contact a spirit on I wouldn't have wanted to use Ouija board alone in your dad's house F no no no no that's not good that would not be good you know and to be honest in the house I'm currently living now I probably wouldn't use a Ouija board alone here either yeah that's because they keep knocking stuff off of the shelves in your basement that's true and all right so maybe I'll tell you one more haunted story so everybody has heard about the renov church that I currently live in and Sh and her daughter have seen quite a few Spirits in my backyard oh my God the only time I haven't had an experience was literally the last time I stayed at your damn house now recently I found out some information about the house so do you want to hear the ghost story about the house or do you want to hear the new information I found first oh is the ghost story have anything to do with the fact when I sleep in your freaking living room I feel like all your outside windows on your deck there's people outside watching me that's just probably the ghost from the cemetery down the road Lord like you're you can't be anywhere in laya's house being freaking watched so the first floor of my house is where the the church was where the pews and everything were and in the back of the house behind where the pulpit was was an office that's now currently my bedroom and right off of that is a porch the second floor used to be the vaed ceiling of the church but it now has two bedrooms and one of my kids bedrooms is right of mine so one of the first nights we were here I go to bed and I hear violent sobbing like someone crying like they just lost the love of their life like everything is awful and it sounds like it's right outside my door I have a door that goes to a porch off my bedroom and my daughter's window is right above that door so it sounded to me like someone was either right outside on my porch sobbing their eyes out or my daughter upstairs had her window open and was sobbing her eyes out so of course being the concerned parent I go upstairs and check on her and she's quietly on the computer with her friends just with her headphones on with her headphones on just having a conversation and is perfectly happy and fine I check on everybody else in the house no one was anywhere near there and no one was crying so I go back to my room and a few minutes later I hear it again so this time I go out to my porch and it stopped and I can hear my daughter upstairs just quietly talking to her friends definitely not sobbing you know like she just heard the worst news of her life and then it it just went away I live in the middle of nowhere there's no neighbors there's no one next to me that this could have been and I've lived in the country before so I know it wasn't a fox it wasn't some random deer scream or rabbit in the middle of the night this sounded like a young woman crying like her life was over like there was nothing left to live for and it was so loud and so direct it sounded like it was literally in the room with me or just outside my screen door and try as I might I could not find a logical explanation for what I heard weird very weird so just very strange and other people have experienced things here too well I just recently found out that the church was listed as being built in 1901 but so was every other building in the town because in 1901 the town hall burned down and so all the records were destroyed and when they remade all the records everything that was already built just got a a building date 1901 date it's older than 1901 but they don't know how old so there's my little GH story here man you and your hauntings hey this I I don't know what to tell you man it just happens that way but sometime you should come up here and we'll use a Ouija board and maybe try to record it again see what happens I say do it I let we need to do it you know I grew up in in a house with a ghost too her name was Kora and I would run from my bedroom to the bathroom because cor was going to see me if I didn't run and you know I used to tell my kids about it and and you know my mother would tell my kids about it and you know how my kids are they're like yeah whatever Mom right and until one day my mom Winters in Tennessee and summers in New York state and my mother had already left for Tennessee for the winter um and my kids and I were at the gas station across the street the house was empty the house was empty um and only my brother and I had a key and um my kids and I were at the gas station across the street because I lived down the street from my mother at the time my son says mom Mom somebody's in Grandma's house I'm like what are you talking about and my daughter goes mom somebody's in the Attic Window now you see my mother's house it's like this three-story huge house and all three of us saw a person in the Attic Window on the third floor now because because I grew up there I knew it was freaking cor I knew it I was just like oh my God that's kaora the ghost so I call my mother you know Mom the kids and I just saw she's like and my mom looked at her cameras it was Kora because there was no one in the house it was cor house even my mother my mother's like yeah it was her don't worry about it but my kids finally believed me and didn't think that I was just talking smack because all three of us stood at that gas pump and saw that lady in the window like clear as day clear as day yeah you know it's it's amazing how many people if you ask them will have some sort of weird story about a house that they were in you know where something strange like that happened so it's no wonder that you know seances and and mediumship became popular they're still up in uh New York State there's still Lilydale which is a whole town of mediums and psychics and you know you can find all of that there particularly in the summertime they're open and do a ton of that um it's still something that's popular to this day uh Harry Houdini who was a famous magician set out to try and debunk seances um back in his day and he actually found a lot of fake mediums a lot of people who are using little tricks like you know pencils tied to their toes and you know assistance in the walls that could knock for them that's why I don't like the word say not that I want to say I think it's derogatory because that's not the right explanation but when I when I hear that word I think trickery fakeness you know like exactly what Harry Houdini was trying to to set out to prove so I just kind of like mediumship myself I think that's because in the in the 1800s even the fox sisters who are credited with starting this whole spiritualist movement they even one of them even wrote a book about how they fake all of it and Prov how they faked it but spiritualism and Seance had gotten so popular at that time that people were just like yeah whatever and just went on with it because it was so popular there were fakes at that time who were very much taking advantage of people like Mary Todd Lincoln and people who were desperately sad and trying to reach their loved ones they were vulnerable you know they were people in a very vulnerable position and unfortunately there's always going to be people that try to take advantage right that's not to say that it's all fake but I totally see what you're saying about the word Seance has such a a Hollywood fakery kind of connotation to it nowadays because of that but we know people like elani Phoenix that we just talked to here that they know things about places and people that died there that there's no way she could have known and she has been speaking to Spirits since she was a child I say the same thing about you I'm no I'm no that's for sure but yeah I mean I saw your grandfather and and there's times that I I have seen and spoken to these energies or whatever you want to call them so have you right you know a lot of people have a lot of people have these experiences it's something there's always been a fascination with it I mean you know to to give credit there's always been fakes too and I think that's just kind of the the nature of the Beast what Harry Houdini was trying to expose you could literally try to expose the same thing today you know what I mean I just think what it is is subject to being vulnerable to trickery but that doesn't negate its validation if you're trusting someone else to be that medium for you you still have to follow safety procedures you know you still have to do your research make sure that they have good recommendations make sure that they's someone that you trust you also want to make sure that you go into it with the right mindset you know don't give them too much information but don't close yourself off either right right you know the similar advice I'd give someone who's going to get a tarot reading I would yeah and I'd also say don't go to a medium when you're in pain if you're emotionally hurt and emotionally vulnerable you definitely should not go to a medium because that's all too easy you know to have the wool pulled over your eyes I guess um and you want to you want to make sure that you're with someone that you can validate that you can trust but what's better than all of that is you know gain a little bit of knowledge and Dabble in doing your own spirit communication you know if the medium can do it you can do it yeah reach out to them yourself I I agree I think that's the best way to do it you don't even have to think you have any mediumship ability right just get yourself into a meditative state or even just relax and think about your loved one think about the spirit that you want to contact and then while you're in this meditative State just ask them for a way that you can know know that they're there ask them for a way that you can identify them maybe a smell maybe a um maybe a sound you know maybe a song will come on but you can ask them for a sign to show you consistently and I found that that seems to work for a lot of people okay Lea if I go before you this is how you're gonna get me okay Billy Joel and weed Billy Joel and weed absolutely pretty sure that that would call you from well beyond the grave if if if you need to get me and I'm gone just put Billy Joel smoke a little bit and I'll be right there all right it's a deal if you have passed and a Billy Joel song comes on randomly I'll know it's you you know it's kind of weird but I think a lot of people tend to make comments like that I mean even Harry Houdini that we talked about earlier had a deal with his wife that if she did seances after his death he had like a coded message that he said would be proof that he was there and I know a lot of other people have mentioned like I have one Aunt who said anytime you see clouds in the shape of a horse after she passed that that's her so I think there's this whole idea of somehow communicating I mean I have other ones too like my grandmother said that she was going to implode a salt shaker my mother-in-law said that one of her relatives said that they would find dimes really yeah so whenever she finds a dime that's in an unusual place she feels that it's a sign from that person like not one that you might find on a grocery store floor or whatever that's pretty common but right you know you grab a dime of some place weird she feels like that's a sign so do you have anything like that I had a grandmother I'm sure you remember her she was a little nutty she always used to tell me when I go you're still going to hear me laugh I [ __ ] you not even my kids sometimes they've been like you know I feel like I hear Gigi laughing and she kind of almost had this like I shouldn't say witch cackle because that's such a horrible thing she did she did and there are times where I really do feel like I hear it yeah and my one grandfather his is Cherry tobacco smoke uh we'll all smell Cherry tobacco smoke and we know that he's with us you know my literal million cousins and I there'll be different times and we'll smell that cherry tobacco smoke and we know he's with us you know I did have like a weird thing and it's not normal it's not a normal occurrence but um my other grandmother as you know me and my mother were a tad bit of strange for a couple years and this last year we've kind of reconnected and she actually called called me at midnight on my birthday which she hadn't really acknowledged my birthday in two or three years so it was kind of a surprise and it was nice but I was half asleep when she called and because she did call at midnight when we hung up the phone it was like my grandmother was in my ear and she goes I made her do it and I I like literally called my mother back and I'm like I swear to [ __ ] God grandma just said this in my ear and she you know my mother's kind of a quasi believer and and she was like you know know that sounds like something she'd say but I am telling you like that particular grandmother I never have felt like I've had contact with since she's passed but that night on my birthday her snarky ass was right in my ear right there okay while we're telling stories I got another one this one was a step-grandmother who hated me or so I thought she was my stepfather's mother and this woman I could do no right nothing I did was good enough for her she constantly belittled me and well you are a witcho even before she knew I was a witch she was a Methodist I didn't think methodists cared I mean come on she was anyway she was mean to me her entire life well I was living in Colorado at the time and she was dying of cancer in Upstate New York and I knew she didn't have long and I was out one day with some friends at a Pizza Hut of all places and we were sitting we were sitting in a corner Booth we were waiting for our food and I kept looking behind me you know how you can out of the corner of your eye like when the somebody there like that peripheral vision yeah like when the waiter's coming up or something you'll catch that movement you'll turn and look well that kept happening like someone was coming to the corner and then coming over to us and I kept looking and there was no one there there never was and I kept seeing a woman with black curly hair and it was freaking me out to the point I made my friends get our pizza to go because it was bugging the hell out of me we got back to my house no sooner had we sat down with the pizza than I get a call from my brother that my grandmother had passed at the exact time I was sitting in that Pizza Hut did she have black curly hair she had black curly hair oh my God and honestly I love that memory I love that memory even though it kind of freaked me out to where I had to leave but that woman hated me but she came to say goodbye when she died and that that meant a lot to me that actually like healed a lot of wounds for me you know that she cared enough to be like hey you know I'm going dick sorry yeah sorry I was a [ __ ] but you know I'm heading to the afterworld and she just kind of you know touched in and and that meant a lot to this day that's very meaningful to me that she stopped by I like that yeah you know and uh dreams dreams are a big way even if you don't think that you have any way to contact uh your beloved dead or or the the dead of a place you know the spirits of a place a lot of times you'll see them in your dreams like how often do you hear even non-believers will say so and so ped and they came to me in a dream but PSA folks just because you see your ex in a dream doesn't mean you go back to them only if your ex is dead okay that's a bad joke I'm sorry that's a very bad joke so a lot of times you'll see them in your dreams and and you can kind of tell they feel different you know you wake up and you're like wow I really feel like I was talking to that person let me guess you're going to tell people to journal their dreams yeah yeah I am am I that predictable you are with journaling absolutely yes write your dreams down especially if it's about your beloved dead or about you know if you're in a haunted house like shell was did you write about your experience in my dad's house no I was too traumatized but I will say this you know T the season for ancestor altars and that could also be a a a a good gateway to communicate you know set up an ancestor Altar and kind of use that as your focal point for meditation to kind of get into that communicative space like I I have one going right now that I just started a few weeks back for the month I got some things that belonged to some of my beloved dead as well as pictures and I have those strewn about my my normal alter space but what I did was I ripped it apart I cleaned it I dusted it everything and put it back together with my ancestor pieces with it and kind of use that as a focal point for that connection you know what I mean I love that one last story I promise uh this is about my ancestor Altar and a new piece that I just put on it wow you don't usually put new stuff on this is from a young woman who passed quite a while ago and I knew her as a young teenager oh my God I know this story and I'm going to cry I was very close with with her family her mother was like a big sister to me I absolutely adored this woman and I adored her family still adore her family and her daughter passed tragically and I happened uh to talk to her she was interested in Witchcraft and in Tarot um great kid wonderful human being so bright and she had purchased a Tarot deck before she passed and uh just recently I was in contact again with her mother and her sister I absolutely love them my friend looks just the same absolutely gorgeous but her daughter is all grown up and fabulous and so remembering remembering this young woman they gave me her Tarot deck oh my heart crushes it's wrapped in a Shaw that had been her grandmother's and it's in a box that she has signed with her name just the connection you know the the honor of giving me this peace of you know it's it's Central right now in my on my ancestor altar because you know she is one of our beloved dead and she is one of our beloved Souls who have crossed the veil and I have not yet used the deck but I do plan on using it you know this s season to honor her and to honor her life and to remember her and that's what these are for this is for you to honor these people to to love them still to call to them and to remember them and to be happy and that's what I'm going to try to do with this deck is I'm going to I'm going to try to remember happy things and wonderful things about her and about her life you know what better way to try and contact our dad I guess I look at sa as kind of almost like a family reunion yeah and I don't look at it as a sad time a lot of people kind of get that sadness with the the whole ancestor thing conect with the dead thin veil thing yeah I look at it as as almost like a reunion like a like a party like everybody's coming you know you know what I mean I do and I love that aspect of it and I I know I've been I find it more joyous than depressing yes and that's what I always try to do even the years you know that I've been depressed on sa remembering people that I've loved and lost there's still that joy that they were here and they were part of everything and that's why you know talking to Laura Gonzalez about Dia deos muos and the joy in that culture around talking about their beloved dad you know we we need a little more of that I think right right so don't be afraid of the W aboard don't be afraid to contact the spirits but do it sensibly and smartly walk around and find out with caution yeah there you go sh's wise wisdom for tonight wrap yourself in your Rosemary wrap yourself in your protective oils and then say bring it on [ __ ] call to all the spirits there you go no don't please don't do that if you go [ __ ] around and find out in a cemetery make sure to leave a coin at the gate or to cut the cords before you leave and be respectful if you do it in a cemetery be respectful those are people's loved ones and and I do believe that these Spirits are out there and if you desecrate Graves and walk on them they will come and grab your ankles they're coming for your ankles man but leave something at the gate so that they don't follow you home you do do a seance if you do call on Spirits use shell scissors analogy and cut those energies you know use smoke and cleanse yourself to cut that energy use Music singing upbeat songs at full volume there's nothing better to don't bring that [ __ ] home don't bring that [ __ ] home yep don't bring it home do whatever you need to do to cut the connection and Say Goodbye right with that being said have fun good luck let us know how it goes or if you have any
