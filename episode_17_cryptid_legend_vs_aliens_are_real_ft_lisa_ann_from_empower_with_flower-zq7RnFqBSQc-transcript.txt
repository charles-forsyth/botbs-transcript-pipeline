it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi and welcome to episode 17 of the stoned Witches Hour it's 4:20 a.m. our favorite time to get high and downright spooky on this podcast we tell stories from the USA of the Paranormal the tragic the spooky and the just plain weird I'm Leila and I'm your West Coast host with the best weed and the best stories what up I'm shell from the East Coast hey this episode shell is our last one for the month of April and it happens to fall right between the high holiday of 420 Earth Day and belane which is the Pagan celebration that's coming up on May 1 and you know this is a time of year where it just feels like spring and summer and like now like it's breakout of the shell time it's like go outside do things what a good time you mean it's shell breakout time it's shell breakout time yes it is it is that's right get outside and enjoy I always love this time of year well here in California I can do it all the time but on the East Coast I loved getting out bare feet even when it was a little cold and muddy and just getting out there and feeling all the new grass on my toes you know let me tell you something 60° in the spring is a whole lot different than 60 Dees in the fall I don't know how to explain it but it is right now right now 60 degrees feels like it could be 100 I'm just as happy but like in in in October 60 degrees feels like it's like frigid yeah so I'm riding the wave of warmth and it's only uphill from here thank god oh it's about time it's about time I know that belane was big for us back in New York because everything really did start to bloom it was warm most of the time it was the first weekend we were able to go camping and not freeze our asses off although sometimes we did freeze our asses off I do not miss the crazy weather of Upstate New York I'm just I am no I am very grateful for the blue skies and sunshine on the best coast which is the East Coast oh [Laughter] no so for today's smoke sesh shell and I have invited Lisa Anne from the YouTube channel Empower with flower Lisa an welcome and do you want to tell us a little bit about Empower with flower and and what your message is absolutely and thanks for having me here on the stone which is our ah you're very welcome we love having you here we're so excited love your podcast Empower with flower is actually my YouTube channel and basically I started it just this year kind of like what you guys did started it pretty recently to just get the word out there because I used to think cannabis was not okay and now it's it's my blood it's my it's everything and I've had so many benefits psychologically physically everything that I just want shout it from the rooftops and so that's why I started the the channel oh I love that and you know when I found your YouTube channel um we're we're both fans of Reddit and that's how I that's how I found you was a post of yours on Reddit with this beautiful witchy photograph and and talking about your YouTube channel and then I checked it out and I was like this is amazing you know you're making cannabis so accessible to people you you describe different ways of smoking and I I just loved everything about how you were presenting it it's it's so refreshing to see just a downto earth happy presentation of cannabis instead of the typical stereotypes that we usually see you know the slacker Stoner or the you know the the grungy kid who's not doing anything you know yeah and and that's what I try to show on my channel too is look I'm smoking am I a stoner am I not able to speak to you now you know look I'm I'm actually coming up with more stories and and and wiser things because I'm on because I'm high right to me to me it enhances my thought processes because it shuts off all the stuff we don't need to be thinking about right that most people that's all they're doing but when you smoke and you shut off all that that programs stuff or shoulds or roles and stuff then you're you you access part of your brain that you didn't even know you had and you come up with sure crazy [ __ ] ideas but you also come up with really good things that that for me have been life-changing and how I relate to people finding my true self you know so that's what I'm trying to dispel and it's a low-key Channel I I'm not looking to add it bunch of you know I'm not looking to be known or to monetize or anything like that I have everything age restricted trying to really do it the right way I'm hoping that the people that really need what I'm saying will find it I love how you talk about how weed has allowed you to find that that wise woman within you know has allowed you to kind of go deeper and strip away all the things that kind of don't mean anything there's so much that's going on there's so much that's bombarding Us in in life that we just it's too much sometimes and I think cannabis gives me that moment to sit back relax and kind of reconnect with myself and reconnect with what's really important right well I want to tell you guys one thing I get from you and why I might be just really needing your podcast more than most people is because when you're when you're you're raised very conservatively religious whatever right so I have a a background you know that's a whole other thing but when you do that you you're you're acting you're not really knowing yourself you're being given rules for what you wear how you speak what's appropriate to do who appropriate friends are you're very sheltered and watched and so so like even public school kids are scary right so when I was growing up I never had that real girlfriendy thing that you two have I think from is it from college sort of um kind of it was around that age yeah 25 years or something so I've never ever believe it or not it's not sad but I've never ever had a girlfriend like that because of my upbringing it's hard to explain but anyway so so the so the last time I remember feeling like the Rapport you guys have is like Elementary School slumber parties and then of course in junior high everything shits up and it's horrible and I was behind in puber you know puberty I was the little short chubby girl and all that and so so I never had that that friendship and so when I hear you guys bantering and I'm listening to your podcast I feel like I'm at that slumber party feel like I have those girlfriends and so it's something a little different that's feeling even more for me because I I've never had that and so this is that's why this is extra fun for me talk I I'm a hermit and I don't go out and me too I think when when Lila when Lila and I uh had first met we were both kind of at a point where we are who we are we like what we like we think what we think and be damned anybody you know if you don't like it I don't give a sh [ __ ] that's that's you that's a you issue that's not a me issue you know we we did a lot of things that kind of went against the norm and we didn't really care right down to we both had a job at the same place and we both almost lost our jobs for having our tongues pierc and we were like you know what whatever if you fire us you fire us so we we kind of from the very beginning always kind of had this this is who we are and if if they don't like it that's their issue not ours so that's something I'm just learning right now in the last since covid and I kind of said I'm I'm done with my career you know I'm just going to stay home because we loved being once I was staying at home we were like we love this you can't ever leave so I just basically retired but um and then I started being able to smoke every day and really do thoughts and so I'm just now finding that part of me that feels like it could go out and just make girl friends with anyone and and and and do my own thing and I have I have I've I've done amazing boundaries and changes and I'm my I'm my same self wherever I go no matter who walks in or you know I'm always me now I've never had that before so you guys felt like you could be free to be yourselves at a young age and I'm I just am finding that in you know late do you feel that not only your upbringing but did you feel that your job kind of restricted that and that now that you're retired you don't have that concern well that's a great question shell because what my position has always been um at work has been like she's the weird different person but it was because of my upbringing so like so so like I I'm not going to be witty or come up with funny things I I I'm getting better at it I'm letting that out too but but I was always kind of um strange in that um they would talk these real sexual things about their husbands and I was and I still wouldn't so there was just Parts where I was kind of separate but it was part of it was because of my upbringing and I was different I went to private at Christian Church school instead of public school and so I'm getting better at that but um I always felt different because I couldn't express myself I had I had my really good friends that I worked with offer me weed after a dinner at one of the girls' houses and I said no I was afraid of it and this isn't that long ago and she said it's because of control you don't you don't know what will happen you're always in so much control of everything and she was partially right so I I I get that as a as a I'm also so control freak I'm a perfectionist I I I get that the the losing control is difficult but I feel like cannabis helps me more to take control a little bit more of my life it helps me to feel more in control of my brain and what I'm doing um but I wanted to touch a little bit on you kind of coming into yourself after you retired the biggest thing I keep thinking of every time I see your channel in a in a magical sense and in a literal sense is you remind me very much of like a butterfly you you are bright you are colorful you're bubbly you you have interesting information your your topics I love your YouTube channel because the topics aren't very long I listen to them they're packed full of information they're fun they're visually beautiful to look at and but it doesn't have to take 2 hours of sitting down and you know you get right to the point and you distill things in a very beautiful way I'm an old Stoner I have been smoking a very long time and joints are one of my things I can roll them right up cones I'm not so great at packing them and I looked at your joints for beginners video where you did the raw sck shooter demo I have got to get one of those you know so even for an old Stoner like me you H your videos have interesting things I didn't know about you know and it's they're just fun to watch they're informative I I love them and and again the butterfly thing because you're just so bright and fun and interesting and and you just kind of give that Vibe of having come out of your shell and being and loving it being so happy with who you found and who you are now and and that kind of really comes across in your YouTube videos well thank you and um that makes me very emotional to hear you say that because because uh I've never liked myself and oh my gosh and I never liked how how how I looked and and everything and um it's just been literally you guys since I found cannabis I'm able to get rid of all those filtering thoughts so so before you do something that you want to do is this okay what is it going to look like how what are my parents going to think what are my siblings going to think and I just was always living kind of in fear of all these uh these things we compare ourselves to and I I've always liked a very simple minimalist life so my family's well educated and they buy houses and all this stuff and I've always been like no we're we're really happy just in our own little place and and so I've always felt different but I've I've I've never ever um liked myself until I found cannabis and said [ __ ] everybody like like shell said I heard her just say this morning you know I got no [ __ ] left to give I mean I just how old am I gonna get before I go who am I what would my eight-year-old self smile at my life being like and and I'm just you know I do have some witchiness in me from my grandma we can talk about that and and I just it so it really Thrills me because I've never you know you guys have met me now and you're saying we like this person and um and I I like her too for the first time and so it thank you for that butterfly comment and uh and for liking the channel I try not to to have too much filler because I know what kind of YouTube I like to watch and I don't want all I just give me my answer so I try to do that for other people yeah thank you oh my gosh what what was that what PR to do that first time um what what got you to pick up the bong that first time and start smoking so uh we we were living in Boulder we've we we lived in Boulder for quite a while Boulder Colorado and there's weed in the there's weed in the air oh my gosh I read tarot cars on Pearl Street there Lea lived in bould I love B well I kind of slept on the streets in Boulder but well we we had we had kids at Fairview hike but we're in Boulder and this is kind of a witchy story so I'm working at a I always worked in cosmetic dentistry and uh gorgeous gorgeous smile I was managing this office for a a really well-known cosmetic dentist there who who I had worked for for a long time and we had a lot of patients come in who were interesting as you can imagine in B Sure believe it at that since one gal came in and they found out she read chakras or whatever and so they said can you come and read everyone's chakra in the dental chair can you stay we were closing sure yeah so read everyone's things you know it's very private we pulled a curtain and everything so she does mine and she I don't know what she was doing okay um I'm not I wasn't into any of this and she's has a necklace holding it above me and it's twirling and she's saying things and she's doing some kind of raiki stuff she's doing her stuff and when we got done she said I've never had anyone with a clearer reading oh I I I've just never and and she she was saying that she really could connect to me and she said to me her her name was K just the letter K she said there's something really important you're supposed to do do you know what it is and it was a life-changing moment that led me to follow a creative thing that I had been wanting to do so that led me to being part of the live uh Boulder musicians singing out at different places like laughing Goen places that's where I met local other singer songwriters who all smoked weed really the ones that wrot the best songs the ones that the ones that wrote the best songs and I noticed when I would go to this songwriter thing I was you know 20 years older 30 years older than some of these kids that are out singing right and they would kind of like go okay it's over and I would leave and I would realize that they're not leaving and it's because they were GNA have a sesh to up afterwards and so I went I went home to my husband and I said I want to smoke weed and he's like really he's you know smil sure because we'd never done it before but we you know we're High School sweethearts we're like let's try weed in our 50s right and so uh he went out to the farm in Boulder and bought a bong not this one but bought a bong and we started my first experience was horrible but um and I said never again oh my goodness I think I love your husband already what a great guy you're like hey I want to try weed he goes and buys your bong it's like here do it love that later I said let's try try again and we had a really good experience and it's been pretty much a daily occurrence uh since then and that was October of 2019 so yeah the weed bug hit and you never looked back yes Husband by the way comedy let now does your husband smoke every day he does he he doesn't smoke as much as me I'm I'm the one who smokes enough to kill a rhino he he his tolerance is different so I can smoke um okay Norm for me I'll just confess I can do three bongs two joints in a pack in a day and that keeps me nicely High nice very nice if I want to get really really high for like what I call a puff and [ __ ] um I'll do which we're planning on tonight I'll do um I'll I'll I'll I'll get cross faded because that helps me get up to that Stratosphere that he can get to in in you know one bong I highly recommend THC and CBD infused um enhancement oils fabulous fabulous oh topicals yeah little bit of a THC CBD Lube I highly recommend good stuff you need to be able to mail this stuff to me mail this to Massachusetts one of these days we will be able to do that b where where are you I am in Salem Massachusetts I've been to Salem but I heard you say Massachusetts and I'm like yeah I used to work in Back Bay okay I know where that is now you visited some interesting places Lisa an you have been to the Queen Mary which is right here near me you've been to the Stanley Hotel you know you have quite the haunted history here well I'll tell you so I I think I have a little witch in me and I'll let you know you guys decide that every woman has a little witch we all do I was born on my grandma's 50th birth birthday Ethel Esther was her name and uh she definitely was a witch so she um when she was a teenager worked for room and board for some witches she cleaned their house and cooked their food and learned from them um and I didn't get to get a lot of stuff from her because my parents were no way going to let her tell us any of that but you had that religious upbringing yes very very strict as strict as can get but she would do fortunes with playing cards for us I she probably had tarot cards but my parents wouldn't have allowed that like Gypsy fortunes yes and and so um I actually have on her her pendant so this is her Virgo pendant because we were born on the same September 17th nice and my grandpa got that's my Grandma's birthday September 17th how weird is that it's my Grandma's birthday that's synchronicity right there well this Virgo pendant of hers I know we're going to get scary real quick here but this Virgo pendant of hers my grandpa got for her on her 30th birthday which would have been she was born in 1913 so 1943 and so I'm wearing that today nice I love that to bring some witchiness but yes I have been to some scary places and I'll tell you the Queen Mary it wasn't scary when I went on it but the reason why I was on it is because my grandmother lived in the Cooper arms which is on Ocean Boulevard and the Queen Mary's the window so I grew up going up to her 16th floor apartment and seeing the Queen Mary we went there to have dinner once and the scariest thing that happened was for the chef because it was a very fancy restaurant and we ordered steak and I asked the kitchen for ketchup so that's he was he was very upset and came out to the table and wanted to see who ordered ketchup but I was you know a kid yeah oh that's cute but no ghosts during dinner yeah and I don't know if that restaurant was on B deck or which deck it was on but that was back in the early 80s but definitely I can see it haunted especially since you guys talked about how it was painted gray and it was a warship and it it caused that other crash and people died and definitely some some servicemen haunting on the Queen Mary for sure to bring it back a little bit to to the Cannabis portion of your journey you mentioned earlier I talked about how we both do Reddit and you mentioned um I I love this term and you don't hear it that often but you called yourself an an witch that you were um I don't remember if you Ed the term baby witch but you said you were just a little bit of a witch and you called yourself an an witch well I'll tell you it's actually int wife and the reason why I use that word is because it's a subreddit on Reddit so there's my favorite subreddit is called Ant wife and and maybe I did say ant witch that I must have been high it's very creative um but int I all I know is that int comes from some Lord of the Rings thing I'm not that's not something the trees ants are the tree people yeah yeah and the big subreddit on Reddit for cannabis is trees right trees yeah yes and the joke is the Cannabis subreddit is actually about actual trees not cannabis so that's the joke our trees Canabis will post a picture of a tree on on trees and go does anybody know what kind of trees this is and we're like wrong red wrong yeah same thing happens on cannabis I actually joined the the subreddit cannabis and was very confused when I couldn't find anything but pictures of trees and then I realized what the joke was so yeah but those an wives on on Reddit are the ones who made me who who helped me understand there's other people like me out there so I thought that you know a stoner it's going to be a kid it's going to be a lowi it's going to be somebody doesn't work it's you know I didn't didn't know and then on and there's all these beautiful women successful women uh very accomplished women and they're sharing their bong hits and talking about how they smoke weed every day and it made me feel like I found like a a a a coven or a tribe yeah defin and I love that and just to again explain what an end is it does come from The Lord of the Rings uh Jr token it is one of the it's a species you know they're tree people ants and so actually never heard of that yeah so they're they're the I had nether shell until I found ant wives I didn't know what it was big Lord of the Rings fan here so and and being an an witch for me I I'd have to look and see if you sent an wife or ENT witch maybe I read it wrong but I love the idea of an you did if you did and because it's just you know trees and cannabis and being and being a witch or a pagan is so all wrapped up together for me that I just loved that idea and it just really struck me as as a cool interesting way to combine those things definitely and I am learning from you guys how to be an INT witch because I like when you did the episode um about spring and the the ritual the the uh witchy rituals around that um I'm just at the level of having a tiny little alter and some Sage but now I I got lots of ideas from that episode of what I can do to bring spring in and and shell saying that you don't have to read the crystal Book and know all the things just pick the colors that are pretty to you you know and it helps me understand how it's so flexible which is so different from most worldviews right I I grew up in something very inflexible and so just the anyone can be a witch you can do it however you want they'll say do this elaborate ceremony or just close your eyes and think it you know it's very you you can customize it to yourself and and really find out who you are through witchcraft instead of the worldview telling you who you who you are who you should be so I'm very drawn beautifully said beautifully said and I think that's why we're kitchen witches or chaos witches for that very thing because intent is so big this this week uh we had our full pink moon how I celebrated the moon was seeing it upside down laying in my bed recovering from my illness and it was just as good as if I had put on this or that outfit gone to some stream like I just didn't have it in me and the intention was no different that's what's so beautiful uh about you know paganism Wiccan you know it it really lets you express yourself naturally instead of being programmed I mean it's just a beautiful way to view the world and I love that cannabis helps to connect me to that as a grower I I have lots of plants I I do I have plants all over my house I have plants in my garden and I I grow a [ __ ] ton of cannabis and it's my favorite thing to grow because it's so interactive the the vibe I get from it the feeling I get from growing it is intelligent sounds weird but it's so symbiotic and it feels good I immediately feel good when I I work with this plant and other Growers that I talk to kind of have that same thing and it's just such a a nice way to connect with the sun with the Earth with water with air with everything and and just to kind of feel feel that Vibe and even smoking for me can be a mini ritual again you have all the elements you know you have the air you have the fire the water the Earth all of it combines when you're packing a bong or rolling a joint and then that inhalation can be a mini ritual a mini meditation a mini spell right there and and it's always been like that for me and the girl power the girl power the female plant like that that just really floats like I really think we should run everything but it's you know that the female energy it can be a male person but those us those of us with that female energy should be running things because we're not greedy correct yes that feminine energy needs to kind of run for office yes do you grow at all lisanne do you or your husband grow oh great question um we've he did one grow so this is when I was working um he was retired already he grew a uh got some seeds and grew in a closet in this room some LSD strain which we termed Soo so we call it Soo stream because that's what we call our little apartment here Soo because it's so good but um so we call that strain Soo and it lasted us for a year Leila and it was good [ __ ] like it was our and I've heard you talk about that like I don't know if it was the Jack hair the abusive OG or some straight you were saying oh this is I grow this and and it lasts me a and it did it lasted us over a year nice very nice things come to me to die I can't grow anything like literally cats and kids that's all I can keep alive cats can't either sh it's I'm I'm surprised my kids are alive um I can't grow anything I have no plants and I can't grow anything so that was all him all I did was help Harvest now I've seen on your show you um you give prices sometimes I I've seen you kind of break out the bags from your from your delivery or your haul and your prices blow my mind okay yeah do you know what what it goes for a gram or an ounce typically uh when you buy um we only order from flour company it's in I'm in California near Sacramento so most of this weed is grown in arada Arata it's all grown in the the Emerald Triangle up there but Flower company is the is the delivery service so it's an app or a website and we go on there and and say hey this is what we want and you get it usually the next day um but this is an ounce of ice cream cake uh $49 what wait wait wait back that train up back what and this is an ounce I have I have a bunch but this is what I have in front of me this is an ounce of Sour Patch Kids which is a good go-to and it was $59 free delivery can you do they have um THC percentages on there at all yes and shelle I'm up with you if you guys will see on here see how it says the word ass ass yeah yeah ass Inda ass sativa so we have we we group our weed in ounces by ass mid and top so this is the yeah this is the everyday stuff that you make into joints and stuff like that so this is this is the low stuff that that I don't really love but it's okay during the day uh it's 18.5 6 and 18 .97 now my top shelf which right now is Ebola and triangle mints is close to 30 or 302 so I like the high THC 50 bucks an ounce I can't get over that I would walk to California for that [ __ ] okay that's amazing the price for something similar cheaper than my that's cheaper than I get a eth for and the top you got shell the top shelf here the Ebola in the Triangle mints is 69 an ounce so it's not we were paying 130 down in Santa Barbara for a Pacific Southern California is so bad so bad oh my goodness so the prices are crazy jealous oh my gosh yeah and it's good stuff it's good stuff uh it I mean we go to the Moon where you just feel like you're floating out in the stratosphere you guys know what I'm talking about oh yeah you get phosphated and you're with your honey and your clothes are coming off and you're grooving to the whatever music and and we can see trees out our window and we just feel like we're floating in space like nobody's ever had a blissful Life as we had that is perfect what a great right there for that $69 an ounce for that so it works nice nice The Flower Company yeah now I'm smoking on some Blissful wizard that I purchased from a local delivery company um and it was not $69 an ounce this is blissful Blissful wizard it's 34% THC but nice it's this is costing $60 for just an eighth and when you know if you go up and you buy in an ounce it's $320 an ounce and that's for the heard you say something like that on the podcast and I was like she must live in Carmel or La Hoya or some this is Southern California prices and it's not too different from the sounds of it from Massachusetts prices yeah it's the same Massachusetts 60 and8 300 an ounce yeah so I'm smoking my I'm smoking my low THC one today it's Lio G and you want to know how low I've gone this week my low my my low one this week is only 28.7 that's my shell there we go y yep I agree with you you know for being called lioy it does not have that Citrus flavor just want to say you can smell it though you can smell it but you can't a little bit a little bit but it tastes you know it almost tastes like homegrown dirt weed from like 1995 oh wow you know what I'm talking sounds bad you know it is nostalgic actually because when I smelled it all I could think of us I'm like this is [ __ ] that we used to smoke like back back in the day like back in the day like when my kids were real little back in the day wow good high but it just you were like and it almost tasted like that weed too to have weed as a mother see I never had it that sounds life saers life saers you don't even know I suffered it all raw you know I saw the rise of the wine moms and I I was actually a little upset that it was so socially acceptable to be the wine Mom oh I need it's wine o' clock I have to drink glass of wine and and if anyone knew that I was puffing on a joint in the morning so that I could handle my kid all day I right I don't know what they would say I would be judged but someone could have a glass of wine or a bottle of wine and they were applauded almost and I I have nothing against wine moms but I come on yes I just didn't like the stigma of a pot Mom all I have to say is with having a daughter that's seven months pregnant right now I still have to smoke to deal with my kids so just saying oh I my kids are all adults and I definitely smoke to deal with them you need me yes hey I I smoked as a teen it and it it not that that's something that I'm going to promote as a thing that people should do but for myself I I've self-medicated before I knew that's what I was doing most of my life and I I do definitely smoke just to relax and because I enjoy it but I've also spoken on here before that I I smoke to help me control my ADHD and which I was not diagnosed with until I was an adult having fibroid pain I think you said yes yes I deal with fib severe fibroid pain on a regular basis and it's I have to take so much Ibuprofen that I get sick until I found you know being able to to dab high THC and CBDs I was not able to manage the pain at all and that helps me to keep the pain to a manageable level without destroying my liver and my stomach totally yep and that should be available to everyone my God I I don't I won't even go there if I can get so upset you know about alcohol where you know you can you can get in a fight you can drive home drunk you come home beat your wife but alcohol's fine but on cannabis you're not going to do any of those things um you're just going to chill and and not hurt a fly and it it just really is it you know there's so many things out there in society where we just have to smoke and go whatever I can't you know I can be I can be sometimes very dangerous when I'm high you know like right now these caramel pretzels covered in chocolate danger I've heard about him and now I get to see him that is a danger to me like these you can't stop eating them and there's so much like salt and chocolate and caramel it's just too much yeah you should be arrested yeah right that that you know that is that is a legitimate concern but you know they've actually found that smokers are among the most healthy people we tend to have more Healthy Lifestyles and you know munchy lower BMI the whole munchy stigma not withstanding and it they finding now that it's due to I believe you talked about some of the um compounds in cannabis that help with weight loss and that can help with different things like that a lot of good cannabinoids that they're separating out like at the rare canabo company in Colorado and you can buy a a tincture bottle of full spectrum pure CBG CBN I mean take CBN an hour before bed and you will sleep like a toddler and you'll wake up and want your blankie I mean that that [ __ ] works I I use it the thcv it suppresses your appetite and gives you energy it's the best stuff ever you know those different canabo but but um and and they're legal because they're from the hemp plant anybody can get those but the benefits you're getting from dabbing for fibroid pain that should be available to everybody everybody absolutely and it's terrible that it's not you know and science I say that a lot I love the science that's coming out and it it's coming more needs to be done yeah it's coming out though it's it's it's in my feed I know because I Google it but I have seen things pop up in popular and things where they're saying hey guys if you legalize weed prescription drug uh prescriptions go way down um just like when you legalize abortion teenage pregnancies go down you know um so it's happening and I'm glad in my lifetime I'm seeing the legality that I am seeing me too I I I think it's a snowball I think it's just going to get bigger and bigger from here we're on the cusp of it being federally at least moved off of schedule one and I think that's going to make a big difference yeah because they found out how much money they can make as a state you're not even joking on that you are not even joking it is like a billion dollar industry just in the state of Massachusetts alone yeah I mean that's why it's going to be legalized for profit of course and and that's why all of a sudden in the last what three four years you've seen a lot of States hop on that bandwagon yes Pennsylvania is it Pennsylvania on the Brin yes I try to look at the H the glass half full uh but it is frustrating because people are having to uproot their families and move to legal states because their kid has epilepsy or you know Grandma has Alzheimer's what or it's in there you know people are actually having to geographically move for for this medication you know it shouldn't be that way it we saw that a decade or more ago when people started moving to Colorado to order to get the charlott's web for their kids and it's still happening today and it's ridiculous that it's carried on for as long as it has you know they they need they need to kind of follow if they follow the money so be it because at least the science will then be able to follow and well I had I had a client in in Boulder who tearily was crying uh to me after her her dental appointment because she had grown up in Pennsylvania she loved Pennsylvania but her son was having you know 20 seizures a day and couldn't speak and all this and they had to move to Boulder which is a great place and they had the money to do it but even with that wealth she was sad that she had to leave her family and her friends and her job and everything and it was because she had to go where the Cannabis was and when you see somebody just distraught but she also got her son back right and and we saw happen over time and it was an amazing thing but so many people don't have the resources to be able to do that and the the incarceration rates extremely yeah I have to take a hit I yeah that's a bad one it's it's extremely racist policy and and the amount of people that are incarcerated for this that should not be is Criminal it's absolutely criminal and different podcast but before before we get to far there's so much when you get into it we've just barely scratched the surface of of what a terrible policy that prohibition has been and how much damage has been done because of it and how much has been lost that we could have found if we had been studying this from the beginning and the and the myths that are perpetuated over and over again in every form of media even now you know um don't do it at a young age because of brain cells uh don't do it because it's addictive don't do it because it's a gateway drug all all these myths just keep you know it makes you stupid they say and you're going to be a all these myths and and that's what I want to to spell yes I mean because it's just like the religion I was brought up in um there's nothing to it there's nothing there but you know what there is something to Lisa in smoking marij Marana perpetuates my fat ass because I sit here and eat and thcv that's all you need yeah but I I like to have like like this dark chocolate caramel pretzels sea salt like I'm ready for ice cream now I'm jealous I just have TR today I want some of those now you know I guess to my credit though to my credit after after having had covid all week I I haven't eaten a ton this week so now I'm just like hungry for everything and I'm high so I'm high in like a week's worth of hungry that's how I know I'm feeling better because I just eat every little snack I want I a video on called realistic munchies and and I'm a big uh dark chocolate Smokehouse almond kind of gal too um but one of the one the best things you guys can get and it comes out of Boulder I didn't know that it did but they're called yaso bars uh y a SS o and they're Greek yogurt bars uh like a fudge sickle but all you know all different flavors they're only 100 calories and they they take they do the ice cream thing I'm telling you because we were doing consistently and I said we need to stop and we found the yaso bars and they're delicious so that's fabulous yeah I guess I'm stoned because I I need those right now I could really go like four of them I'm GNA I'm going to text my husband not just one of them four of them four I'm just gonna say yaso yaso and he'll go again love your husband that's fabulous oh my goodness so while you get your Munchies delivered um one of the things I like on your channel is um your different how-to videos again I even found howto with that the raw six shooter that I had never seen before so Stu for for new people to make things more familiar for people and stuff for old Stoners Like myself to to find something new do you have a a favorite one of your how-tos that you've done and do you have any new anything new coming up that we might look forward to well I I think my favorite howto was was the bong one because the bong is my favorite method it it just is um it like you said it cools the smoke it puts the flame a little farther away from your your throat so that that was fun for me doing the bong one and also because I have a little custom way I pack the bong uh called The Baklava pack so you have to watch it but I was able to show that to everybody and I I really stand behind it that you get a better high if you pack your bong in that way and and so it was fun to kind of sayous yeah and and so that one was real fun for me because I just love you know hitting the bong you call it the baklava pack who doesn't love baklava I'm going and Munchies oh is that a yaso bar oh yeah the awesome husband has delivered the amazing looking yaso bar mint chip nice so yeah we'll have to link that episode so that everybody can find out what a baklava pack is because now I'm curious I want to know I'm happy to tell you oh yeah okay give us a teaser go ahead and tell us okay so I invented this on my own um because I had bong BS that would like get clogged or um just it wasn't always smooth to smoke so I actually have a little jar called twigs and I save the Twigs from when I'm yeah I save them and I put them in a little jar with a little humid a pack you know a little Bova humid a pack so they don't get anyway so on across the hole in the bottom of your bong with a lighted you know Revlon tweezer I put a twig across the hole like a keep things from pulling through perect yeah and then I sprinkle in just just on top of that whatever weed I'm using and that keeps the twig in place and then I I I fresh grind my weed every time I used to pre-o it and keep it in jars and it just wasn't the same so I fresh grind it and I squeeze it between my thumb and fourth finger in these little just pancakes it doesn't matter the shape and I kind of tile them up like a roof just to fill the bong and then I'll put some loose on the top and what I found is it just kind of gives the air the Heat um it kind of has to go through and it just it makes it really tasty and you get more oils I think and it just really hits harder and we've gone back and forth and tried it my hun and I swear that you got to pack The Baklava it's just not not as good a high so I'm gonna have to watch this video what my bud shoving friend shell over here has are you GNA try that stop what did you call it C you called it something like stuff and stuff and stuff and shove that bud right in there every time so I'm curious to see if she'll take the time to try it she put stems in hers and you're not a pot snub to her I smoke stems and I'm all of a sudden some like bad pot smoker I think there's a difference between intentionally taking your carefully curated bovita pack kept perfectly humidified stem to put on the bottom of a beautifully crafted bomb is much different than just grabbing any old stemy butd and shoving it into the bowl little different I do if that was the only option I would do that so you know I'm not above any of anything yeah me personally if the if I find that the hole at the bottom of the bowl is a little too big I usually just take a small Bud something a little bit bigger than that and I put that down there and then kind of pack around that so that's how I kind of same concept yeah same concept I like yours because uh sometimes if you get the wrong if you get the wrong Bud down there it's going to clog the intake and then you kind of got to or or the times when you just put nothing but Shake in there and hope for the best and then you take a really big hit and you're like it's all my house suddenly you're bong water looks like tea in there yeah uhuh well I usually do like the Chillum or the pipe so usually it's all in my mouth no no no nobody likes that part so you know I do have a glass ass grav Gandalf pipe and I have some other glass pipes you know the the their regular pipe that kind of their standard one I have that in green and pink and blue so I have some pipes too excellent everybody needs a pipe for travel you can't smoke a bong in the car uh you you can't well I mean I guess you could really oh interesting um I one of the things I like about your channel Lisa Anne is your is your paraphernalia you have a dream stash of paraphernalia I am so jealous you you know you pull out these pretty bongs you pull out pipes you pull out Grinders and and you have humidifier packs you have you have everything and I love it UPS I have yeah you have a a jar of joints you have anything any you have big ounces of weed that you get for amazing prices out of all of that um you know you've mentioned you really like your bong but is there any piece of paraphernalia that you could not live without absolute favorite 100% favorite um yes I do and I I have to say it would be my my PX too and I'll tell you why um now what is ax too for our listeners okay ax is a ax is a brand that makes Vape for um Vapes for for cannabis um but the Pax to is convection so basically what it is it's about 4 in long it's it's about as like you're holding a lighter it's it's not that big but in the bottom of it is a convection oven you grind your weed and put it in that oven and put the lid on and you heat it up and it's very specific uh you can use an app even to set the temperature that you want it to heat um Let me let me just grab it it's right here cuz I have something that's called a packed pod it's very similar hers does um vaporizes it actually does um it heats up the weed it does not burn it there's no combustion yours I believe does oils shell um this is it's more like a think of it more like a dab pen oh okay yeah like a vaporizer yeah this is convection this is convection I got one that's oil right same company same type of concept that's a Pax era that's a Pax era that has Pax pods and you buy them yeah mine's just called a px pod and similar to dab rigs where you can set a temperature based on whether you want like a tpine whether you want to really taste all the turpine so you'd go for a lower temperature or if you want really a to get all the THC where you might go for a higher temperature people can set different temperatures when you're vaporizing flow to again taste a little bit more of the tpin or get get more of the to um get more of that THC into your lungs you can use a higher temperature well the Pax is favorite because it's it's very portable so if you were going to go to a downtown block party or something you can take this and take your little um Bud cups in the little bud cup humidor and you'd have enough you'd be good also if you get to the point where you feel like I need a tea break because I'm coughing or I'm feeling a little respiratory stuff going on this stuff hits ju as close to I mean it's flour you're convecting flour in here it's not a pod you actually grind flour and put it in here so when you feel like your throat needs a little combustion break this sues Menthol oh this is the tastiest way to do weed it's like it's like you get all the tpen and flavonoids and everything and it soothes your throat so I I would would say I'd have to go with the packs if I couldn't pick the bong or joint find someone who has one and try it try one go to a festival once these festivals start and try one there I've never been to a 420 Festival or a cannabis Festival so I might try one on your recommendation because I know they're all over the place here yes especially in Northern California you should definitely look some up they are a lot of fun they are a lot of fun look for one with a good reputation because I'm sure especially now that festivals are coming back there's going to be all sorts of popups

it i' give that [ __ ] away at that right I think that's probably illegal too such [ __ ] I give away my zucchinis I should be able to give away my prize Jack hair buds come on anyway well anyway so you have a crypted story for me this week SH now have you ever heard of a puck wedgie no I've heard the term puck in reference to you know fairies or the Fay a puck wajy so this is a good one I feel like every state has like their own crypted maybe not every state I think you might be right on that I think you're close almost every state has their own yeah there's actually a couple of different areas in the United States that can claim to be home of pajes but for the most part they are commonly thought of as a Massachusetts crypted so your neck of the woods so my neck of the woods they oddly enough kind of already they they seem to gravitate towards areas that are rich in Supernatural lore to begin with I kind of take that as paranormal attracts paranormal you know what I mean so if if if it's a place where maybe there have been alien sightings or ghost sightings it might also be a place that has pues potentially like there's a there's a place called Round Rock Texas also Bigfoot's been spotted there too but pwes and bigfoots seem to go chill and rock around Texas um we'll have to go visit there I don't know what it is about rockr Texas what is a puw so a puw check this out now this is like between three and four feet tall kind of a humanoid shape in in a humanoid type thing kind of could look like maybe an elf slash fairy SL troll okay it is definitely more of like that that evil fairy SL troll persuasion they have like a grayish pale skin that they can illuminate in the woods I don't want to say gloin thee dark because it's not necessarily a glowin the- dark but they can illuminate their skin so they're more humanoid like a like a fairy or a troll rather than um an animal rather than yeah like a Bigfoot or a Sasquatch which is like more of a hairy animal humanoid they're more like a like a people humanoid right they're more like a troll fairy leprechan type thing okay they're kind of kind of along those lines they have a multitude of magical abilities now I know you love this topic orbs I do I love me some orbs hqua use orbs and that's what that's kind of what I ORS yeah like that and that's also what I mean by like they can illuminate their skin they illuminate themselves to look like an orb oh see what what their goal is is they they they want you to die and then they want to collect your soul and I'm just putting that in like nutshell terms that sounds awful what wait a minute hold on hold on wait back whoa whoa whoa you're describing these cute little Elfin humanoids and now you're telling me they want to like kill me yeah yeah I am wow okay hey that that took a turn I was not expecting but what they do is they use orbs and things of that nature to kind of my beloved orbs they've corrupted my orb no stuck you in pull you in to to bring you into the the depths of their web so they're like one of those lantern fish they like put out the the glowy pretty orb and you're like o pretty orb and then you follow it into their deathly clutches correct correct oh that's awful that should be illegal illegal Eagle where are the Men in Black when you need them I mean come on that's bad obviously not in freaking Massachusetts obviously not now not I don't know if you have front of you but like Plymouth Rock y'all heard of Plymouth Rock You Know Plymouth Rock the pilgrims the Mayflower the whole heard of it yeah the one that fell on the native people here correct so so there's this place called hwam Mo swamp I'm probably pronouncing that wrong F so for everybody who knows this place don't hate me don't be a hater oh they'll tell us they have no problem telling us if we mispronounce something please let us know nicely preferably yeah just just be nice because you know I'm not I'm not I don't live in this town I don't know how it's pronounced so we'll call it hakak swamp probably different it's near ROM Massachusetts and it basically the the correlation of Plymouth is it's about 20 miles Inland from Plymouth okay so think of it as like a half hour from Plymouth so there's this guy actually let me back this train up pucka were first kind of found we'll say by the Native Americans and what they would do is the natives would kind of Go off into the woods or into tree infested areas and hear these noises and like Hear Voices but like those voices didn't speak a language per se if that makes sense like you know Native Americans something you could hear what sounds like people talking but not in a language you could recognize correct okay so this this started with the Native Americans and they would follow these voices and then if they saw it at night they'd see these beautiful flashy lights and follow the lights oh no oh no oh no okay so unfortunately not my arms I hate that I don't like puck waggies now that's so rude terrible that's terrible they've stolen the pleasure of your orbs now every time I see an orb instead of being like oh maybe it's a instead of my worst fear being that it's an insect my worst fear it's going to be a [ __ ] Puck Waggy that wants to eat my soul or something ah it's awful what they would do is they would lure off these poor Native American folk and they would either what they would do is they would either lead you to your death by like oh say walking off a cliff or something [ __ ] because what they would do is create a fog and the blinking lights in the fog and when you'd walk in the fog oh there's no land beneath you plunged to your death no that's evil or or they would manipulate you into committing suicide oh that's really terrible oh no so the Native Americans the Native Americans kind of figured all this out and and they learned that is as long as you didn't follow the pucka G seeing one wouldn't kill you you could encounter one but don't ever follow it kind of thing say no to the pucky say no to the pwy do not follow that orb take a picture of the orb don't follow it right you just kind of be like yeah I ain't happening and and you don't I know your game puck Wy [ __ ] you but of course as you can imagine you know oh that's not true I'm gonna follow it and then you're dead there's always someone there's always someone in the crowd that has to touch the cursed chair or talk to the cursed doll or challenge the [ __ ] Puck wajy yeah always one in every crowd so you know and as you can imagine these are like like I can't remember the exact year the freaking Mayflower landed but we're talking this has been going on for hundreds of years because this was happening to the natives before before the the pilgrims came so then enter the pilgrims then I guess what the Indians did was when some of the quote unquote Pilgrim white man were pissing them off they would kind of lead them to the puck wedgies and let the puck wedgie take care of it what [ __ ] man you're like hey we know enough not to follow the puck Wy you invading [ __ ] don't okay smart I think that's smart so they kind of believed that the natives kind of went along a premise of to leave them alone just leave them alone when you see it you just you don't mess with them you know you just you just leave them alone you go away quick and and the natives were able to kind of I don't want to say live in harmony with them but kind of avoid any mishaps with them so the pilgrims come Massachusetts get settled there's still sightings of the puck waggies people disappear people kill themselves you know things are happening people walk off cliffs they're victims of here's another thing they're they're supposedly able to create fire arrows and have little knives and there have been people that had been found with they they died of small knife wounds but don't know why Wow W the thing was is that they were once friendly to humans but then turned against them um now you know they kidnpped they say why you know what happened to turn them against humans other than we suck and probably are destroying where they live you know I wasn't able to find the exact origin but it had to do with the [ __ ] um the [ __ ] Indian tribe that is near like Cape Cod like the tip the top of Cape Cod like Plymouth area that native tribe uh it had something to do with children being kidnapped I think that someone kidnapped them and it was blamed on the puck wagies but they didn't do it but got blamed for it and then kind of I see you know there is a long long history of of Fay and Fay type creatures stealing human babies there's a lot of tales of Fay being baby snatchers so I'm not surprised that they were accused of that but they weren't they were innocent and so they they got mad over it you know the the the crazy thing is is so you know this this is happening throughout the years and all that but as as recently is 1995 I was reading about an eyewitness uh statement from 1995 we go from you know the pilgrims to like literally present day and it's still going on wow still going on there was this man uh named Bill Russo and he lived next to the hawach swamp in ROM mass and in 1995 he had was working a second shift and he had gotten home around midnight 1:00 a.m. and when he got home he decided to take a walk in the woods with his dog because he didn't usually work that shift and he was in the habit of as soon as he got home from work he would take the dog out so even though it was late at night he decided he was taking the dog out anyway so about 1 one in the morning they're walking towards that swamp now this man has even suggested that building and and changing the area could be contributing to some of this because that swamp land was much larger than it is to today because they just keep building and shrinking that Wildlife Area they're losing their habitat you know they're kind of being invaded basically right right so he's walking through the woods all of a sudden there's this big Mist in front of him that wasn't necessarily before like a fog when it wasn't necessarily foggy before and the dog starts barking and crying and trying to force him to turn around and run home and is like pulling to run towards the direction of the house you know when animals react that's something that really that really hits me because animals are sensitive to things and if they're reacting like that to fog there's something run run [ __ ] okay there's definitely something going if your dog is reacting to what looks like nothing there's something going on yeah so the dog is like acting scared Bill Bill began hearing what sounded like a voice calling to him um but again it wasn't necessarily in a language that was understandable but he could tell that this voice was trying to entice him and he felt like the voice was like basically saying we want you not I want you but we want you oh wow yeah and then he said that a three to four foot creature uh became began walking towards him from the Mist he said no [ __ ] it was not necessarily an animal but it had attri rutes of an animal and that it appeared friendly but was far from it so this is actually now it's making it sound a little more beastial more did he say like what about it was animal likee like did it have fur or horns well here's the thing like they can they can supposedly shapeshift and they are known to to to shape shift frequently into porcupines he almost the way he described it would be almost if you were to combine a porcupine and a human like if you had a little tiny little human that had porcupine spines up its back in back of its head kind of oh how cute interesting which I guess is what kind of makes it fall into the crypted category they are able to shape shift are able to disappear they can appear on the left at one second and then on the right the next second oh that sounds that sounds very creepy that would freak me out my cat does that and it freaks me out bill stood there and looked at him for he thought was was three to five minutes of him trying and and there was lights trying to guide him into the mist and he said that because he had grown up in that area he had known the lore he had heard the stories and when he realized the situation he was truly in and that it was actually the puck Wy that he had always heard about he turned around and ran home um and this is like this is like a 55 60y old man like we're not not talking about a teenager here how scary good thing he knew what to do and not to follow it basically because it was like a local quote unquote urban legend that he had heard about and he was like oh my God this is what I'd always heard about I always heard don't follow it or you die so he didn't follow it but in in in Indiana I guess there's some puw in Indiana and they actually on the roads have signs that say puw Crossing no way it like deer Crossings in New York oh wow that's wild but there's also another man uh that went to the same location um Andrew Lake and Andrew Lake claims to have photographic evidence of the puck Wy yeah which actually I saw it and it kind of yeah I I'm with the guy now this was more recent this was in 2008 a paranormal group a local paranormal group called New England ghost project they actually are a paranormal group that works with a psychic as well they were looking to go to this area not necessarily for the puck wedgies um but they were looking to go to contact some Native American Spirits from the land and there is video of all of a sudden where the psychic is physically attacked by what appears to be nothing no [ __ ] to the point where some of the people that were with them had to kind of restrain the person and in the background they zoomed in and it did look like a a part porcupine part humanoid being in the bushes off to the side they actually can see it the thing that attachs her in the bushes oh wow and like I said this was from 2008 um the paranormal group New England uh ghost project and and I understand that [ __ ] can be doctor but the video is pretty compelling pretty compelling wow that's amazing that's wild but for centuries the puck wages tormented the Native Americans on that land like I said they can appear and disappear transform into different animals damn and here's the thing and this is why they want you to [Music] die there's a reason oh okay well as long as they have a reason why they need you to die they're basically like soul collectors like they take the souls so like they want to kill you so they can steal your soul so they don't just kill you they like take your soul yeah worse that is that is objectively worse they don't want you just dead they want your soul too ew what did they do with the souls I don't know I didn't like phone a friend and ask they haven't like left any evidence as to why they haven't said hey we stole you know Mr Smith's Soul because we're using them to make pretty necklaces or anything they haven't said why haven't said why and as far as Massachusetts goes you know I I I kind of talked about that the two guys that had the experiences um near rain him Massachusetts which is down like near Fall River like Lizzy bordon area yeah um but they've also been been seen in Framingham and Totton and Freetown which are like like Framingham is not terribly far from me oh you're not going to go Puck wajy hunting right just tell meich please that you're not going Puck waji hunting so I was telling my boyfriend last night that I was doing a story on the puck wood sheet today oh no tell me you didn't tell me you're not going to he's like we should go look for pck and I'm like what the hell are we gonna do I'm like they'll kill us and make us like walk off a cliff and take our souls and he's like we just won't follow the orbs he's like we'll take pictures and then we'll leave oh my goodness you being the calm one the sober one the sane one in this instance frightens me frightens me very much it should it should that is not a good sign but you know these these things um disclaimer by the stoned witch's hour do not go hunting the puck wajy do not follow the orbs in the woods do not go looking for any type of Fay that wants to suck your soul this has been a public service announcement by the stoned Witches Hour thank you yeah what she said right but they have actually been like they've been do not recommend they've been compared to Massachusetts version of the leprechaun like and seen that movie they can be scary they're nasty like they're tricksters they're they're they're nasty and apparently you can lose your mind before you die and there has been people that actually were able to regain their sense of confusedness um and get away from them paji bad news no bueno that is a great story the puck waji freaking scary I mean damn here's the thing like there's like like they've seen them in Indiana and they've seen them in Texas I guess they're like predominantly a Massachusetts thing but kind of like Bigfoot like how Bigfoot is generally Northwest there are sightings all over of Bigfoot same thing pajes are generally Massachusetts but they have been in other parts of the country some of them have migrated to further parts and but most of them are in one area I just like saying the word pwy pwy that's that blows my mind and it's so scary and how could they do that to my beloved orbs so rude mean well you know what you're just you're just gonna have to you're just gonna have to go meet a puck wagi and [ __ ] about your orb issue how could you I'll just have to give them a talking to maybe over a nice joint maybe they like bongs better do you think p bugies with like a joint a pipe or a bong I think they're more like a pipe kind of person because if they're more like a trolly kind of Elfie person like the old grandpa pipe that goes down and you know goes think so if I ever encounter a pug wajy hopefully my husband will be with me because he always has a packed bowl and we can just offer this dude a packed Bowl be like okay hold on the soul thing let's smoke some of this good ganja let's talk about this what do you need the souls for to kind of segue into into your story um they're one of the places where Puck wedgies are found in near uh Freetown Massachusetts in a near What's called the Bridgewater Triangle which we're going to do another podcast on the Bridgewater Triangle that's another show another day anything with triangle in it you know has some sort of creepy stories attached well not only does it have um the the cryptoid there and and some you know Puck waggies but it's also a site of um uh UFOs as well ah interesting that well like you said that the puck wedgies tend to be found in places where other Supernatural events are occurring as well right so you know I I would have to I I I should do some digging when I look into the Bridgewater Triangle um and see if there's any correlation with the puck wedgies and and some UFOs you know have they been chatting with the aliens like is this some plot to steal our soul like what's up here I need to know like I was talking about in our Roswell incident episode as soon as I start looking at alien UFO or abduction incidents there are so many there are so many all across the country that it it just it it's hard to narrow it down so I think I have an interesting kind of story for you this week about alien shell but this is by no means a comprehensive story or this is just one small tip of of a many pointed iceberg the problem with alien stories is once you dig into one thing it leads you down a rabbit hole of like 20 other different things oh my goodness and that's exactly what happened here I I started out with one idea and oh my goodness I just went down to so many and familiar things too like Project Blue Book that we talked about before and the um and the mj12 group that we've talked about everything seems to kind of lead back to those every single time and and there's just so many you could get lost in this Maze of so I'm going to try and just stick to one little part of it and so please keep in mind this is just one part of a very much larger many tentacle story oh actually so I wanted to start out with um I guess we're not supposed to call them UFOs anymore shell what are we calling them right UFO is unidentified flying object right but it's unidentified and it's a flying object that's true now they they like to use the term UAP which is unidentified aerial phenomen what the hell because sometimes it's not necessarily an object it might be a something that happens like in space I don't know like maybe a light flare or something so unidentified aerial phenomena is now more UAP instead of UFO use UAP you're now you're in the no I'm just learning about cultivars here people now we're changing the alien [ __ ] too oh my goodness oh my God so so yeah so uaps I'll probably still call them UFOs but uh so we talked before about Project Blue Book which is the code name for a um a group that studied unidentified flying objects it was done by the United States Air Force and it was from March in 1952 and it ended right around December 17th 1969 and it was created following like all the UFO sightings that happened during and after World War II you know again we talked a little bit about the Roswell incident and everything that happened around that time and so they created Project Blue Book which for a long time they denied the existence of which recently we have found is actually a real group and they have released several UAP sightings UFO sightings and stories that they have classified as unsolvable or you know unable to be unable to be determined so I've got a few of those stories here for you oh okay right so even our government says that these are true so the one I'm going to start with is a kind of fun this is Ned the alien and this is where I kind of started my search I heard about Ned the alien in a place called Aurora Texas and there's a grave site to Ned the alien and he's one of the very first recorded alien sightings and UFO sightings in the United States there's actually a newspaper article dated April 17th 1897 from again Aurora Texas is said that around 6:00 a.m. a craft was seen flying through Aurora Texas erratically and kind of low to the ground and it was unlike any type of craft they had ever seen before and it was kind of emitting its own light and it crashed into a windmill so when the town's people went to see what this was they could obviously see that the craft was something they had could not recognize had never seen before and it was so badly damaged that they couldn't even tell what it was made out of the pilot of the ship was deceased unfortunately and Al though he had been hurt in the crash it was very obvious to tell that he was not human it was some sort of alien and in the newspaper article they even say that one of the um the police officers or government government officials that was there at the time said in his opinion it was a native of the planet Mars and they actually buried this alien in a cemetery in Aurora Texas and the grave site is still there they've done ground penetrating radar and can tell that there is a small body buried there however they're not able to exume this body because Texas law says that you have to notify a NEX of kin and get permission in order to exume a grave and nobody knows any of Ned the alien's relatives in order to get permission to exume the Grave so best they can do I have no words for this okay zero words other than tell I he's my cousin so so Ned the alien is my cousin so I'm going to go down there with little sand Shuffle and we're g to dig them up so you can go and see in Aurora Texas you can go see the grave site of Ned the alien do he have a headstone he did and it disappeared there's now a rock on the spot where his grave is supposed to be what what year did they say he was buried there this happened in 1897 it's in was in the paper well if it was in the news it must be true right that's not NE but you know hey there's a body there we don't know we don't know that it's not true could be a hoax absolutely but I think that that's interesting that especially in the late 1800s and the early 1900s a lot of these things would make the paper people would go and would say hey wow yeah that is something I've never seen before that's a metal that's never SE been seen before and hey that is a government official taking something away and they'd write about it in the paper whereas you don't hear so much about it now so the next story is um it was 1941 again it was the' 40s during the World War II and afterwards that a lot of UFO s sightings really started to happen repeatedly in the US it started to become an epidemic of UFO sightings at that time and during World War II there happened something called The Battle of Los Angeles so the Battle of Los Angeles is actually one of the first and most mysterious Mass UAP sightings in the nation's history after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941 everybody in the country was really jumpy especially Coastal military people so they were on high alert and a few months later February 23rd in 1942 a Japanese submarine actually surfaced off the coast of Santa Barbara California and bombed an oil field and Refinery off the coast yes and that was the first time that that Mainland us had had been physically attacked so again tempers and and tensions are high a couple days later after the submarine attack outside of Santa Barbara about 2: a.m. on February 25th 1942 military radar picked up enemy aircraft about 120 miles off the coast of Los Angeles so they immediately go to the air raid sirens they start to warn everybody they do a whole blackout on the city lock everything down and within minutes uh troops have manned anti-aircraft guns and they're sweeping the skies with search lights looking for this aircraft that they've picked up 120 M away less than an hour later about 3:00 a.m. the the witching hour reports come in of an unidentified aircraft off the coast and troops in Santa Monica see these aircraft come in in open fire and then down the coast other defense stations open fire as well as they start seeing these aircraft Witnesses at the time described the sirens there's air raid sirens there's smoke from artillery there's aircraft they they talk about seeing formations of six Japanese aircraft in the sky over Los Angeles there was um shells that were raining down causing damage search lights going everywhere in this blacked out City it was chaos for about an hour there were reports that there were aircraft flying directly over the city and even that one had crashed on the streets in Hollywood some people described paratroopers uh enemy paratroopers coming down in the city terrible scary absolute chaos then as Dawn came up after this fight and the attack has ended the city started cleaning up and they discovered there's only our shells our artillery there's no enemy aircraft down there's no enemy people there's no bullets or any evidence there there had ever been any enemy airplane in the area even though multiple Witnesses had seen them flying the official report said that there were no aircraft that it was all due to nerves even though radar had caught the aircraft there were multiple eyewitnesses saying that they had seen aircraft the official statement went out that it there was nothing there however military people including the Secretary of War Henry Stimson said that at least 15 planes had been reported cited over Los Angeles so what happened where did those planes go a lot of people think that they were um alien aircraft and that was one of the first sightings so a couple years later a civilian pilot Ken arold was flying his personal aircraft around Mount rer in Washington and on June 24th he reported seeing nine blue glowing objects that were flying really fast which was uh I saw some estimates that said 1,700 mph in a V formation so he thinks again World War right after World War II so it's right after World War II ended so again this is around the time when this rash of sightings is happening so he thinks maybe these nine blue glowing objects are possibly some sort of military aircraft and he reports it and he's told that there were no flight tests being conducted near Mount brainer at that time and he's talking to a reporter he talked about how the Craft's motion looked to him as if it was a disc a saucer the way they moved was like a saucer when you skipped it across the water oh and that's the origin of the Flying Saucer term when people discussed UFO and so people Ed that phrase to picture like a flying disc even though most reports that talk about these aircraft talk about them as Crescent including Kenneth Arnold he said it was more like a crescent shape but his description of how they moved as as a saucer skipping across water is why people think of a a flying disc shaped thing I gota I thought it was because it looked like a paper plate nope that's why they thought it looked like a paper plate because of the way he described how it moved cuz remember that back in like the 50s they used to think they were like two paper plates on top of each flip yeah that's that's exactly where that movie idea came from was his description of a of the saucer skipping across water way that they moved that's why they started depicting it that way even though his description of the craft talks about it being a crescent shape gotcha so that just kind of got into the popular lexicon even though it wasn't necessarily true so soon after he did that report other people cited them there was a lot of credible sightings including from a commercial airline pilot um a prospector up on Mount Adams also saw these nine blue fast moving objects and it was a few weeks after that that the supposed Roswell crash happened oh so right around the same time period so there was a lot there there was multiple activities around that time period that's correct there was a flurry of it around that time and that's when uh Lazar and all the people talk about having worked on secret places in Area 51 and in the Roswell area all of this all of this is getting Declassified now yes and and interestingly enough someone whose experience I'm going to talk about here do you want to know how Blink 182 was in involved what Travis Barker T not Travis Barker not his guitarist but we're I'm gonna let you know how how uh Blink 182 is involved with aliens we so we'll get there a couple decades later in 19 64 an incident that ufology groups call one of the most credible UFO encounters on record happened and this one is also was researched by Project Blue Book and they listed the case as unknown so they weren't able to solve this or figure out what caused it it's called The Lani Zamora incident one of the most credible UFO sightings ever April 24th 1964 officer Lonnie Zamora is on his shift and he's following a speeding car and he calls in to dispatch because he sees what he thinks is um an accident happening about a half a mile off the road so he stops chasing the speeding car and he calls into dispatch and says he's going to go down into the yoyo and search out this and see what happened with this accident he says he gets down to this accident and he sees two people dressed in what he said were kind of like some sort of overall work type clothes standing next next to what he thought was an overturned car at first and then as he gets closer he realized he didn't recognize what type of vehicle it was at all was some sort of round shiny vehicle that looked like it had uh like the underside of a car on top car parts you know like car guts on top of it yeah which is why he thought it was like a flipped over car and as he got closer he said this object went straight up and looked like it had fire coming from beneath it he was so perplexed by this that he he radiated dispatch again and said that he had gone down to the accident site and asked them if they could see anything going up into the sky and they didn't but they asked him what he saw and he said it looked like something shooting straight up into the sky and when other officers got there they did notice burn marks on the ground and smoldering Bush and Scorch marks and the people the two people that Zamora had seen were nowhere to be found oh wow so I guess he had originally when he thought it was an accident what he had originally seen was like what looked like an explosion like a a bright fiery ball and a a roar of sound and so he thought that was what the original accident was and when he got to that site that's when he saw the overturned or what he thought was an overturned vehicle and it just went straight up with fire shooting out of it and the people disappeared that would be I would be rattled i' beatt so this made news it made the news at the time and UFO investigators and organizations and even the US Project Blue Book investigated it and were unable to find a cause for this so it's still listed as unknown in that now Declassified Project Blue Book I would love for them to like gather up some of these people and do like present day interviews now that they're because like back then like they were threatened like the government threatened their lives there are some modern day one of uh a couple of the people I'm going to talk about now are present day people including Tom dong the guitarist for Blink 182 uh he was part of Blink 182 in 1999 when they released enema of the state interestingly enough on that album is a song called aliens are real so dong has long has been an alien believer for a very long time he himself says he has had an Alien Encounter he told The Hollywood Reporter in 2015 that not too long before that he had been on a camping trip to Nevada's area 5 one with some friends and he says that um he was in his tent and he woke up but he wasn't able to move he felt like his whole body was like full of static electricity and all he was able to do was open his eyes and he could hear he'd only gone there with two friends and he could hear what sounded like 20 or so people outside his tent talking around the stillo campfire all he could make out was that they were they were trying to do something they were trying to work something out and he couldn't quite make out what they were saying and he said he blinked sounds like sleep paralysis which is a common theme some people claim that it's just sleep paralysis other people claim that sleep paralysis is a a Hallmark of some type of Alien Encounter or alien abduction uh particularly in someone who's never had sleep paralysis before or since it's definitely interesting but that certainly could be an explanation and he says he had about three hours of lost time oh my God this and other things that happened to him led him to found to the Stars Academy and this group according to the independent is a group that collects documents and physical materials from public and private sources relating to unidentified aerial phenomena and it consists of former officials from the Pentagon and the CIA as well as specialists in the fields of science from physics to biomedical research and so dong is part of this group and they launched themselves in 2017 and they said that they would provide evidence and release video which actually prove that UFOs exist that UFO encounters have happened and that our government is trying to cover it up at that 2017 launch they released these two videos filmed by US Navy pilots in 2004 and 2015 and it caused a huge sensation at the time and then in 2020 the US Navy acknowledged that the footage was real and the phenomena that's scen on this video is indeed unidentified and they don't know what caused it oh my God the 2004 Video released by Tom dong and to the Stars Academy is called the nimit video and it is Sensational and it has caused quite a stir nits because that's the name of the ship I believe okay and it has caused quite a stir in the UFO or UAP Community because the government's even said it's real and I'll post a link to the video itself so that you can look at it but what the video is on November 10th 2004 radar operator Ken Day first reported seeing some uh really odd objects in the air that he didn't know what it was they were very slow moving so too slow moving to be aircraft too high there were 28,000 ft in the air so too high to be Birds they were flying in formation small groups of roughly 5 to 10 and they were near San Clemente Island which is U west of the San Diego coast oh wow they were traveling um about 138 miles an hour so again too slow to be conventional aircraft too fast and too high to be birds and they didn't have any conventional flight path what did they do did they like use like a radar detector to see how fast they were going yes and they also sent aircraft up to take a look and see what they are and that's the that's the video that you're able to see is this these flight videos looking at these Tic Tac shaped aircraft that are moving erratically and although they might be moving slow at first they are capable of tremendous speed and it said that the their maneuvering and their propulsion is far beyond anything that we could ever do they don't have any type of heat signature they're definitely an object in the sky you can see the the video go through like infrared and different types of video different ways of looking at this object and it just moves and then takes off in a way that is not possible by any of our aircraft the Nimitz video has been proven to and has been admitted by the government back in 2020 that it's real and it was first broken in 2017 by Blink 182 guitarist Tom dong and his his group to the Stars Academy now another really interesting provable thing is the Wilson documents the Wilson Davis documents or the ewd notes and these are documents that came out uh in 2016 it's a 13 pages of notes letters and documents written by Dr Eric Davis who had had a meeting in 2002 with Admiral Wilson Admiral Wilson was the director of intelligence for The Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1997 to 1999 and he was also the 13th director of the defense intelligence agency from 1999 to 2002 so definitely connected knew his [ __ ] knew what he was talking about this discussion they talked about UFOs and Roswell and alien autopsies and the mj12 group and UFO crashes and they talked about these things and all the groups that had been formed to study them and it just blows my mind that that all this stuff it's right there they talk about how these projects these government projects were developed to study alien crash sites they were developed to study alien bodies and to reverse engineer alien technology and in this discussion they even talked about how things like lasers and and integrated chips for computers were reverse engineered Tech from Aliens and that's why our technology had such a huge leap these pages and notes were found amongst the um the things of a Dr Edgar Mitchell and he was the fourth man to walk on the moon and a scientist also who worked with the government and he was involved in a lot of these groups and so these papers that were supposed to have been hidden away were kind of discovered in his personal effects after he died and those were found to also would be credible more proof that Roswell really happened they mentioned the crash site in Roswell it mentions mj12 and it it corroborates a lot of this stuff from like Bob Lazar might be true that the government has been studying these things from the beginning and it's just interesting to me that you know since 2020 all these videos are coming out that the government is saying yes we know that these unidentified aerial phenomena happen we know that they're true and we can't explain all of them and we we've even developed groups like Project Blue Book to to that we previously denied existed to study them yeah but it's just so interesting that now all these things are coming out and all these people that were deemed crazy all these years they weren't right you know they they for a long time denied that these things happened they would say it was a weather balloon or you were imagining it but you know now they're saying well yes we did have Tech that that you didn't know about we just Li about it or you know yes we you know we did know that there was an unidentified object flying around the nits and we lied about it but now we're you know okay here's the video and we have to kind of say it's true and I I think that's it's been such a cover up and so it's hard to know what to believe because every things that they denied and strident denied and tried to say that people were crazy for believing now they've completely changed their tune and are saying oh yeah well lied they were telling the truth and we were the ones lying so how are you supposed to trust anything it's it's it's hard to believe anything you know because it's just so Fantastical I don't even know yeah that's the government for you yeah but blank 182 and aliens are real who would have thought I had no idea that he was trying to tell us something you know music is a part of everything including aliens right he was right on his group in 2017 broke that Nimitz video and the government themselves had to say that it was true that's just that's amazing that's wild to me and stuff like that still happens in this day and age but you know then you've got Puck waggies trying to entice people off to their doom and give up their souls so and they haven't been found yet so who knows right there's more things in Heaven and Earth Horatio than in your philosophy or something like that I don't know what's more frightening right now aliens or buck wagies no I pck waggies definitely have it I I don't want anything snatch in my soul it sounds like the aliens just kind of buzz by and freak people out with how fast they can go you know I can handle that I don't know about getting my soul snatched though I might have to give this one to the east coast y I had to give you one sometime I knew it I knew the puw G would get you yeah it definitely did it well it corrupted my beloved orbs and now I can't look at orbs the same way anymore I'm so sad about that yeah but don't you just want to go and see if we could find one we don't have to follow the orbs but don't you want to just go no I don't no no I don't I don't like tempting fate like that that was a little too that's a little too scary I like my soul right where it is thank you I'm G to just keep it right there but uh all right good point good point well that's all for this episode of the stoned Witches Hour thank
