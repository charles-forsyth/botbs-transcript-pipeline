weren't really originally from different coasts that's just where we are now but I am wonderful on the east coast and then guess who's on the west coast guess guess guess tell us that would be me I'm Leila your host with the most on the west coast with the best weed and the witchiest scariest stories yeah but I have the best haunts over here on the East Coast so yeah whatever and the best Cryptids I've been told I our listeners do tell us you have the best crypted stories so I am going to try and rest that Crown from you but for now you are queen crypted I am queen crypted but we've got something to do before we get back into my crazy crypted tales and that is our very last Salem episode our last one this is a bummer this is very much a bummer like you need to stay in we need to be in the same town all the time how much F I was looking at real estate while I was there I mean it's way too pricey for me but I was looking at it and honestly I think our listeners get a kick out of when we're together because I think we're way more I don't know Reckless that's a good word yeah maybe going to Gallows Hill at midnight on a full moon could be called Reckless I suppose what are you talking about everybody's doing it du or it could just be called a good time right but yeah I I we're going to have to do this again because I am not done hanging out and seeing all the sites in Salem there's so much more to see there's so much we didn't get to talk about or show on our Channel and of course I miss hanging out with you I already miss you I know it's a bummer and and you know we did we have touched on a lot of I don't want to say the famous places but the famous places yeah so what we're going to do tonight is we're going to kind of talk about some random lesser known places we visited places that you just thought were the coolest we're just gonna talk about wrapping up in Salem I love it I think that's a perfect idea just to wrap up episode 40 oh my God 40 40 this is episode 40 of the stoned Witches Hour yeah and we're still doing really good I can't believe it so you know hi Israel hi Ireland hi Australia and New Zealand in in my favorite country England that's true don't forget the Commonwealth of Canada oh yes no we have lots of friends in Canada Poland Germany Italy thank you guys Tokyo thank you guys so much there's some more I'm sure that I'm forgetting Brazil Mexico Greece you guys are awesome this has been such a trip so thank you all for joining us and sharing in our spooky stories and we hope we make you laugh at least a little bit we make ourselves laugh right that's the important part um and you see any cool costumes downtown today I saw the most amazing vampire ever really like a lat type vampire yeah or a sparkly vampire no like a lat type vampire o do tell do tell this guy this wasn't a costume this was an outfit oh like a vampire came to town and dressed in his best yeah this was not like I went to Spirit and bought some [ __ ] this guy like had this [ __ ] in his closet I swear to God or in his coffin yeah right like you know the roughly necked shirt oh some guys can really pull that off that flouncy necked pirate type shirt but then like his inner jacket had like the the the flaps pulled up and they went just above that fluffy neck but then he had like a long black trench coat on with it oh he actually had fangs nice well yeah I'd expect it how was he walking out during the daytime I don't even know how this guy was out during the day they do have really good SPF sunscreen now so maybe that was it well I think he just ate also oh that'll help that'll help because he had like two little drips of blood oh so he must have just fed and I've heard in some legends that allows them to walk during the daytime well and I also think that they have like context they can put in that blocks out the Sun so that they can kind of meld in with society makes sense makes sense I mean this guy was topnotch like he had this like cane and it wasn't like like a old person cane it was like one of those like thin like you could whip it out and it could be like a Rapier any second yeah yeah like one of those like like Ballo by the time it's at the bottom kind of thing this guy was topnotch I like it that sounds awesome I love the costumes you get to see and say but you know you know what I saw multiples of today Sanderson sisters believe it or not no no Sanderson sisters today wow everybody is wearing skeleton costumes men women children big little old young I love skeletons I'm wearing my skeleton sweater right now I love bones I think bones are the coolest it was like the black one piece with like the rib cage like actual skeleton like the leg bones multiple people today but nobody had like a face mask now see things seem to come in waves there the other day you said you saw a lot of crows people were a lot of people dressed in C costumes now it seems to be a lot of skeleton cost it was like freaking skeleton day in Downtown Salem and just the other day it was Sanderson Sister's Day you saw like hundreds of them it's been in a way you're right now that I think about it and you point it out it has been a way of like that but I'm looking and I'm like wow there's another one and I'm like wow there's another one yeah like skeleton day in Salem oh I love that I wish I could have seen it but unfortunately our time in Salem together has come to a close boo nobody likes that part no so now that we're smoking separately I have had to uh get my own weed again speaking of my own weed I have some very very purple straw nana I don't know why it came out so purple this time but it is deep dark Violet purple and I'll have to show you some but uh pretty soon I'll be able to smoke on that o so what are you smoking on over there shell tonight I'm just smoking some Grandpa cookies oh was this the one that was like Grandpa cookies one through 12 or whatever right this time this time I have 12 I think I'm gonna call this a sleepy it's a sleepy one it's sleepy it's a little sleepy this is from Happy Valley right right right my favorite I remember because I love the grandpa cookies feno hunt I thought that was such a cool idea so they're still doing that they as far as I'm aware there has been no results yet did you vote on their Facebook page does anyone still do Facebook yeah our age group does Facebook I don't know if the kids still do I voted on my first purchase I have not voted on this current batch gotcha did you get anything other than cookies 12 Granda cookies 12 not this time because I'm in between paychecks oh I hear that good gracious why is weed so expensive I am so glad that I have an almost done crop I mean granted the straw Nana finished earlier than everything else but I have got some Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] and some um I just want to smoke something that's called Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] just because of the name I don't know if this is really Alaskan [ __ ] or not because apparently that's kind of a possibly lost strain or maybe you can only get that in Alaska I'm not sure but that's what I was told so we'll see how that comes out and then I have some Gorilla Glue and something else growing that I don't remember but you know I'm really glad that I have stuff ready to harvest because these prices are killing me yeah right all right so with your sleepy weed and with my Sunset cake that I spent way too much money on my nice little indicia I don't know if you can see my little eyes here like it half Mass so I know it's going pretty good my little eyelids are all heavy and I'm just all pass I think we both got the Sleepy weed today sleepy weed right before we got on I was looking through my notes about my man Giles Corey and I know one of the things we're going to talk about tonight is where his pressing took place what our theories are our Theory our Theory yeah what some of the popular theories are what our theories are and maybe anything that we felt innate different areas and some of the like you said some of the more hidden gems of Salem that are off the beaten path that not a lot of tourists go to which might give you a little bit of a better Vibe like it's fun to go downtown and have the very Commercial Salem vibe to go through the historical buildings and see all of that I love that so so much but it's also fun to wander away from that too yes and I loved having you and your love as guides I mean I've been to some of these outof the way cemeteries but being able to go there with you guys and go on these little hidden side roads where we saw some what was it Hof and Horn hien Forge Forge they were beautiful and they're not on the main strip and and there's just some really nice places that are a little quieter and in my estimation that makes you better able to kind of feel the vibe kind of feel the energy of the place a little easier without all the noise of the crowd there is a place I wanna I just want to just briefly touch on we're not going to talk about it a whole lot and we did not go inside you started off off with your man chares Corey oh yeah so we in our minds us personally feel like we have debunked that he had been pressed up on Gallows Hill yes so the next theory is that he was pressed at the sight of what's currently modern day the witch dungeon now I'm going to quickly debunk that theory by saying now no go ahead was the witch dungeon uh Sheriff Corwin's house no the witch dungeon was nothing the witch dungeon was built in modern times there was no dungeon there was no witches and dungeons like this was not a real thing people like every time like I I look outside when I'm downtown and I'm like the trolley goes by and I'm like there was no dungeon so I they do say that though I'm pretty sure even though it's called that I'm pretty sure they most tour guides do tell you that there's no dungeon my in my own mind I'm debunking the witch dungeon is a current location but one place I would like to to just kind of we'll talk about how we felt Howard Street Cemetery now Howard Street cemetery is one of the theorized places of the pressing and that is actually a theory that I tend to believe I as well so the first reason I believe it is because the proximity to the old J um it's right behind it they weren't looking to kill him and leave him and throw him in a ditch they were looking for a confession so that they could persecute him they weren't they weren't looking to just ditch his body they were they were looking to keep him now Giles Corey actually went to jail after his wife Martha brigh had been in jail he actually testified against her kind of at her one of her trials now back in the summer of 1692 that's a shitty husband can I just point that out that's a shitty husband it is he didn't really say anything badly about her he did say that he saw her in front of the fireplace kneeling as if she was in prayer but not saying anything and so they took that as being like testimony against her he also said that one time he was saying a scripture and she came up to him and said that he had said it wrong and so she was just really correcting how he had said that particular scripture but again they took that as not wanting him to say scripture so they would say things that he had said out of context not necessarily that he had testified against her they had both been going to the trials prior to this but Martha brigh his wife had become kind of disillusioned of them very very quickly and realized that something was wrong here that this was not a good thing yeah but that made her a Target exactly it really did so she tried to get him to stay away and because she was speaking out against it you're exactly right it made her a Target and Giles must have seen something coming because he then deed his land to his um to his son-in-laws uh so that if he got accused which he then did they wouldn't be able to take his land so what happened with these regular people being accused of Witchcraft you would go before someone and they'd say hey we have this evidence against you these girls say that you came to them in spirit form and made them sign a a witch's book you could either say you were innocent and which case you would then have to go to trial or you could say that you were guilty and you were sorry and you would just go to jail I have a question sure am I not a witch because I never signed any witch's book according to the Puritans according to the Puritans you're not a witch you thank you thank you I'm sure anything that else that came out of your mouth because I know you they'd be like witch they'd be so scared of you they would immediately anyway but as far as signing the devil's book no you are not a witch in their eyes so what they would do then is if you said you were innocent which a lot of people did because lying was a sin to the Puritans and they did they didn't want to do that but if you said you were innocent you then got tortured by Sheriff Corwin or judge Corwin or someone there because they were then trying to determine if you're a witch and so so if you quote unquote or following the law of the Lord and telling the truth unconditionally you're going to get whipped for it yes yes they would torture you no wonder they didn't want to be Christians testimony of people having to hold their arms out and and hold like heavy weights for hours historians have testimony of these boys being tied neck to ankles backwards uh until blood would come out of their nose they would whip them they would do that the infamous dunkings where they would kind of dunk you underwater with like a seesaw and if you drowned you were innocent obviously but if you were able to swim to the surface or come up for air that must have been magic so you're guilty so people who said they were innocent had all sorts of horrific things happen to them and then they'd be hung people very quickly were like yo I'm guilty I am so sorry I did all that [ __ ] put me in jail and uh I'll get back because it was easier that way [ __ ] I would I would say yes I I'm like oh let's see I can get tortured and then hung and they're going to take all my [ __ ] away or I can just go to jail for a little while and maybe lose my property but I get to live all right I'm down I did it especially in those times exactly so Giles saw which way the wind was blowing and he also knew okay he wasn't possibly the greatest dude ever he did get in trouble decades earlier for beating I don't know if he beat him to death or beat him almost to death but he had an indentured servant which is bad enough that he either Beat to Death Or beat almost to death and so so he knew that because of that prior issue that more lik than not he was going to get in trouble and they they were going to hang him as a witch and take a bad reputation already exactly so I've heard some accounts say that he said he was innocent and then that was the last he spoke after you entered a plea of not guilty they would then say okay do you agree to a trial by jury and that's where he stayed silent you have to answer yes to go to court that's right you have to answer yes or no in order to go to court and so he did something where he abstained from speaking he stood mute and so because he stood mute they couldn't try him he had to say and so they were allowed to um torture him now at this time he had been in jail for about 5 months or so with his wife and so just like you said my theory has always been they would not have taken him very far away from the jail if what they're if what they're after is making him say let's go to trial they're not going to want to go very far they want drag his ass to I think they wanted they wanted to make a spectacle of him because of his Defiance in in admitting he wouldn't admit it and he was defiant he was being the mute guy so they wanted to make an example they're not going to make an example where no one can see that exactly he knew that if he said he was guilty or that if he went to trial and was found guilty that they would take all of his property and his family would lose out he also was a very proud man and so he would not have wanted to to have that kind of stain on him I guess he would much rather stand mute and refuse to just go to trial then actually have that happen a pride thing a pride thing so they then took him out back in my assumption of the jail and then they placed a board on his chest and started placing stones on it over the course of 3 days and during that time he only ever called out for more weight and you know I think that is I don't want to say commendable but that's the thing that sticks out I think with him more than I don't want to say more than any of the other accused but he was just like you know what if you're gonna accuse me and I didn't do this [ __ ] you more weight more weight [ __ ] yep and that's that's what I admire as well he wanted to help his family he wanted to make sure that this court that he knew was completely Bonkers completely you were either guilty or dead those are your options guilty or dead Not only was his name going to be sullied his family's name would be sullied and his family would be deprived of the farm and the livelihood that he had built for them and so his stubborn ass like you said [ __ ] you guys more weight because wasn't he at one point prior to some of his issues wasn't he one of the main wood suppliers to the town possibly yes I know he had moved to like the Southeastern Corner into what's now Danvers right and and he had a large farm there and was quite prosperous so in his mind in the way they thought back then his legacy and all his future Generations were in Jeopardy by some dicks exactly over something as messed up as spectral evidence and you know I still go back to the whole [ __ ] up thing you left Europe because of religious persecution just to come to [ __ ] America and persecute religion right what the actual hell here's another extreme messed up thing the lovely church this wonderful Church what what were they Puritans I I don't know some type of Christian so this lovely Church while Giles Corey is being pressed to death in the middle of this torture they excommunicated him from the church do you know why because he was witch I don't know you're close because he was either guilty and a witch or innocent and therefore committed suicide because he refused to enter a trial so so they excommunicated him because yeah he was either guilty of being a witch or he was innocent and therefore the torture was considered suicide because he refused to call for a trial Insanity right is that [ __ ] up or what how can they what is up with that I can't even I guess I can't even fathom the train of thought yeah so he's considered a sinner either way for a situation that he had zero control over and you realiz if I was alive during then I would have been dead dead oh absolutely oh yeah yeah yeah we would have been in big trouble I'm pretty sure I would have been out like we would have been we would have been like that Meme where he where Ned like kind of like slides back into the bushes we would have been looking at everybody and like you know what we're going to go visit our sister in California and we've been gone I mean it's just it was a bad time it really was but I I do think that that old Howard Street cemetery is more likely the site and the reason is because that is where the old jail was right right right and the in the Howard Street cemetery is on the backside of the old jail Y and it said that he was then buried in an unmarked grave so odds are his body is in that Cemetery unmarked somewhere and remember when we were walking through that Cemetery we went all the way To the Left End and in the very back corner huh that's the only place in that whole place and that place was jammed with Graves only place where there's no Stones who's there that's right I was hoping um I know that they have done ground penetrating radar on the old burying Point Cemetery I don't know if they have here though yeah I don't know if they have in any of the others I'm I I haven't seen in my research I'll have to dig a little bit deeper to see if they have but if I find anything I'll put it on our Instagram um but so far I haven't found it here's the thing although they weren't offered a proper burial you know if you got a cemetery right there just plop them in and don't mark it and that's the same as an unproper burial so that's why I was thinking that yeah and you know like I don't know if they ever did find a lot of the locations of the folks burials I know Rebecca nurse is buried at her Homestead which is now in Danvers but the others I I just I don't know where they ended up honestly no there's there's no way to really tell now I mean there's the family would have done whatever they could under cover of Darkness to hide those bodies and and give them the best burial that they possibly could but for many of them that would have meant someplace you know unknown and unmarked far away it could have been you know somewhere else on Gallows Hill there might house on top of it now maybe maybe they they got a cool freaking p and like Blaze of Glory man I love that idea I really do I feel I feel so badly for these people I mean Cory's death it was something that really shocked a lot of people of the town they were already frightened and scared because of the hangings that had happened prior to that and and this just really messed people up I mean at one point Corey's tongue was like bloated and fell out of his mouth and the sheriff used his Cane to push the dying Man's Tongue back into his mouth I can't imagine seeing that as a towns person and thinking that I would trust that sheriff with anything that just seems so callous yeah but back then people ruled by fear they really did and damn did they have it none of these people were trained in law they were like just the rich towns people that get appointed to being on the court or like my dad was the sheriff and now he's dead so I'm the sheriff because my dad was the sheriff you inherited you inherited jobs and the accused didn't even get lawyers they had no lawyers you had to speak up for yourself I can't imagine being being so freaked out being accused of being a witch they're going to take my family Homestead away the thing that we came here for that we worked so hard for and trying to then like defend myself in a in a court of law where there's a bunch of girls in the corner freaking out every time I start talking now was was he was he a threat to the town is that did that have anything to do with it I'm just trying to not that I can think of any of their mindset with any of this [ __ ] but was he a threat to somebody that they needed to quote unquote get rid of him possibly it seems like they wanted to bother some people it was an easy way to get rid of I think you're right I think a lot of it had to do with they wanted to make an example of him and they wanted his estate his wife was the first one to start saying these these proceedings are not right you shouldn't be using spectral evidence and and you should stop and and he you know went to court and testified I don't think he meant to testify against her I don't think that was his intention but when she went to jail he really woke up and started also speaking out against the court yeah but as as you are as you're well aware of you might say you might go to court and say left and somehow they Twisted that [ __ ] and do you saying right right so all he had to do was say yeah I had an oxen die and a cat die and they're like oh well your wife did it he's like wait that's not what I said and they're like oh yeah yeah yeah you said that yeah exactly you know and he said that she didn't say she was kneeling as if in prayer but didn't say any prayers well people do that [ __ ] all the time who doesn't sit in front of a fire and just stare at it I mean come on but they again twisted his words but anyway because he was speaking out against it and because quite possibly they're drunk with power at this point in taking people's lands and houses and businesses and he has such a rich farm and such a a large estate you know often in what's now Danvers I think it was a combination I think they're like we need to shut this guy up and you know I want his stuff and this was before America as we know it folks the United States of this was before what freaking 90 years before America was America so I think there was also a big bid for land power settlement because they were they were in that first group they weren't the first group but they were in the first group of what became Americans so there was a lot at stake and you were either on the team or you weren't Y and that's why I think with him him in particular I think it was more of a vendetta that he either had too much money too much power too much and and he was a threat to someone else getting further up the ladder and he needed to be out of the way executed were Bridget Bishop Sarah good Elizabeth how Susanna Martin Rebecca nurse Sarah wild George Burrows Martha carrier John Willard George Jacobs John Proctor Alice Parker Mary Parker an peer William red Margaret Scott samel wardwell Martha Corey and Mary easty executed as witches and then to death was Giles Corey just to just to rewind a second you know what I found the other day after you left what's that so I was driving down the road and it's very trafficky in this region as you can imagine surprise all the influx of people so I'm waiting in traffic trying to get on 128 and I look over and there's like there's like an on-ramp and an offramp and then there's like a big patch of like grassy whatever like in between the on-ramp and the offramp and the straight road sure I look over to that and there's a big Stone who the freak would knew it says Proctor's tomb what and I was like I'm like this is like a [ __ ] weird ass place to have it it's like in between the on-ramp and the off-ramp so it looks like what they did was they built the road the on-ramp and the offramp around this little patch of area like around a family tomb I don't know I don't know like it almost just looks like like a rock Mound I don't know how to explain this but it there's a sign there that says Proctor's tomb but it's not in a location where you can really get out of the car and look it's on L Street right before the onramp to 128 let's see John Proctor Jr was hanged on August 19 his body was then disposed of in an unmarked common grave now Lost legend suggests that the Proctor family secretly did something secretly retrieved his body and buried it on the Family Farm but Proctor's tomb there's a stone called Proctor's tomb opposite 310 310 LEL street at the Lowel Street onramp to 128 does that sound right local historian and archaeologist Timothy Kendall believes that this is the most likely location for John Proctor's grave so he says um there's a stone called the Proctor tomb it's a granite block marked with a sign indicating it was set up in 1821 it's the probable actual burial site of John Proctor where his sons took his body after his execution on August 19th 1692 so that is the actual spot of the old Proctor Farm where his sons retrieved his body after he was hung and buried it there secretly which would have been oh I'm not good with measurement but we'll call it maybe about a a straight shot mile straight down from where Proctor's ledge is so they would have basically walked a straight shot roughly a mile and then that's where the tomb is yep so it looks like that's why there's the the stone there now but I saw that after you left and I was like oh my God I got to tell her how cool and how interesting that it's kind of like right in the middle of of regular roads modern day roads and you can kind of tell that they made sure to kind of keep the sanctity of it because of the way the onramp and the offramp and the road is right there you know how we are nowadays you just tear through stuff and they didn't tear through that and that was pretty cool but it was I never noticed it until I just happened to be sitting in traffic and I was like what the hell well I guess I was wrong I didn't realize that they had found at least that one maybe there's more so that that that was an interesting tidbit because you would think being called practor ledge that practor was buried there like you know who was buried in tomb well I guess you know they would have had to have buried him someplace very secretly because you know you couldn't let anyone know that you had buried the witch you know on some place well if that was the the old location of his family's land that would make perfect sense because like I said they know that Rebecca nurse is buried on the homestead that you can actually still go and tour I think that's that's where I was thinking before all familiar land it's just a matter of finding that familiar land and then looking for the graves right or you know some of them possibly didn't have very much land a lot of these people were destitute some of them were very old or very poor you know they might not have had land so maybe they were just kind of taken into the wood somewhere or like that woman uh that we touched on last episode as well as one in our early episodes that just got exonerated within the last year or so no family so no one CA if you don't have who's coming for your body no one right exactly ex so my guess someone like that they're they're probably still it practor ledge they wouldn't have been able to bury them right there because the dirt was too shallow it was only about 3 feet until it hit rock but there was a river there at one time so they could have taken them down river somewhere or and there was also a road not too far from Proctor's ledge that they could have you know carted them away so more than likely they maybe a little ways down the road or a little ways into the woods right absolutely but it it's it's just sad because even with with your your buddy Corey there I do feel like he was pressed in that Howard Street Cemetery location and I do think that that's where his remains are but the sad part is for as old and cool and creepy as that cemetery is you'll you would never ever find a stone for him no no sadly you wouldn't and my personal Theory had been that he had been pressed outside the jail or nearby the jail and I had always assumed that that was down near judge or um Sheriff Corwin's house which was further downtown I think closer to where um The House of the Seven Gables is so I had always assumed it was probably somewhere near there and it wasn't until recently when you had told me that that Cemetery was actually the site of the old jail that I realized that you know that's probably where it happened so we totally agree on that one but I had been completely clueless as to where the location of that jail had been in 1692 one of the things that I find interesting um the Old Courthouse where where these folks were essentially tried the actual the the actual Courthouse where the trials were actually the courthouse was located in the middle of the street right outside my work really so you get to look right at that space the well it's actually a road now but if if anyone is familiar with the the current modern-day Salem City Hall the Old Courthouse where the the accused were tried is like basic basically kitty corner from City Hall like right smack dab in the middle of the road oh wow but you know as the times changed those horse roads we had to turn it into a real Road and tear it down but yeah so if if you think of it that way geographically where the courthouse was was actually only about two to three blocks away from where the jail was and then again that cemetery on the back side of the jail gotcha makes sense you know who's gonna like cart some guy through town all the way up a steep hill to press him up there only if he says okay I'll go to trial to cart him back down the hill and then back into town but you know the brutality it it boggles the mind that people could do that to each other that they would that they would even consider like Abigail Williams I think was one of the girls and she said that Giles came to her in a dream and told her to sign a book and they used used that they used that as evidence that he was a sorcerer and needed to be put to death it it's scary that people can go that far for a fiction and it's scary that the law followed that [ __ ] very scary it goes back to you leave your Homeland due to religious persecution just to go to a new land and persecute yeah yeah I don't understand yeah I I I almost do understand because I I I do think you were right in your statement drunk power yeah absolutely they they really were they there wasn't a leader of the land yet and somebody wanted to make a name for themselves to be the quote unquote leader of the new world I guess so and they certainly had this particular Town whipped up into a frenzy people were turning on on each other I mean it was terrible was a shitty time can you imagine five years later or even just like can you imagine like six months later who's going to go shopping with like this Abigail Williams or whatever like how do you look these people in the eye afterwards how do you have someone deliver your baby keep your wife alive through that delivery and then you kick out the freaking stool Underneath Him and watch him go like yeah accuse him of Witchcraft and it wasn't witchcraft when you're [ __ ] wife was in labor no no yeah like in that poem I delivered his wife of a fine young son yeah I would have been dead man that's all I can say i' would have gone out and a blaze of glory and now in Salem thankfully that whole history has been spun on its head and all types of paganism and Witchcraft and witches and wicens are celebrated you know they come from all corners of the country all corners of the planet and they really do and they're all here right now I swear to God they're all here right now and and we Revel in our witchiness how amazing that that not only have these people all been exonerated and the church has apologized how do you un excommunicate someone like un excommunicated Giles and Martha Corey reparations have been paid 300 and some odd years later they had the opposite effect because let me tell you which city you w it very much is and I mean there was the boo bash and there is always the witches ball witches ball vampire ball there's a ball for everything here you grab a costume you come on down you don't even have to go to a ball wear your costume up and down the street rock on with your bad self I think what makes it so great here is it's the exact opposite of the history the history the history is persecution judgment ruining people's lives based on falsehoods here you can walk down the street with your freak flag flying and nobody bats an ey they're just like hey and it's been like that when I was first there back in the early 90s that's when I first met other real witches other than a couple online here and there I had never met another real witch in person until I met these people and not only are there witches walking around in their cloaks and their witch hats but there's whole full-on covens walking around and not getting judged and not getting ridiculed and what have you exactly and they're studying and they're worshiping together and they're doing magic together and I wanted that and I loved seeing it so what an amazing place to reclaim to kind of say that that type of bigotry and that type of closed-mindedness not only isn't acceptable but we're going to kind of completely flip it on its head and revel in our differences and revel in this type of connectedness and witchiness and and Earth worshipping goodness you know to big [ __ ] you to Hawthorne and Corwin [ __ ] yeah that's right that's right I love that [ __ ] I love that but you know everywhere you go is just so cool what are some of your favorite shops or places shops wise you know first of all you

don't go don't go don't go oh so good so good what was their address they're on Derby Street I don't remember the number but they're down right literally across from the parking lot to the House of Seven Gables if you can find the House of Seven Gables you can find you old peppermint company because it's legit across the street and if you have to wait for your tour at the House of the Seven Gables some candy and hien Forge in Salem is at 30 Church Street and it's a little quieter little off the beaten path there's not going to be quite as many people outside bad store it's a badass store I loved it so cool has such a great Vibe definitely loved it and I I I do have to put a one little plug and it's a place we didn't make it to a food place if you're looking for some good Mexican and some good margs Casa Tequila can't beat it I don't know why we didn't go there I love tacos and tequila I think between I think one daying around we did I think what we do seven miles between smoking and shopping and touring and ghosting we weren't thinking about food now I know we also mentioned this other place in our one of our other podcasts but the Black Veil tattoo shop with the twins Ryan Matthew Boston Street Boston Boston Street 137 that's right 137 Boston Street and that shop was fantastic really cool stuff also had some local things along with your regular fun things a few older Ouija boards I saw that they had for sale as well and they're actually one of the most awesome tattoo joints in town love their tattoos I have since seen the ink master the season of inkmas where the twins competed so I know how they did don't tell us right yet I won't tell you go and watch the season it was pretty interesting we went down by the the right out on the upper opposite side of the House of Seven Gables we were down at a dead end Road just kind of looking out into the ocean oh I love I sent you the picture that's yeah those are some of the gems people forget about that smoke spot that we had while we were waiting for having Gables that was a nice spot I liked that and you know the old ship Love The Old Ship don't think it's haunted but we love The Old Ship we sat on the ader on Deck chairs we smoked our weed we did not get a chance to go to the ship we did not get a chance to go to the museum right and those are a couple things that I would like to see next time I'd also like come back absolutely absolutely I'd also love to go on a tour now I know we know a lot of it but it's so much fun to go on a tour and kind of maybe maybe we'll go on one of the Haunted Tours or something and and see if we can learn some new little tidbits those tour guides always seem to have the coolest most up-to-date information on everything from hauntings to history I love it there's one place I've never been and I'm gonna save it for your next trip I want to go to Danvers to the Rebecca nurse Homestead that would be very cool you can actually tour inside the house it's like this whole museum thing so yeah that's going to be on our list for next time oh yeah definitely there's a few a few more places that we have to go see for sure and I also want to see if we can uh next time we'll have to find a local tarot reader or um astrologist and see if we can go get a reading together next time we're there oh oh that would be so great we uh stopped at one of the filming sites for Hubie Halloween Let's see we didn't we didn't do Ocean Avenue house from Hocus Pocus but you saw the ropes Mansion love loved it and the gardens out back were stunning bring a book for the little Library so you can swap it out but fun so much fun the the whole city there's just something to do everywhere so many different shops and cool little places and you just have to check them all out you you really do you're definitely going to feel some Vibes here just don't expect them to be all Wich trial related yeah and if you wanted to go on a haunted tour and see if you could kind of find some of that out here there's also some haunted uh airbnbs there there's also a few um if you're looking to stay in a haunted hotel um one of the oldest in America it is and I actually when I first started coming to Salem I used to stay at this hotel and it is legit awesome they even have red velvet on the walls of the elevator people um the Hawthorne worth the money if you are going to come here get your ass into the Hawthorne hotel and it's convenient to walk everywhere yeah and there's there's like the witch City walking tours there's uh Black Cat tours Salem ghosts you can check out some of those different tours if you're in the area be prepared to put your walking shoes on and uh see a lot of places but they'll take you to all sorts of haunted places because like shell said I mean pretty much every building here has a history and has a ghost of some sort lurking about and if you go to salem.com website they'll tell you where all the public bathrooms are always good to know always good to know just saying but check out the witch City Mall which I guess that would be fun I don't know I've never been in that the witch City Mall we'll not call it a mall okay let's just not call it a mall let's just call it what it is it's a walkth through building um but they do have some good stuff in there one great place if you walk through the witch City mall and you like Thai food the Thai place the and that's literally what it's called the thae place nice they also have uh which City Teas is in there um and another good one we should do this sometime um which which picks oh I think I saw something for that that looks so much fun all the they have all these costumes and scenery and you can get photos oh my God we got to do how fun would that be I mean it wouldn't be complete unless we got our our witchy pictures on exactly and I think a bakery just opened in the witch City mall so I'm always down for a good Bakery we are definitely Sweet People we're just talking about candy store now all drooling on a bakery you smoke too much weed I do and the food was half the fun being there I mean I we ate a bunch of different places and it it was a blast it was really
