welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and on this episode we're joined by the incomparable Witch judica illis judica is a witch a Tarot reader an aroma therapist an author and an editor and you may know her from her book Encyclopedia of 5,000 spells and her newest book which is a compendium and just to point out I'm shell here and I just want to say that I am super excited everybody for this I remember buying this big book that was so big you could take out a grown man with it it's a security device it's a big book I actually still have it the Encyclopedia of 5,000 spells I had never seen anything before like that in my life and you were an eye opener thank you to have it Circle back and have you here today in 2024 is just mindblowing to me so welcome I welcome you thank you I'm very happy to be with you judica tell us a little bit about your newest book you know it's a mini encyclopedia because I've written big encyclopedias so long story short it was between my third and my fourth encyclopedia I had the opportunity to write a small book and it was fun because usually writing is not fun for me writing is a lot of work but this was fun and I got to celebrate witches in general and I love witches and it's a celebration of witches I did a podcast and the host described it as a love song to witches and that's really what it I like that love song to The Witches of the world now you say that you liked because you got to write a smaller book which this book you can't really take out a grown man with I'll admit it but this book is maybe small in stature but it is overly large in Epic information I try you packed a lot of good good info into this book you know I am not a child of the 80s I'm older and I remember when books were inexpensive and it if only because of my age price of books I mean along with other things it bothers me so I really do try to give people you know best bang for their Buck yeah so yeah that's the phrase yeah definitely it's terrible you know you're spending this money and you know there's nothing in it so I I try to be substantial well you knocked it out of the park with this one and I could have written I could have written a book that was twice as large the hard part is what I left out yeah we're not in there maybe the next Edition that's right but you know I have my art witches in here my my painting witches and I could have added some more I'm sad that Lenor feni isn't in it I mean I could give you all the people who aren't in it because you know the history of Witchcraft past present and you know future it's really it's it's vast you could totally write a part two to this abely Definitely Maybe One Day who knows and what this book is is it's actually a lot it's modern day witches it's historical witches it's witches in media and in movies and it's concise interesting information and there's witches we expect like Lorie cabbits in there but there's also witches I didn't expect like Moses you know and there were witches I had never heard of before but you give the historical context and the reasoning why they could be considered WI is yeah I was fascinated I knew a lot of the information but there was so much I didn't know or whether they were perceived as witches right because depending where you are sometimes that you know that's more pivotable whether you are or aren't a witch or whether you consider yourself a witch if other people think you're a witch that that can really have a lot of impact on your life even now we remember the 90s you you started reading tarot cards professionally in 90 or so you've been a witch pretty much your whole life basically and in the 90s it was scary people were afraid to wear their regalia or their jewelry they were afraid to say who they were even in the 1990s it was scary to be a witch oh later into the 2000s that's true even still the three of us have a connection um judica that I'm not sure you're aware of but the three of us are native upstate New York workers and you know that environment in Upstate New York back in the 90s like you had to be careful you had to be careful because that was you know small towns Backwoods you know a big red State we had to be careful coming out back then we're not a red state but upstate's definitely very red parts of it are pretty R mean New York is not a monolithic state but I mean I remember teaching I want to say at a festival I want to say it was in Virginia and and sometime in the 2000s and I taught in Christopher panac and you know the festival paid for presenters and I remember being there and thinking it really you know I I do my best and I think we Christopher and I did a ritual together which I think it's the only time we've done that but we weren't really necessary all these people who attended were just happy to be able to take their Pentacles out from under their clothing y and walk around all weekend and be a pagan be a witch and not have to worry about judgmental people or worse that was everything else was just like icing on the cake that was cake back then to meet a group of pagans was like a magical event in and of itself yeah yeah it was it was difficult and and and like you said judica even now even in the early 2000s I am absolutely amazed how difficult it still was to be a witch at that time and so one of the things I wanted to do with witches with the book which is a compendium was and I I do try to do this with all my books is not to not to limit my topic to narrow geographical area so it's not just the United States or North America or the English-speaking world because witchcraft in some form you know even if it's not EX exactly the same exists worldwide it's a worldwide yeah yeah and you know depending where you are now every once in a while you know you still you you open the newspaper and you hear about may not be in North America but there's somebody suspected of being a witch perceived of as being a witch and they're killed and people who kill them very rarely get in trouble right and it has been flung as a word against non witches usually as a form of control it's an insult yeah as an insult or someone who doesn't conform they would use that as a way to punish people for being different or for not conforming to their rules an unruly woman there you go especially for women women who are somehow not behaving you're just a witch yeah it's very interesting because I see it you know it cuts across political boundaries too because I've seen it with kamla Harris people calling her a witch she's not a witch you know and think which is a positive word so you know I I know you know but I've also seen conday of rice you know on the other end of the political Spectrum Hillary Clinton I I think I have po I collect witch postcards and I have witch postcards featuring both conday and Hillary Clinton you know dressed up as like the wicked witch it's it's you know they're not talking magical practitioners they're not talking about healers they're talking about the wizard of green skin yes you know the balloon sck with the with the monkeys y you know and it's not even it's not even like a a religious heretic or you know there's there's nothing witchy about it it's just here is an Upp disobedient woman I don't like uncontrollable woman even today even in Salem Massachusetts shell has heard people calling other people a witch in replace you know of calling them a oh yeah actually in my day job um a few years back was in a derogatory manner called a witch and I literally work in Downtown Salem so even there even there today it's still a bad word I I I believe I I I believe Barbara Bush referred to Geraldine Ferrara as a witch but you could tell she it was her way of not saying like that's you know see when people call me which I just wear it like a badge of honor thank you thank you very much well we've also kind of claimed the word as well so we might as well take both of them absolutely absolutely I love dogs I love dogs dogs are better than people you know are good  are great that's not an insult I'm sure hak would say the same right shell absolutely absolutely now I know we talked about how there's a lot of quote unquote witch history in here but there's other stuff um good information like different types of witches yeah different tools you can use basic kind of setup stuff little Museum of Witchcraft yeah yeah yeah and I think that that is a good th a good tool for people there's a Resurgence again there was back in the late 80s early 90s there's a Resurgence and getting out some of this information in a clear concise way you know even though we we had our big blue books 30 years ago we as a as a population need more books like this witches compendium back in our day you were just a witch there wasn't really a kitchen witch or a green witch or a water witch you know you were just either a witch or not a witch and now you know you kind of explain all of those different we're not all the same yeah that's right everything's kind of aspect out and and you explain that very good for folks that maybe are looking for what direction they want to go to what pulls to that and you kind of give them a good explanation of all of those and I like that I think that this book has sort of has two audiences one audience is people like me who love witches and you know you know you want to sell me something put a witch on it I'll buy it add to cart right but also I think people who might be a little who might be attracted but are a little afraid or a little ambivalent or who think this might be something interesting but they've heard terrible things and witches are heroes we are wonderful people we are independent of byy people but that's a good thing we we think for ourselves and that's something maybe everybody should strive for we need a lot more of that I think in the world absolutely wouldn't hurt yeah right before you came on we were talking about your book and about how every single witchling should have this book it gives you a great history oh that's really nice thank you that's very nice this gives them an excellent grounding in recent history a little bit further history the tools that they might need buckland's Blue Book was wonderful but it was very one note and and it doesn't really resonate with a lot of people today well it was for a type of Witchcraft at a certain time and and yours gives people a very well-rounded introduction into a lot of different things that's from New York City you know I mean when you when you read a book one of the things is who is the writer writing for and sometimes writers are writing for very very specific audience and you know I I have an international family I lived in Queens the most diverse place on Earth so I I'm used to being people we may not agree on everything or we may not do things the same way but you can respect somebody you know we don't all have to be the same so that's that's where I was coming from and I love that that you address many different cultures a lot of different belief systems and it's all right there I never I I don't want people to feel left out and I'm sure somebody will feel left out because that's inevitable well like you said you have to write a second one but this was pretty encompassing I I try I try not to have that very exclusive you know this is this is a witch and you're not you know want go there people ask Christian witch wites well I I know people who identify as Christian witches and even if it might seem contradictory to someone who am I to tell them I'm not the pope of Witchcraft I'm not going to say you know oh no you're wrong you're not a witch I mean if you have created a path for yourself and that is how you identify yourself I I don't know that it's for and you're not harming anyone I have a very controversial opinion and my opinion is that if you say you're a witch you are a witch yeah me too I have no other requirements no right right exactly so if you want to say you are a Christian witch or in your book shell was very happy that you mentioned Jewish witches because we happen to be in a coven with a couple of self-identified Jewish witches a lot of jewi witches that's not that's that's not even contradictory because you have this centuries Millennia of history of magical practice that was centuries the negative stereotype Jewish people they were magicians yeah so I mean the issue with Christian witches and I do understand the issue is that is that for centuries the church as an establishment persecuted witches and I mean I think there is um if you get into the historical part the congales San Antonio which she's one of my favorites you know she was essentially she she was very much she was burned at the stake by the church you know you're not necessarily expecting that in Congo in the Congo but you know so it's not just in select places in Europe and um so I think there there is that anger and that bitterness and when somebody you know but but we all have our paths and and as an individual if you have forged a path and you have worked out something that I life is complicated and you've integrated those contradictions who is it for someone else to tell you like you can't come into somebody's life and say oh no you're not what you think you are I mean that's you know full harsh and that's what I think the big attraction is uh to Witchcraft is how it can be so individualized yeah I think so too and who are we to I don't want people telling me how to practice so why would I tell other people how to practice I don't identify with a witch because I want people to tell me what to do that's right that's not why we became witches if I wanted people to tell me what to do I wouldn't be doing this a lot of people love your encyclopedias particularly because there's so much there that they can then individualize for themselves right and that was my hope yeah and it comes through that's what people say time and time again is that you have given them access to all this information but done it in such a way that people are then very free to personalize it it's almost like a reference point it's almost like like that Encyclopedia of spells is almost like a reference point where yeah you know you kind of present a certain spell per se for a certain idea and then we're free to go and kind of manipulate that to our own individualized way or our own individualized practice I had to be talked into writing that book by the editor and one I mean eventually he hooked me I wanted to do everything probably because of the size yeah no that wasn't it was oh my God it wasn't supposed to be that size that that just happened it was supposed to be smaller I have a contract for 450 pages I mean no publisher if you've ever seen the first edition the book literally is a hard cover beautiful hard cover with a dust jacket and it weighed over five pounds and at some point after about a week Amazon refused to ship it for free that's why there were all those different versions because they tried to finally get it to await that's what I'm saying you could take out a grown man with that book anybody bothers you you just like not drop it on on their Flor that's my favorite kind of spell you know the mundane before the magical throw the book throw the book you're fine one of the reasons that you know one of the ways he he hooked me into doing this book was because there are a lot of spells that have variations and usually when you write a book you have to pick one but the publisher really wanted 5,000 and so that's great you can have three different versions of Florida water you can have different versions of stuff you don't have to make that you know because that's a choice I'm going to show you this one version and you you may have to go looking for the others and sometimes you know here are three versions and you can you can come up with another one you know you can adjust it you can create a new one it doesn't doesn't have to be this way and and people find a lot of freedom in that in your encyclopedias and so I love that about them well that to me that's which is about it's about independence and freedom and not having people tell you how to do every little thing not to like you know say anything negative but we all know there are people who live like that especially women there are places where they are telling you what to do how to dress what to do with your hair what you can eat what you can't eat what you can think what you can read I mean there are a lot more conventional places to go if I want to live like that but that's how witchcraft is witchcraft is to create your own path and to do your best to create your own life and your own prameters wow love that very powerful well I mean if you want to go for real basic I mean even all these fairy tale images of you know the witch in the forest in her little Hut why is she in the forest well because maybe they chased her there but also because nobody is telling her what to do there right I aspire to be the witch in the woods all by myself thank you I like pling well yeah I'm going to have a great house it's just going to be all by itself that's all yeah yeah my house is g to be next door what are you talking about well yeah well that's different we're gonna live together our little Enclave in the woods yeah an enclave in the woods that's great yes we used to have those all the time when we would go to festivals our little Enclave so with witchcraft being very free with that freedom comes a lot of questions especially by witchlings and and it's very scary being told oh just do it your way they're like well I don't know what my way is yet and so there can be a lot of fear of starting there well but that's that's why one of the beauties of Witchcraft the Alchemy is finding your way no one knows right away the trial and error is half the journey yeah and and the fun I mean if you you know assuming that a witchling is a young person I mean imagine if you have to commit to everything I mean and know you know sometimes you people do there circumstances but you're young and now everything is decided and this is the rest of your life it this is it's it's a trial and error it's the it's the circuitous route it's like the the trail of crumbs in hens and grle going back to witches in the forest you you start to follow something and you see where it's going to go and if it doesn't work you're going to try something else and eventually you know in astrology you're not even an adult until your first Saturn return which is 29 so that's a one of the things with witchcraft that people don't talk about enough and I did try to express it in my book is of course there are tragic aspects to it and of course sometimes it's hard work and sometimes we're spellcasting because you know our life has turned to crap and we want to fix it but witchcraft is fun yeah and if you look back at the stereotypes that the Inquisition had about witches one of the stereotypes is that witches were having fun they were flying away to mountaintops under the full moon to dance and feast and have fun rather than staying home and doing their housework or praying or you know being doing whatever they were supposed to be doing it should be fun there is a and and fun fun will build up your magical energy your own personal power it is a serious thing about witchcraft having fun and I I think that that will eventually lead you to some sort of M it's a lifelong thing if you like if you know already if it's like done like what else are you gonna do keep doing the same thing for decades go have fun learn something new I love that fun in witchcraft is very important and thinking back shell when you know we would get together when we were first building things that we had a lot of fun I remember a lot of laughter even when things didn't go well but we had a lot of we had a lot of trial and error though too well yeah but that's how you learn exactly you have to be not afraid to fail I think and that's how you learn what you're made out of you know you don't know until you start right so true so you said something about you know lifelong learning so I'm going to kind of take a little Blast From Your Past and I'm to call you out judica I heard that when you were six years old you stole your older sister who I believe was 18ish at the time true you stole her tarot cards and that was your first deck a muger I I think I mugged her oh you mugged her it was even worse honestly I respect you more now because you mugged your sister you would come in the door because you know I you know I was little I was home all day I mean you know I'd go to school and I'd come home and she'd be coming home in the evening and she always brought good stuff home always books records all kinds of stuff I mean it it happened to I I mugged her all the time I just six-year-old it was all very enamoring to you yeah you know I was the only child in a family of adults my closest at that time I have a cousin who's younger than me but um my sister I had a cousin who lived in the same building they're all adust years old with me I I I was not a childish child at that point I was you know I learned how to read very early I was surrounded by what people call an old soul H yeah maybe was was your whole family into divination or just your older sister my mother my mother was fascinated and my mother um was what you would call a true dreamer you know if you've ever live with a true dreamer that's not always like a comfortable thing a true dreamer is someone who has dreams of things that are actually happening she you know she dreamt that my my college roommate was pregnant when she was and I had not planned to tell her that was we you know we don't need to know that but um she she called me up and told me her dream and I was just so shocked that I blurted it out you know yes that's true I mean she had details so I I don't know if they were into divination as practitioners but there was an interest okay and I think a tolerance and I get emails especially right after I wrote 5,000 spells I would get a lot of emails from people telling me they demonstrated some psychic ability as a child or you know they saw a dead person or a fairy or something and how their families would panic and essentially beat it out of them and they they would like to return they had that gift and then it wasn't safe to have it but now they would like to get it back and I never had an experience like that the absolute worst thing anybody in my family ever did with me was roll their eyes at me that is the worst thing do you remember what that first Tarot deck was oh I still have it the Builders of adum right Builders of adum bota yeah I still have it which makes sense because my sister was an art student What would possess a six-year-old to to grab a deck of tarot cards is the most magical coloring book in the world and I love coloring books and it was it was just magic so you know for people who don't know that's a deck where you're supposed to color it in you have these really really detailed instructions about the colors you're supposed to use and I have never colored it in because I uh it made me nervous it was a little bit too too much telling me what to do and what if I do a wrong so I I just use it like are you a cancer or an aquarius yes I am a Cancer with a stellium in the sixth house so yes everything is practical and look I I I I worry if things aren't you know are we still going to do this tonight are we still gonna do this I mean that's that's just my nature so you stole your sister's Tarot deck and you never color it in now shell is a shall we say politely a connoisseur of tarot decks I appr appreciate you saying that and not calling me an obsessive addict thank you she's an obsessive addict but we'll go with connoisseur for right now since she likes that word you can be both they're not mutually exclusive exactly exactly do you also have a passion for tarot decks oh yeah I have a passion for tarot I I I have Decks that I love I you know but I mean I still use the writer white Smith that's you know I know other people get that's my old standby the thing with the writer weight Smith and I used to work on a psychic hotline for a couple years the thing with the writer W Smith is if you and people have if you wake me up at 4 in the morning because you have an emergency and you really need a reading right now I can do it the writer waight Smith is so consistent and so reliable I remember being you know working that psychic hotline and that was the deck I always used because this was in the early 90s at a time when it was very popular with the 900 numbers and you'd go from Reading to reading to reading to reading and people were asking about all different things and you just had to do it like you couldn't say to people oh let me switch a deck let me you know people are paying I remember they were paying $4 doar a minute and yeah by the time they had gotten to the actual reader they'd already spent like four minutes listening to all kinds of announcements I have a question about your time with that because I had found you know reading your back info IID found out that you were a part of that which back then I found fascinating yet cringy and you know why all of those things question to you is did you feel drained every day like did you just feel no that wasn't draining for me is over and over if I could I mean this may be a terrible thing to say I'm I'm proud of my body of books I you know I was a single mother for a while too so I mean I mean I'm still a single mother but I mean my kids are grown up now but I was a single mother of small children if I could do nothing but read tarot cards that's what I would do I love reading I find it very energizing really because there'd be times where Lila and I would go and do big group readings at colleges or for local organizations or or private parties and like I remember one time we were at a college function and we did we do Ila maybe 200 readings four hours like I needed to sleep for two days after that you like it just I felt just so sucked out of me yeah but I don't know that's that's that's all those people that's a lot of people I used to work in a store in Manhattan uh I want to say 2004 is five six something like that maybe a little later I worked there every Saturday I was the card reader like and it was a tourist store you know it was in a touristy area so you would always get people coming in oh let's do a reading and I would sit down at 12 o'l and I wouldn't even stand up till 6 o'clock and when I stood up it it wasn't that I was drained but I was dizzy it was like I couldn't you kind of go into zone is it because the inperson thing where you're physically mingling with their energy I think so and all the other people you think that's what it was yeah and all the other people because it's just a lot of people around you're in a store so if it's like one onone and a little more relaxed it's for for me tarot when it's working it's like it's like you're plugged in to something and it's very profound and very I like it it's very hard for it to be an economically stable thing to do yeah true you know I think card readers and fortune tellers are the best because you know not to cast dispersions but doctors when do they make their when you're sick when do Funeral Directors make their money when you're dead when do lawyers make their money oh well you got a problem fortune tellers want you to be doing well because when you're not doing well the first thing you're going to cut out is your fortune teller right right you know because that's a luxury and here here in Salem I see a lot of people who try to make their living off of that it's hard yeah yeah in Salem there's so much competition that's that's a hard thing Salem is is really hard during the Halloween season and then it's so much better the rest of the year it is crazy town and everybody's making money but the other 11 months it's hard because like you said there's so much competition I have read in Salem in October I have been in Salem in October it is crazy town it is I mean it's exciting I remember see tourists come from all I mean I very people very peoply I don't know if people appreciate it's like Maro people come from all I met people from Australia yeah people come from all over the world to be in Salem in October yeah but it's overwhelming I mean maybe everybody should do it once that's always what I say do it once who really want to enjoy Salem come in like the spring or the summer spring is coming up and I cannot wait yeah you know people have time for you you could shop I say spring and summer cu you can walk around without a jacket you're comfortable you know you got the beach that it's sunny it's beautiful here in New England in the summer yeah people are relaxed there's less people I'm an introvert I'm and I I'm not a people person but I would definitely say especially if you're someone who does not live near a witchy area go to Salem do the pilgrimage wear your witchy best because like you said it is a chance for people to be amongst your people to be amongst other witches that you might not necessarily get my very first experience with other witches was I went to Salem for sa and I my jaw just was on the floor constantly because you were bumping into witches everywhere they were crawling out of the woodwork the town of witches yeah and it was brilliant it was absolutely brilliant I have had some I mean gentle no one there was no Farm but I've had some anti-witch comments to me in Salem I mean I have like walked down you know and I I wear a cape like you know it's cold in October at the end of October so I've got the cape and I have unly hair and you know people people have all my life had a tendency to look at me and think I I am witchy or I have Aquarius Rising you know or somehow weird or something I mean even without anything else you were born this way darling but I mean I remember being in Salem and people crossing the street I mean this is actually pretty funny I I may have done a mean thing I was standing at there is the point you know by Essex Street where it becomes like um a walking the walking part we we just got the walking part of Essex right and I was standing on the corner and I may even have had my kids with me and there was a a man with a little boy a child and he looked at me and he said to his father daddy is that a witch and the father you know he rolled his eyes I mean he's he he was he said something a little snotty he said you know no Sunny there's no such thing as witches just people pretending and the kid turned around and looked at me and I winked at him you guys shared a little secret there I think I didn't say a word I'm not GNA but I wined at him and that kid knew dadd was telling the truth the one thing I like about there's a couple things the shopping is unparallel for witchy shopping unall definitely but nowadays I don't know how long it's been since you've been here there are some of the the locals that are kind of like oh that witch thing no matter what your flavor you can walk down the middle of Washington Street or Essex Street and you could be looking and wearing however you want to look and what you want to wear and not a damn person's gonna bat an eye and no I mean I I i' seen a guy walking down the street with like a pair of underwear on that were like pulled up over his shoulders and nobody looked nobody cares no matter what your flavor New York City's like that too York no matter what your flavor it's okay here you can whatever people are busy they can't be bothered with you whatever if you're not bothering them they're not bothering you that's right exactly exactly it's a New York or a witch attitude same thing although I remember before salum was like that I came back from I grew up on the East Coast lived in California came back in 2001 and I brought my kids up to Salem to see Salem and you know we went and saw the Chamber of Commerce the little introductory film welcome to Salem they didn't talk about witches at all they were talking about ship building yeah it was shocking um so I'm I'm glad to see the development yeah it is home of the National Guard but it is Ely turned into wi City USA for sure definitely I think we have Lorie cabat to thank for that definitely put it on the map for sure yeah yeah but that is that witch Pride to you know when people call you and I mean of course I'm not talking about people for whom it's dangerous and if they call you a witch maybe they'll kill you or lock you up that's not but I mean if that's not the case like you know if you are an autonomous adult and somebody calls you a witch don't cringe it's a badge of honor people I mean this people will say to me all the time like what do you write about and I you know oh I write about witchcraft magic spells and they'll say or magic and they'll say oh I don't believe in that and I always say oh that's too bad I'm so sorry for you you know they're trying to assert their superiority but actually and that's very sincere I do feel sorry for them because they're missing something wonderful yeah you're missing something wonderful F the world is a magical place it's full of mysteries and magic and wonders and you don't believe in it well you know whatever you know too bad maybe someday you'll open your eyes not be quite so closed-minded and yeah that's a big part of being a witch being open and learning and being willing to change your mind and being willing to learn new things yeah and I think that's something that you know I know I said all you have to do to be a witch is to say you're a witch but I do think that learning and being open-minded is start yeah that's where you start but I think getting that open mind is a big thing amongst witches you know we all have to think about what is a witch and in characteristics of witches I think witches are people who like to know and and that is the definition in a lot of languages of the word witch the people who know and what do they know they know all kinds of stuff they know the secrets of Nature and the world and plant and all kinds of stuff and I I think it keeps you young you know you always want to know you want to learn something new that's good never stop learning never stop learning you know if someone starts with your books the Encyclopedia of 5,000 spells and yeah the newest one which is a compendium they will certainly have enough reading to keep them busy for a while yeah one last question one of your books is called daily magic spells and rituals for making the whole year magical yes what are are some things that you do daily that help you feel magical I try to do everything I try to keep them magic with everything I I am very aware I'll give you a more direct answer but I mean I'm very aware of colors and sounds and smells and directions and you know you're cooking which way are you stirring little details like that just a mindfulness in your everyday stuff yeah you know when I teach in store like in a classroom as opposed to online one of the you know usually you you're teaching and you're sitting in a room and people come in and take their seats and one of the things I do is I just watch people come in and what colors are they wearing because all kinds of colors have spiritual associations as well as maybe Elemental associations or astrological associations but you know is is there a disproportionate number of people wearing purple or yellow or green and it sort of it tells me what direction to go in what is the spirit who are the spirits coming in what are the spiritual forces in the room and that's something that comes with time you know because there you'll learn if you keep doing this and you keep reading and you keep studying and you know it's really good to learn with other people because not everything is in books you know you you'll pick up that vocabulary the vocabulary of the powers of the world and that makes everything very witchy I what I do every day uh you know I'm always asked what is my favorite spell and I don't know I mean it may not be my favorite spell because there are spells I love because they're beautiful or the construction but I I do the invocation of Archangel Michael twice a day morning and night I was taught to at a time in the 80s when um I was not in a good place a friend taught me how to do it and you just do it it's it's a verbal it's a verbal visualization you can do it in 30 seconds if you have to so it's not it's not hard and you don't have to have privacy you can do it silently and I was told to just if you get nervous just do it if you get scared just do it and I mean there have been times in my life when I've done it like 12 times a day but I still do it every morning and every like you know the morning and at night some point I'll do it and that's a and to surround myself with protective spirits and protection and you may not be able to see this but I'm like covered in amulets well a lot of witches like you know we're like mag pies we like we like our shiny things right we like our shiny yeah we like our shiny Yeah Yeah Yeah you mentioned a daily practice and I I'm very big on trying to do things habitually because there's magic in that when you do something over and over and over again then you can kind of get lost in it and just kind of let that energy flow and and I love I love a daily practice there's Beauty there and it develops uh you know like uh people talk about like I mean I use cast iron pans and I've been told like you know for people who use walks you get the walk hey the flavor of a walk that's been used continually for a long time and if you're doing a daily practice you too you develop the flavor too I like that I like that oo a cooking and a magic reference I am so there I love that that's perfect I laugh because you talk about your favorite spell and my first thought was you wrote a book about 5,000 how do you must have 5,000 favorite how could you pick people well that this is how I knew I was in trouble because um it was supposed to be a 450 page book with a you know submission date matching that and and it was not written consecutively I did put my favorite spells in first and some of my favorite spells are these really poetic lengthy I mean there's these Moroccan spells involving Jin I love these spells I they're not necessarily practical spells and they're not necessarily spells that you're G to everybody's going to do on a daily basis but they're just they're beautiful and I I love them as spells I love I love the art of spellcasting and I appreciate you know in the way that you can look at a beautiful painting or a wonderful dish of of food I appreciate how these cells are constructed but they're long and you know I had barely gotten anything done and I was already over a 100 pages and I was like we're in trouble like we're gonna blow this limit out of the water here so now now my final question is what advice would you give to either a a newer witch or be someone who quote unquote like like Lea and I are back up the broomstick you know someone who maybe was connected in the past and had kind of a life break and is circling back to to their craft what what advice would you give to either a new person or someone getting back on the broomstick two things one read everything like read for knowledge read to learn something not a lot of people read so that their beliefs are validated I mean that's fine a little bit but so now you know you're right like whatever where do you go from here read everything even if you don't like something because sometimes that helps you if you read something and you don't like it ask what didn't I like about this because that will help you focus your own path what is it that bothered me or you know a lot of books there's one valuable thing in there and you got to like go through a lot of clutter to find that piece of gold the other thing is follow what you love what is it that you love and it might not not be obviously witchy and I think that's one of the things that I think does appear in my book there there are things that are very obviously witchy like you know the Halloween costume and the the black hat and you know a black cat and you look at it and but witchcraft has so many forms what do you love if you love cooking but you don't think about it when you're thinking of things like baking or right but baking is Magic baking is Alchemy I mean Alchemy is transmutation it's transformation you get from a bag of flour and a stick of butter and look at this amazing bread or what you've created like how did you get from a to be that's magic you can cast a this one of the things I have in this book that I was never able to do in another book and I know I keep going back to them but it meant a lot to me to write it is the arc witches and these are painters who Express their magic through paintings through their art and that's not really something you can you can write as an instruction for a spell like if you're a painter I I can't tell you how to paint painting but it's magic so whatever you do and whatever you love you can be magic with it just finding that magic oh I love that I love that see love just as a side note it's kind of that that that theme of art magic how I became such an obsessive tarot collector is I'm just enamored by all the artwork I only really Ed the the writer weight Coleman deck which is a new thing because I was very anti that for a lot of decades yeah and the The Witches tarot Ellen Canon Reed back from the 90s oh yeah that's great but the reason I have several hund is because there's some magic in that artwork so I get what you're saying about that art because I in Tarot cards and that's what made a collector I use Kipling West Halloween tarot a lot I have I love that deck I love that check who doesn't love a good Halloween themed deck I mean come on Halloween every day do you have a favorite Wich of TV movie book you know fictional wit do you have a favorite I'm like a promisc I mean I'm like promiscuous with my love I it I love Holly witchery Holly witchery yeah I mean the older I get the more I appreciate Endora I just you because I was around when the show was on you know initially and of course we all loved Samantha and I think a lot of when you were watching it in the early 60s you were seeing indora through for those who don't know you should go watch for wit if you don't know what I'm talking about it is it's a classic and it in its way it's a culturally important show it was really the first program to show a witches was a heroin she was beautiful and nice she was not sinful or evil or disgusting it was Radical at its time but it was a time of mother-in-law jokes in general and and we see her mother-in-law and Dora played by the wonderful Agnes Mor Through The Eyes of the husband who was aggravated by her and she was very much at that time I think attended as the villain but the older I get she's she's just phenomenal when I was a little kid and would watch those shows she was my favorite I just she was so spicy and just so interesting that I just adored her yeah I liked the whole you know what if if I don't like it I'm just gonna poof make it want it kind of like I'm too old for this was kind of the vibe I got from Endora I'm just too old for this and she wasn't embarrassed by her Witchcraft and the younger witches sometimes were yes that that embracing it's an Embrace of power I think especially for women we can have power and we don't have to apologize for it especially as we get older I think we we Embrace that power yeah exactly so hopefully through this show through your books we can help witches all witches of any age Embrace that power be that spicy Endora I hope so thank you so much judica for joining us thank you where can people find you I'm on
