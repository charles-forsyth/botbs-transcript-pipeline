welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I'm shell before we get started today shell I wanted to dive in a little bit to some of the comments that we've been getting lately especially since our episode with Phyllis cirat and I just want to say thank you so much to all of our listeners our new listeners our listeners who've been here a while you guys are amazing the emails the comments I have just been loving all of them thank you so much and definitely keep it up I got a good one I want to read you ready go for it so this is from Love Struck lovers struck Laura she wrote hi I heard about the podcast because I follow Phyllis cirat on all of her social media and absolutely loved the episode you're both such great interviewers and I can't wait to go through and listen to all all you wise ones have to say you've got a new subscriber for sure well love struck Laura thank you we appreciate it we hope you really like all of our episodes thank you so much we really love Phyllis curat too so I'm glad you enjoyed the episode who doesn't love Phyllis jeez hopefully we'll have her back on to talk about her Tarot deck once it gets pre-released in early November um I wanted to read one as well that I really enjoyed especially u in thinking about our episode today shell but this one is from LDA and they say resonates love the variety love the topics love the witchy hostesses practice differently it gives all of us permission to try things in a new and non-mainstream way allowing us to tap into our inner witch and intuition about all of it great it right I also love that we practice a little bit differently a lot of witches practice a little bit differently it's one of the few things we have in common universally I think but I think the thing to remember about that is as much as we are kind of Polar Opposites on things we we've been able to Rocket together for decades it works it works it works well and I think it's even better because we come at it from slightly different perspectives but we have the same end goal we want it to work well and I think what you bring to the table and what I bring to the table makes it so much better and bigger than each of us individually and I I love when witches come together and do that well and I love when we come together and do that because well witches aside you're still my best friend I love you you're awesome love you all right so let's get into the episode and today we've got a great topic for you Leila break it to him gently you make it sound like something bad's about to happen well today we're going to talk about meditation one of my favorite things one of not one of my greatest strengths of all time you were trying to avoid the topic right from the start chel I I was we kind of have opposite views here but we're going to discuss how I try to work in and how you think it's fabulous that's absolutely right we'll discuss how you guys can find easy ways to work meditation into your life and why you should use it in your magical practice I'm working on it I've been working on you for decades trying to get you to meditate more and you keep going back to all the reasons why you can't and don't want to well I think you know you see it all over the place you know social media the internet wherever meditate meditate meditate meditate I know you you have pushed it since literally the day I met you a billion years ago but I always came at it from the perspective like at the time back then you know I had I was a single mom with two kids you know my kids were both in sports they were both in chorus they were both in band they were both in theater mama ain't got time for meditating like when am I meditating when I am driving from you know a volleyball tournament to a theater show like when am I doing this like there were times where we had dinner in the car in between events and and you're telling me to take a half hour out of my day to meditate what half hour what I don't think I ever said to take a half hour sh I never had 10 minutes very true but I have a meditation that you can do when you're already in an alpha state that only takes one minute well and I'm GNA share two ways that I am able to briefly meditate because they're not the most traditional sit there you know and close your eyes and type thing but I have I have two ways I'm going to share that when I make the attempt I can do it perfect so if you stick around to the end we will definitely give you some short and sweet ways to meditate so that you can incorporate that energy into your magical practice and one of them I actually I don't think any of them that I have or that you have are what you would think of as your traditional sit in the Lotus position with your legs all crisscrossed in ways that I cannot and have never been able to do and look all Serene with your fingers all nice and just with your eyes closed for an hour while your cares float away none of the meditations I have today look anything like that nor do any of my cares melt away in that time because all I'm doing while I'm meditating he thinking about all my problems well that's pretty true well let's uh start out with a little bit about what is meditation in case you're not sure or don't know what meditation is basically meditation it involves attention and awareness it is the practice of of paying attention to yourself in the present moment just observing yourself and observing your thoughts and everything that's going on within you with complete acceptance and no judgment so it it's it's basically training you to have an awareness and to be in the moment and I'd also like to point out too that by other people other than myself apparently um meditation has literally been practiced for thousands of years and it was actually originally meant to help deepen understanding of the Sacred and mystical forces of life but nowadays it's more of a relaxation and stress reducing thing so they say Lea says it I'm not sure it is definitely a method that has been proven for thousands of years I need to practice what I preach I hear you guys but but yeah it's it's definitely something this isn't no new age fad when we were first introduced and we were talking about magic and starting a coven the biggest thing I use meditation for at that time was because I had discovered the joy of getting into an alpha State having your brain in an alpha state allows you to be in a very magical space and I had discovered that that worked very well for my practice of anytime I wanted to do a spell if I was going to do ritual if I was drawing down the goddess being in an alpha State very much facilitated the flow of magic but I don't feel like meditating and and going into Alpha are necessarily the same thing they kind of are because when you're when you're meditating you're paying attention to your breath and you're paying attention to what's going through your brain but you're kind of you're active and yet passive at the same time and to get into that Alpha state where you're kind of half asleep but awake it's the same thing it's an active passive State and so meditation naturally brings you into that Alpha state so even though you don't know it shell every time when you were teaching yourself to go into Alpha you were actually meditating to get there but let me ask you this when I am going going into Alpha state I'm usually doing that with intention okay but when you're meditating what the hell is the intention to be there right there just in that moment you can have different intentions when you meditate it's not to clear your mind a very common misconception that people have is that when you meditate you're supposed to be empty and completely mindless and have no maybe that's why I never that's what maybe why it never caught on with me because like I just I I can't I can't be empty-minded I'm a Gemini you're not supposed to be that's the thing that's what I've been trying to tell you all these years sh you're not supposed to empty your mind you're supposed to actually pay attention to those thoughts but not judge them okay so say you're you're sitting down in a relaxed and comfortable place and you decide to start to meditate so you get into your space and you pay attention to your breaths which is a very common way to meditate it's just really to pay attention to your inhalations and exhalations and while you're paying attention to your breath you're kind of relaxing your body and you may have a thought about oh I forgot to get milk at the grocery store that's okay it's all right that you had that thought be like okay I forgot to get milk at the grocery store and then let it go yeah but then I go into what else did I forget I can't let it go and that's where the practice comes in because you have to do that for as long as you can be like okay I'm focusing too hard on this milk maybe you're not in the right space to meditate at that time or maybe you need something shorter but the idea is to try and think those thoughts acknowledge that you thought that and then go back to paying attention to your breath or paying attention to relaxing each part of your body or moving your feet whatever your meditation happens to have been for example uh one of the things I did while I was at the parliament of world religions recently was they had two labyrinths and labyrinths are very near and dear to my heart you've always been a lover I have and they're wonderful for a walking meditation the um the YuYu Church where we used to teach wiah 101 put a labyrinth in outside a small one the Pagan community that we worshiped with also put in a labyrinth it's still there actually but I kind of took it I kind of took the labyrinths more as a connecting with deity as opposed to going within and meditating like you know what I'm saying isn't that a way to connect with deity though a I hate when you're right damn it but labyrinths have been proven to be an actual moving meditation it really does affect your brain the turns in these labyrinths go 180° and when you turn your body like that it actually switches the hemispheres of your brain and so these labyrinths are full of them and so you're constantly brain switching and it puts you into a very hypnotic meditative State particularly the last day I was walking the very large Labyrinth because there was so much I wanted to see so much I wanted to do but I was kind of peeped out I was done with all of it happens it does but I wanted to experience more and I wanted to try to remember to be in this place so as I walked the Labyrinth I repeated the phrase be here now you know ramas and that whole idea of be here now did I repeat that constantly the 20 minutes or so it took me to walk the Labyrinth no you know I would think about a class I needed to go to or my kids or my husband but then I would gently remind myself to be here now and just go back to moving my feet and saying that phrase over and over again and it was very very calming and very wonderful to walk that and to do that Mantra and moving meditation I I have been doing a lot more of the enjoying the now and and and being out in nature and kind of be just taking it all in but I guess i' never thought of that as a meditative thing it is especially if you the next time you go into the woods and I know you love to go to the ocean I do but I love the woods but I just love the ocean a teeny tiny bit more either one wherever you go someplace where your soul is happy happy when you go to that place just take 30 seconds 10 seconds and put your toes in the sand and take a deep breath and just say be here now as you exhale and that's a meditation and the more you do that the more you can train your brain well we as our our listeners will find out here uh in the next week or so we spent some fun time together this past weekend and we actually were at a beach and inand I I remember actually sitting there for a few minutes I'm like I don't know if you remember I was taking pictures of my toes in the sand and I was like man here I am with the love of my life and my best friend and we're on the beach and we got a fire and this is  great but never thought of that as like a meditative moment not exactly I mean it could have been if you chose to kind of put it that way but you were in a state of flow you were in a state of magic and and a state of just pure happiness we all kind of were we were we could feel that energy that really good vibe and that can be a meditation especially if you took a moment to pay attention to your breath and made it a meditation and one of the things I said I I would mention two specific ways that I have gotten a little bit of a grasp on meditation one of those ways is um bathing whether you are a showerer or a bath person um either way and I've done it either way you know sometimes in the shower people look at that as kind of a a cleansing of sorts you know you you visualize everything being washed away by the shower but as you're doing that as well it kind of can be the you know just pay attention to your breath just kind of feel the water just you know kind of I look at it as like a mind clearing you know not just cleansing your aura in your soul but kind of cleansing your mind too and I just kind of sometimes you know people complain take like a half hour shower I probably spend a good 10 minutes of it just kind of standing there and just being eyes closed water and just thinking about nothing but that water that's saying yes and that is that is kind of for kind of the ADHD Gemini in me that is the the one way I can just calm the mind for a moment is like with that shower and the same thing with a bath I mean you know I I I love a good bath you know ESP what tub put some candles around or even if you can't put them on your bathtub put them you know on the sink or the toilet or whatever next to your tub you know create that space and just sit in that water and just be you know and you don't have to have the Instagram perfect bathtub none of us do honestly we don't but you know just light a candle in your bathroom you know maybe some incense or maybe if you have a bath bomb and just be in the water and just think about nothing but how great it is to be in the water that is perfect and shell you hit on a wonderful Point set and setting it definitely makes a difference if you regularly get in the shower and spend 10 minutes just being in that moment and and letting the water wash over you and just breathing and being that's a meditation and because you do it in the same place at roughly the same time with the same sound sounds and the same smells all around you that becomes a trigger to your brain our brains our subconscious likes that it likes repetition it's almost like you know you're going to have that calmness the minute you get in the shower and even if it's like one of those I have to go in the office that day and I woke up 10 minutes late and I legit have 20 minutes to shower get dressed and be out the door somehow someway it might not be 10 minutes but I still find that moment in the shower where I don't really care if I'm G be late for work because I have that moment and because you have set that repeatedly your brain knows this is time to meditate and can go right to that and once you've done this enough times later in another place when you need that Serenity you can recall the shower remember the shower remember what it felt remember the smells The Sounds the sensations and you can put yourself right back into that meditative State and that's when you know that the practice is really working right now I've talked a little bit about being in an alpha State and I know in other episodes we've explained it so I'll explain it a little bit here uh your brain works on different vibrational levels beta is when you're Wide Awake Alpha is when um when kind of like the early morning stairs or when you're doing something kind of on quote unquote autopilot like when you're driving to work every day and you just kind of know how to do it without thinking or like if you go to the doctor and get that like Twilight anesthesia like you're not asleep but you're not totally with it exactly and then after that comes the Theta state which is more of a hypnotic State that's when your subconscious is completely in control and and you're very very suggestible between Alpha and Theta is where a lot of shamanic work gets done because you're not as suggestible but you're very much able to talk to that subconscious so if you can get into an alpha State uh it's a good state to do magical work in because you're kind of starting to talk speak your subconscious and work with that part of your brain and that's where when artists get into a flow or people that are doing a craft or or some type of physical activity they talk about getting into like a flow State you're usually in an alpha State and it's a very creative space I I think with me and and and don't get me wrong you know I don't want people to think that that being not as meditative is is maybe others um that that Alpha is difficult because it's not but again that's a trained habit I mean we would how many times did we do that Crystal Cave countdown to go into an alpha like you know I can kind of just close my eyes that's a meditation shell is it really it is no no  you're killing me you're killing me here see that's why we don't argue about it anymore because I know you've been meditating all this time just in your own way you huged winked me I did I think one of the things that bothers me about info that's out and about is there's this sense online that you have to fit into a certain mold or you're doing it wrong and I think that's why I kind of wanted to make sure I pointed out my perspective on this because you're not doing it wrong no no matter what you do you're not doing it wrong um I got a cat ready to jump on the computer I'm sorry freaking cats today it is Mercury retrograde I just have to say and Venus retrograde and Saturn retrograde okay she went just saying in Virgo you know yeah Mercury's retrograde in Virgo so fun but I wanted to give my perspective especially because I don't want people to feel like if you're not doing it the way a a internet person tells you to do it or a Tik Tock person tells you to do it that somehow you're not doing it right the second way that that I meditate and one thing I'm a big huge fan of is tea you know I love tea like hot tea cold tea any tea t t t t te do hot cup of tea like I have to have sugar and I like creamer too but stiring that teapot or not tea poot the tea teacup stirring in the teacup there's just something almost like watching that swirl down the middle like pulls you in you know it's almost like when you watch the Flames of a fire you kind of get pulled in same with stirring the teacup and and that big swirl in the middle kind of pulls me in and I know that a lot of people do a lot of te tea drinkers anyway they do find tea to be a good simple way to kind of ground yourself and focus on just being so as a huge tea drinker and a tea proponent I can incorporate getting into that meditative State via a cup of tea shell I love you girl you are just setting me up left and right today because that's another thing I wanted to talk about another super simple way and this actually involves tea or coffee or your caffeinated beverage of choice in the morning all hail lady caffeina but in the morning you are naturally in an alpha state that kind of meditative half awake half asleep state where your subconscious is a little bit in control so why not use that because you're already in that Alpha state so when you wake up instead of Doom scrolling on your phone and I know y all do it get your journal and go make a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and do it with just a little bit of intention you can just shuffle your feet over in your soft comfy robe you don't have to really work at it but just think about what you want to do for the day maybe you're going to work maybe you're working from home maybe you're taking care of the kids or the animals or the farm or whatever yourself good Gods set that intention while you're in that Alpha State while you're slowly stirring your tea you're infusing that tea with your magical intention and write in your Journal about your day what you want draw a Sigil if you're into that sh it draw a tarot card and just be in flow space and write what that card means to you while you're in that Alpha State just write it all out in your journal and then later come back and look at your journal and see where you were at where your brain was at what you were thinking while you were in that morning Alpha State and if you do that every day that again becomes a practice that you're used to you know what Alpha feels like you know how to work magic in that state and you'll be able to use that repetition to put yourself back into that state anytime you're stirring tea or stirring coffee or writing in your Journal just by fact of having done it so often you know I have I have a lot of people ask me what can I do to to be more magical what can I do to embrace magic and Witchcraft more and I think no matter what you're into no matter what you want to study where you want to focus what your what your jam is I think the biggest piece of advice I can give is be habitual none of these things are going to happen by reading a book none of these things are going to happen by doing it once whether it's reading tarot cards or going into alpha or meditating or doing magic doing spells it's all habitual it's all about making it a habit doing it repetitively it it's this isn't oneand done stuff you got to be habitual with whatever it is that you're focuses I am over here cheering you on I know our listeners can't see this but I'm clapping because yes yes yes especially with meditation be intentional do it the same time every day like we said earlier use the same incense play the same music and even with the tee thing you know maybe you're like me and wake up 30 minutes before you need to walk out the door for work I do the tea thing once I get to work by the way but also at nighttime I also kind of use it as a let go of all the of the day kind of release everything because you you can't go to sleep with that weight on you every night or you ain't sleeping good okay so sometimes it's it's more of a nighttime thing as well like I get the whole you know waking up and and the journaling and the sigils and stuff but you can on the flip side if you can't fit that into that part of your day you can use it as a letting go of the day that happened already yeah is more like a letting it go letting it be let me get back into some good space so I can sleep espec especially also if you're into dream work because you want to clear your head and clear your day to go into that dream state with a clean slate absolutely and I I find as we've been traveling this intentional path that's exactly what I've done I I tend to meditate in the morning when I first wake up and I'm journaling and also later in the evening right before I go to bed and I often will combine crystals with my evening meditation just to kind of do a little bit of a cleansing I do have a couple different herbal Blends that I like to use as well in the evening for relaxation and calming but I also like to add that cleansing aspect to it as well especially if I've been ping a lot that day or doing a lot of energetic work I need that little bit of Letting Go time yeah that Letting Go time absolutely and it does help me sleep better because our again our brains like repetition we like schedules a lot of times and our magical brains are no different you can set yourself up for success with meditation by making sure that you're hydrated make sure you're rested like shell said do it on a schedule pick the same time or the same space to do it in and meditate for very short amounts of time do it for a minute in the shower do it for three minutes in the morning when you wake up it does not have to be a 90 minute full-on guided meditation and I'd also like to point out real quick you know we're kind of focusing on that specific type of meditation where your your eyes close calmness whatever but I want to point out that that there's a lot of different kinds there's guided meditation taii yes Tai Chi is is a meditative thing moving yog for all you yoga fans out there yoga can be a form of meditation so your morning walk can be a morning meditation right so these are things that maybe you're already doing maybe you're like me let's not admit that to Lea and you're doing things already that you don't realize are meditative and and hell I mean I know we talked about traditional ways to meditate but my current favorite way to meditate is beet saber is what beet saber it's a that it's a VR game where you're swinging laser swords to slice colorful blocks but when I put the headset on and I put the headphones in and I'm playing some of my favorite music and you actually start moving and dancing and swaying there's a couple songs that are a little bit slower Green Day I'll just say it right now Green Day but it's very much a meditation because of the way that you're in your own space and you're just kind of moving and swaying to the music and it becomes very much a meditation for me so it meditation can look like a lot of different things so if I go into a game of beat saber knowing that I'm going to do it to try and center and connect myself it becomes a very different experience than if I go into it thinking I'm going to play a competitive game game okay listeners Lila's a nerd we'll continue on so a lot of the meditation that you do again set your intentions set up your space don't set yourself up for failure by asking yourself to do it for too long but do make sure that you won't be disturbed and find something that you enjoy and don't think you have to do what other people tell you you have to do to be meditative exactly do what works for you how you want it the way you want it for the amount of time you want it whatever you come up with that's the right way that's right and there are a lot of different ways to try it I mean I literally thre every single different type of meditation at Shell and she said nope not doing any of them and then she found her own way to do it that worked for her and has worked amazingly well for her for quite a while so again it doesn't have to look like you think it has to look like going back to the parliament of world religions and we will absolutely do an episode where we review all the fabulous things that happened there but and I can't wait to hear about it there was an amazing Workshop that was put on by members of Circle Sanctuary I believe it was River higinbotham and Jasmine and it was a chanting Workshop where they taught a lot of pagan chants to other pagans like myself as well as people from all sorts of different religions they had one of the most packed rooms I saw in some of the workshops I love chanting I do too and I'll see if I can play a little snippet but I'll have to get some permissions first it was one of the most wonderful meditative experiences had but we were chanting but it was so easy to get into the chant and with everybody doing it together and all that energy Focus together it was a very magical meditative experience oh I miss that big group atmosphere and togetherness and you can really feel it when you're in a group like that when you're drumming and you really get into the rhythm again that flow space is an alpha space which is a very meditative place for your brain to be so it's good for you it can help reduce stress it can help lower your heart heart rate and it can also be fabulous for your magical practice obviously we did not touch on all the different types of meditation or the ways to get into it and we will definitely be doing some guided meditations and a few things on this channel as well as elsewhere and I I've succumbed to okay I meditate I'll admit it fine but not in the traditional sense so again don't feel like you have to fit into a box exactly because you don't and if you don't want to do it yourself you could hire a meditation professional that can help through it you can find guided meditations on YouTube or online you can read one and record yourself reading it and then listen to it in a meditative space so there's all sorts of different ways to do it and you can just take a shower woohoo or have a cup of tea even right so I think that's that's going to wrap it up for for our meditation episode and I'm glad you had some good points as much as I respect them I'm going to stick to my own way and I know you respect expect that absolutely but I am looking forward to our next episodes as well so we want everybody to like us give us some Stars give us some comments check us out on Instagram shoot
