wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a special meditation edition of back on the broomstick this is a companion episode 2 number 129 water energy of motion intuition and the sacred self and this meditation to borrow a pun from Shell dives into the magical emotional and intuitive energies of Elemental water and I'm going to be honest with you guys this meditation was really difficult for me to write and record I think this is revision number seven or somewhere around there things are a little crazy right now the world is in a lot of upheaval emotions are running High the ground seems to be shifting underneath our very feet and tomorrow is not certain I'm feeling a lot of emotions myself a lot of anger fear concern a lot of frustration and helplessness and every time I tried to dive into my subconscious and into those emotions I would get either extremely upset extreme  angry or extremely weepy it was difficult I had to work through a lot of those watery Deep Emotions myself I think before I could really face this meditation so I apologize for how late it is but I'm pretty happy with it where it is at this point so that being said in witchcraft water is the realm of emotion intuition dreams and the Deep subconscious it's very often associated with the West the direction of dusk Twilight in the in between water is The Cauldron of carrot with it is the sacred well of the subconscious from which we draw our magic working with water energy and meditation allows us to connect with our magical mind the subconscious or what some might call the dream self this is where imagery in motion and intuition live we're going to Journey inward to that sacred well of water to access deep inner knowing that ancient wisdom that transcends logic  the place where the old gods of the Sacred Waters and where your magic lives  water can help you move through blockages and that's pretty much what I've been doing these last couple weeks trying to work with this elements and get a meditation out to you guys I had a lot of blockages I have a lot of motion so working with this on a pretty regular consistent basis has helped me to connect and kind of calm those tides to come those Raging Waves and unlock the inner peace and healing that I was trying to talk about for our bodies are made up of mostly water just like the tides we respond to the Moon we respond to the energies around us are blood are tears the tides and rhythms of our life Echo at the rivers and oceans of the world the same water that is in our body has moved to clouds to the roots of the tallest trees your ancient streams before finally finding its way into ourselves  we are made of the Moon charged Magic from the Waters of every witch who ever said a jar out under the full moon we are not separate from the element we are the water and the Chalice working with elemental water helps you become soft without breaking to feel these emotions especially when motions are running hot and high to feel those emotions without drowning and not to feel those unseen currents of magic and energy in life and to know when to grab them and to know when to surrender went to the cycles of Evans low which is that still water reflects truth and rough water has the power to reshape a landscape so far this meditation we're going to travel with into that sacred well the sacred Waters within ourselves and meet the old gods that are there recognized them see what gifts of strength and Justice and wisdom that they have for us and then bring those energies back  two of The Waking world so that your space find someplace where you won't be disturbed maybe where you can hear the fountain or maybe you have a bath in the Next Room or if you're lucky you can hear the sound of rain on your window if you'd like to you can play a video of rain sounds and promise I won't tell anyone and your subconscious won't know the difference you could play a little light music reminds you of water make things soft and comfortable maybe blue fabric or blue pillows or white silver blue candle maybe an incense that remind you of clear beautiful day is have a smell of a spring rain a little bit of water and some food for after the ritual to reconnect with your physical self once you're ready to settle into your spot and if you feel comfortable and good doing so go ahead and close your eyes  alright let's begin
