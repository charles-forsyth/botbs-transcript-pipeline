on that we decided to do another witch's answer episode and get to some of your questions that we think everyone might benefit from hearing enhancer to you know I love these because I feel like it's kind of a way to be interactive with everybody even though they're not here with us in the moment and I love the questions and we always get really awesome questions and we do get a lot and it's hard

back to you  I promise I just can't give you a time line so I'm actually going to dress up as real quick and then I promise we'll get into the questions but we did have an email not too long ago someone who's offered to help because they have heard us mention before that it's just the two of us and oh my gosh I love the idea of having a little bit of help is not professional by any shells in a bathrobe I'm in my basement we just hang out and talk about witchy things to each other and love having all of you guys along for the ride but we have real jobs and other things outside of this is kind of just a hobby this doesn't make us any money we don't we don't have any training in this be kind of learned all of it on the fly so we're having a ton of fun with it don't get me wrong but this is just too very adventurous newbies you are so humble cuz you are the biggest techno-geek and you know I am the comedy here like you  you are the Techno princess and queen thank you myself and all the listeners appreciate everything that you do an awesome job that we have done a techno which is kind of out here on the airway a question question is from Sabrina she says that she's fairly new to Witchcraft she's been soaking in all the information that she can practicing small things here and there she says that our podcast has been a big part of her journey thank you Sabrina we appreciate that one of her children will be going on vacation with her sister and her family soon he's never been away from her for that long and she would like to do a protection spell for him as well as the rest of them she does trust her sister I get it I guess sisters I totally get it but you'd be more at ease if you could give them a little extra protection I guess  nothing wrong with being a mama bear and wanting your kids protected your sister her family she's asking do we have an easy protection spell for beginner witch absolutely we've got you I know you got something up your witchy Slaves Shall and I have a couple ideas of things that we do in my family I love trinkets I love things I must have been a fairy in another life I am all for carrying crystals I am all for amulets whether that be in the form of a necklace or a ring or whatever I do like temporary body art a henna tattoo of a Sigil you know I know that doesn't necessarily work for everybody and might not be appropriate for small children but that's generally my go-to this if I were in this particular situation my daughter went away to school several years back Jesus she's a full grown adult now but she had gone away to school and I had  coffin nails and put them in her car to protect her when she was driving back and forth from school because she was about an hour and a half away from home so I'm big on amulets or crystals or something magical like I said the coffin nails whatever works best for you sing with coffin nails is they were used to create spiritual barriers and ward off negative energies entities in influences some people would put it on their property or or bury it somewhere on the property but it can also be used as a protection in a ward in a barrier in your moving car magic and I know I'm a lot of Appalachian Traditions as well as other food conjurer other type of folk magic Traditions as well but particularly in Appalachian magic I know that one of the men  uses of coffin nails is for protection so letting them in a vehicle makes perfect sense something like black tourmaline for protection with maybe a Sigil on it I love that you said trinkets because that's exactly what I was going to say to my family travels a lot my children travel we travel together so we actually have specific trinkets if we're all going together will usually each carry a trinket with us that we've carried before one of them in particular it looks like a small coin and it has a tree on one side and on the other side of his family we have like four different things that will use but that's one of them that will use we almost have like this little tradition where when we are saying goodbye to the person who's leaving we will make sure one of us to give them one of the trinkets that we have charged in the past with travel protection and because we've used them so often we don't even need to  beautiful ceremony with those anymore just the familiar ceremony of saying goodbye and giving someone the protection trinket is enough to activate the spell because I got medals jewelry crystals tend to hold spells very very easily you can even involve a child in that if there's a trinket that they like even a teddy bear or a blanket will hold a spell for a short. Of time or if you can put a not around like maybe a scarf around a teddy bear or not in a blanket to hold a spell that can be a very simple way to charge an item with protection for someone who's okay you know I'm famous for left turns I totally need I I need to interrupt you and stop you and take a left turn love it where we going okay this is another case of how you and I are so damn simple it's frightening so you said you had a coin with a tree on it and what does what does it say on the back family okay funny story so  my sweet love we actually it 1.7 years ago when we were not living together got coins and I have it right here on one side is a tree but on the backside mine says may you know nothing but happiness from this day forward it looks very similar to mine we are too so when you said that I was like oh my God ever treat going to we have a few of them that we use for a little and we still do it and again it's kind of part of a little bit of a ceremony and when I think it was kind of chosen we would do a ritual little spelled charge it specifically with protection but again because they've been used so many times for that we don't really need to do that anymore you know sometimes it's not necessarily a thing or a trinket it can be just just a idea or a thought because you know sometimes bother you  you know my sweet love and my children at nausea I am one of those people that I don't care if it's in your face and I know damn well you see it I am going to be hey look at the Moon I'm literally one of those people and I would drive my kids nuts especially cuz me and and every night look at the Moon kids both of my kids have told me that there's been times cuz you know all three of us actually live in three different states that they felt safe when they looked at the thought of my arm so sometimes it's a thought more than a trinket or what-have-you I taught my girls a charm when they were very very little and it's dumb it's the dumbest rhyme ever are fire and water this house is safe safe for Witch's Daughter makes no sense right and you know we have this little thing song You way of saying  and I've done that with them since they were very very little you know when they would go to bed and they were scared of there's a monster under the bed or the Boogeyman in the closet or when the plane was taking off and they were worried about it because we've done that as a charm of protection anytime they were worried even as teenagers and now one of them is in her early twenties they still say that charm the whisper it to themselves or they'll think it over and over in their head if they're walking down the street and they're a little scared or you know if they feel like there's a little bad energy in a space that's a charm that they will automatically go to and it clears the energy immediately again because it's something they've used so often you know it was a powerful charm when they were little it's still a powerful charm now I love and energy before we get off this question I just want to say that this is a wonderful time also to practice long-distance energetic use because learning to use energy on yourself or someone else with  someone else's permission to shield and to use that energy to create an energetic bubble of protection around them is a vital part of working with energy of working with magic and so this is an excellent time to learn about energy to your child you don't have to give them anything you could just say you know every day at 1 I'll be thinking about you and then think about that person and surround the constructs that beautiful bubble of energy around them in light and love and protection and for their best good and then practice that practice drawing that energy up into you and projecting it to that person to give them that protective bubble that protective shield and it's a great way to protect them at a distance and also to help you work with energy in to learn to work with energy more strongly  in a funny story about that I did the same thing with my children growing up and I literally my son you know he was in his late twenties and Laura that pains me to say I can give that boy like that evil mom look from 200 miles away and he sees it home and my mother is just she knows and she's not even here like I can give him that look from a fire there's a bunch of ideas and connected you have a unique energetic connection with this being that you nurtured you raised your grown you have a bond with this person and you can utilize that bonds to send them beautiful wonderful loving energy or to yell at them across distance like Sheldon  this message came from Sandra and she says I have my misgivings with the spirit world do I feel that the veil is there for a reason I was Harry I have avoided communing with Spirits or having anything to do with mediumship is this okay do you have to commune with spirits to be a witch know Sandra do you do not answer the next question so yeah I know you do not have to do anything with mediumship to be a witch none at all I think you should get comfortable with the idea of it but do you have to work with them know this question Sandra you say as a solitary you've avoided communing with Spirits or having anything to do with mediumship that strikes me as worry or fear her and I would hope that that's not the case but do you have to work with them know but I also would not want you to be afraid of them I'm not saying don't work with them because there is a fear there I'm saying you don't have to  if you don't want to but if there's a fear there I would hope that you would maybe learn more about that work with that a little bit you know I think that for people who are reluctant and maybe want to like dip their toes into it and not go off. Contact you now try to connect with a relative that has passed that you had a connection with my go-to would be a grandparent or maybe someone closer but sometimes I think that reluctancy comes from Fear you know it's like the ocean if you don't know what's there and you can't see that it's scary you know it's a very good point I also emphasized that you do not need to if you don't want to he just don't want to for any reason you do not have to work with any type of spirits of people or energies any of that you do not have to work with any of that to be away like that  what's the weather shell and I are big proponents of learning as much as you can I don't want you to be afraid of any of these things we would like you to learn and know as much as you can about it so that you can be educated and make a decision that way rather than through fear and learning and knowing doesn't necessarily mean practicing correct you know I have learning something you said I was like alright moving on you know take the bus leave the rest I say be familiar enough but if you are not comfortable with it and you do not like it then you know what you need to know and walk away and be done mediumship Spirits are different to me than land entities been land Spirits than eat your energies and nature spirits and you don't have to work with them to be a witch either although in my personal opinion I think that would be extremely difficult because my brand of Witchcraft and and what I very strongly believe paganism  and Witchcraft is is very deeply connected to all life to the Earth and two living things into all the cycles of this beautiful wonderful place so I think that would be very difficult but obviously it can be down there are people who do it so yeah you can be any kind of what you want you don't have to work with any energies you don't want to but I do think learning about it so you don't have to be afraid this wonderful and you know I think that maybe the method in which you do it or or give it a try is also going to be key all right so next question is a very short question and I think it has a very long answer words what study would you advise to help open your third eye  third eye is something that came from him it's an idea that came from Mostly Hinduism and Buddhism and it refers to a spot on your forehead just above and between your eyes in the middle of your forehead essentially and that corresponds to it's a chakra the Asiana I'm probably saying that wrong I apologize is a j a n a or brow chakra I literally have always just got out of my head Shakra just saying it's metaphorical and it's called sometimes quote the eye of introspection a lot of people say you have two eyes to look outward and one eye your third eye to look inward when you awaken that I the idea is that you have had a deeply personal and transformative experience that you are able to access insights about yourself insights about personal understanding your place in the universe or at least you know a little taste of that as you start to open up your third eye  I supposed to help you look Inward and it can be very deeply spiritual and very deeply meaningful so activating that can really open your psychic abilities I can open up your your magical abilities that can help you with meditation I can help you with a lot of magical practices so quite a few witches will work with the idea of opening their third eye to help them activate that magical energy and that beautiful insights that can give them access to more of their potential more of their which who sells I guess the last piece cuz I was worried you were going to stay with the introspection part because I have never really utilized my third eye for introspection work that is such a me thing I don't do is shovel says but because I am able to open my third eye  can utilize that to kind of I don't know a better way to say it but get myself there you know whether it be in alpha or in that magical you know it's time to do ritual it's time to the honor or or whatever the case may be that is kind of you know I close my eyes and kind of look out my third into I want to say the magical world but the magical yeah a lot of people especially witches and magical practitioners will use some form of breath work or meditation to activate that third eye and just like you said not to sit there and be introspective and and look at themselves or or do Shadow work although you can do that but more to activate their magical brain and to get into that being able to see those magical currents of energy and feel that that magic is active within you and that you're connected to all of that no  you know read ten bucks get 10 different answers I think for me it really kind of it started with meditation and continually doing things like you know the Crystal Cave meditation think of when when you wake up in the morning in your eyelashes kind of flicker but your eyes aren't quite open yet and then you know he just kind of Peak open I think that consists of meditation is what got my little eye lashes my third eye flicker in and you know kind of waking up the and now I can kind of do it on command so I think repetitiveness what do they say you do something 21 times and it becomes habit meditation is what kind of got me to flicker in that I open meditation and breathwork is definitely a great way to do it so the best way to visualize it is when you're sitting down in your meditating close your physical eyes and then focus on the center of your forehead and some people will even  I believe we did it in the meditation that we posted not too long ago we talked about when you breathe it in imagine that are coming in through the center of your forehead and if you have trouble visualizing that one thing you can do is lay down and take a small Crystal take a piece of lapis lazuli or take a clear quartz and place that on the center of your forehead then close your eyes and as you do the meditation focus on the cool Stone you'll be able to feel it sitting on your forehead the weight of it right there look at it with your eyes closed battle kind of cross your eyes and you'll essentially look at that center part of your forehead and you'll begin to feel it activated just by the weight of that stone and looking internally at that spot and then just start to work with that do your meditations of third eye opening breathe and feel the breath come through that chakra through that energy center the more you work with that the more you will wake him that I it'll start to become very easy you'll be able to do it on command  but sometimes it's easier to have a crystal there some type of physical sensation to help you visualize the no political visualizing not physical I now Dynasty then what peace and I think they done what piece is really up to you as an individual you get to that point where you literally feel that I open what do you see where does it take you and never took me to introspection that is a shell issue apparently but maybe it takes you to a different magical place maybe it takes you to communicating with Spirit you know you got to figure out what that looks like for you when you know what do you see in the morning when you open your eyes the same thing what do you see when you open that I I can't necessarily tell you what you're going to see when you open that I cuz it's probably different than what I saw what you saw or what the next person is going to see  how do you say you just got to open it and kind of work with it and get a feel for how do you feel where do you feel you're at you know you feel like this is a work on yourself or greater magical workings for me it feels more like Awakening my active magical brain Awakening that part of myself that is in touch with allergies and end with currents of magic and so opening that I allows me to see those energies and to see that magic much more clearly I'm going to say something that is so unexpected that may this might be something you should Journal oh my god did I say that yes you did say that making you more wise  I I wouldn't say you should record this cuz I may never say it again but I definitely think this is one of those things that might be best journaled because it is a process and you may have a different experience each time is your your opening that third eye so it pains me it kills me  if you are into smokable spells make yourself a little smokable joint little cannabis maybe a little blue lotus that when you do your medication put you lapis lazuli right on your third I have a few puffs of your herbal spell lay back and have the idea of opening that third I just look at the crystal that's on your forehead and that'll help you visualize that and like she'll said afterwards Journal everything you felt journal what you saw a journal the things that you thought do that for which you say 21 days 21 days after that discontent and she was looking for spiritual connection like a lot of us too and she kept being pills back to Witchcraft because witchcraft is amazing so I'm not  all the things looking for experts and sound back on the stick which were very happy for we're so glad you're here she's as I feel like you're my family not wise Auntie since we are the same age but really cool cousins I'll take it for your cousin's Samantha's having a little bit of trouble with an insurance company insurance company suck right person she wants to know if she should try a binding spell to prevent an aisle or something like a Prosperity spell to Grant her request and is wondering if we have any insight she also says if we ever decide to host a retreat or a seminar back on the broomstick boot camp for beginners she would totally be in so I can't say we haven't talked about it there's nothing to talk about it okay so I have to start off with don't ever listen to me cuz I am a crazy Gemini but I understand that you are thinking of  binding spell for Prosperity spell Layla we'll get to that in a minute really should start off with the Itchy ass. This is a tri-axle spell I'm telling you insurance company itchy ass will spell step to you know I'm almost torn because I like both of her ideas but I will say this I try to keep finding these two special occasions for is I like to call him the super douche has the pound to the whole world I would say maybe focus more on the positive outcome part of it because you also got to remember kind of negative breeds negative and you know again we don't want to be bound to everybody on the planet here I slightly disagree with shell and not because I have a problem with Texas I mean expeditious by all means they deserve it  and that when I kind of don't agree with either let me explain why or is he asshole spelling large entities is really difficult it is you know it yourself that's right we've all heard about the tick tock witches who cursed the moon and we've all heard about people who tried to curse various political entities we keep trying but very often are difficult we have to have realistic goals here people write insurance companies are very very large if you have the name if you have one person at that insurance company that is holding you up and you know specifically who's doing it. She has whole spell you'll be a tri-axle spell buying them throw them in the freezer whatever you need to do to stop at persons however insurance company is a whole are very large entities and think of magic like pushing things if you're going to push a stone you can throw that fucker really far you would chuck it across the lake if you want to  I could not Farm you can throw that stone really really far exactly an insurance company is more like a boulder yes you can push that Boulder but it's going to take time it's going to take my meds some it might take tools it might take friends it might take a lot of energy so I'm going to say save your energy for other things don't try to hex the insurance company what I'm going to say is do a road opener spell do something to ease the way for you and to open doors that might otherwise be closed so I would Envision a door opening spell literally stand in a doorway hold the handle of the closed door and stayed out loud all obstacles borrowing my way to health to unburden health to help without financial obligation she'll be gone and open and an open that door with force and say so be it or so it is or by my will something strong powerful as you open that door do that  do a traditional Road opening spell if you want to I wrote opening spell and a lot of Latin America and Caribbean Traditions Road opening a specific to those cultures but if the idea of that type of spell is to open the way to remove blockages opens doors that's why the opening doors spell I just mentioned could work really well but the idea is to allow energy to flow smoothly and clearly towards your goal so that's probably what I would do here for this type of working after you do the hopefully it'll land on the right person and that'll help and then do the door opening spells to clear the way for you and for your health and for your goals and that way it brings the focus back to you and things that you can control and your energy being open rather than trying to stop a very large Boulder by yourself definitely thinking this situation kind of working on  your path clearing your way is the less energy sucking to be honest with you set your intentions during a new moon work on spells as the moon waxes to grow your health to grow cooperation with the insurance companies and then on the full moon when that power is at its highest and its fullest and at its most strongest strength then do that spell and open the door and let that energy to flow Samantha I don't like insurance company a tri-axle spell so hopefully everything works out well for you and you get what you need we hope the best for you and that everything works out well they're all right so answer the next question OK Google one more and it's a little bit of a long one but a good one so this is from Kimberly and Kimberly rights  so I've always been a big ol atheist but I really feel like I'm supposed to be working with Venus right now in retrospect she's always been the embodiment of my spiritual self but I never really called it that before I gave an apple spice to the ocean the other day oh my God I love that and put a pink candle and some red flowers on my altar at which point two doves appeared outside the window where my Alternatives but how do I actually work with Venus to accomplish anything hold that thought there's a little more so that seems like kind of the first part she continues to write I am already happily partnered and a mom so I'm not super interested in that aspect of Venus hey totally get it but she adores the passionate slightly androgynous but very firm mother goddess parts of Venus Venus has energy and bringing abundance and luxury back into her life again and to help her achieve her creative goal  towards that end she also wonders Venus is very Mediterranean but Kimberly is Hawaiian on the other side of the world she's wondering if it's even accessible for her to get that Venus energy I'll get to that in a minute that I think I have a long-winded answer for but she wanted us to discuss Venus and ways to work with her or even go into detail on what it means to work with any particular goddess and how to do it she also says that were amazing and you know what Kimberly you are amazing and we appreciate you writing to us okay so Laila on the backtrack just a second so she put out the Apple slice in the ocean put a pink candle and some flowers on her alter but she's wondering how does she actually work with Venus so we'll start with that particular question first beautiful you already are you just did  instinctually however you found that information you know how to work with Venus she loves fresh flowers fresh fruits luxurious Cent music Beauty rituals rituals of self love and care that's perfect and the production is you know she said that she's already partnered in a mom so she's not interested in those particular aspects of Venus but is interested in other aspects to that I say you don't have to necessarily love or be a be tied up and every single aspect of every single deity that you work with that's unrealistic so you know maybe at one phase of time you are into the fertility of love and compassion pieces of Venus and then maybe at another point in your life you know it's maybe that the mother asks  EXO Venus like people evolved DD's evolved you know like I said before take the best you know leave the rest if you are not into the sexual aspects of Venus and that what she represents fine work with the mother aspects thing about Venus and other Roman goddesses is they very often have other names to honor different parts of them so I know that a couple of Venus's names are Venus Felix or her lucky ass back to you can pray to her for good luck Venus genitrix for her aspect as a mother the mother of Rome Venus murchie I guess because of Myrtle because it's Aunt Myrtle is sacred to her so I don't know what to think about that one but that's one of her name and Venus victrix because she's also the goddess of Victory so you can call to her I'm one of these names she has other names as well so you can call to her specifically would one of these names talked to her in that aspect  you want to you do not have to just worship her as love and beauty but like you said in your message you like the mother goddess the passion the luxurious Miss of her those are all foundational parts of her that are absolutely wonderful to call upon and to honor in worshipping her because there is a lot of love and beauty with being a mom you know maybe it's not the traditional way you think to work with those aspects but just put it into the perspective and how it relates to you and your particular spot in life that's what I would do but this next one so she sang Venus is very Mediterranean and she is very Hawaiian how do you make this work so hey Layla river that time way back when when I spent like a year working with Pele Kimberly might have heard of Pele before you know I think people connect with  allergies and DVDs in a way that there is no time and space there's a lot of a lot of answers to this imma let you in but I don't feel that when it comes to working with deity time and space play a part in this that makes sense to bring this back just a tiny bit to the beginning of your email Kimberly you mentioned being an atheist I'm kind of an atheist myself I don't I don't believe that the entities are actual human like beings that walk around I don't I do feel that they are energies there are aspects of humanity aspects of nature aspects of the world end of life and the universe that through a lot of different ways to become Siri like I literally just covered the ears on my account a statue just so you know I'm going to really twist your brain because I do believe  and deities in that way if it they are energies that they have ideas and will and force this is a whole other episode cuz I don't believe that they are actual being nice but I also believe that they are actual energies and entities so we'll get into that some other time because I think I have a totally different View and I would love to have this conversation however because of that I do believe that these energies that these entities are Universal ideas and learning about Venus if you feel drawn to learn about her learn about her that means she is calling to you find out as much as you can about her there is a wealth of information about Roman deity is particularly Venus they're very popular get a little statue so many books and information out there that you can find and and I think that's part of the fun and part of the worship is learning as much as you can about these deities what works for them and finding what works for you with them  that's part of the joy of it and that doesn't matter where you are or who you are in a lot of cases if this is not your culture of you're not Roman maybe you wouldn't want to say that you are an expert in in Roman deities and go around saying that you are now a high priest of Roman deities and you're going to teach everyone the ways because that's just not it but learning about it we're shipping out on your own finding that relationship within you that works for you and for your practice absolutely go for it so I would also add and I'm also a fan of a good statue if it were me would get some things related maybe and have those things on your altar for example you know with the Conte I have a statue I have some keys I have a little thing I made look like a Crossroads I have a statue of a like or sacred to her or or are associated with her  and I have those things on my altar to kind of bring her to me because well I can't go to her right now your question about what does it mean to work with any particular goddess and how to do it you know for sure it's Gathering those things and creating an altar to them and creating a practice and working with them and for me it starts very much with learning about these theories and I do a lot of reading I like to research them as much as possible I like to look at rituals and spells that people have done shortly with this deity and I I like to journal hot of it how I feel working with them what resonates with me about their stories their myths their folklore and through doing that it becomes very apparent what feels right just like you did Kimberly with your reading in your research you offered her fresh fruits that felt right to you that's something that you learned about her mythology that works for you and you felt the energy of that and you saw that with the two doves  set a do you know what a beautiful symbol of Venus with doves mate for life and are so adorable that way and I know I'm a weirdo but with Hecate it was more like conversation is like I know you you're such a bookworm and I love you for it but it was almost like those meditative conversation is like like we were talking on the phone like bestpals getting to know each other and she was whipping my ass into shape but I kind of more have like those Spirit conversations that I can save you read first communicate later I communicate first read later and sit down in the meditative space have a lit candle that you can focus on in a journal right there and asked if he had any questions or talk to them you know hey Venus how's it going with messages if you got for me today  and then no matter how silly it feels just write down whatever you feel write down whatever comes to you or just remember whatever comes to you mean you probably won't you should write it down know I remember sometimes has given me the mamluk before you go remember those things but have that conversation and write it down how does it feel talk to that deity surround yourself with things that remind you of Venus you know beautiful fabrics and sends sensual music venous Lake and then talk to her what messages do you have for me and then just write it all down no matter what it is write it down or pull your tarot cards are your rooms or you know I probably need anything I was just going to say we all know I'm not a super fan of Oracle decks but remember that goddess Oracle I have that you got the  I like using those cards as well for connection pull the Venus card and focus on it what do you see what do you feel you know was it make you think of it all those things down and and do that regularly I'm from Venus you could do that every Friday you don't do that every Friday in the summer when you feel sensual and beautiful and just try to see how that goes and also spend that time researching and learning if you reach out to some people that work with Venusaur that work with Roman deities and talk to them find spaces online where people are talking and discussing these things but for me it's a lot of education and Hands-On work with the things that they like and with that energy and please give me a book man and I'm so they're all right so one last question and this was posed by our Facebook discussion group we have the back on the broomstick Gresham Ford group run by the incomparable Helen  JoJo who is it and this is a fabulous group of witches who have all sorts of amazing questions I'm so sorry I haven't been on lately I've been having a little bit of a Facebook phobia rash I don't know Facebook gives me a rash lately so I haven't been there much but I hear that there's a question about we did an episode back in the first year that we were on about AI is there magic in a i and a couple listeners were concerned about what our stance was on a I particularly in light of the environmental costs and the idea that the AI is a thief and steals art so we wanted to talk about that a little bit and to address that just for a moment I would like to start off we've always talked about how you are way more in the know on techno stuff that I am and I didn't realize and I I don't think I realized till after we did that first episode  environmental impact of AI and it was fell out of my chair when I found out I'm like what the hell is going on so I'm not I'm not using that as a defense person but I think when we had that first episode and I was blowing over a I I didn't realize what that meant at the time so when it when people talk about the environmental costs of a I use what they're talking about is water and a I like a lot of other things relies on servers and the servers put off a great deal of Heat and the water is used to call these down and it's activated that's a chat CPT for instance uses about half a liter of water for every 100 words It produced which is a lot but keep in mind however this water is not lost it evaporates and it's reused so it's a closed system so they try to reuse a lot of that  it's still a lot of water and it still high and then fire mental cost I'm not trying to excuse this I'm just trying to tell you what it is now keep in mind that to produce a pair of jeans it takes four thousand liters of water so that's about eight hundred thousand words of a I again I'm not trying to excuse or make any judgments here I'm just explaining so that you can have an idea so I'm not saying that there isn't an environmental impact there is but I also think that it has been overblown for a lot of different reasons it's still not good and it's still a big part of why my AI is extremely limited I have even turned it off on Google make sure that you know what it's doing now when we first started with that episode I was not aware of how artists felt about it or what was happening with art back at the time  why was New back then was the other thing it's changed since we did those episodes has changed so much it is not even remotely the same it's so much different but I've had several conversations with all sorts of different people about Ai and the theft of Art and that is also a big concern there's also the idea that learning somebody learning or something like a computer or a i learning about art and then creating art is not that fast in NC that's what you and I were doing a i itself was trained on Art of famous artists and stuff like that comes back to is training on Art stealing art and I don't know I don't know there's a lot about AI that I don't know and I'm someone who is exposed to a i quite a bit full disclosure my husband works in a very high-tech field  so he works, we're both Geeks and so as part of his job he has to keep abreast of a i and its capabilities and so he works with quite a few of these regularly so I see it from a little bit of a different aspect does it still bother me yes have I disabled it on Google yes is it something that I have stopped using regularly yes because I am also concerned so it's here may is here is getting bigger and better at an exponential and kind of scary Pace who's in The Terminator having a baby right now and it's kind of 2025 so I think not knowing about it is not going to stop it and it's detrimental but I think there's a possibility in the future where people will have to I think it's going to become a bigger and bigger part of society and so I think we all need to kind of figure out  how to best deal with it if we want to cuz I don't think there's any stopping it so if we did talk about it we did talk about is their magic and Ai and something that can aggregate information and I can help you learn information that quickly I think there's benefits there I think that could be very interesting there's also danger of having just one voice you know if you do a Google search say Google still is kind of controlling what you see but at least there's a whole bunch of different information if you do an AI inquiry it's just one voice it's just one set of information although now there are some where you can get all of the sources that they use to find that information so I don't know this is a big complex question but what I can tell you is that it's not something that I think she'll or I use regularly if at all but I don't know I'm not someone who hates a I I'm not and I I think I can see a lot of good uses for it so  I don't know is the best I can answer that no it's not something that we use right now yes it's something that I think has a potential to be extremely dangerous and cause huge problem I also think it's something that could do great things to so I don't know I'm not smart enough for that question I'm still looking into it you know I know the answer the question but we live in a world that is ever-changing more rapidly than ever has and our lifetime and we're pretty old we may have an opinion about something and then learn better know better find out better and change our opinion so you know I know that folks go back and listen to old episodes but this is a good example of yeah we had a conversation about it and then we kind of learned a little bit better not that we are really knowing a whole hell of a lot about it but we learned a little bit better and  so this is a good example of how people can kind of change what they what their views are in changed how they think about certain things are topics when you know more and learn more and kind of grow more so I don't think it's necessarily we went back and forth on the topic I think it's more we learned more we grew more and now we know more you know when that's life right now you know yeah and even with that was something like this topic you have to keep learning it's not just learn a little bit and then be done this is changing all the time and so we're constantly taking a new information on computers came out and I need to get on the bandwagon but it was either like you leave or learn computers are you get left behind and I kind of feel like that's the way it is with a i you got to get a custom the world is going to leave  behind I don't want that either because I have a little bit of a peek behind the curtain I do see in scientific research and in some of these applications AI is doing amazing wonderful thing it's also the Terminator it's also the Terminator it's also putting people out of business is also making the same answers in the same things over and over again making weird art that keeps people out so I don't know that I don't know so I keep trying to learn as much as I can I guess is all I can say I'm still learning and still trying to figure all of this out just like the rest of us are we love you so we're learning we're trying to figure it out yeah I'm worried about the environmental impact but I'm worried about the environmental impact of our questions there so thank you guys so much for sending in these questions we love answering yes you do  excited again thank you guys so much for sending these in these questions came in on our
