it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to the stoned Witches Hour shell and Lila's favorite time to tell each other spooky Tales from across the USA while getting higher than Elon musk's Twitter debt on the greenest ganja in the land telling the most ghoulish ghost stories and smoking the dankest homegrown I'm Leila and I'm still not driving a Tesla but I'm shell yeah well you don't want to take a vanity trip on a penis rocket to outer space it was just Valentine's Day what better way to tell your love that you love them than by buying them a trip to just inside outer space on a penis shaped rocket by Elon Musk I mean you know just want to know who were the people in on this this design meeting men they were all men definitely that that's the shape we're going with the shape that we want to pierce the Earth's atmosphere and penetrate the universe with we've got it you know the worst part is is Elon Musk is the type of guy that he probably sat there and was like yeah this better look like a penis oh I'm sure he probably yeah it was probably written into the contract somewhere that it had to look as phallic as possible he just wants everybody to think he has a bigger dick than Jeff Bezos I'm not sure who's winning that war and to be honest I don't really care know so happy Valentine's Day listeners welcome to episode 56 of the stoned Witches Hour and if you didn't already have a bad Valentine's Day then I want you to imagine Elon musk's penis oh no there's not enough weed for them there is not enough weed for that and I'm currently still waiting on my weed guy because I'm out of homegrown I'm out I'm out I'm out and I'm sad you know I just got to point out whoever is delivering to you today don't name names because they suck because I feel like you've been waiting for this delivery for over an hour I have and well I have to say this is definitely a much better day I can remember the days of moving away like almost 3 hours away from my plug and not finding anyone in the new area I was in there were multiple times and driving the three hours I drove that three hours or my husband drove that three hours back sometimes we would visit you after stopping at the plug because at least that would help make it worth it so long gone are the days of having to do that I can just pick from multiple delivery services and have weed show up at my door so I guess I'm complaining but I'm not really complaining you're complaining but complacent right I'm about to get a like a half an ounce of thin mints and a half an ounce of mencino OG I'm going to get a gram of Super Lemon Haze diamonds oo and another gram of Gorilla Glue diamonds so I'm about to be a very happy girl well you just stole my thunder because I'm actually smoking some super Lem Haze this week and I haven't had any in a while so what is tell me and our listeners what is the difference between the Super Lemon Haze I'm smoking and what is the super lemon hazee diamond because I have a feeling that I'm going to be sad once I know the difference I am about to be smoking Super Lemon Haze diamonds that started out exactly the same way that Shell's flower Super Lemon Haze started out a very picky tough to grow pain in the ass yeah worth it sativa of Super Lemon Haze which is one of my OG faves and I know Shell's OG faves as well it's like the harder it is to grow The More I Love It I used to call sativas my head stash and I know a lot of other Growers did as well because as long as they took and as picky as they were they were worth it but the yield wasn't usually very high so not very profitable unless you sold them for astronomical amounts of money so I just keep it to smoke myself but anyway very tasty one of the reasons we both adore this cultivar is because of its lovely citrusy taste and AR actually tastes like what it [ __ ] says it is finally a name matches the taste it tastes like lemon it does and it smacks you right in the face with that high THC with that Delicious lemon with that sativa up Buzzy feeling you want to get up you want to talk you want to do things you want to be social and the Diamonds is this like laced with like the moon rocks and [ __ ] cuz I'll cry no moon rocks are something different moon rocks are a nug of cannabis that has been soaked in THC resin or some other type of liquid distillate or extract and then rolled in keth and so you get a very hard nug that's resiny all the way through that has keth on it and that's what's called a moon rock and that's what I love they're fabulous they look like a hard little Pebble and they will take you right to the [ __ ] Moon which is where they got their name from the THC on those is through the roof what I'm smoking looks more like a light clear sauce with what looks like literal white crystals in it did you say like a light clear sauce I did it's basically it's an extract THC diamonds are one of the most pure forms of THC or thca that you can get from a plant does it look like sap it does it'll look like a very it can range in texture but diamonds usually come in a very light sauce it can range from clear to a light amber color and then the diamonds themselves literally look like little clear diamonds or crystals in that sauce the way diamonds are made you take your plant you take your flower and you use either mild heat and high pressure to squish out the THC and the resin or you use some type of chemical to extract that resin you should squish it cuz the chemical is yuck yeah you get a lower yield but it's definitely much more pure and very very nice so um you use a cold extraction method to get the resin the live resin from a cannabis plant and you squish the resin out of that and then that has to usually um sit for a period of time that sauce usually has to sit in a cool place for a period of time and that's when you get the pure THC crystals and those will be roughly 99% THC and the sauce will have a lot of the tpin in it and as well as have THC 99% that's correct a [ __ ] your ass up it is now a lot of times these are what you'll see called thca which is the non psychoactive form of THC basically it just means it has not yet been decarbox it hasn't had any heat applied to it to change that thca to the psychoactive THC which is what gets you high and now I feel like we're having a science class it's not very scary you know we're we're not going to talk about this today partially because I don't have packaging and you don't have packaging yet but I do want to in a future episode I want to talk about labeling and how to read labels and what they're putting on the labels and what that means oh I love that so you you said thca and that's what sparked me to think of that because you see that on labels and then you'll see THC and THC CA well what the [ __ ] is the difference how do I know I'm not Lea I don't know the difference so that's going to be something that we're going to discuss when I have actual packaging to discuss it with is that a sloth weed breakout tray it is a sloth weed breakout I love it so much that is the cutest little sloth ever it's like one of those metal trays it's super cute that is so cute what a cutie Cutie sloth he's holding a pineapple he's holding a pine Apple I love it I just found out actually what an upside down pineapple means why what's an upside down pineapple mean I never knew this and I'm I'm feeling a little um a little out of the loop and dumb shell well I I don't know I'm like today years old like what's going on I saw this because on some Twitter thread or something some lady had gotten a pineapple tattoo while she was on vacation and all of her friends are like it looks like an upside down pineapple did you not know what that means and I just need to interject this before you continue any further um you know our friend from England yes we always played with pineapples and it kind of started out as a thing in our online phone game that you know you're being a dick so we're gonna shove a pineapple up your ass so oh I see we have this infatuation with pineapples so please tell me now because our our push and middle-aged selves with our friends think that these are funny and I'm afraid of what's coming out of your mouth next well apparently back in the day before there were swinging cruises oh God if you were on a regular cruise and you wanted to signal to other people on the cruise that you were open to The Swinging lifestyle you would somehow manage to place a pineapple upside down somewhere where people could see it my God because you know I guess you know this fruit pretty everywhere on these cruises right but you'd never see an upside down pineapple so if you put an upside down pineapple picture on your door or if you wore an upside down pineapple pin or if you walked around wearing a pineapple Hawaiian type shirt that had upside down pineapples on it that was the hidden clue that you were up for a little swapping action oh my God I did not know that and I oh wow okay i' had no idea and you know I guess it's less of a thing it's still a thing I guess on cruises I have never been on a cruise but I guess it's still a thing on cruises but less now that they have actual cruises for that type of thing you don't have to be so hidden you can just sign yourself right the [ __ ] up for a swingers Cruise they're like hm I want to do some swinging you just go on that cruise you don't have to covertly put your pineapples upside down anymore so ghost if you're listening we're going to move on from pineapples have to find something melt POS with Mr Potato Head when you come visit okay yeah just don't put it upside down pineapples are fine just not an upside down pineapple a little bit of uh upside down pineapple sex tips for you for our Valentine's Day episode or is it Valentine's Day um actually we're airing the day after Valentine's Day so everybody will have gotten their groove on and then they'll wake up and listen to us well there you go there's your tip for the day after Val Valentine's Day so depending on how your Valentine's Day went either really really well or really really badly you might need this upside down pineapple information I don't know just saying right now everyone's hot and bothered it was just Valentine's Day who knows what people got up to I don't know and I just got to say spring is springing here in in New England it's February it's not supposed to be spring yet we haven't hadara it was almost like 60 yesterday day it's like 50 something already today I'm thinking that with spring I am going to phase out not phase out forever but I am going to phase out my Silicone Love here what your favorite silicone pipe no well I didn't say it might not be replaced with something similar but I am going to search out in the spring a a new go-to pipe the thing with silicone pipe legit is the lid it's the lid you cannot discount a pipe with a cap especially if you're in a situation where you can't finish it or if you if you just want to pack it and pop it in your pocket right having a lid is so lovely and you are an on thee-o smoker quite often right so having that lid is important so I might get a new silicone pipe with a lid but I haven't ruled that out but I'm definitely going to to be getting something different in the spring but for right now I am still rocking this you can't go wrong with it you clean it with hot water you don't even need like chemicals to clean it like how easy how many glass pieces have I fallen in love with and lost in the same time that you have had that pipe I know right but you've acquired some pretty badass looking pipes though too I do I have some very beautiful glass that's lasting just fine but what are you smoking today sh I smoking some super lemon haes and I right yeah haven't had any in a while I probably haven't had Super Lemon Hayes in wow like two months or so I feel like I was on endgame for the longest stretch but I'm loving it I do that too I find when I get a deal or if I'm harvesting and I haven't been careful about amount sometimes I will end up smoking the same thing for the longest time yeah well this was like a deal thing like they were having I think what it is is they were getting to the point where they've got a new crop coming and so they're trying to get rid of the last batch before the new crops are ready to harvest so when they do that a lot like what a lot of the dispensaries do that grow their own and have their own Farms is when they've got a new crop ready to roll they will put the old crop on sale and get rid of it so that everything's new and fresh that makes sense so I think with the endgame think they were getting to the point where they had a new crop coming and they were just trying to get rid of it because it was quote unquote Old Stock I I smoked endgame for a good month month and a half maybe even two months solid because the deals on it were impeccable now the shelf life you can freeze weed I don't recommend it but you can and you can store it in a cool dry place to keep it for a long period of time but honestly after a few months it's going to start to degrade and you're going to start to lose potency anything older than 6 months on the Shelf you're probably going to want to look for something else will it still get you high will it still taste great yes and unfortunately I think a lot of especially the cheaper stuff you'll find on the east coast is stale West Coast weed because it still works but I think that's when you're getting that super dry super crumbly super packaged stuff particularly on the East Coast I think that's a stale West Coast weed so they're not quite as nice as some of the local dispensaries like you said that grow their own right they'll discount it a few months later to kind of move it move it quickly before it get stale and you know and that that's kind of what Happy Valley does pretty consistently is you know you can tell their cycle based on their sales because when they've got a new crop coming they're getting ready to dump and and you figure every three months so you know a three-month block that's that's not in my opinion still weed I will buy the [ __ ] out of that what did I get I got 15 one G pre gos for like 120 bucks like come on you can't beat that yeah the pre-roll sales that you found the smalls that we were talking about you know anytime you can find deals like that it's a great way to save a little bit of money because it does take a couple years after a place first legalizes for the prices to actually drop down they stay pretty high in the beginning right and we're what three four years until three four five years into legalization here in Massachusetts so things have really really settled down and because I know they do this cyclically with their grows I will buy the [ __ ] out of their sales when they're dumping them bring it on I'm the girl that you are marking that down for so my endgame run has ended and now I'm on to Super Lemon Hayes and boy it it's got that you want to clean you want to chat you want to get all your [ __ ] done it's a very that very upid high that you expect from Super Lemon Haze now after having done my first hit of the Super Lemon Haze diamonds is it how is it how is it it's delicious it's citrusy it definitely has a very high kick I can feel it immediately start to work once I take the hit now does that diamond give it more of a lemony flavor maybe less it's the sauce around it that has more of the flavor the diamonds tend to be almost strictly just thca and so there's no flavor whatsoever not no but they usually again are in sauce so there will be sauce on it or you can scoop more of the sauce with it when you do your dab hit so the diamond itself is almost entirely thca but it again they usually come in a sauce and that's more of the Turpin and more of the flavor so yeah great lemon taste it's fabulous love it very high ready for some scary stories I was gonna say you look [ __ ] up yep Valentine's Day just happened I don't know what you've got going today we just generally never talk about this beforehand but I've got some ghost stories of tragic love oh I'm excited about that I'm uh yeah that'll be good to that's good I know last year I talked about still one of my favorite episodes was the the Amorous bones yeah from Colorado so I'm curious to see my ghost story it's a lady in white story and as you know they very often start with a tragic romance and this one did too but it's more about the cemetery itself so a little less on the romance side I'm excited to hear your your spooky yet sad love Tales I have I have like three shorts we'll call them that are I don't know if you want to call them Happy Valentine's Day ghost stories all right well tell me your spooky Valentine's Day ghost stories first and then we'll get into my longer and frightening tale that actually mentions Ed and Lorraine Warren oo which actually I just recently saw on Facebook book that Lorraine Warren her birthday recently passed well the cemetery I'll be speaking about was just a few miles away from their home and is about one mile from the cemetery where they're both buried well I'm going to start out with a deathly love triangle who doesn't love a good love triangle on Val especially a deathly one right now there is a place in St Augustine Florida called the Castillo de San Marcos we know I pronounce stuff so horribly so don't email us yeah don't email us I already know I said it wrong um it's one of the oldest masonary forts in the United States so as you can imagine it's already got some Tales to tell in its walls to begin with basically it was built as one of the first forts to kind of combat Pirates oh okay so you know it's near that St Augustine Lighthouse like down in that area aside from the fact that the place is like dripping with Paranormal Activity we're going to kind of stick to this affair that led to murder at this place so I'm gonna take you back to 1784 because you know there was love triangles even in the 1700s oh so this Colonel it was Garcia Martini he basically was sent to this fort to do whatever Colonels do there I don't know rule the land be a drill sergeant I don't know so he brings his young wife Dolores he wasn't really the greatest husband he was kind of shitty ignored her kind of acted like she wasn't there kind of a how do they describe that on Pornhub she was like a she was like a free use wife oh great hold on hold on how do we get from 1700's relationship to PornHub free use wife big jump there folks there it's a leap it's Valentine's Day I guess we're doing that so she began to have an affair with her husband's assistant whose name was Captain Manuel Abella so she's having an affair with her husband's assistant and as you can imagine you know like they're working real close together so things are GNA kind of sneak out she wore a very unique type of perfume oh no I think I can see where this is going you know it's it's kind of like if you got that girlfriend who wears pachuli you're going to smell that pachuli no matter what okay so doloris has her very unique perfume and one day Garcia smelled dolores's perfume on Manuel oh no yeah so now the girlfriend who distinctly smells a pachuli now your best friend smells like pachuli and you're suspicious so as you can imagine in 1784 short after that Dolores and Manuel go missing oh both of them okay shockingly surprise Garcia the husband told everyone that Dolores had returned to Spain and that he had sent Manuel on a special assignment to Cuba okay convenient very convenient I'm sure everyone believes him no problem because he's the colonel yeah your wife went off to the Homeland and you had to send your number two off to Cuba to do some stuff no questions asked no questions asked 50 years later you know the things you could get away with in 1784 right no one questioned a thing like like it's not like you're gonna call and find out anything right so this is where it kind of gets really sad 50 years later a hidden room was found in a dungeon behind a brick wall at the Castillo de San Marcos oh wow and the remains of a woman and a man were found there he walled them up some versions say that they were chained to the wall and some say that there was basically a pile of human ashes like they were burned to death damn kind of those specifics are a little bit sketchy depending on what stories you read either way all the stories go back to they were bricked behind this dungeon wow walled up in a dungeon and just left there yeah speaking of your lady in white so there are sightings of a woman in a white dress reported on the site which they assume is Dolores some ghostly things related to this specific story is where they found that brick wall leading into this dungeon they say that that sometimes you can faintly hear a man and a woman screaming oh now again gross this place is like soak and wet of Paranormal Activity up and down inch of the place but those specific things relate to this story this location has everything from seeing soldiers Walk The Halls wow to again supposedly Dolores their version of the lady and white dress well you know the lady and white stories always seem to precipitated by some type of tragic love story which this obviously qualifies right you know it's it's it's kind of sad and you know back then you could easily make people disappear so Colonel Garcia Marty never you know there was no consequences to this he just made him disappear done yeah and depending on how powerful and how well-liked you were who would question him why would there be any question that his wife went home and just never came back sometimes that happened and like I said there's no way to call any type of Correspondence could take years especially when you say that your wife went to Spain from Florida in the 1700s how you ever disproven that you're not exactly nope so he got away with it got away with it and you know 50 years later they found the bodies but by that time I would assume he was long dead right so I'm going to jump real quick up to Forester Michigan so this is a sto a quick story of forbidden love there was a a young girl mini Quay she was the 15-year-old daughter of James and MaryAnn Quay and again they were in Forester M Michigan so they often saw boats coming in and out of town Minnie of course any 15-year-old girl falls in love with a sailor all I can think of is like being on vacation and you know you're at the beach and you fall in love with a guy at the beach knowing full well that when Summer's summer camp you know your your summer camp romance you know like John Travolta Newton John you know it's like this grease thing so Minnie fell in love with this sailor and of course her parents disapproved he was probably much older I would imagine um not much is known about him so one day word came to town that the boat he was on sank oh no poor Minnie she must have been heartbroken oh my God she was distraught and her parents had forbidden her to even say goodbye when he left oh no even worse this girl is like torn to bits okay I mean just remember when you were 15 years old and were like Love Struck probably but you know this whole oh older man oh yeah but probably she felt that she really felt that she did so sometime after she was babysitting her infant brother for her parents left the house walked down to the Waterfront you know she waved to people at one of the nearby hotels as she walked by she literally like walked to the cliff and to Lake Kiron and just plunged into the water no with the baby or did she leave her brother home no she left she left the baby at home she left the baby at home um and went to the Waterfront alone but like I said very happily and cheerily waved to the people outside of the Inn as she walked by and she literally walked off the cliff into Lake hiron Legend says that she still walks the beach waiting for her sailor to return and there's also legends that she lures young girls towards the water and towards their death oh almost like some of the folklore kind of makes it out like she's trying to get girlfriends for other lost Sailors kind of thing hey let me go get my friends yeah a lot of these tragic lost loves very often such as the folklore of La Yona where the the woman who was scorned by her husband and drowned her children and then immediately felt sorrow for it a lot of these women something H like they'll take their own lives but then afterwards they turn into this almost fearful like trickster Spirit like this type of spirit that then tries to draw other people to their deaths similar to Lerona so you know very often it goes from being a tragic story to being a very scary story there have been sightings of uh folks saying that they've seen her walking up and down the beach again we're going to take it back to your lady in white she's always wearing a white dress um I think it's like if you are like some heart strick female you are destined to spend eternity in a white dress I don't know but I got I got one more for you and this is a a romantic murder plot oh okay so this is actually taken it to to Albany New York capital of New York State Jesse strange deserted his wife and children and began a new life in Albany New York changed his name to Joseph Orton and but that's better than Jesse strange I and he be began working for the van renier residence in Cherry Hill he caught the eye of an affluent girl who was married uh oh but him and her decided their love could flourish without her husband around oh of course you know and that that doesn't mean run away they don't mean by running away right tell me they mean running away absolutely not because this is an 1827 oh no well running away would have been easy then they could have even run away changed their names and told everyone they were married and people would believe them or you could try arsenic poisoning oh well yeah sure probably easier Jesse had a failed attempt of poisoning Elsie's husband John Whipple she he tried to basically kill him via arsenic poisoning and failed and didn't do a good enough job like dude really did they then decide to run away I know right nope they tried to hi their murder plot of course then then Jessie shot John Whipple oh well that's faster than arsenic poisoning they didn't cover their tracks well uh oh so they ended up having to go to trial they ended up getting convicted of this so Jesse strange was found guilty of first-degree murder but even though Elsie Whipple had like I mean they knew that they were in cahoots together but basically they couldn't they didn't find her guilty as an accomplice so they had kind of proof that he did it but they couldn't really prove she was the accomplice I don't know if it was that they couldn't prove it but they just didn't pursue it they acquitted her okay yeah I think they they kind of she let out some information she knew stuff about people you know in 1827 what they call those te- circles or something sure where all the women of all the affluent men would get around and talk about each other's husbands go she had all the dirt on people she knew all the tea because she was of a higher class she knew things about the judges of the trial and like the prosecution she knew stuff about them and their wives so like they kind of backed off of her trial so that they didn't screw themselves right they were afraid of what she would say if she was like put on trial right so so Jesse basically took all of the blame even though she was essentially a 5050 accomplice I gotcha well that's kind of sneaky so even according to the Albany tourist site all the members of The Love Triangle so John Whipple Elie Whipple and Jesse strange all roam the halls of Cherry Hill oh no can you imagine having to spend eternity with your like Unfaithful spouse and their lover that would suck like in court it's basically like y got stuck in court it's like the dead husband's Spirit came to court for the trial and then all three of them just got stuck in court for eternity ah people have actually witnessed a ghost on the bottom floor of Cherry Hill and believe that it's Mr Whipple they say that he's not hostile but gives off a feeling of anger they think that Jesse Strange's ghost is seen where the Gallows once stood wearing the same clothes he wore on the day of his execution because basically they ended up executing them they hung them oh wow so she gets off scott free she gets away Scott free and then she's got a dead husband and a dead lover how'd that work out for you seriously well she probably got to keep the money she didn't have to go to jail and she doesn't have a boyfriend around bugging her you know hey I killed your husband you should let me have some cash so I think she made out pretty good actually but you know unfortunately she's kind of stuck there with the guy she left left for the guy that's there too like what a bad eternity yeah she's stuck with the guy she cheated on the guy she convinced to kill him and then let him take the full blame damn yeah none of them are having a pleasant afterlife from the sounds of it no no I just feel bad for the husband here I mean everybody else kind of sucks in this story so Cherry Hill and Albany has this great thing going on Lucky them so unfortunately it seems like all of the ghosts that I have found that are related to lovey doy Valentine's Day stuff are like [ __ ] shows of relationships like literal [ __ ] shows so you know I did it's funny because when I was looking into kind of this like what what could I find related to love and Valentine's Day and our theme the one that kept popping up was a story I did I don't even remember what episode I could look up Emily's Bridge Emily's Bridge how'd you know because that one also popped up for me anytime I was doing research on ladies in white and tragic love stories yeah because Emily's bridge in a previous episode shell talked about it is a very sad lady in white tragic love story so if you go back to episode 31 you can hear all about Emily and her bridge on Emily's bridge and you can hear about her being her lady and white dragging her dead feet on the roof of cars no fun but lady in white stories are pervasive all over the world they've been happening for hundreds of years and some people think that the whole idea of the white of it be comes because they were originally thought of as um spirits of a place or or elf Spirits uh sometimes they were thought of as being healers and they were seen in like a a a bright white light and so some people think maybe that's origin of some of these ladies in white they're very often in many cultures like in Mexico with LA yarona in Japan they vengeful spirits but they're usually women who suffered some sort of tragic love story either they died right after they got married or died in childbirth or they were cheated on or they were the one cheating and then they were murdered but there was some sort of tragic love story occasionally involving children sometimes not and they did something ntic they killed their lover they killed themselves they killed their children and so now they're seen around the the place where they committed this crime or this tragedy happened usually dressed in a white ball gown or a night gown or a wedding gown depending on what their particular story is and so it's this idea of innocence and tragedy and fearsomeness you know a woman who would kill her children that's terrible or kill her lover that's awful but usually there's some equally awful backstory that can almost give you a reason why but they're very very tragic figures I do want to tell you something cute before I wrap up my portion here so you know Harry Houdini yes okay famous magician from the past used to debunk uh Spirits uh spiritualists correct and actually he has been to Salem they have a Houdini alley here from when he was imprisoned here briefly anywh who so Harry Houdini and his wife bus they kind of fall into like this romantic ghost thing and I love this this little tidbit before Harry died the two of them agreed I don't know if you know this the two of them agreed on a secret phrase that they would transmit to one another after one of them died like through a medium thus providing Spirit contact between the loved ones so they would know so he's trying to debunk spiritualism on one hand and on the other hand he has a secret code phrase with little old best so how they can chitchat and know it's each other once one of them is dead well that makes sense if he thought that most spiritualists were fake then if he had a code phrase any spiritualist that said I have contact with Harry Houdini would have to know this code phrase right or best would be like you're bullshitting get the [ __ ] out ver or vice versa if she died he would you know VI VI Versa they they would transmit this code word so yeah I recommend try it with all your friends have a code word code word yeah that I that that's kind of one of the cuter things I don't know if they ever tried the theory and if it worked if the code word was spoken like I don't know that part but I just thought it was a cute little they love each other yeah I think that is cute and that they're hoping to speak to each other from Beyond I love that reminds me of that grandmother that made the little Ouija board cards to give out at her funeral so that people could stay in touch that's adorable keep in touch I love that yeah it's very sweet my grandmother before she passed told everyone that she was going to make a salt shaker implode and I haven't seen it yet so Grandma I'm still waiting yeah she said she was going to make a salt shaker implode and that would be our proof that she was still around and I haven't seen it yet as far as I know no one in my family has yet either but we're all waiting I want to be around for that one if it happens I will let you know so those are my little tidbit romantic ghost killer cheating bastard stories yeah there's a lot of cheating in our Valentine's ghost stories today cheating and murdering mine doesn't involve so much cheating and murdering but it does also involve ladies in white because if you start looking for romantic ghost stories or a ghost love stories you're going to come up with Lady and white stories from all over the country you know including ones we've talked about I did see the ghost of Emily's Bridge because she is a tragic lady in white ghost but the one that I I decided to talk about was a cemetery that was visited by Ed and Lorraine Warren because of a lady in white sighting and the lady in white here is another famous lady in white they often get a lot of local attention and a lot of local Legends built up around these women like the ghost of Devil's elbow in a Wego New York there's a lot of local Legend around them so this particular cemetery is Union Cemetery which opened up in the 1700s and it's roughly 7 Acres and it's in Connecticut it sits at the intersection of Stepney sport Hill and Westport roads at a Crossroads great we're Crossroads we're already looking good here folks now I've seen a video that Ed Warren actually took here and captured a ghost this is one what he called one of his most compelling pieces of of evidence but one of the things I've seen in all the videos of this places is it's quite noisy it is at a Crossroads and so although the cetan noisy like real road noise like road noise you hear a lot of road noise legitimate real noise yeah but the cemetery itself is oddly peaceful despite all the road noise around it it still has that very peaceful Cemetery kind of air which is even more frightening to be honest with you right so now the ghost sightings here go back as far as the 1940s and it's listed as one of the most haunted places in the entire country now it's set off by stone walls and rod iron fencing like your typical scary Cemetery they all are the most haunted in the country it's like famous roast beef here in Massachusetts they're all world famous world's best cup of coffee on every corner yes this is the most famous most haunted cemetery shell wait are there gates to hell here are there gates to hell here no a damn it you know they keep saying I keep coming up with these places that are the most haunted something not one of them lately has had a gates to hell so I think that they're slipping as far as the bar to the most haunted if you don't have a gates to hell you can't even put most haunted can you even say that you're the most haunted I mean this place doesn't even have a crypted in a pond I mean come on oh Jesus come on folks it's closed from Dust Till Dawn and apparently so many people go here that the police are serious about it being closed at night that does not stop ghost hunters from going here however like even like even to this day even to this day people go there oh yeah a lot of the videos I saw are very very recent you will get orb sightings you will see a demon with red eyes and of course the infamous lady in white let me tell you a couple stories about got if You' got a de if you've got a demon we can almost call that a crypted okay that's true we do have a red-eyed demon and Ed Warren did say that there was demonic activity here okay so although the ghost stories start back in the 40s with this lady in white and she's been uh seen quite often they didn't get very serious until the early 1990s it was about actually 1990 and a gentleman named Rod vessie who was about 25 years old at the time he lived in Easton and often drove past the cemetery as he was going to and from work he worked at the Home Depot not too far away and so the cemetery was along his route very common for him to drive by it he worked the late shift and was often done at midnight and so it was almost 1 o'clock by the time he was driving by the cemetery after his shift pushing the witching hour pushing the witch an hour so he says further up the road he saw what looked to be a woman standing in the middle of the road so he he tapped on the brakes and he says as he tapped on the brakes he felt someone touch his right arm from the passenger seat oh Lord and he looked to his side and he sees an older gentleman like in his 60s with a a short grizzled like five o00 Shadow beard and a crumpled hat wearing what looked like an oldtime maybe 1940s is kind of suit well when you start this ride alone and you haven't stopped and let anybody in that's the first sign to [ __ ] yourself yeah so he did a double take and by the time he did that the man was gone but the woman woman was directly in front of him so he slammed on his brakes and stopped the car he says the lady in white standing in the middle of the road held her hand up as if to say stop and he's not moving she's not moving and yet somehow her hand gets bigger and bigger like she's moving closer to him and then moves through his car through him and disappears and he says as she moved through him he felt like not just a temperature change but an immense feeling of sadness just rolled over him now I've heard some accounts of rod from people who knew him and they all said he was a very straight laced standup Cold Sober not the type to see ghost kind of guy like the kind of guy that if he's telling you this story you know damn well that [ __ ] happened exactly now after this woman moved through him and was gone he said he started driving again but the road just on his side of Road was deep red as if it was smeared with blood I would be freaking out he was and he said he just felt this immense sadness and he got home ran up the stairs and just threw himself in his wife's lap and just sobbed his eyes out he just could not shake this feeling of Sorrow that had come over him that's shitty yeah he was so scared he called up at Lorraine warrren who lived nearby and told them what he had experienced so of course they're like be right over and they were Ed has often said that he was quite surprised that one of the most haunted places that he'd ever been to was right in his own backyard and he hadn't even known he ended up setting up cameras and equipment in the cemetery for about seven days and at the end of one of those days he caught video you can find it online of what he called his most compelling evidence of a ghost now he says he heard some noises and then looked through the viewfinder of the camera and saw these orbs kind of coales into a woman's form and when he tried to walk closer to her she disappeared and he says knowing that ghosts often do that he kind of backed away far enough that she reappeared again so he just kind of stayed back away from his camera and everything and just watched and what you can see is what looks very clearly like a woman's form in a glowing white dress and veil with dark hair walk he's rows uh Cemetery rows away from her but you can see her form walking down the cemetery row and as it goes behind the the tall gravestones it disappears only to reappear again as it moves through just like a person would as if they were walking down the rose no [ __ ] I got to check that video out there's so many hauntings and so many entities in this Cemetery that Aden L rain found that they wrote a book about it called graveyard true hauntings from an old New England Cemetery now where is this what what what town did you say this was in Connecticut Easton okay so there are several legends that would fit the Lady in White story there's two young women in particular that people think could be the lady in white or might both be ladies in white at this Cemetery one woman is named Harriet B cely she died in 18 1853 she was born October 19th 1815 and she married a gentleman named Titus Brian on February 10th 1836 9 days later she was dead it doesn't say how she died just that she was returned home to her family and was buried in the Union Cemetery oh [ __ ] after nine days after nine days she was married February 10th she died February 19th he killed her now she died at her husband's home in Washington Connecticut nothing is said as to why she died but it could have been some type of illness I mean she did have to travel to get to his home maybe she caught a cold or something maybe she had some type of infection I don't know however there's also another woman named Harriet cely uh this woman married a gentleman named Ezra Sherwood Seely in 1850 when she was 24 and 3 years later on May 20th she gave birth to a baby boy and he died the same day a she died on May 28th 8 days later and some people say that it's her ghost that wanders the cemetery looking for her baby boy a because they think that sometimes when children were still born they were very often uh either taken away and buried in a mass Grave by the Midwife or sometimes they were just wrapped in a cloth and put in a casket of someone else who had died recently so they say that his grave isn't known and so her ghost is roaming around trying to find where her son was buried but both of them could fit the Lady in White hisory because the first one was only married for 9 days when she died unexpectedly and mysteriously and then the second woman died shortly after her son passed away so both of them kind of fit that lady in white Legend now the people that see the lady in white at this Cemetery all describe a drop in temperature and a feeling of sadness now a few years later in 1993 there's another encounter with the lady in white that's even more amazing so this gentleman who was a firefighter gotten a call about an electrical explosion in a nearby town called Monroe that which is right near this Cemetery he drove to the site and was told to help divert traffic away so he had a police officer in the seat of his truck as they went to go find a spot to safely divert traffic away from this electrical accident and there was another car behind him now he says that they were right behind the cemetery when the officer yelled out look out stop and he said he looked in the road and he saw saw a woman standing in the center of the road and she had flowing brown hair and was wearing what looked to him to be like a a fancy white night gown he said she looked surprised and he slammed on the brakes but he was too late and he hit her he said when he hit her it was like running straight into a brick wall he said he slammed forward it felt like the back end of his truck came up and when he was able to come to a stop he didn't see anyone in the road he and the officer immediately jumped out of the truck as well as the woman in the car behind him jumped out and said oh my gosh you hit her and so they all start looking for this woman and there's no one to be found oh [ __ ] but yet it felt like they hit a brick wall oh no [ __ ] yeah and even the woman in the car behind him said when she saw him oh my God you hit her but no one could find any trace of this woman anywhere she was completely gone no blood no clothing no trace of the woman anywhere the officer that was also a witness said he clearly saw the woman and then she was just gone there was nowhere for her to have run off he would have seen it but she was nowhere to be found wow so edin Lorraine Warren also felt that there was demonic activity another entity that's seen at the cemetery is usually only described as a pair of red glowing eyes and people will say that the temperature around them will actually go up and they'll feel what seems to be like a hot breath on the back of their neck and then they'll see red glowing eyes in the trees or in the bushes around them and it just feels eerie and scary sounds like a crypted demon to me could be a crypted Ed Warren who was a demonologist did say that it was a demon and he felt that it was related to a murder that had taken place across the street from the cemetery now local lore has it that a man named earol Kellogg was cheating on his wife and was caught and was lured to the cemetery where he was doused in gasoline and set on fire in retaliation for having cheated oh [ __ ] he died there obviously and so Ed Warren felt that it was either Earl Kellogg that caused this demonic activity or that Earl was the demon himself but very often people will say that they see this demon or these red eyes in the cemetery and it's another common sighting some people even say that when they see the lady in white they'll see what looks to be like small black doglike figures with red eyes jumping up from the ground at her almost as if they're trying to stop her or like pull her into the ground oh [ __ ] like pull her into the underworld man now of course this place is Rife with orbs everywhere you go you can get your fave my fave but just in the cemetery proper itself pictures taken outside the cemetery don't have the orbs there's also quite a few EVPs that you can find online that are creepy as [ __ ] oh one of them is a woman who goes there specifically looking for ghostly EVPs and she didn't get any or so she thought when she listened to it later and enhanced the audio she says all you can hear is a woman screaming the entire time she's there oh [ __ ] other people that go in will hear they say it's almost like a party remember you said there's a cemetery in Salem Massachusetts where you feel people are like hey how you doing it's a party yeah people who go to specifically get EVPs have described this Cemetery very similarly the spirits here want to talk and people's EVP recordings will be peppered with hi there hey come on over what you doing oh and other comments of that nature almost as if people are greeting you as if you're at a party they want to hang out they want people to notice them it's a very active area one of the more intriguing EVPs that I found was U made by a group of teenagers who were just kind of [ __ ] around but they actually got the spirit to say his name and he was quite swear even worse than we are but all the EVPs were just peppered with swear words he was a pissed-off upset ghost and it turns out when they researched his name he was someone who had been killed by a drunk driver right near the cemetery oh and obviously he was not angry he was angry he was very angry about all of it there's two legends of women who were killed there by jealous lovers one that a woman in in the 1940s her husband suspected that she was having an affair although she wasn't and he murdered her and buried her in a shallow grave at the cemetery dick exactly another local Legend and I I don't know if this one's true or not much like the Earl Kellogg Legend I I could find a lot of references to it but I couldn't find a lot of factual information another such story is about a young woman in the early 1900s that was having an affair with a minister of the Baptist Church church that's right there and in order to cover it up he killed her and then dumped her body in a sink hole that's behind the church uh adjacent to the cemetery holy [ __ ] so because of all this activity all these ghosts are still there and kind of there's so many possible young women here that could be the cause of that lady in white you know maybe they're all part of it I don't know but highly haunted Ed Lorraine Warren thought it was so haunted they needed to write a book about it and felt that that video of the lady in white was one of their most compelling pieces of ghostly evidence it's a pretty creepy place I do want to say that you know say what you will about Eden Lorraine some people think that they're a crack of [ __ ] some people swear by him I go 5050 I think some of their experiences were true and real and I think some of their experiences were some [ __ ] they made up to make some dough this sounds like it is one of their legitimate experiences and it almost makes me want to get that book and read it I know I'm so curious as to what else could be out there and I'm with you on Ed larine Warren I know we've talked about doing an episode in the future on them and I really think we should because they're fascinating characters for sure they absolutely are and and and I just think that this is definitely one of their legitimate cases that I actually want to find out more about like I said I'd be very interested in reading the book they specifically wrote about this graveyard me too and as you know I just love the lore and the history around ladies in white they're so fascinating and you love orbs don't lie and orbs I do too but just the the idea of all of these tragic love stories tragic children stories attached to women in white is just the lore and Legend around it is fascinating so hopefully you all out there had a much better Valentine's Day than any of our Lady in White did and also to get one more Lady in White story again check out our episode 31 Emily's Bridge because she was definitely a famous lady in white you can find the story of Devil's elbow um the lady in white from a Wego New York in episode 14 there's also episode one The Exorcist and a hitchhiking ghost
