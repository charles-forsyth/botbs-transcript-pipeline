Come with a box or a book but it came with a handmade bag and I absolutely love it and I also got the Celtic Tree Oracle that was a good fine she got all the things that I already looked at  I went through those tarot decks I've had free rein but the books the books I was able to get anything I wanted you did find me a great book there at the The Witches Bible complete by Janet and Stuart Broad Ripple to buy some used things was really nice but I think we're glossing over the most synchronistic thing that we saw sitting right on Joe's table when we moved like mind-blowing so and it will get into the deities to invoke for this ritual had this all planned out and we kind of thought we could be chosen a less common goddess I guess it's the best way to say it so we walk in to Joe and his table of wonderful goods and what the hell do we see the statue  who would have thought  now before we went shell had managed to get a statue of each of the deities that we were going to be invoking for the spiritual so you already had another one of the ways I snatched her up so fast and then I would be remiss if I did not mention this so Layla gets this Ellen statue does happen we immediately go up to our room to put it safe and sound on the altar that we'd set up the table in our room I reach over to make my tea and my sleeve knocked over Ellen two pieces pieces thankfully it was a very small piece literally just her sleeve knocked off and you couldn't even tell and less you knew that they had come off that there was a problem include right back on new I know but I felt like  you were very sweet about it but no our little Alan so we actually put a picture of the two islands in candles as we were getting ready to set up our ritual on on the social media to check it out back on the broomstick on Instagram and Facebook. Start off with day one day one I'm going to say is are driving so tell the people how we left what was the weather like when we left a literal snowstorm literal snowstorm I was a little concerned that the snow wasn't going to stop before we left but thankfully it did it we're going to fast forward like five days the day we left Maryland it was a weird day before the conference started a temporary room we did we did this is a Story 2  and then it's time for the opening ritual there's like 18 different rooms that they do activities and workshops in this one particular room which will be important is our story goes this room will be important later on and that was a good ritual the opening ritual one of the things that Sacred Space does is the board of Sacred Space goes in ahead of time and kind of sets Wars and sets space and call what they call the egregore of Sacred Space so the entity that they have kind of created over doing this for so many years and so at the opening ceremony they call upon the spirits of Sacred Space and they also call upon the idea of hospitality they call upon the rules of hospitality and they basically Encompass the entire Hotel the whole place in Sacred Space which you know I love them  because they create the second one Ballroom so there was a lot of people a lot of energy the minute that ritual was done it was like it was a thing that did carry on and you could feel throughout the weekend even if you weren't doing the ritual or even if you weren't in a workshop if you were just sitting in the lobby station on a muffin and tea you could feel that energy and it made Community very easy it was easy to talk to people even for someone like me who is very shy and anti-social it was very easy you could feel the camaraderie and the energy between people with really nice but I love that you mentioned the opening ceremony because that ritual was held in the same room now the big big Ballroom was split  the three separate room three very large separate rooms and we had requested one of those for our ritual because we're making a large spiral like a Fibonacci ask spiral out of candles and we needed the space interesting Lee the room that we were chosen to do that ritual in also happened to be the room where the opening ceremony was done and our ritual would be done just a few hours later after the dinner break and so the energy was very much present and still there when we went in to set up and at that was very cool no let's talk about this so next on our agenda for the week is Sacred Space was our ritual after the dinner break so there was the opening ceremony there was one Workshop well there was several workshops in a time once upon a time slot  we've done this a thousand times and it's nerve-wracking each and every time and we had just left our temporary room and we had to wait until 4 which was a few hours before our ritual started at 7:30 to check into our new room and of course they were very busy because it was a very large conference I mean everybody there was so nice everybody that works there is amazing but they at the front desk people were great and they were very helpful we went back to them several times cuz they kept telling us to come back but we were nice they were nice and like she'll said they didn't have our room ready on time and they gave us an upgrade to like the top floor  and it had is all somehow she was so cute I can't remember her name but she was so sweet she's like well your room's not ready but I found one that is and we're just going to give you a little bit of an upgrade girl she hooked us up so good I wish I knew her gift card only entry Club room that had 24/7 snacks drinks whatever you wanted and free breakfast I mean how I felt the whole weekend what we kind of where we were so we had an amazing room and man we met so many people I met dinner break I think we talked to like four or five different people before you even ask but you know I think we didn't realize it at the time but the significance of us being in that room was just Cosmic it was just one  it was one coincidence synchronicity wonderful thing that happened after another and our ritual being in the same room as the opening ritual it had so many layers and as we go through this episode we're going to talk about all the other rituals that happened in that room that seem to each a Coweta other and they kept calling back to each other we said some of the same phrase that weren't typical phrases used here we invoke some of the same energies it was very very interesting the synchronicities that kept popping up and the layer upon layer of magic in that room but first we'll talk about our ritual we really had a good time putting us together and I think that the hardest part in retrospect I don't think people understand what it's like to have to turn on and lay down like 250 camp  still sore from turning candles on if you do get to see the picture of the two Allen of the ways of statues that we have on social media you'll see that they're surrounded by cups filled with electronic candles candles on and then we laid them out and if you've never seen 249 candles laid out a sweet out in the spiral check out her social media is kind of pretty so yeah that was the hardest part we set up to beautiful Alters actually shell did that I made a few finishing touches but other than that it was all you gorgeous. They have are Ellen of the ways we had Care New knows which are two deities that we both love working with and it was really really nice even though one of the Ellen Show with broken she didn't mind I don't mind it's all right she fixed up good so what we did was we had people come in and we talked about the fool and the fools past being  I have a spiral like the Fibonacci spiral that connects everything the golden ratio and we got into a little math nerd is going to show you how about that the fool is with us on this journey on our path that we are the fool and that this path isn't just a straight line it's more of a spiral or occurred and it connects all of us and that you can be at multiple different places on this path at once you can be anywhere on this path and that you should always reconnect with that part of yourself that isn't afraid to take chances to take leaves whether you're at the beginning of the end and in addition to that we were going to be walking the spiral of candles to emphasize walking with the fool in the spiral of life and we decided to call to deities that were also path Walker sometimes you worry about time in these things  under the bus right here now so I know what that we had some listeners there shotshell out in a minute so I realized this unless you happen to see the look I gave Layla at that particular moment we got into a point where we talked about the whole point of what we are doing and then we decide to it to circle the whole kit and caboodle beforehand like I have this  detailed sing written out like she knew how long it was we had a back-and-forth call you would call Ellen I just went out okay when last we left our Intrepid witches we were on the precipice was a fool waiting to see how much you cut me off all right yes I did I cut off I cut off our DD call so it's so talk to me a little bit about it the deities and and your DD call and then go ahead and tell the people that I totally messed you up and I'll I'll say well it wasn't that you're totally messed me up other than I really felt that the best things I was going to say was at the very end but it wasn't that you messed me up it just in this is where you when I Vibe very well like it caught me off-guard like it's almost like if you trip over something but you don't follow you like tripping catch yourself and then keep going like I caught myself  I was like what the hell is she doing I'm not done yet it's a good point and afterwards we talked about that and I was super impressed with our our energy together in circle was like right there even though we haven't really done major rituals together and how many years what you're saying is we communicate without communicating  for the Richmond we have decided to call Karen Olson Ellen of the ways as we said because their path Walker's there in that liminal space and and we were going to kind of be in that time out of time and space out of space for this particular working we wanted those types of DNA's so shall was calling elen of the ways and I was calling care nuno's and we have these beautiful calls right now and we have been seriously working on them right up to the day before and had a back-and-forth kind of call going it was really really great and it wasn't what happened it was but you know you just you just you just like I said it's like tripping and you just kind of catch yourself we started out the workshop describing what we were doing and then we can circle with a heart-to-heart circle cast that we used to do in our old Community which by the way I was a little more than we had expected so the circle cast take a little longer than I expected it's very nice to take the hand of the person to your left and you hold it to your heart and you say from my heart and then you put your hands  over their heart and say to your heart we cast a circle and then you do that around the entire circle is a very beautiful way to connect everyone in the castle but it does take a little bit of time then after that she invoked energies into we didn't exactly call quarters but she'll did a beautiful little car where she invoked the energy so I didn't want to be like in but it's in my circle we got to call everything yeah I didn't want to call quarters but I did want to make sure that it was included definitely we couldn't call a circle without having the elements they're just not in a wicked way the Guardians of the West back and forth invocations on a Shelf  Alan and myself calling caring and we got about half way and I did and I did and the reason why is because I could feel the energy these are kind of long and yeah but they were a little long and we hadn't again anticipated quite so many people so we didn't think that those Circle casting would take so long I just felt like people had been standing around I could feel the energy in a circle shift and I didn't want to lose our participants I wanted to kind of keep the energy slowly building until we moved into the candlelit Fibonacci spiral walk and then the meditation I didn't want to lose people and I could feel it slipping and so rather than keep going with you admittedly very gorgeous Vianney invocation I kind of gave shell the silent City immediately picked up on and we both without saying A word without any type of outward sign immediately moved on to the next part to get  and that even though we didn't get to say bakul calls that was beautiful that was beautiful magic but actually the next part was my most favorite part so you had made these beautiful beautiful cards which Bravo by the way an overlay so they all look the same of you know the number zero and the floor jacks with the four and you know what is my most favorite thing doing these things having anyway so you gave everyone a card and then I left the whole group in a walk around this Fibonacci spiral of beautiful candles lit in this gorgeous Ballroom it was beautiful as absolute  will definitely put up more pictures of that for sure we did this beautiful spiral walk shell him on this amazing shirt and I'll put a link to the chant and we were placed a word lady with fool so full of the labyrinth we chanted as we went around it was really cool I think that is where we were able to pick back the energy up and kind of get it back into a flow and there was something about walking there a spiral maybe it was because I was first having everyone behind me chanting that I don't know what that was all about it it was free with beautiful sofa Fibonacci spiral at into a Center Circle we had everyone sit down in the circle and we did it a really cool meditation to meet the Fool on the spiral because we talked about life not being a straight path it's not linear And The Fool is not just the beginning it's also the end so there's a cycle there so we went through the spiral Matt the fool learn some lessons and then came  stopping and retrace our steps what is a very cool ritual but my next favorite part was right before we retreated back through the spiral we gave participants the option to either keep their full card you know stay on their current path or exchange it for an Infiniti card which were actually the same Prints but instead of the zero they had the Infinity on them and I feel like it was almost split between people who kept their card and people who picked up a Infiniti card in exchange kept their card was slightly more than 50% I think there was really close guess of the Infiniti card was very popular and then at the end some people did, and request extras to take home with them which again take away their cool when we had to have one and it was wonderful but the coolest part of this ritual was how it echoed and reverberated throughout the entire week  synchronicities would like how many times did we look at each other in a one or two a day throughout the entire several days and it seems like from the opening ritual than ours was second to hack at a ritual that night the themes of being on the spiral walking belt on each other the idea of be here now everyone kept saying some of these same phrases transformation liminal spaces cat would expect to hear some of those types of an idea as you don't disturb this was definitely not coincidence it was beautiful to see the magic layering like that just day after day and of course you know being followed  almost immediately by Lera Tempest is a cross doing the crossroads Christopher Christopher and Mara again in the exact same place we had ulcers in the same places and and it was just you know I didn't realize but because I am who I am I felt the irony of one you know so so they opening ritual they had they had their thing that they did but then our ritual the second actual I invoked Ellen of the ways and then the rich will immediately following the info Tecate on what's going on here  so much good stuff but yeah this Sacred Space definitely opened those doors we were definitely standing at the crossroads and learning there and learning so much in that in the beginning they create a Sacred Space for Sacred Space and truly they meet that goal and then you can feel it as you walk around and the interesting thing for me is I loved all the workshops this year and again I had trouble picking which ones to go to in the same spot but last year I felt like it was all happiness and joy and light and I love meeting people and this year there was a ton of that but it also felt very I had a lot of work to do it was very it was very good but I felt myself and I'm still doing it I'm still there's a lot of Shadow work at seem to uncover a lot of deep things I've needed to like journal and work  and that's been pretty amazing but talked to she was a little different you know if I had if I had to put it in my shell way I'd say last year they were fun shops in this year they were literally workshops so heavy original was kind of putting people's feet on the path and say it really did you know we kind of put them there like it's going to be okay if you're back in the dog you're going to be all right in two hours ago and she's going to kick your ass so grab that pack I thought you were okay when I'm a cauldron of transformation that's what I call my coffee in the morning  so yes the Workshops the people and oh my gosh the people I cannot even count how many listeners that we met our star and Val and Holly and live oh my gosh so many people you know so Cassie Cassie I love you but for some strange reason I just want to call you a cat and I wanted to call you cat the whole Sacred Space and I still want to call you a cab but I understand it's Kathy but I'm just going to call you and don't forget Amy and Amy Amy and Amy we met them last year and oh my God so you know week we connected with some of our old Workshop friends some of our old presenter friends and then we connected with new presenter friends it was definitely a time for you know what felt very much like a intentional Community Building almost like there's a lot of work to do and none of us can do it alone so here we are  like a community-building 100% yes I absolutely felt that too I felt like we either we need each other especially now we definitely need to be here together we all need to be a part of the collective yeah that's kind of the whole thing pulled together for me is kind of like it takes a Village People funny that you say that because that's one of the biggest takeaways that I came with it I'm going to this very small uu church that's not too far from me that has a a little cake and commuting I'm going to try and work with them you know when I get home you know bring a smaller and spread that I want to spread the information that we learned to the people in my community so I'm very much looking forward to starting like a once-a-month roof at this little uu church but I think a lot of people felt that that building that Community taking the energy that we all kind of bills up there and spread that out into our local communities when we all go home and kind of bring that energy back with us because we  really need that now let's just quick touch on the variety of things that we we were able to experience Workshop wise what's your favorite I was going to make you pick a favorite child oh gosh I will I really like the last one we went to was Christians and that was the Alpine witchery and we are going to have Christian on our show but I loved his because the history was fascinating yeah I don't want to give anything away right now but you are going to want to catch the episode of Christian because it was eye-opening to me some of the things that that he has to chat about I adore folk Magic from all over and I like seeing the similarities and the differences and so if that was cool I also like Ness Bosch you know me and bonez & Ness is a bone floods in Magic which very very cool.  Talkington us as well so we got to talk about ink magic tattoo magic and she's got a great book so that was nice I really honestly surprisingly I had a lot of fun okay not surprisingly I love Matt are and he's amazing absolutely phenomenal psychic tarot dude you know I was taking a bath in that was a great Workshop in that was top two or three yeah I was definitely in the top his workshop on the second part of Tara was really really good yeah I got to take a shop but let's talk about my fan-girl moment when I saw Christopher Hughes for the first time okay well yeah that the cerridwen ritual was definitely right up in the top it was amazingly well done he did an awesome job and keeping an entire room of 200 people hundred  after the energy going and you could feel the energy moving around when he was working the energy working the circle and honestly I had a funny moment because we're not going to talk about the time I forgot how to stay my freaking name that was funny but in a past episode we were talking about alter tools and ritual tools I talked about a boat which is at a sickle looking guy that's like a crescent moon looking knife and I mention it only ever seen one and use once until now had a very gorgeous very large believe that he used as an athame in the ritual and that was very very cool and not just because it was him it was phenomenal absolutely and Laura Tempest eckroth did the Lord that was fabulous that was  you know if you can get again almost 200 people to sit silent at the end of this gorgeous ritual where she embodied Hecate and the crossroads in the room and allowed people to come to her and circle and receive a blessing from Picante that we took what like half an hour 20 minutes half an hour the rest of us sat and held space silently for half an hour silently in this room in this account a ritual we just sat there and held that energy and it was freaking cool it was yeah yeah it's amazing but yeah sorry what was your favorite I actually would have to say that Christians with my favorite I'm so glad you said that you know he he's just I think what he has to talk about it like I said I don't want to give too much away cuz we are going to interview them soon but just very interesting very interesting history very interesting information  and you know I didn't necessarily know that Austria had its own folklore Traditions so I opening my really I really don't decide as always I absolutely fabulous amazing don't tell them anything know I was going to say I would have to say that her workshops are always my top favorite workshops speak for yourself she leaves The Sisterhood Of Avalon which I totally dig so she never puts on a bad Workshop very information packed you know she's just a good presenter I just I like what she presents every time I see her after one of her workshops that we went to we've been talking to her also about coming on the show so we went up to say hello and  I thought you were going to tell him I'm going to tell him I have to explain why I can't ever talk to her again she will never ever be on the show is because I then proceeded to hug this woman now Jenna and I are close to the same fight that I've got nothing if you can believe that gorgeous woman holy cow and she has the most beautiful head of black curly hair I hug her and put my arm around her and I'm wearing this very cool beaded a spiral bracelet it's wire and it has a hook on the end and that freaking hook caught in her hair so badly in the first few seconds it was like that bracelet fell in love with her hair and never wanted to come out again I almost started crying Isaac Michelle please come help me but I had the pleasure of digging your bracelet out of Jenna's hair cuz you hugged her that was pretty Tangled and took me a few minutes I never wanted to let her go  so as much as you were mortified by getting tangled in her hair I appreciate the fact that you gave me the opportunity to touch her hair so we can never talk to her again we will never ever I just can't do it okay that's not true we did see her several times after that and she thinks that was not our only fun and interesting moment with one of the more famous of our fellow pagans that were there and we did get a chance to talk to Christopher Hughes and bring some books to have signed by having you have to bring this up because you are now famous amongst Christopher and his friends and you need to tell why you do first of all the fact that he's going to remember me for this Google you're going to be the American who introduced him to his next book title so the story here folks is Once Upon a Time  I don't know a year ago or so and I decided we were going to get Christopher hughes's book cauldron-born so fabulous so this book arrives at my home and my sweet darling love sees this book and I don't know if it's age or silliness but he thought it was called cauldron-born it's in like an old English font it kind of looks like so then you don't go back and go back to my coven people and I'm like a coven people isn't this hysterical he calls it covered porch so no makeup and like totally calls it cauldron-born so they got the coven call in at cauldron-born we call it cauldron pouring here at home you and I now call it cauldron-born so silly old me decides in My Fit of fangirling and losing my brain where is you forgot your name I forgot all sensibility and I tell her  Super Shoes the story about how we call his book cauldron-born we call it cauldron porn he's loved it. It was hysterical to which I found out the next morning because I actually had to mention it to him again the next morning he ended up texting his friends back in Wales and said that he knew what his new book title is going to be cauldron-born so-called gets published and you are welcome hopefully she'll get some royalties from it because we're running low on tea folks  so yes we definitely kept our entire weekend and oh my gosh just had such a great time and I do want to mention a couple of our listeners are one we did have a birthday girl was there it was very fun she came all the way from California and we got to sing Happy Birthday to her so that was very cool thank you so much for taking such a long trip to come out I also wanted to mention this one young woman who and Matt Ahrens Workshop he handed out cards to everyone shell and I both managed to get nights I got the name of Pentacles and you got the Knight of Swords swords and the fool was right in front of us which I thought was fun but when I turned around to see the young person behind me there's a person with the card behind me if caught my eye and I immediately knew I had to read for them and so I asked if I could and she just happened to be a listener who is a tattoo artist  so I wanted to mention her very quickly give a shout out to re star and I'll put some information some links down to her tattoo shop because she's local to Towson and her tattoos are gorgeous she showed us a picture of one she had just done like a chest piece with a crow skull and wings was very very gorgeous we did it last year we should do it next year may absolutely if you ever get a chance to go either online or in-person to workshop with Maura Starling not only is she hysterical but so freaking knowledgeable she just presents information you're laughing your learning you're having such a good time and at the end of it you feel like she's your best friend and you just want to go hang out you know I think I felt that way with everybody there to be honest whether it was friends or  are are present her friends I mean we just  it was it was just it was a good time everybody have a good time and we were all just kind of happy and chatty and I love that about festivals as it is easier I'm an introvert I am so shy and I we did that was fun. Hopefully this listener will be going to Brushwood folklore Center this year as well so that will be looking for her is coming up pretty quickly and bring about a couple of festivals that we are hoping to prevent that, the entire time we were there is in the morning we would draw schedule for the day and then at night we would draw some cards and kind of get an overview of the Lessons Learned for that day you know I think we were really good in the beginning and then we kind of got a little off-kilter towards the end but I think it was because  it just got deeper and deeper as the week went on it really dead and we kept saying I mean we were up early in the morning going down to work shops and things first thing in the morning and then staying up late late at night you know all the things going on so it was it was difficult but I did like that I did like having the I-10 to do sigils a lot especially when I'm out and doing what she thinks because it helps to keep me focused for the day you know if I do a word or phrase information talk and then around the triangle Weezer the alphabet and then pick the word for the day and then what was it we circled the first letter and then drew a line to the second drew a line to the third and so on and then but what a slash on the last letter and then made a composite of that on a new piece of paper and kind of  so we chose a triangle shape you know that the three sides of the Delta all of that was in with a good symbol and that you separate the alphabet right a third of it on one arm turn on the next in the third on the last write out your word or phrase eliminate any duplicate letters you only want each letter to appear once and then exactly what she'll said you Circle the first letter draw your line to each letter keep going in and the last letter you put a slash through it it makes me little symbol most of the time I think we used to Triangle I did use a circle once and I think I used to square one so you can do any any shape that you want there's all sorts of different ways to do sigils and we'll get we'll get more in-depth than that in another episode what they're really great or festivals if I'm at a conference it really helps to helps me to focus for the day to have like a phrase or assemble it so that I can look at to help keep me on track and I think with the the card pulls at night I think we did anywhere between like 3 and 5 Card polls  yeah and that was nice especially to do data shared by the second night shall had bought several decks choices so we have choices we both brought several decks with us I did get the feed Cheryl signed by Christopher Hughes which made me very happy even though he said that you'll tear off his favorite by Christopher Hughes before anyone else gets it but it was really nice to be able to you know kind of decide what we wanted. Cards and then talk about a little bit I just a different track every time and that was kind of nice being able to do that yeah  we had a little magic going on and as usual we set up an altar in our room we do like to set up our way Alters this time I got to be a little elaborate because we did bring extra since we were setting them up for the restore it was more like an old turntable alright people have their little pocket altars in the Altoid tins and shells bought a tubby exclusively for travel Alters that's true that's true I was more referring to the one on wheels that you purchase specifically to carry things in well yeah next year I am very much looking forward to going to their conference it is going it's called Sacred Space in between the worlds in between the worlds it does there own festival and I guess I think it's every 3 or 5 years they combined so actually  this next year in 2026 new date and time instead of being at the end of March it's going to be at the end of February and it is going to be what they say like an hour away from where is currently been held I believe but if you want to check out Sacred Space conference.org you can get more information and they're already starting early registration we are hoping to be at several other festivals you can check out our website back on a broomstick.com we have a whole list of festivals that are going on son will be at some we won't you can also check out mandragora magic. They have a list of pagan festivals maybe in your state and you know I think that some of our listeners that went to this in this was kind of their first time cuz I know there was one or two that this was their first time doing something like this I think they would agree with us when we say give it a try go at least once because you will learn so much and meet so many great people the amount that you will learn  something like this is overwhelming absolutely Festival weather is in the woods or in a hotel definitely worth it I will thank you so much for listening to this episode of back on the broomstick we will be posting some pictures from a ritual and maybe I can convince Sal to record that beautiful island of the ways call that she didn't put that up along with the medication for you guys coming up in the next couple weeks maybe you'll let me say the whole thing all right thank you again for listening people see you next week on back on the broomstick please give us some likes and review some stars that really helps the show out and it makes L&I cackle like a little witches  and keep it Richie
