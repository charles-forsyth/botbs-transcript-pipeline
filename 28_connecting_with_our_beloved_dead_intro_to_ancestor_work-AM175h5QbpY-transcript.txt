welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to another episode of back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and what are we talking about today Lea well shell today we're going to be talking about working with your ancestors a little bit about how to do it why to do it and why now is a good time of year for it I'm feeling fall in the air shell I'm definitely feeling it it's there I woke up one morning and I was like geez it smells like fall what the heck I think I drove to Ohio and it was summer and drove back and it was fall in Upstate New York that's funny because I drove from uh Salem to Upstate New York and I was like gez it's awful fall like here in upstate I come back to Massachusetts and I'm like that followed me it did it happened seemingly overnight but this is the time of year the Autumn Equinox is right around the corner sin is breathing down our necks The Witch's New Year the final Harvest The Nostalgia is brewing oh my gosh this is one of first Halloween Seasons first fall Seasons that I've been in back in Upstate New York and I am loving the crispness of the air the leaves that are already starting to change you and no one else by the way yeah nobody else likes fall it's just me but it is kind of the time of year where you you kind of look back on those that have gone before yep the veil is thinning you naturally feel a connection to the Turning of the wheel to the people that have gone beyond on and I don't know about you but my family just got some craziness about passing on anywhere between September first and December 31st like it's just just like this weird vibe they've got going on and they need to just stop oh your family passes away this time of year yes oh wow so I think that's why I do a lot of ancestral work and a lot of ancestral remembrance and and things of that nature around this time of year because one of the most significant deaths I've had in my family in my whole lifetime was uh in the middle of September then it just kind of snowballed from there you know the second most important person to pass was then um right at sin so it just kind of as a snowball so I I get that Vibe this time of year even though you know there's the whole oh the veil is thinnest right at sa right at Halloween time well you know it depends on where you are and how thick that Veil is to begin with because my veil really really does start thinning around this time um because of of those events yeah it's absolutely the thinnest at sa at that time but leading up to it and leading away from it is also very very thin and so ghosts and ancestors are very pervasive this time of year so it's not surprising and you unfortunately have a second reason to look at it as a as a going inward as a ancestor connection time of year but it does not have to be this time of year to work with your ancestors people work with their ancestors all year round now you shelle are one of the very first people I met who ever actually worked with ancestors I had done a lot of reading back when I was a witchling about cultures and people that do a lot of ancestor work that's just because my ancestors scared the crap out of you when you were like 22 years old and you were like who is that guy I'm like oh don't worry that's my grandpa and you're like but he see through I'm like well yeah he died when I was 10 but he was with you and he has been with you for a very long time and he has been part of our rituals at times absolutely and and you know not to jump ahead but I actually I I I wanted to touch today on ancestor altars or having ancestral pieces a part of your main altar um I don't necessarily have an ancestral altar per se dedicated to just that but in my altar area and probably why my grandpa sticks around a lot U my grandfather was a fireman and I have his uh his fire badges uh that were from his uniform and I keep both of these things on my altar so I have and you know no matter where you move I got storage units full of crap stuff that I haven't touched in a little bit but like these are things that no matter where I am they are with me no matter what and and it's kind of that they are a piece of my grandpa they are a piece of my Altar and and they are a remembrance piece and and I feel like maybe I keep him with me probably I mean I think that's part of it we want to keep these people close to us so that's definitely part of it for sure do you have any sort of ancestral altar or things you put on your altar that are ancestral focused I do I have a couple pictures of people that I love that have passed some are relatives and some are friends one's a dog and this year has been tough there have been a lot of deaths in my family and it has lot of pictures added to the altar added and I do have an ancestor altar as I've gotten older maybe that's a natural progression I don't know but I I have started to pay more attention to ancestor worship not just people I have known in life that have passed but people from my Heritage that have passed and and I do have an altar altars are very common when people um venerate their ancestors and it's seen in many many different cultures that you have the ofenda alter in Mexico for Dia deos muos and those can be quite large and elaborate some Chinese and Vietnamese families will often have an altar in the home India you can find this everywhere cultures everywhere we all love the people that helped create us we all worship them in some way or honor them in some way and so an altar is one way to do it one thing that I kind of stole from a Community member for sin one of the things that people do in paganism in I believe it's a Celtic practice was to set a dumb supper right right around Halloween around S one of the things that we do and I have done this for a very long time is to set a place at the table for the Beloved dead for the people who you love who have pass you set a place at the table to invite them to come into your family and to your home and it's one of my favorite Traditions around that time of year so what she had done was she had purchased a large black charger Plate at a um like at a dollar store or something and she takes permanent really nice art permanent markers in silver and gold and around this plate she has started writing ancestors that she works with oh I love that idea recent people who have passed away friends and family and of course spiritual ancestors are on there as well as physical ancestors but she writes them in a spiral on this plate and that's the plate that she uses for her dumb supper when she puts the offering out and I have stolen that for my own ancestral altar at home that's a great idea I love that it's a very beautiful way to have a physical item to honor the people and like shell has very personal items and and items that belonged to these people I'm more of a trinket person I like trinkets like my my grandmother U that I was very close to you remember her she was a Spitfire and her favorite Halloween her favorite holiday above all was Halloween like Halloween was my grandma's Christmas and every Halloween no matter what she dressed up with cuz until she was 87 years old dressed up every year Faithfully no matter what she wore she always wore this wooden cauldron pin and so when she passed away I made sure to get my hands on the wooden cauldron pin um shocker and that also that wooden cauldron pin also uh I I sit next to my grandfather her husband's uh fire badges so they are actually they are my grandparents but yeah the husband and wife Duo so you know I I like to bring people back in pairs but I also with my trinket collection a few years back I had a friend pass away from severe mental illness and before she passed away she had given me a locket with a moonstone and in that locket she had put a picture of her and I and then after that she had passed away so this locket is a part of my ancestor altar now when she originally gave it to me I wore it as a necklace but after she passed it kind of came became more of an altar piece so I I kind of like to have more visuals I guess I'm a visual person I'm a nickname person I love shiny freaking things so I like to have the things as opposed to I love the idea of the of the the dumb supper or I've heard it call a silent supper as well I just I'm not always able to be that or Nate at dinner time let's be realistic well I don't necessarily what I usually do is I set it out on the dining table and we leave it there usually for three days around s so it's not necessarily just during meal times we kind of set it there during that day before day of day after time period of sour my cats would like mess that up but the other thing with your items is those are all items that were personal and close to the person who held them and hold some of their energy some of their literal DNA is still on those items and so that's very much a connection and very magical to have so if you can have that that's fantastic but to kind of get more on the in and on the the more DNA ancestors I guess for lack of a better phrase in my time that I have lived in Salem which has only been a couple of years my daughter bless her soul has become one of those ancestry DNA Fanatics okay um she made me spit in the tube and mail it in the whole kitten Kaboodle my adult child has done some extensive genealogy after her brother and her and myself all doing the spit in the tube thing I actually have found out that I had a a distant relative that was one of the founders of Salem I'd like to point out that Salem was founded about 35 years prior to the witch trials um so this is more of a of a Salem founder not necessarily witch trial related and I have found myself a couple of times going down to the shore and just thinking of this person his name was Peter palfrey and his daughter remembrance palfrey is is who married into what became my family so I I go down sometimes to the Salem Harbor and think about what would life have been like for her and how did it get from her standing on that Shore to me standing on that Shore and the irony of that is through my my family tree and my DNA history remembrance paly and Peter palfrey traced back to my grandmother with whom I keep The Cauldron pin on my ancestor altar oh that's wild yeah so so you know I don't know this person I didn't know you know I didn't know anything about their life back in 1632 but that is a a DNA ancestor of mine and I have caught myself down at the beach thinking she's looked out on this beach before and I looked out on this Beech before and what what the holy heck happened between then and now because a lot has happened between then and now and it it kind of takes you back into that I don't want to use your words but a meditative State it's a it's a peaceful moment kind of remembering someone even though I never knew them I mean this person is is like my eighth great grandmother obviously it's not someone I've met in the flesh but genetically that is my eighth great grandmother who stood on that same Beach as I did that's a beautiful way to find a connection to be able to stand in the same place but even if you can't physically be in the same place where your ancestors were you can still build connections with them either through pictures or items ancestry is a great place to go genealogy people have found all sorts of amazing documents signatures photos of graves you can find connection physical Connections in all sorts of ways or you can find out like myself I'm a big mut my family has done a lot of genealogy and I I'd like to know more one of these days and I will but haven't gotten there yet I do know that we are such big muts that you can really only call me an American I have a lot of different nationalities in my lineage and I think that's kind of cool but what I can do is go through and I'm related to Robert the Bruce and he's a diff distant grandfather on my grandmother my paternal grandmother's side I love that because I'm related to Queen Elizabeth II look was supposed to be royalty here royalty that's right and we're supposed to to bring peace to our lands I know but although I'm definitely not Scottish I mean I'm not enough Scottish to really claim it that's still part of my Heritage and I'm still interested in that and so I can look up parts of the culture and read about it and I can take that information that I have learned and craft a a meditation or a ritual to learn more to ask these ancestors to ask Robert the Bruce himself or maybe another relative like you found remembrance palfrey what a freaking cool name first of all it is kind of a cool name you could talk to remembrance if you find somebody in in your tree that you would like to learn more about you can ask them to come into a dream or come into your meditation or to come into ritual space with you offer that and ask them what they have to teach you just like you might sit down at your grandparents or great-grandparents knee and ask them about stories from when they were younger ask this person their name ask them to come talk to you and be prepared if they say no because I've had that happen well so like a lot of very white families in America my family had a lot of Stories on both sides about how we had Native American ancestry and I was pretty sure it was bull crap you know it's something people said I guess I don't know but when we started doing the genealogy on my father's side way back in the late 1500s there's a woman that's just listed as native woman and you tried to reach out didn't you I did and she's not happy happy she's not thrilled what I know from our genealogy is she eventually went back to the Netherlands with this man and had several children and that's all I know her children then came back to America so she could have very well have been enslaved she could have been she could have been I don't know anything else about her and so I reached out to her and she said no she's come up a couple times when I've done ancestry work and when I've done tried to reach you know to her to other grandmothers in the past and she's angry I mean I guess I've been told no when you kind of put it that way there's been times where I've desperately reached out to my grandfather and kind of got the not today sweetheart and that's that's going to happen kind of that I'm busy call again right for a lot of us there's going to be ancestral trauma the history is not always going to be a pretty place you're going to have ancestors that come to you that died horrible deaths that starved that had terrible lives that were very angry not great people or in my case an ancestress who was done wrong right and so I think I I've been working with that part of it you you don't just look at the good parts you shouldn't just look at the good parts you know you should accept and work with the bad parts as well to maybe try and find some healing in that or moving forward in that but you also in the same breath can't take on the burden of why that ancestor is upset or abut in your case you know your ancestor may or may not have been done dirty you can't take on that burden of responsibility absolutely not no but understand it kind of unpack it and learn from it 100% right right so in learning about that you know you you're going to uncover things in your family both recent and very far that are wonderful you know I'm related to Robert the Bruce how freaking cool is that that is pretty cool that's pretty cool but I'm also related to someone who probably abducted a native woman and kept her in another country against her will right so you're going to find all of that and learning to that's family folks that's right and so learning to to sit with that to learn from that is part of what all of this is about that's what we're here to do is to learn from our ancestors they're not all going to have been you know hedge witches from England that have spells to teach you you know nor are they going to be great Heroes that had the utmost ethics and morals either most of them are just going to be people who are trying to get by just like us and there's lessons to be learned there too I was going to ask you do you have any tips for any for folks on how to tap into finding your ancestors okay we you know everybody knows ancestry DNA you know all of the other DNA testing but as far as on a magical ritual spiritual work level what is your biggest tip for people to connect with ancestors find out about them as much as you can say you have if you have a name if you have a country if you have any information about them at all hold that information if all you have is a country learn as much as you can about that country and that time period so that you can have an idea of what you're looking for and then set and setting like we've said in other meditation podcasts get yourself into in front of your ancestor altar get yourself into a meditative magical space and ask you know hold all that information that you know whether it's about the place and culture and time period or if it's a specific as a name and a picture and a lock of hair take that information and use that energy to call out to this person where they are Beyond the Veil and ask if they want to come talk to you and if they have any information to give you or stories to tell you ask in a respective way and in a magical space as much information as you can gather get that first that's my biggest tip and you know we on occasion we do these Try It episodes and I'm G to kind of turn this into a try it if I can I've been able to kind of track down a general location of where Peter paly had his land because apparently it was like 200 Acres so there's a little bit that's so flipping cool I want to see if I can go there in a non- trespassing kind of way you know if if I just feel like if I'm on land that they owned that maybe I can glean some more yes connection that's definitely a connection I kind of want to try to Foster I would have to go back and look at Peter paly's death date but Peter palfrey was the one that came over and was a founder of Salem wait a minute if he was there 35 years before the witch trials and Remembrance is his how old was she during the witch trials she died I think the witch trials were 1692 and she didn't die until um 1701 so she was alive during the witch trials I know nothing more I know nothing more yes now see this is great this and my daughter is not entertaining me to dig deeper I'm like find out more she's like I'm busy I'm like but Mommy needs to know this and she's like you know I got work and I got a life and I'm like you're killing me kid but going to those places even if it's not your ancestral place if you know your ancestor was on a sailing ship go on one of those big wooden sailing ships and walk around on it go to Salem and walk the streets go to Historic Place she's buried here and I got to find it and her husband um which was actually my genetic DNA relative um her husband was also buried within about a 30 mile radius of Salem and my goal in the next year is to track these people's Graves down but if you walk in these historic places whether your ancestor walked there or not and you allow yourself to be magically open and receptive to those energies you can feel that I mean these you can feel the Shadows of the people who walked that path before you they're right there especially this time of year in in historic places in particular or places that have meaning to your ancestors in particular you can just feel that energy you just have to be a little bit open to it a little receptive it provides so many benefits it gives you information it gives you direct line I I think it's important for for folks in In Living in a historic town which I just happen to have um a DNA Trace to you get that sense walking down the street you're absorbing that history and it's not just the history it is all the people that have walked down I mean you've been here with me walking down that Cobblestone Road how many people were walking down that Cobblestone Road 300 years ago I mean it's just a vibe that you pick up and if you put it out there you should be able to get some sort of reception unless you're Lea's ancestor and get the door slammed in your face I don't blame her one bit not one bit and again the best way to get in touch with your your ancestors is to set up an ancestor altar with pictures to them or items from their Homeland food I was just going to say food offering or beverage offering um my grandma uh sure you remember this from back in the day my grandma is a Coke drinker like nobody's business she would drink like four or two liters a day like like religiously so sometimes if I'm trying to reach out to my grandma I'll put a little Coke in a cup because I know that that woman cannot resist like Coke it's the real thing and she lived by that Mantra and scents and smells and tastes are huge memory triggers and so they are definitely something that can call ancest cestors to you because what's going to bring them back faster than their favorite home-cooked meal or their favorite drink you know mix a drink for them if they like it if I was going to call my husband's father I'd light a joint there's a you know whatever smells remind you of that person are going to pull them in but keep in mind if you don't have any of those things that doesn't mean that you can't do it you might not have the trinkets or the pictures or you might not remember that your grandma smoked Terry tin cigarettes yeah weird fact you might not have these things that's okay you know one thing and and this is what I've tried to do a couple of times and maybe I just need to do it more um because it is such a deepr rooted ancestral you know it's it's far back I've sat here a couple times and just written down the name um I've written down Peter palfrey dozens of times I've written down remembrance palfrey just kind of trying I don't have anything I don't have a trinket of theirs I don't have a picture of them I just have a name you know it's not like my grandparents or my friend where I have stuff so write the name write the name write the name almost like I'm Bart Simpson writing on the chalkboard you know I don't know it works for me because I that's all I got so if you don't have stuff be creative you know if if you've got a name just sit there and Bart Simpson that out on a on a notebook pad of paper just keep writing it that that's what works for me when I'm in a situation where I don't have the trinkets or the photos or what have you and that's where research about the area you know maybe you know where they were born or or maybe you know what time period and what country they were born in you can do a lot of research about what their life would have been like at that time their culture their culture and and take it good and bad and and just meditate with that and call to them call to them with the information that you know maybe cook a traditional dish from that time or find a scent that would have been popular at that time an incense or a candle and just call to them and ask them what their name is ask them how they want to be called by you ask them about their life ask them what information they have to provide this is why being in a meditative state or using DreamWork is a really great way to talk to them because it's the best way to get messages automatic writing is a great way to do it uh shell and I have used Ouija boards as a way to speak to them I know not everybody likes that I think it's just one more way to connect but you know automatic writing getting yourself into a meditative State and then just free form writing ask a question and then just write out whatever answer as it comes and let it flow it's another way to kind of get these messages but like shell said you don't have to have specifics you don't have to have a trinket you can just have an idea of who they were and where they're from and go from there and let them fill in the rest of the information yeah just like regular alter tools it's fun to have they're pretty to have but it's not necessary exactly and it doesn't have to be around this time of year although it makes it easier if it is um it can be any time of year and the closer the connection the easier it will be to call to them my other big tip is don't wait until they're Beyond the Veil talk to your grandparents talk great ants talk to your great grandparents ask them about their lives ask them what information they want to give to you ask them about their favorite place or ask them about their best vacation ask them about their First Love ask them anything but ask them while they're still here because they're still your ancestors that information is still worthy they don't have to be dead to give it to you the conversation's way more fun when they're still alive just saying so I guess that's my biggest tip right there but yeah um and they don't have to be related to you personally I'm very much right now into lineage and close friend chosen family ancestor worship it's kind of where I'm focused a little a little bit but spiritual worship uh spiritual ancestry is another one where uh maybe a famous figure or you know someone we spoke about her earlier hail the traveler Patricia canel Morrison she is on my altar because she had a big impact in my life she's not my ancestor and I don't think I'm badass enough yet to call upon her as one but I still remember her and so she's on a remembrance Altar and I think of her as a spiritual ancestor and so you could do that with people that you know you care for or you have heard of you respect admire you know shell might have Lady D Princess Diana as a spiritual ancestor I don't know or the queen she could ask for information from them whether they're related to her or not I actually do have um one of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee pins on my ancestor of course you do why do you have to call me out on that fans of our other podcast the stoned which is our will know that shell is very very much a fan of the monarchy particularly God's rester Soul Queen Elizabeth and that was way before my daughter even found out that there was a genetic link by the way that's right so having someone that you admire um that has passed on a witchy type person of a famous person anything you could certainly have them as someone that you call as an ancestor that you call upon but it it's just a slightly different type of connection different type of connection different type of energy you know if I'm calling on Queeny here I'm G be calling the queen in a different attitude probably than I'd be calling my grandma that's very true that's very true how you approach it would probably be different depending on who you're calling but I'm I'm very interested in trying to kind of make that connection with some of my ancestors that I know are from from my local area as well as in the surrounding parts of Eastern Massachusetts so I'm looking forward to kind of delving into that in this quote qu unquote thinning Veil season if any of you guys have any questions on how to create an
