welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick today we'll be doing another witches answer episode where we take questions that you've sent in through email and DMS and answer them for everyone to hear I'm Leila I'm shell and I love these These are fun because people have good questions and people make me giggle I love people y'all are great you definitely make us think you make us dig deep into our books of Shadows and pull out all these answers and I can't wait to dive in we have a few Tarot questions we've got some spell and ritual questions we've got incense questions a little bit of everything and at the end we have a really big surprise for everybody people have been having a special request lately there's been a rumor of a wise spell that I've talked about many of times and if you stay tuned to the end you just might get what you've been long waiting for there is a spell a hex to be exact a deep dark hex that we have been keeping a secret but have talked about a few times so yeah stick around to the end and you might learn how to do it so shell if you reach into our grab bag of emails what have we got here from our listeners everybody who's sent in questions has has been great and I just want to start off by saying that if we do not get to your question do not take offense to it we just had a bunch and we just had to pick what we could fit into a time frame okay that being said Kimberly right hi I host a monthly full moon and New Moon ritual at a local metaphysical shop do you by chance have any ideas for activities to use the moon energy we have made intention jars smudges candles Moon water and of course we burn things I love that part I'm just looking for new and fresh ideas thought I would pick your brain all right what do you got for Kimberly Lea well Kimberly and group sound like Crafty Witches to me and definitely looks like they're not just raising energy at the new and full moons but they're putting it into something that they're creating which is a great idea and a wonderful way to harness it other than just doing Moon water which you know we all know and love this is a tough one because you can do anything you can put that energy into anything so you're obviously using new Moons for your intention setting for New Beginnings to put your wishes out there to the universe and full moons that's more your culmination that's when you kind of look and see the seeds that you've planted and kind of see where things are going so during those times you can do crocheting you can do some knot magic try that a little bit try different types of knots if you're green witches you can put that energy into seeds or potted plants and then make some of those knotted macra plant hangers it's a great way to keep energy in a home but I mean anything that you can do that's crafty you can direct energy into that if that's your bag now if you want something just a little more on the Fly here because you just got  going on in your life and you're trying to use that Moon energy to pull it all together clean okay people clean you know cleaning is a ritual I'll fight you for it cleaning space you're not just cleaning your house which obviously we all got to do and and that sucks but it's also kind of a metaphorical thing that you know maybe by mopping your floor or sweeping or you know taking some extra things and putting them in storage or what have you you're cleaning your space but you're also kind of mentally and spiritually cleaning your space I kind of see them all kind of work hand inand and clean clean people it's good for you I really do like physical manifestations of of a spell cleaning is a good one you can see that you have done something and that lifts your spirit as well and can raise vibrations but creating something I'm definitely a crafty witch and I really like to create something with my own hands and my own energy and not just the notot work which I didn't see in your list Kimberly but one thing that has stuck with me for a very long time is Clay work oh my God you've been doing that forever yeah well you did too back in the day we were involved in a a women's group from the Pagan Community we were in where we would get together once a month and one of the things we did was create clay objects and I created like a Venus of Willendorf type statue and I have had that goddess statue on my Altar for a good forever yeah decades now and you were helping me pack last weekend and I thought I had lost it and in about lost my mind she's that important to me boom found it you did you did and we'll talk about the moving thing later miss your astrology thing predicted me moving right after the eclipse I have an episode to prove it different podcast anyway creating something with your hands anything to put that energy in pick a different person each month and have that person bring the intention maybe it's something for their life or someone that they know and also bring the idea of what to create to put that energy into to kind of release out to the world for the next month so maybe rotate that for each person in your circle another thing could be I always take everything back to divination sorry I can't help it have like a a full moon or a dark moon for that matter divination night um and whether it's the full moon or the Dark Moon can maybe gear your questioning or your intention but have a divination night because I like to pull cards on moons I don't know am I weird is it me yes you you are weird but yeah pulling cards on any special night I love it I just did that at the solar eclipse and it was quite fun so clean and pull a tarot card that's my biggest advice and I'm going to tell you the Journal of course you are create journals why don't you tell them to meditate while you're at it I am going to tell them to meditate while they're at it but no creating journals creating a book of shadows uh decorating it I just learned something cool about using uh glue sticks to create designs and then painting over it decoupaging stickers but creating a book of shadows or creating paper are a fabulous tool to charge and that everybody has something that people have all put their energy into from that Circle to write their magical memories in you know we've done actually as much as I I I laugh at the crafty part we've done a lot of crafts for different rituals and some of those things are things I still have to this day 20 30 plus years and that they are prized possessions where in the moment I'm like why am I painting a rock now I'm glad I painted The Rock and kept it okay yeah exactly exactly they have a lot more meaning than something you just purchase right now I kind of you know I was talking about divination so I kind of want to gear into our next our next question from Alina she asks about pulling daily cards she says when I pull dailies I've gotten the same card twice in a row it seems like they're yelling at me they are Alina what are the odds of this happening 100% no not 100% but what do you think what are the odds that you're going to pull the same card twice in a row well mathematically the odds if you're using a traditional Tarot deck are one in 78 now there could be a shuffling thing like how good did you Shuffle and and you know you weren't clear in your in your message if you were a good shuffler or not you know did you shuffle them good and if you are going if you're sitting there right now listening to me and you're nodding yes shell I shuffled them good then my answer is you better listen they're yelling yes and in your message Alina you say it seems like they're yelling at me that's your clue right there if it feels like they're yelling at you they are yelling at you there's a distinct difference in the way it feels when you're reading cards when a card just falls out as opposed to when a card jumps out of the deck or when a card is trying to scream at you something by coming out twice or it's just a 1 in 78 coincidence you'll know you can feel that and you know obviously they are definitely screaming at you some type of message usually when that happens I have found in other readers as well shell back me up on this say that that does mean you're ignoring something they're screaming at you for a reason yeah the universe has a way of slapping you upside the head over and over and over again until you do what they think is the best path or what's right for you so in this case you're ignoring some type of message what I would say is whatever that card may be I would maybe you know look up that card look at it uh look it up in the little booklet that comes with it or Google it or whatever float your boat but see what that card uh means to you and what relevance it has right now because I don't know I got a strong feeling it's yelling at you and you better listen yeah definitely especially if it's a major Arcana you know those are the bigger themes in our lives so if that's jumping out at you repeatedly then there's definitely some piece of advice or faded thing some karmic thing that you're missing you know maybe you're with someone you shouldn't be maybe you're I don't know getting a Vibe here uh oh uh oh come on Lea give it to us I I definitely feel like there's a person in your life I don't know if this is a romantic relationship or not but it feels like there's a person in your life that needs to needs to be removed you keep trying to get this person out and it just keeps coming back so I feel like you need to make some better boundaries I'm not sure anyway wow in that Medium moment brought what's our next question next question comes from Tracy and this actually is a lovely question that came up during one of your workshops at Sacred Space Shell Tracy says that she's been an out ofthe closet witch since the late 80s and solitary because you know hey that's the way it goes sometimes she says that her question is about incense she says it occurred to me recently that maybe I could make incense from the used herbal teas I make if they dry out would they make a decent herbal incense shell do you want to answer that one yeah yeah I mean yeah that's the short answer but yeah there's actually a bunch of things um that you can do with your used tea and that is one of them you can also use it as a as a fertilizer actually if you're using herbal tea you can use your tea bags two or three times before you dispose of them I wouldn't recommend that if you're using black tea for the caffeine purposes because then every time you use it less caffeine bummer but yeah I would definitely definitely dry them out and use them for incense you know waste not want not man that's like my motto and you know I I I'm actually crafting a different Workshop as we speak about how incense and tea if you're using organic ingredients are really the same damn thing whether you're burning it whether you're sipping it whether you're smoking it it doesn't matter so yeah dry that out I would definitely make sure that all of those ingredients align with your intention for the incense but if you're just burning it to burn it for the sake of something smelling good rock on but otherwise I would definitely make sure that what is in that tea bag aligns with your intention for that incense say you're making a you know Communication in my relationship spell and you put in rose hips and you put in chamomile and you maybe you put in some mint you can put in Orange so that you can have these good conversations and still have loving peaceful Vibe going on as well so you do this spell and you create this herbal blend you put that in your tea and as you're sipping your tea you're reinforcing the spell you then take those herbs and dry them out again reinforcing the spell releasing that energy to the universe and then you burn it as an incense while again stating the intention that you want to have good communication in your relationship you could even take some of those not necessarily the rose hips but you can take rose petals and similar herbs and add them to your smokables so now you are doing the spell in three different ways with the same ingredients so the spell has been not only presented as smoke in incense to the universe but you have consumed those energies within you as well and it's an excellent way to honor those herbs like shell said waste notot want not reuse them make it a tea turn it into an incense and then take those ashes and add that to your black salt now you have black salt that is charged with the idea of good communication good relationship yeah very much so we agree with reusing herbs in multiple ways real quick PSA here folks make sure with your personal health care provider that anything you are ingesting is safe and healthy for you and we are not telling you what to ingest drink smoke whatever consult with your physician we're not doctors excellent PSA also so with the tea like shell said you're not going to get as much caffeine if you reuse it it can also get very bitter depending on the type of Tea Leaf you use just keep an eye out on your tastes to see if you like to reuse it as far as a tea bag goes right because that especially with black tea that shits only real good one or two times around if you start trying to use it a third and fourth time it is bitter but you know hey there are people who like bitter tea not judging my recommendation sip it once burn it as incense make a complimentary smokable and just do all of it at once to enhance your spell work waste not want not folks exactly all right so our next question also has to do with you know we were just talking about the workshops we did at Sacred Space we also got an email from Alicia who was another attendee at Sacred Space in Maryland this past March now shell we were just talking about being in the vendor room at Laura Tempest Zach's stall looking at all her fabulous art and I think we encountered a fan maybe Alicia in the wild do you remember that wild fan in the wild alert now Alicia if that was you I just want you to know real quick we were fangirling ourselves at the moment so you should have stayed and chatted yeah by the time we turned around you melted into the crowd we were so excited to actually meet a fan in the wild it was about it we actually did talk about it the whole rest of the weekend we're like oh my God fan in the wild thank you for going I hope you had as marvelous of a time at Sacred Space as we did it was absolutely phenomenal and I'm still glowing from all the energy I wish I was back in Marilyn just so Alisa really was just emailing to say hi and let us know about some of her tarot rituals uh she says that what she likes to do is a self- blessing ritual before she does tarot and I don't always do this but I think having a routine with your tarot readings especially if you're doing them for yourself can be really fantastic and I love how yeah Alicia says she does a self- blessing and then she does her tarot Paul and then afterward she does some gentle chair yoga and I think that is such a nice thing to incorporate as a routine in your day we already recommend doing a daily tarot poll in journaling about it to deepen your practice to deepen your connection to the cards you know if you add some meditation and self- blessings and movement into it that's so much more magical so thank you Alicia for sharing that and by the way Alicia we love iring glass too wo she's amazing wot woot all right what have we got next next we have Amanda Amanda's enamored by my vast collection of tarot decks a lot of people are so I am too so Amanda's looking for a small deck as far as small and size you know I've had a lot of people ask me this because I don't know I have these enormous long fingers and I am the only one and I get it and there are people with smaller hands that want smaller decks because they're easier I happen to at Sacred Space which we were just talking about buy two more decks because who wouldn't and I happen to buy a smaller deck now this is not what would be considered a miniature deck because the wrer weight series puts out a wrer weight mini deck so to say I wouldn't call this a mini deck it's just smaller and I really like this The Fellowship of the fool and this deck was created by Helena Dominic who was also a presenter at Sacred Space and this would be the perfect deck for someone who has a hard time shuffling larger cards but they do create that wrer weight original deck in like six different sizes um so you actually can get that OG rer weight deck in a smaller size that's not the mini I've gotten a few Decks that come in tins sometimes you'll see the tin deck those that come in a tin are generally a smaller size than the traditional decks so I would maybe look out for some of those a really fun one if you're like a a Halloween lover is they have a Halloween tarot that comes in a tin that is a smaller size deck or my last option would be a round deck we actually saw folks with round decks at Sacred Space the mother piece tarot yep and and I know there are a couple other ones besides the mother piece but around Tarot might help you with that so that is my advice on non-traditional smaller siiz decks Amanda so I would maybe check some of those out online or at your local metaphysical shop and also most popular decks come in a smaller like traditional playing card deck size for example Phyllis curat The Witches wisdom tarot I believe just recently came out with a reprint and it's a smaller version of her cards specifically because people had said they had trouble handling the larger size deck right and I know there are several Decks that will have a larger version and then a smaller playing card version so if you see a deck that you like check with the publisher and see if they reprint it in a different size like shell said some come in more than one right they're a lot easier to find um than you think and if you don't have a ton of options in your area locally shoot us another email and I will suggest to you some shops here in Salem that you can do online shopping actually we've had a couple requests for you to suggest your favorite shops in Salem I know I've sent a few emails out to people with those but uh we will do a short uh review of Salem shops at some point episode oh hell yeah we will and make sure to give those out to people we do mention the ones that we like occasionally in episodes but we'll combine it all into one episode we'll be more comprehensive that's right that's right um let's see here all right what do we got next oh witch babes we're witch babes I could be a witch babe us hell yeah yeah so this message is from Ari star I love this question I thought this was the coolest thing so Ari asks is it a good idea or is it necessary to cleanse primordial ingredients like dirt sand shells etc for contact they say they were crafting a ritual for close friends fertility and cleansed my normal tools but wasn't sure about the oyster shell or the sand I want to keep the nature of the sand and shell but wouldn't want previous external energies lingering or for dirt what if the grounds are first that would junk up some things thank you for your insights with gratitude Ari star I almost have a couple answers for this yeah me too yes and no me too I have the same answer so weird my yes would be I would probably do the shells not the dirt and sand my yes would only be if they had previously been in a place that had some type of strong energy that was not in alignment with what it normally would have say for example you have a a quartz say you found a a clear quartz which would normally be for clarity for protection for divination and you found it in a cursed Forest so maybe it has picked up some of the energies from the place where it was I believe that most items have their own energies and their own Spirit their own animus I am an animist so I think those shells and that sand and that Dirt has its own energy and its own alignments so you would not need to cleanse it you would just need to let it be what it is and use it the way that it wants to be used according to its nature in your spellwork but if say that shell had been on someone else's Altar for a while yes you'd want to cleanse it say it had been in a shop for a while you might want to cleanse it but if something that you just picked up randomly most of the time you will not need to cleanse it just go with the energies that it already has I love that answer I just kind of do it more of the the shell kind of had this living being in it so you want to cleanse those energies out where the dirt in the sand I kind of look as a kind of self- cleansing if that makes sense yeah so like a self-cleaning oven um so I I kind of picture them as more self-cleaning whereas the shell has kind of the residual energies of that being that was housed in it previously see I guess that's where we differ a little bit because I wouldn't cleanse that I would feel that that is part of its true nature and so I would want to follow the energies of its true nature wait wait wait wait wait do you cleanse a new house when you move into it after someone else that's different you know the the crabs energies I would put into my spell whereas the people in the house to me that's a little different but the shell is just the house yes but the crab is just a crab it's not a person I guess maybe the crab had a tragic life or something I don't know but I think I prefer to just work with the energies as they lay as opposed to if a person put their energy on that shell or on that house that I would probably want to cleanse or like I said if you're in an area like sometimes places can have a  ton of energy for all sorts of different reasons like say a cemetery if you get dirt from a cemetery you know you need to be very careful because depending on what grave or what part of the cemetery you got that from if you did the right requests when you got that dirt that could have careful when I use that dirt for though because got Cemetery exactly so Cemetery dirt is going to be different than forestt is going to be different than stream dirt so know what you're working with know the energies of what you're working with and know where it came from and how it's been used before for different reasons our answers are yes and no yeah there you go we both say a lot that intention is everything if you pick up that shell and you want to use it as a cauldron that kind of fits with shell energy but maybe you want to use it to hold your smudge stick and now it's going to be like fire energy you can still have that work for you because of your intent and how you want to use it but going with what it wants to be going with the nature of that component will make your magic that much more potent in my opinion if you if you work with the energy that's already there in that natural element it's going to enhance your spellwork flows easier and there you go all right so I hope that answers your question Ari it's a big question and you're going to get different answers depending on the wit okay so now we have a we have a a good one from Jessica Jessica is realizing a lot of stuff that she was just doing on her own is witchcraft hey but her her question comes into she's collected moonwater um and storm water for spellwork and she wants us to talk more about uses and types of water and water work this Jessica Jessica Jessica this could totally be a total episode in and of itself it will but to kind of address it in the moment and I want to skip information but you're asking a big question we got a lot of big questions here you can use it for consecrating your tools you know you can use your moon water to consecrate you know maybe your athme or your chalice or what have you you can use it to do sigil work um like Lila has said before you can make sigils out of your water I would definitely be careful with storm water and sigils because there's a little bit of chaos going on there use your water wisely but there's a lot of different things spell work you can do um you can drink it as long as you know it's clean and what are some things you could think of Lea I think that using sunat is excellent for like shell said if I was going to charge my tools or Empower things I would definitely use solar charged water maybe not necessarily Eclipse water cuz that's going to be a little different but but water charged by the sun if you want to get really specific you can pick a certain astral olical sign to charge it under but just plain old Sun water is definitely going to work for you to empower things to give that Vitality the the lifegiving sun energy if you're going to use storm water that's some very powerful water and in an episode we'll get into different types of storms snow water if there's lightning or no lightning but typically storm water is used to empower spells it's going to be used for hexes and curses to break hexes and curses uh to bring in different types of energy and power into your workings and when we do when we do do an episode on it we'll also talk about how you can use it with those different varied intentions into spell bottles and stuff again just a big question to get into right now yep uh New Moon water is good for manifesting it's good for calling things into your life full moon is good for U vitalities that's the one you'd want to drink it's great for protection it's great for you it's great for increasing psychic ability ities so yeah witches nowadays it's it's a big thing Moon water and Sun water used to pretty much be it but now you can get storm water and do water water I've been kind of into water lately shell and I have both the last couple years been kind of leaning towards water witchery I do charge Moon water and Sun water but not a lot more so I work with water of place like the well water on my father's land or the the water from Lake Ontario or from the fingerlakes I'm not too far from the Salem Harbor down at water from Lo Hoya where I you know out in California where I lived for a while and loved it water from Big Bear places that I love so water of place is very important to me more so than Moon water or solar water but I mean heck you can put your crystals or your items outside in the sun be careful with crystals because some of them can be damaged by water or sun uh so you just want to be a little careful with that but putting the item itself outside as opposed to charging the water is more what I do now I for ease that's a little simpler than carrying around jugs of water that I then forget to label I can tell you right now you can't see it but right here behind me shelle I have two jars of moon water I don't know when I did them I don't know what moon it was I don't remember anything about it can I just say same aside from the ocean one of my favorite places on Earth is the Thousand Islands region in Northern New York St Lawrence Seaway and everywhere I go I actually carry a bottle not everywhere I go like leave in the house but every place I live I keep a bottle of water from the St Lawrence Seaway with me and I actually have it next to my bed here so I don't know I need to keep the the St Lawrence with me wherever I go and damn it I do and I it's it's weird and yeah it's in a Mountain Dew battle with No Label I get it I get it but yeah Jessica we are gonna actually do an episode on that upcoming so stay tuned and we will give you a whole episode on water magic so let's see one more here this one's from Tam and I really like this one cuz it's kind of fun and Tam says I have a question for you please knowing that the directions correspond to the elements North equal Earth east equals air Etc do the solstices and Equinox also line up to directions they do they do indeed you know one thing I've always wanted to do and one day this will happen damn it I want to go to England and see the sunrise on the solstice it's supposed to like come right up through like come on right there are actually build is building is the right word there are structures um across the earth a couple of them here and there that line up with the sunrise on the two solstices and different places align with the different solstice so um depending on uh where you are in the world in these particular structures will depend where you see the sun through is it through the structure is that the best way to say it yeah that's a good way to put it like new gra it lights up the chamber and or or goes through a hole in the stone or or like an opening between Stones so we're not going to get into who put the stones or the buildings or or whatnot there different pod but yeah so you know the winter solstice is going to line up with generally the the spots in the Northern Hemisphere and the southern hemisphere generally more lines up with the ones that are at the summer I don't know why no that fits ostara is is fertility it's New Beginnings it's it's the beginning so naturally that aligns up with East in a lot of traditions that's air then you have lith the summer solstice the sun is at its most powerful you know it's summertime it's hot it's the longest day and that's fire that's South fire and passion then you have the Autumn Equinox sometimes uh contentiously called mabin very contentiously by the way this one is I would say is water uh this is the West this is Harvest and sunset it's the end of the day everything is equal and Balan so West is connected to water and emotions and I think that goes well with the Setting Sun of mavin the Autumn Equinox and I think it's a good time to kind of balance the transition between the elements um because the elements kind of you know clock Along on that little Notch of the wheel just as everything else so they're kind of like that balance in between switching elements and then like shell said the winter solstice Ule that's North that's Earth Ule is The Rebirth of light it's quiet you go with within it's the longest night uh it's the deepest part of winter when everything is quiet and still and cold and you go kind of within to the Earth including my wallet that's right it's stability and grounding it's family you know it's that why is that so true shell it is it is fuel when my wallet goes dead and cold that's right dead and cold that's right but to answer the question Tim yes it does funny how all this stuff lines up and works together that's right now I equated these elements with directions that's not always going to be true the elements and the directions that I gave you are traditional Wiccan traditional Western European correspondences in your practice if you're an animist if you're connected to your land you may have different elements for each Direction and that is absolutely good and okay and proper whatever works for you the element itself ostara air litha fire mabin water right sorry Autumn Equinox water and Ule Earth so the directions don't necessarily have to go with that but the elements correspond that way so there you have it that's the answer so the very last email is from an and an has a lot of questions shell so we're going to tackle this as best we can before we get into our surprise thing at the end okay okay all right so Ann says that she's overwhelmed with the amount of information she needs to learn and she wants to learn everything which I totally get and it's so much that sometimes she finds herself not doing anything at all because she doesn't know where to start and she wants to know what our plan of attack was when we first started out and how did we learn the many and varied subjects in the craft and I think shell kind of answered that quite a bit last episode when we were talking about books of Shadows in our books of shadow Shadows you will find a veritable eclectic Paradise of topics as we got interested in things we would research them like crazy our group would get involved we would do rituals we would do spells uh we'd talk about it we would read books and suggest them to each other and then we'd write it all down I know I say journaling all the time but that's really what I'm going to recommend is go with your interests go with what you like grab a book or an author or a topic go to your library and read as much about it as you can and then write all the bits that you really like into your book of shadows because that's going to help you remember it you don't have to learn everything no like with me it and and it's kind of still that way today you know I really gravitated to herbalism and Tarot and everything just kind of went from there as far as you know doing actual spellwork the ins and outs of that ritual the ins and outs of that you know those tried and true 80s and 90s books you know buckland's Big Blue Book Cunningham's herbal encyclopedia you know spiral dance those those are kind of the ones that really I don't want to say shaped us but shaped us they really did and so my best advice for this one is follow your interest go as much as you can in what you're interested in and do it get dirty if you see a spell you like don't just read it do it get the stuff get a close approximation of the stuff and do it the other thing I want to do is is and I would feel remiss if I didn't say this you and I early on were also blessed with a pretty kickass local community that we also had the opportunity to learn from as well so those things on top of being surrounded by a really great local Pagan community that you know we learned a lot from those guys and if any of you guys are listening love you and that's very true I love our community they are full of amazing practitioners and I absolutely love and am grateful to our local community for that but before I met you and before I met them I was a solitary practitioner for years I knew zero other pagans or witches and that's the case for a lot of people today despite how popular Witchcraft and paganism is it can still be very difficult to find people to practice with and so when I was a solitary and had no one my biggest Source was books now you have so much more available to you and usually within a short drive there's some type of metaphysical shop which can be a great way to meet other people right today with podcasts like ours with YouTube channels with online conferences and festivals you have so much opportunity to meet and learn from other people just be a little careful you know watch out for the people that reach out to you because they love your energy and want to teach you but you know look for reputable places reputable conferences and check those out learning from other people is invaluable absolutely and like Lea said just just be mindful of of who you're dealing with because there are so many scammers and bad people out there but yeah books podcasts festivals conferences and just do it get dirty and do it and just do it and you know nothing's wrong and if someone tells you that it's wrong they're  that's all all right so the next part she has another question question and she says that she wants to do more but she just feels silly sometimes and her self-doubt kicks in girl I hear you on that one right she says there's a little voice that always tells her that she's nuts for even believing in Magic and she struggles a lot with Christian guilt and she says that to be her most powerful she must listen to her heart and intuition but that's so much easier said than done and she wants to know if we have any tips from our own personal struggles and I can say I still struggle with self-doubt and imp imposter syndrome you should have seen the two of us before our workshops at Sacred Space our fan in the wild did and they're probably like man those two girls are nut jobs no we were having anxiety thank you anxiety I I'm gonna honestly put it out there um I do not have really any experience on the Christian guilt end of that question the best I can say because I I know someone and had someone in my life who did have that Christian guilt and the best thing I can say to you is you just got to trust in what you believe and trust your heart and you know guilt is that's kind of their hook you know don't drink the Kool-Aid don't drink the Kool-Aid I I I get that it's easier said than done to just not feel that way but that's kind of what they want you to do they want you to feel guilty and that is a secondhand experience personally I have not had to deal with that thankfully now as for the self-doubt when my biggest helpers in that has been going back to the science I go back a lot to psychological theories and ideas of the brain and the idea that you can help yourself through spellwork and that spellwork and meditation are very very good for you on a physical level above and beyond magical even if it's just physical meditating is good for you doing spellwork and positive thinking and affirmations and intention setting from a psychological standpoint is good for you and scient ific Al proven to be good for you so if that is all you're getting out of it that's enough now I don't want to mention any names but do you remember back in the day we had a person that we regular regularly did ritual with and wanted us to do a ritual where we uh we called the what what are they uh Saints or archangels what were they archangels yes yes yes yes yes yes we did that because I remember we called St Michael and I'm like is this what are we doing I was taken back but I didn't come from a super Christian background but do you remember that when we we actually did a ritual and Incorporated some quote unquote Christian to it um because someone had asked us to and you know it wasn't so bad I'm just saying if you have a lot of guilt you can maybe kind of ease the trans incorporating it help transition sure there's a lot of Christian wit witches and a lot of folk magic folk tradition incorporates quite a few different Christian values and traditions into their magic so you certainly could incorporate that if that would help you because witchcraft by the way witchcraft Itself by definition is not a religion so just just keep that in mind that witchcraft is actually in itself not a religion would the Christian think that's not something that I struggled with either um I was very happy to realize that there was more to the world than just that particular religion and very happily left that behind but meditate with it I guess is the best thing that I can say and like shelle said talk to if you still feel a connection to Mary or to Jesus or to any other figure in the Bible you know talk to them Reach Out Mother Teresa she'll give you good advice yeah there you go the biggest struggle I had is is mostly with um impostor syndrome so I find a lot of comfort in the fact that putting positive intentions out there is still good for me and I have seen enough return magically to know that it works but we still have imposter syndrome on occasion don't let us fool you too true so now the last question that she has or actually two questions I love this one is what the hell is the difference between a spell and a ritual when do I cast a spell and when do I perform a ritual I love this well spells are kind of you know this is what I say to some of my Christian friends think of a spell is praying and think of a ritual is going to church yeah that's a great way to put it I love that that's really good yeah spells are when you're asking for something spells are usually because you're trying to work your will in some way and rituals are usually when you're giving thanks or honoring or paying homage to something so yeah it spells our asking ritual is thanking I guess is a simple way to put it in the Christian analogy is it's like praying versus going to church Church spot on spot on I love that spells can be on the fly it can be me going I need a parking spot and sending that energy out to the universe rituals tend to be more formal they tend to be more structured usually there are different steps that should be followed in a ritual components that's right that's right there can be you can make your spell very ritual like your spell can have a lot of ritual parts to it but it doesn't have to and you can design a ritual around your spell and and you know you can do that but absolutely not necessary right I love how it's very simple prayer slash asking for something as opposed to giving thanks or honoring your ancestors maybe you're paying your dues you know maybe you're giving a sacrifice or giving something to your ancestors your deities your Spirit guides so it's a little different side note there's no confessional and ritual is there a conf oh right I right over my head I didn't I was like confession I'm like do we do that in spells like what is that a Wiccan thing no I love you I didn't know I've never been to confessional okay so aen we have done the best we could to to kind of get all of your questions answered because you know you know you had a lot of questions but we hope that those answers can help you with your journey and thank you everybody that has emailed or dm'd us questions and I am so sorry if I haven't gotten back to you but there's a few I'm working through it I'll get to you it might be a minute but we'll get there no no no no no before we go we've promised a little surpris gifty for folks as far as there's there's some knowledge that that we have that people are seeking currently I don't know what state the world is in right now but for some reason we've gotten like six requests for the famous itchy spell I have heard requests for this itchy spell I don't know what's going on in the world right now that that that this is a hot a hot need but you know what enough people have asked for it Lea let's let's let's give them a version of the itchy spell all right now we will be putting this up on our website if I could figure out a picture to go along with this so I could put it on Instagram I'll do it but I just don't know something that'll get past the Facebook sensors I let me think on this people let me think on this all right so the back on the broomstick itchy spell you're going to need some traditional uh spices you're going to need a little cayenne pepper black pepper cornmeal and if you can get some stinging nettle that's great but regular nettle will work you can also use Thorns from a rose if you're in a pinch absolutely you're also going to want a pink rose bud now not a fully open Rose well I guess it depends on who you're doing this for but typically a closed pink rose bud some paper and a pen a paper pen a large pen a red or purple or black candle um what type of incense would you use here shell well to be honest with you I would take pepper corns and uh some of the you know how you can get like the red pepper flakes usually you get them to put on your pizza yeah pepper corn and red pepper flakes we're using that in the spell but what incense would you use that's usually what I use I double it up oh okay so be careful if you're going to be burning peppercorns and red pepper flakes as your incense be very careful cuz it it'll hurt your eyeballs you don't want that in your eyes I can't believe we're actually telling the public this I don't know why we're telling the public this say ass anyway so one of the most important components is a large apple and what you're going to want to do is take your Apple you know the stem is on the Top If you flip it over on the butt end yes it's called but the Apple I'm like a 12y old boy right now that's where the flower was when the Apple first grew so that's the part that you want you're going to cut off about half inch to an inch of the Apple almost so you have like a little dish and you're going to place the cut side of the Apple down on your cornmeal so you have a little a little um a little uh crevice things in yeah let's go with the crevice yeah so you're going to light your candle in your incense and you're going to write this person's name on the paper with intention and you're going to take that paper as you pass it through the smoke three times you're also going to fold it three times and you're going to say I fold your name in The Heat and smoke intense discomfort to provoke a reminder sharp and itch to teach the find out part is within your reach then you're going to pin that paper shut and if you feel like stabbing that paper repeatedly before you pin it shut with your PIN that's okay go for it you do you man now you're going to take the paper and you're going to light it with a candle and drop it into your cast iron cauldron or your safe burning dish and you're going to take that pink perfect little rose bud and you're going to crush and mangle that Rose Bud over the burning paper and drop it onto the paper tell them what they got to say you have to say with intention and say this like you mean it your tender buds so pink and sweet mangled now with revenge and Heat make sure this person deserves it by the way now now Leila and I have a little variation on this next step so you mix the cayenne pepper the black pepper the nettle together and you add to the pepper Ash the rose petals but what I also do is I flip over the apple and I take some of that Red's hot sauce and I put the red hot sauce on that part of the bottom of the Apple that kind of looks like an I'm just saying and then so put your red hot on that flower part of the apple and then why are we giving this to the public I don't know and while you're mixing all the ingredients together in your cauldron you're going to say around find out  around find out around around find out find out and then you're going to put that mixture on the Apple butt on the flower part of that apple and make sure you are putting it there with all the energy you can muster because this person deserves it uhhuh now you're going to take your pin that had previously stabbed into their name paper and you are going to stab the Apple butt nine times 27 if you're super pissed I generally just go right to 27 but that's me yeah yeah and you're going to say prickle burn poke and itch Justice is served karma's a and this is when you're going to be raising your energy and pouring it into your ingredients right there once you have charged that apple and all the ingredients on the little apple butt plate you're going to take your candle and seal it you can do just a couple drops of wax onto the herbs or you can completely seal it with wax you do go big or go home people go bigger go home that's right and imagine the Heat and the burn of this dropping wax adding to and sealing the spell for this itchy  spell then you're going to do a couple different things disposing of a spell can be important too if you want to just get rid of this and no longer think about them and their Itchy Butt ever again just throw it in the garbage you know what I've done before what's that I've actually thrown it out in the yard when I knew animals were coming through to eat it so it got eaten there you go that works make sure you take the pin out if you're going to do that oh no no no I take the pin out before I do it you can bury it in the ground if you would like this energy to slowly be transformed and taken away from you but also take the pins out if you're going to bury it in the ground exactly make sure it's just the organic part and again just the organic part you can put it in a compost bin if you would like that energy to be transformed into something else and to grow into something new so how you dispose of it can also help disperse that energy in a certain way you know how I close out this spell me personally how's that with a big you yes scream that to the universe y put it out there you they have around they are about to find out and they will have an itchy  that they will not be able to soothe so make sure they deserve it as funny as it is be careful the magic you wield because you know like they say careful what you wish for it'll just happen you don't want this backfire and because the backfire is your will itch so just be careful folks hex with caution and while we don't necessarily believe in the wiccan version of the rule of three we do believe that all actions have reactions as long as you're willing to take the karma we're all good here shell and I usually ascribe to if you're going to be doing this magic make sure that they deserve it and make sure you're willing to take the consequences whatever they may happen to be 100 there you go and that's it that's our answers and our itchy spell use it wisely folks use it wisely please and with that being said thank you all so much for listening to back on the broomstick make sure you like subscribe comment give us a review we'd love to read
