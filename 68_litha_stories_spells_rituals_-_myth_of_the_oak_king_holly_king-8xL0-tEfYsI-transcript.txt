welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode we'll be talking all things litha the summer solstice and to our southern hemisphere friends it is the winter solstice or Ule ready to talk all things summer and flowers and abundance I'm Lea and I'm shell and I'm also going to interject some of the winter solstice stuff into here for our for our southern hemisphere friends and we've got a little uh a little myth story to tell you that'll be relative to both both our Southern and Northern Hemisphere folks so happy summer solstice happy litha guys let's do this happy litha obviously we're recording this a little bit ahead of litha but it's still summertime everything is Lush and the flowers are out and I am so stoked litha always reminds me of lavender litha and lavender go hand inand because June is when my lavender bushes flower I tried to grow lavender once it died shocking well we'll get into the plants I gave you in just a minute which I hope you're not killing so I went out and I harvested a bunch of lavender today I'll put pictures up on Instagram for everybody but I made a star out of lavender stocks that I'm hanging up in my little office SL witchy space and I'm letting it dry and it's super cute it's so cute and it's a perfect opportunity to do a little not magic so we'll talk about that later in the episode as well but first I saw you this past weekend you hung out at my house house and got to see my little witchy space in the back and I sent you home with a spider plant clone from my plants and a clone of my heart leaf filodendron plant and those suckers are really hard to kill so you should be all right so how are they doing so far so good I actually so first of all I have to keep them up because my  cat is very into you know he's just a cat so I have him up but today I put him down and let him be in the sun I watered him today and I've had him for what two days now so it's been two days and I watered them cuz I thought I probably didn't need to water them the day after I got home cuz I assumed you knew me well enough to know that you probably watered them well enough before you gave them to me that's true you know me well that's very true I did but so far so good well I'm still trying to keep them away from the cat yeah that's going to be the big problem is if the cat eats them oh but so far so good and I I I had kept a spider plan alive for a good bit way back in the day so I think I'm up for the task we'll see this is me telling Devon Hunter hold my beer hold my house plant Devon she's coming through she's got the spider plants it's all ready it's on like Donkey Kong man I did want to mention you talked about something that you did today sumers souls to see I did something today too a little bit different than you it was clean your alter space day today you know I know that we do this whole spring cleaning thing but I figure by this time of year now it's it's been a little bit and it's it's time so I did the summer solstice cleaning ritual today I love that you know I know we harp on it a little bit but really every tick as shell would call it but every holiday of that wheel is an excellent time to remember to refresh your ritual space refresh your altar space even if it's just one little corner of your dresser where you maybe have a crystal and a candle and a cool stick you found on your walk clean it refresh it maybe add a little pine cone or a new flower or something different to represent the season but these are great reminders to freshen up your space because that is a wonderful way to energetically and magically clear out the clutter in your own head in your aura in your magical self while you're cleansing physically your magical space no it was good getting to the point where I'm pretty sure that that dust was getting spiritual at this point yeah I told you scrape it up and put it in your black salt man it's not dust on my window s those are magic a WS that's really what right right yeah yeah magic dust magic dust that's right the good stuff here so I wanted to kind of get into the some people call a legend some people call it a myth call it what you will the story of the oak king and the Holly King and that where I was I was hoping to Encompass our southern hemisphere friends today because they can just kind of relate to the opposite side of the story so you want to delve into this Oak King Holly King who are they what do they mean why are they fighting let's talk about this I really love this myth it's come up a little bit lately because people don't think it's necessarily relevant any longer and in some ways it isn't but honestly all of these myths are really just stories and messages to try and get a point across so the point of the oak King and the Holly King is a solar story it's basically dividing the year up into two halves the light half of the Year where the light is growing stronger and the days are getting longer and the dark half of the Year where the light is waning and the days start getting shorter and shorter so that happens obviously on the solstices the summer solstice is the longest day and the shortest night so the oak King the young God who rules over the light half of the year is at the height of his power he's the flirtatious God and you know what you don't actually have to use God he could be a goddess you could say energy you could say whatever basically it's that young flirtatious lifegiving force of the sun that's coaxing all the flowers and the leaves and the grass to grow it's pulling people out of their houses and enticing them to make love and make babies and rejoice and have all this abundance it's that energy and that reaches its Peak at summer solstice and then the Holly King Reigns and this if you want to call it the god energy or the goddess or again Just Energy doesn't really matter the seasoned the wiser the the experienced the taking a step back you know think before you leap whereas the oak King is more leap before you think so it's kind of that older wiser version yeah it's that steadi more calculated responsible C that's a good word I like that calculated yeah it's that very much more mature energy that you need to get I mean in the spring and summer abundance is here you don't have to worry about the future you just pick some food off a Vine and keep going dancing way into the night you don't have to worry about being warm because you can be hot and sweaty all night long while you're naked it's summertime Beach where the Holly King is thinking about we need to conserve we need to gather we need to be thinking ahead for those colder darker times to sustain ourselves through that exactly and so they embody those types of energies and in Wiccan tradition and in our old communities tradition it was embodied in the Young Oak King God and the wiser Sage Holly King God what they do basically the idea in this old story is at the height of of the oak King's power the goddess is a little fed up with him she's pregnant she she's over it she needs more responsibility she's going to have a lot of responsibilities coming up not just needing to store food and be warm but she's going to have a baby so however you choose to take that in your life again does not have to represent a goddess and a baby it can represent responsibilities your nurturing aspect it needs to be more supported than it was in the spring and summer so even though the oak King is at the height of his power he's now realized there's nowhere to go but down there's nowhere to go but older and wiser he's reached his prime so some people have them battle in switch places now because now after litha after that longest day the days start to get shorter and that's the dark half of the year that's the rain of the Holly King sunrise on the day after the summer solstice that's how H King territory but some people kind of have them still walking side by side a little bit as the seasons slowly change but that's basically the story of it and remember for our southern hemisphere friends it's the same story you're just going to flip it to the opposite grab onto your broomstick witches back after these messages if you've been feeling like you're in need of a bit of soul food and some inspiration join us as we journey back into the Mists of Irish mythology come into the Mythic with us and discover what these magical ancient stories can tell us about our place in the Web of Life today there are love stories stories of transformation and magical beings doomed Heroes and radiant goddesses into the Mythic is a mix of Storytelling ancient wisdom and conversation all recorded in a small village on the Southwest coast of Ireland and we'd love to share it with you it's available now wherever you get your podcasts yeah the wiser energy is giving way you don't have to be closed up any longer you don't have to be in your head you need that energy that power to go out and get your ground ready get your seeds ready start planting and doing that energy that dance that energetic growth that you really need from the oak King now we've actually done group rituals where we we kind of played this out in a Passion Play form didn't they have swords if I recall and we did like a mock sword fight or something I think it was with our matching swords with our swords right that we had gotten for when we did the triple goddess yeah we had two people from Community I think they were both from our coven yeah one played the oak King and one played the Holly King and then we had another coven mate played the pregnant goddess I played uh Queen MB of the Fay that was narrating The Passion Play they came in with swords and did a whole actual sword fight in the middle of the circle which was really cool some people didn't appreciate it because they didn't like the idea of violence being brought in but I I liked that we had them fight with swords but it seemed more like a dance yeah and at the end was yeah and at the end even though there was a quote unquote defeat we still had them working together and walk off together because they're two sides of the same person just like all this idea of triple goddess or triple God or whatever they're all different aspects of the same person so we talk about Oak King and Holly King they're the same God they're just different aspects of the same deity and I think what's important is even if you don't like the myth of the oak King and Holly King and don't like that wicking take on it I think it's still important to notice that it's almost like handoff season think of it as handoff season you know you're going from foot loose and fancy free too you kind of got to pull it in make things a little tighter you know kind of like summer for kids in school you know you're doing whatever whenever and then you get to that point where it's time to start getting ready to get back to school get back to responsibility get back to routine so it it really does signify just kind of a shift if nothing else if if if the myth part ain't your bag recognize the shift going from that light half to that dark half or vice versa I really love the dance of the seasons I I am so into the whole cycle thing the bigger cycles of the year the solar cycle of the sun god the oak King Holly King the lunar cycle of the Goddess changing every month there's so much wisdom to be found in that that I can apply in my own life that makes it feel so much more magical to know that like you said it's a shift it's that handoff litha is the height of Summer things are so beautiful and abundant I cannot get enough of being outside right now and all the farmers markets and the flowers and my own ability to work in the land and go camping I know that I've got a little bit more time for that but this is also that clue that it's not going to last forever you know summer is here just for right now and enjoy it but pretty soon you're going to have to start preparing for the cold now that kind of Segways me into to the next point I wanted to talk about in regards to litha and that is is the holiday that never was this is like the most unattended at least at least in our local community it was I know exactly what you're talking about the most unattended ritual of the year and it's not that people didn't like litha and didn't want to celebrate it but because it's kind of that foot loose and fancy free and in abundance and that warmth that summer you know you only got so much time people are making lots of plans there's lots going on it's Festival season yeah so this is almost like the Forgotten ritual yeah it really was everyone was off in their own directions going to 300 people for belan and like 21 people for litha and the worst part of it was is I think litha was often forgotten by the people who had called and promised to host and run the ritual and come up with the ritual yeah they would be nowhere to be found and you would have these couple dozen people sitting around going so what are we going to do and we'd have to come up with a ritual on the FL on the spot yeah right there you know it's a lot of people ask and I see this on on the Tik Tok and the Facebook how do you do that well what do you do if you're in the middle of the woods and you don't have books with you and you don't have this and that with you to figure out something right you didn't plan on running a ritual man you come up with that on the fly yeah and you didn't plan on running a ritual so let's talk real quick about what do you do when you show up and there's nothing planned I like like your your star made out of lavender idea because this was also a time when you know we talked about this with beltin as well but when we were sitting there waiting for someone to show up with an idea before we decided to you know take matters into our own hands and do it we would do things like make flower crowns and even just walk in the creek or or do a sweat lodge you know look at the fireflies at night just all those things that are so soaking up the Outdoors because at least in Upstate New York you only got a couple months to do that where it's wonderful yeah right so you know it was sometimes it was just taking it all in and enjoying the fact that you have this longest day to honor that day yeah and you know I didn't really think of it that way but looking back at some of those lost rituals where we're sitting in that long grass with the wild flowers all over the place listening to the insects and the birds and the creek running the night before we had all just sat around a little fire in the warmth and watched all the fireflies and the stars come out that's celebrating litha right there right right it's the community the Friendship the enjoying the slow pace and the gorgeousness that's all around us right now so that being said what do you really actually do if you need to do a ritual right now because the people dropped out that we supposed to run it what do you do pull that out of your ass that's what you do that's exactly what you do so I would say that's where we would fall back on tried and true in this community there weren't a lot of people who would have said they were Wiccan but but it was very Wicken based it was very a lot of the structures were what I would consider kind of Wiccan but they're basic magical structures so we would fall back on a tried andr structure in this community we always cast a circle we always called air for East fire for South water for West and Earth for North then we would call in a God and a goddess we would call in Duality then we would talk something about the season we would have everybody shout something relative to the season or we' do a Passion Play to show people the meaning of the Season we would have someone just do a speech to tell you about the season energy raising part would come next sometimes uh we we've done like a chance and drumming singing We do maybe some type of spiral dance or scarf dance to get people moving to raise that energy warning about the spiral dance make sure that you don't have two left feet because you could fall yeah exactly make sure you have a good leader and a good Ender right that stuff gets confusing man it does it does but even if it doesn't go well you can still use it to raise energy so you'd raise the energy then you would need someone to direct that energy to a purpose then we'd ground the energy and close everything up that was the basic ritual format if you had that and you could get some volunteers then all you needed to know was some correspondences for the season and the story of the Season like what's the meaning behind the holiday now that's all fun and good when you have a group what if I am a lone person with no tribe you know we have a lot of listeners that don't have the opportunity to have a group of people and they are all by the lonesomes thinking what the hell do I do for litha cuz it's just me and I don't believe in my abilities to that I say fooy but if you are a singular person who does not have a group to celebrate with you know you can kind of kind of embody some of those same Concepts I mean obviously you're not going to be able to have a big huge chanting and drumming Circle but you by all means Can chant um if you have a drum use it didn't we at one ritual have someone like beaten on the bottom of a coffee can like if you don't have a drum make do with what you got a lot of these Concepts I think you can still kind of utilize as a singular person trying to celebrate or do a ritual you don't have to have a group of people or a tribe to be able to celebrate it's not like well I don't have anybody to do ritual with so I might as well not fooy to that yep and the other good thing about the structure that we had was that it makes the magic easier to flow and the way that you can do that by yourself or one or two other people is have things that you always do when you're doing a ritual you don't have to have that full structure like we did in our community but now for shell and I doing those things immediately puts us into a magical mindset you cast Circle I can feel that energy move because I'm so used to it right so do things that you're used to find a couple different rituals like maybe you always sit down and spread an alter cloth and lay out your tools you know do it the same way every time on the holidays and that becomes magical in and of itself your brain your body will start to immediately align to that magical self as soon as you do these ritual things so do the full ritual like we did in our community or find your own ritual things to make your magic yours and that's how you can do it yourself every single time especially if you create habits and create magical rituals around the holidays that will serve you really well to be able to raise that magic more easily at the next holiday now one little crafty thing that this is a good time of year to do suncatchers suncatchers are so cute back in the80s remember you could get those things and like they had these little like they were like beads and you'd like put them in them in the oven yeah you put them in the metal frame melt them in the oven I used to love those things so much but one idea I had seen was to take those little clear Stones I think you can get them for like fish tanks or something they have a flat bottom and they're rounded on the other side and glue them into a metal frame like hot glue them together into a metal frame and make a pretty Sun catcher out of that kind of I don't want to say harness that sun energy but yeah you know uh harness it right into your space and they're really easy to make they're super cute you really can't mess up a Suncatcher no matter how you do it I don't know you give me a hot glue gun I can mess up well I've also seen people kind of do it more like a dream catcher and in making a dream catcher kind of weaving in either little stones or little beads to kind of reflect that sun within the sun uh within the dream catcher so there are a lot of cute little crafts you can do you know like making the lavender stars or or making flower crowns or things of that nature all fun stuff that you can do but big fan of Sun Catchers this time of year the idea is that the sun is at the height of its power so we really want to honor that energy that lifegiving Force that's bringing all this abundance in our lives so any seeds that you planted physically or magically back in the earlier part of the wheel of the year should be sprouting yeah now is the time to check in with those are they growing well have you had some of your first fruits from this you know are you starting to see where it's going and kind of assess that magically maybe part of your ritual can be redirecting that energy that growth that abundance energy towards what you want or are those seeds withering and do you need to put more care and attention into them do you need to be more focused be more cognizant of your magic y so Shell's idea of gluing these clear Stones together these clear glass stones or crystals anything that catches the sunlight like that you can charge them those little flat glass beads are great to charge solar energy into and put that on your altar if you're creating something like when I created the lavender star I used not magic I used the colors of the season I have yellow ribbon that I use to represent the sun you can use yellow green light blue orange anything that says sun in summertime to you so as I was bundling these lavender stems up each knot I would State an intention and I would put my energy into that knot so as this star dries it has that energy and it kind of infuses the area in my space with the energy that I put into it that's a very simple spell and herbs this time of you're collecting herbs eating some of the the herbs or the vegetables from your garden or go to a farmers market or something and get fresh herbs that are full of solar energy obviously they have sucked in all the Sun that they can get so that's a great way to get that sun's energy as well infusions um I've seen some really good recipes for oil infusions that are super easy that will give you again the solar energy tea we just talked about sun tea not too long ago set your tea outside Shell's got all sorts of cool tea Blends that you can put into a sun tea mixture it's just like doing Moon water but you're doing solar water with your herbs in it and then you're going to drink it and bring that energy directly into you so do you have any recipes for us shelf I'm going to throw this this is this is actually our special blend the Busom calling back on the broomstick blend so yummy right it actually makes a fabulous sun tea it is got Mullen and clove and orange peel and rose hips with black tea in it put them in either a a loose leaf tea bag or if you have a strainer and let that sit out in the sun for a few hours and then strain out the herbs delish delicious this is definitely one to add a little bit of lemon and a little bit of Honey into not just because I love it but also because it's allergy season and citrus fruits are wonderful representations of solar energy and so is honey honey is a fabulous representation I think I posted not too long ago a lavender honey infusion which is a wonderful thing to do around the summer solstice so that you can again have that litha energy that abundance what better to do than Infuse an oil with some of your herbs or Infuse some lavender honey and then put a drop or two of that in your money bowl or in your abundant spell jar it's just so good for bringing that solar powerful energy into your spell workking another way you can use citrus fruits um as part of your altar or ritual space is when you are doing any sort of ritual for litha or the solstice you can hollow out a little bit of an orange put your candle in that put a white candle in it and use it as your candle holder I love those for whatever reason it just seems to make that Citrus smell everything oh my gosh I love that so much so that's that's another cute idea but this is also and I know you know this and you said that when we were doing the passion plays you talked about portraying Queen Mab litha is said to be the night when fairies will be more abundant coming out into I don't want to say into the open but into the open for lack of a better way to say it and play tricks on humans the fairies do uh see it as a battle of light and dark so they do kind of get more mischievous one of my favorite movies and I can't remember what year this came out it had to be 1990 something A Midsummer Nights Dream ah yes the uh William shakespare play yeah like Kevin Klein stared it like I said it had to be early 90s but that movie almost is like the embodiment of litha to me I don't know why but it it it from the fairy aspect um from all of it the the lushness of it the the fireflies and the fairies and the sex and the wood woods and the romance and it's just a lush kind of like that dreamy summer night because I mean all the times we went camping for ritual for litha that's kind of what it reminds me of a dreamy summer night just like when we were talking about coming into these lias these lost holidays that really embodies litha to me the long grass the fireflies the laughter heard in the darkness next to a campfire falling asleep to crickets falling asleep of crickets with the creek babbling right next to you you know drumming off in the distance that kind of soft summer warm abundance is really litha that's litha if all we did was get together have a feast have a little fire and hang out and camp in the woods that would be litha that would have been ritual enough yeah that's magic enough so if you just are able to have a barbecue with with your besties with your family with anybody that is a beautiful way to celebrate litha how about tarot cards do you have any tarot things that you like to do in the summertime you know lately I've been doing like a one or a three card pull every night not as a divinatory thing although it sometimes it ends up that way it's more of a a meditation like an exercise of me with the cards why don't I do two cards it's always one or three what's up with that it's you're weird yeah I guess so but I'm thinking about I kind of want to change it up I don't know if it's because of the season or or what but I'm feeling like I want to do something a little different I might want to start doing very small layouts like like not just one or three cards but like a small spread like a small spread yeah yeah and do something like that instead do you have any small spreads that you like that you could recommend actually you want to be outside and you want to be enjoying the energy of the Sun so I would tend to do spreads more not at this time of year just keep it to the one like not even the three just do the one card and just go one to three three card spread limit at this time of year okay so you're saying to keep the card PLL simple and get outside and enjoy the season I I get it I totally agree so if you don't particularly like doing a full spread this time of year what about choosing a card deliberately and with intention something that represents the season like if you're going to save time and just pull one card to meditate on which card would you use what would you pick for lith or the summer solce and and you can't say the sun card because that's way too obvious but you know if you if you like darker Decks that doesn't mean you can't utilize those darker decks during this time of year you know your sun card might be morbid as hell but that's okay that is okay let's see other cards I would probably like the empress that would be a good card for now fertility abundance you know it's the like the pregnant goddess she looks like sometimes I think the world is always good for sabbaths in holidays um the world is relevant in my opinion on all eight sabbaths so that's kind of a good card to meditate with uh no matter if it's litha or or what I would say I like the cups the suit of cups for this time of year because it is kind of that lovey emotional yeah taking it all in absorbing I like the nine of cups for this because it's it's not quite that full abundance of you know family and everything but it's getting there and it's kind of like wishes come true maybe it should be a four card spread instead o talk to me tell me about the four because of the Cross quarter thing so if you look at the cross quarter thing almost like an X there's four spots so you're saying take the like the solstices and the equinoxes as each part of this circle and so you're saying that because there's four of those place four cards because we're in one of them we're in a correct see folks this is how spreads get born so what what is each card representative of that of that notch on the wheel of the winter solstice summer solstice spring equinox fall equinox so if you're if you're here if you're here at litha then you would go back and say what seeds did I plant at the Equinox where am I at with them now what do I need to do to get to the next Equinox to then come to fulfillment at the next Solstice do you see what I'm saying I like it I love it like a round robin thing like what have I done where am I at what is my next steps and then what do I have to do to complete you know what I'm saying I do and I'm going to say at a fifth card in the center that's the U that's the where am I at like right this second or who Am I who am I in this wheel like a significator card like a significator but let it be random so let that card be random either place that card first and then place the other four or place that card last or what I've also done if I'm Shuffling and one card like jumps out of the deck then that usually will be my significator that the significator so don't don't have it be a significator you choose ahead of time let the cards decide what your significator is going to be and that will be who do you need to be to get through this cycle because if you look at it based on the calendar year it would be that whole you know what are the seeds I planted at ostara versus where am I at at litha where am I going to be at mbin and then how do I cap it all off at Ule I love this so it's the Five Card Five Card solar spread Five Card quarters of the Year spread I don't know we'll work we'll think about that we we'll work on it yeah we'll have to work on that but I I like that idea though kind of to to hit those solstices and equinoxes as touching points on where you're at with with the seeds you planted well there you go I'm going to stick with one card for my nightly tarot journaling but for litha I'm going to do a five card spread I love it I love it a lot actually I'm GNA do it I'll I'll post a picture you can somehow some way you can put tarot into everything I know I it's such a versatile tool it really is so good where there's a will there's a way there's a Tarot spread right if not we'll come up with one we'll make one up if there isn't already and that's what you can do with your rituals you know the correspondences you know what says summer to you think back when summer stretched out ahead of you with nothing to do but play and have a wonderful time think of that energy that you know the the grasshopper and the Ant story where the Grasshoppers all singing and playing and having a wonderful time you're that guy be that guy just eat all the good foods and and celebrate abundance and happiness celebrate going out and doing all these fabulous things and and just feeling the sun on your skin you know whatever says that to you put that in your ritual put that in how you want to celebrate the season but I like that we we kind of C talked this out and came up with this um while while we were recording because a it gives people a little insight into how we come up with this and and B it it's a proven point to you that you can come up with stuff on the Fly and it's okay and if it works for you who gives a what is in a book you read this is a classic example of Lea and I taking two minutes talking something out and the next thing you know we've come up with something fabulous you too can do the same thing so it's not about necessarily what you're seeing online and stuff it's what feels right to you what energies in what direction do you want to go with and work with at that particular time you know get get the the basics down about the solstice and litha you know sun energy and you know kind of that Changing of the Guard thing and then mold it into what works for you and what's meaningful for you and I'm going to take that one step further and say not only what's meaningful to you but what fits in the area that you're in true like right now I'm living in North Central PA and I'm surrounded by farms and lushness and life and pollen and poll pollen so I'm celebrating the abundance of farm stands and food and getting my toes in the dirt and harvesting lavender out of my garden looks different for Shell Shell is on the coast she's by the ocean the weather can change in a heartbeat she's in the middle of downtown Salem right it's so it's hot sidewalks and being in the city but it's also being at the beach in the breeze and with the water that looks different from where I'm at when I lived in Southern California it was brown and it was sand and it was the glory of Joshua tree and the amazingness of life in this heat so celebrate summer how it looks where you're at right and you can feel that better by connecting with the land and the the energies around you that scream summer where you're living and okay if you're a transplant you know you're in the desert in Southern California you're missing the green of your homeland of Upstate New York you can go in a little space that maybe has a lot more Greenery in it and celebrate that way to get yourself in the magical space but if you can connect with your local area that's going to take your magic to the next level and it's going to make you feel that much more connected to it absolutely so get connected with your local area get connected with yourself make yourself some tea go to a farmers market celebrate abundance Camp if you can we need to go camping shell we do I miss it so much T the season is the season I'm looking forward to it so we are going to actually be at a few different things we will be in New York City July 6th for witches York City yeah for witches Fest USA we are both presenting there which is going to be a great time check them out online I am going to be at Brushwood folklore Center for both their San Kofa and serus Rising festivals doing pre
