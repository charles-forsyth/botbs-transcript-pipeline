welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick thank you for joining us I'm Leila and I'm shell today we're going to be talking about a topic that we have had a lot of emails on in a lot of comments people are always looking for Community looking for covin looking for other pagans in real time in real life and the difficulties we've all kind of had finding that Community we've even talked about how both you and I are trying to go or actually you're more successful than I am at this point but trying to find that community in a new location in our other podcast I think I talked a little bit more about my search when I had moved here to New York looking for people and how excited I was when I saw a coffee time coming up for a coven called circle of the green that sounded amazing and my absolute Joy when I met them and it worked out it was fabulous this is a coven that has been established in the Rochester area for over 20 years and has been very successful has worked with other groups in the community so today we are lucky enough to speak to my high priestesses we have Wendy and Kelly from circle of the green so ladies if you would please introduce yourselves absolutely it's nice to be here thank you for the invitation my name is Kelly and I am the high priestess and co-founder of Circle of the green thank you for being here thank you again this is very exciting to come on here um my name is Wendy I am the co- High Priestess of Circle of the green and I have been involved with the group for over 18 years welcome to both of you and and I am so excited about this because Lea and I have been kind of talking about this in and out in almost every episode lately we've both had a struggle and Leela's further along in the process than I am but I'm excited that there are people who want to still have physical covens do ritual and magic in person and have that connection because having done it both ways years of solitary work years of coven work there is something to be said with making magic with a group of people absolutely and I I think the last few years with everything kind of having a trend of going online and doing things less in person has been a good way to expand your group and to meet lots of people and learn lots of things but we all still kind of crave that personal connection everyone's still craving that in touch community and I hear that repeated everyone's looking for something but if you ladies wouldn't mind maybe tell us a little bit about how you started or why you started circle of the green and a little bit about the coven sure absolutely so years ago way back in the late 90s I had discovered this path and back then if you're old enough to remember the internet was not what it was like it is today so it took a lot of searching a lot of going into metaphysical shops asking questions hoping for an opportunity to meet with like my people I take some classes at our local metaphysical shop I met some folks who at the time would have been considered Elders in the community and they were open to allowing myself and the co-founder of the group to meet with them on a regular basis and I don't want to say train but learned from them um and practice with them and they were very welcoming very welcoming um but at one point you know we'd be meeting with these folks and we're like you know this is wonderful and I'm so glad I'm at this person I've learned so much but this this didn't quite feel right so after having those experiences and starting to really see what you know what a group could be like we were all talking and we we said you know why why are we searching for a group you know we haven't quite found the right fit why don't we just make our own group and we sat down and we wrote the bylaws and we had um really put the format of what we wanted to see we came up with the the name green because it meant so much to us you know of the heart onata it meant you know the green of the forest things like that um it had so much meaning so um that's really where circle of the green came about so we had some amazing people who really helped us on the journey helped us learn like what a coving could be helped us learn just about you know the craft and and our where we wanted to go but at one point we decided you know what the only way we're truly going to find what we're looking for is to create it and we did 20 years ago that is so so much a mirror image of M and Leo's story it truly is the whole hey all of our friends were doing Moon rituals and one day Lea and I were like hey why don't we just take all of our friends create a coven and off we went yeah took a bunch of soli and and decided to we wanted things to be slightly different like you said they we found wonderful people to work with to learn from to to worship with but it it wasn't exactly what we were looking for and so that was the nice thing about being able to start our own coven and and I think that for us we had several years of of really high highs and some low lows but you know teaching and going to you know festivals and doing workshops and you know it was it was a lot of work there was a lot of work there and and I don't know about your guys's experience but for us we would have coven meetings and they would be hours of work going over bylaws going over lesson plans going over you know every little detail and it you know to be honest I I get giddy every time I say my high priestesses because I adore you guys but also because it's not me because I it's a lot of work to run a coven you know there's there's a lot that goes into it it it's definitely a labor of love it has to be to have done it for this long I am equally excited to kind of take that step back and go from high priestess back to initiate the there's there's no pressure right well you know it's funny I agree with you and when we first started it was tough right we did every Festival we closed every Pagan Pride day around we did classes um we would there was Anya wika at the time which was North East Council of witch witches we would go to those meetings um and it it is it's like another job right but there was also magic in the moments because the first time you start practicing as a c and you're like oh my God the energy it's so different different right and it was so strong and the consistency of it so yeah definitely definitely difficult more difficult than we anticipated but then also definitely the magic was there which was incredible but I will say um as we've gone over the years I think the reason we've made it 20 years and money can certainly give her input as well is we learn to relax and not be so have to have this be this way because quite frankly that that didn't work for people in our group like we are a bit more relaxed it's a more of a this is our lives it's not just um putting together a group it's it's living it every day and really becoming a family so we we used to do our meetings where everyone must be here we' get together on a Sunday morning and we're going to go through this list of things that we need to accomplish we still accom ACC Lish things and you know sometimes we'll do it through Zoom call um but we've relaxed a lot and the other component to that too is our circle is a bit different we don't view hierarchy as a lot of other covens would so yes Wendy and I are the co- high priestesses but that's because there does have to be a leader if there's no leadership at all nothing will ever get done oh especially not in a pagan group because we'll all go off on our own directions absolutely yeah there has to be a leader but but truly the way we work we view everyone as a priestess and everyone has that power and that magic within them and when there are important decisions to be made like when Lea we wanted to talk about having you join our coven it wasn't just Wendy and I having that conversation when you met with us that first day you noticed the whole Stone Circle our Inner Circle came to meet you they all were invested they all wanted to see who are these people who are interested and they all have an opinion opinion we value and we we listen we value and we take it into consideration as a group so it is a little different I think than some other groups yes and I'd like to say too that yes we we have relaxed but part of that is that we've that many ways I think we've evolved right so when you we consider ourselves a learning circle and and when we were first doing that learning it was a very traditional curriculum like you might go to class and then the the more that we grew in our craft the more that we grew as teachers and the more more you know we had families we realized that teaching can can take a lot of different forms and it's a lot more organic on how it's done now uh the way that we teach in the group is similar to how I raised my children in this Faith uh you learn by doing you learn by going you learn by explaining in those meaningful moments so you know we've relaxed because that's how you have to manage life is to just kind of you know ride with the waves um but we haven't lost anything because of that transition absolutely it's a great point and I love that again it it sounds so much like what we had Lea was cirra I mean right down to being a teaching coven we had this this idea of okay very much structure but you know my house at the time was coven Central I had two very very small children so everybody met at my house so I could put my kids to bed and then coven time and we had to be relaxed because I might have a two-year-old run out in the middle of a heated coven discussion and you know rigidness hurts that family environment I think and that is why you know I I understand like especially traditional covs that work that traditionalism does work for people but someone like me I kind of need that relaxed because of the rest of my life and Sh that's exactly where were we were at we had young families we we started we didn't have children Wendy did have her child but the rest of our group we we were just getting married we were still some of us were single they're still single folks too but you know we were just our lives were evolving so our coven needed to evolve to stay up with that and we everyone became family just because you know you have a new baby and you can't come out for a while we weren't going to be like no you're out you can't come back back no we relaxed come when you can you know you're always welcome and you can't make it we understand and I think that's really grew trust and that grew the relationships and ultimately I think that's what helps to sustain us over 20 years I I think that's a huge part of why because I know a big part of why amarat broke up was I mean people more people had families some of the people that were with us that had been college students moved away joined other coven shell you went through a divorce and so coven Central became a difficult place and you know a lot of things happened and life got in the way but the way you guys did it you Incorporated that right into your circle and and allowed your whole lives to stay in that space in that magical space and just kind of incorporate it all in whereas I think for shell and I after omarro broke up and we all kind of went our separate ways and got a little less magical which is why now we're kind of coming back into it after a few years away for whatever reason it's been very very hard to find people in real life to connect with it almost feels harder than the late 90s honestly harder to find a group than how hard it was in the 90s truly I can understand that I think there were a few we you know we we would do open portals every year maybe a couple times a year to to allow for new members if folks were interested um because we did recognize that I mean just why we started Circle the green people are searching people need a safe place but I will say during the covid the P the couple of years there where covid was scary you know even we weren't doing open portals anymore and we had to bring our Circle virtual for us that was difficult we were not virtual people so we had to become virtual people and figure it out which I think we did a really good job at um but then you know after a couple years we had to get back together and say you know what there are people searching and you know we're at a place where we feel comfortable again opening the doors and that's when we put out our our first portal since before covid you know I have to say that it I think it would be a lot harder now and and I I give you to a lot of credit because I would hate to try to find a new uh community at this stage and it's not at the stage in my life for me it's more about the stage of the internet so I remember again back in the you know the the late 90s or whatever it was you had you had one website you could go to witch Fox that's where you went for everything right right you needed to read you could see everything listed there not everything had all the um you know you you do a search for it now and you're going to get thousands of results which makes it very challenging to know if you're talking with people that are real or people who are not and you had some of those concerns back then too right I mean I went to a few that were a little bit dicey and you had to be concerned about some safety but for the most part it wasn't so inundated you were more likely to make those connections it would be very overwhelming right now with just as much that's out there and you know I I don't know if um Leila had told you this prior but three years ago I moved to which city USA not because of that but here I am and I am having a harder time here than I did in rural Upstate New York and it's shocking but part of it for me being new to this town new to the state I need to make friends and to find a coven you know I went to a local store and I inquired and I was told if you're not from here you're not going to be welcomed anywhere and like I was hurt I feel like I would be an asset to a coven finally Believe It or Not Leila found a group for me to inquire with and I am actually in process of scheduling a Mee you know kind of a meeting a coffee date type thing to see if I can get into a Celtic Welsh tradition coven but I've been here three years and it took Leila to find my first lead how ridiculous in which city USA I can't if you would have told me a 1998 that in 2023 I would be in Salem struggling to find people to do magic with I would laughed at you but here I am you know and it's interesting because you know yes there's a level of of secrecy for this and not everybody is going to be open to others and I completely Embrace and acknowledge and understand that but there is a a different level of gatekeeping now that necessarily didn't exist you know 20 years ago that that we shouldn't be elitist about what it is we're doing we should be cautious but there is a difference yeah yeah and I think that in the last 10 years everything has been turned into a scam you don't know now if the person on Tik Tok or Instagram or Facebook you don't know if they're scamming you or if they're a well-intended real person Wendy that that's something that I have heard quite a bit is people are finding covin online covin that very rapidly become just SES pools of yeah for all sorts of different reasons but people are finding these online coven very easily but it's not really what they're looking for or or it's just a group of people who are also searching who are trying to do something together which is fine you know there's something to be said for people learning and seeking together you know that is one of the reasons too why you saw our coffee invite that we put out is that we would see that brought us back to reality going okay CO's over we would see in those groups because we're in them too right watching and we would see people asking about groups and a lot of times they're Upstate New York not necessarily Rochester but we would put it out if you're interested reach out to me some people do some people don't but that's why we we put that that um open portal out on the internet to see if there was interest in the Rochester area and you know we did get some folks and we had really great folks and we had really great conversation and circle the greens grown a bit one of the things too I know we talked about previously um before the internet before the co well not really before the interet internet but before Co days where everything became online um there was always that kind of fear of is this group good is this group okay and we had talked a bit where some of us in the local community some of the bigger covens that we knew and we trusted put together a group circle of the tribes to be that place that Source where people could come to and say hey I'm interested in a group and maybe Circle the green wasn't the right fit but maybe you know one of the other coven were so we that's been going on a long time even before the internet you know making sure you can find a safe place and somewhere to go so that was something we did to try to build community unfortunately with covid and everyone pulling back you know that has definitely impacted that we used to get together every three years do one giant Community ritual you know and bring all the folks together but unfortunately Co definitely impacted that see one thing I've dealt with here is there are a couple groups that do advertise but one of them for example um they are kind of vampire based very open and very willing to to meet new people but for me vampire magic is not my thing I applaud them for giving out the open invitation to the public and trying to to build their group but it's not for me I needed to find something more along my lines and then don't get me started on the pay to participate I understand chipping in for supplies and things of that nature but I have a big problem with you only open up to the public for profit so it really is part of who's out there and willing versus what's a good fit and goddess bless Leila she found the perfect fit for me I hope so I'm really looking forward to your tea here because I'm very excited the coven sounds great The High Priestess sounds wonderful and I'm very excited for you because I know it's been a couple years of looking I I've done a couple uh tarot reads on the subject and I think I'm in a going in a good direction nice now this whole topic of community was a topic that we talked about quite a bit at the the festivals that I was at recently and interestingly enough it seemed like every third person that I met was from Rochester and they're all here getting their Pagan witchy freak on and where are they here at home you know why aren you all getting together there right right I I think there is a a distinct lack of not just covens and I mean God's bless you guys because I love that you're here and have been here but there is a lack of of covens and there's also a lack of Pagan communities like the circle of the tribes that you mentioned and the Pagan community that we had in the Southern Tier of New York shell which was um that was every High holiday as you know that was the whole wheel of the year as opposed to once every three years and that was a fabulous way for solitar to find a group and to work with different people in network to maybe try to get into a group and it it gave you a chance to see the type of ritual that they would put on because different groups or individuals would pick the the holiday and and be in charge of it for that festival and and so you could see what they were like and be like oh well you know this Norse group really sounds like my bag and so you would talk to them or you know these this very eclectic group is more what I Vibe with and so that was a fabulous way for people to really intermingle and and become you know traditions and groups and circles and that group has even gone you know they did get together for beltin recently but that was the first time in fiveish years that they'd gotten together that's a point I do want to I want to make all of this wasn't because of the pandemic no this started before the pandemic so it's not that the pandemic made people afraid to be around others this was starting long before that yeah I do agree with you pandemic I think exasperated it but yeah I do agree with you locally in Rochester we started to see um a lot of the local shops the shops were Community too right these metaphysical shops that open the doors we used to be there volunteering we would do a couple rituals a year other covin would come in and they would all we it was funny we'd meet at psychic's time and the owner of psychic's time would be like all right who's gonna do this one Circ Reigns got that who's gonna do this one C tago show's got that we used to split out the year and all the different groups would contribute we would do this on our own we we you know have workings bring cakes and now all that great stuff and invite the community so that people did get a taste to see if maybe one of the groups was a good fit but also for those solitary folks who maybe don't want to don't want a group but they just want to get together once in a while yeah let me ask you this why did that group stop doing that it was actually the shops and they Unfortunately they just could not afford to stay open any longer they they went under they had to shut their doors and that's another thing so it's really scary and I can't speak to every local Rochester shop but a lot of those shops that used to be these places where we would meet where we' have Community where people would go and ask those questions over the years even before covid slowly one by one we started to see them shut their doors and there really isn't we don't have these um places anymore that we used to have where we'd have these meetings these community and these gatherings there are a few metaphysical shops but it's not the same as it used to be it's very different so one thing we did talk about and I know Lea was part of that conversation we had an idea where circle of the green we are celebrating 20 years we actually it was last oara but we're looking to have a gathering where we invite folks from other covens in which we've you know we've been with Through The Years um to celebrate our 20 year anniversary but we also wanted to utilize that as a kickoff of starting to bring people back together and see if other people might want to take the next event you know if you can get that spark going exactly I love it I love it me well you know part of it is you know where we are we're noce the the city of festivals I mean you can't go really a day or two in the summertime and not have a festival going on so it yes it's jazz festival right now and then Fringe Festival and we have you're not and I have friends participating in fren Festival right it's exciting and we've got l i mean there's just so many and they're used to be more right um again prior to covid right we got the before years um we have East St Festival we would have all of these different things and it's of all the places we could support something like that here but it's a lot of work right so I mean we do talk about how it's uh it's nice to get together it's nice to do these things but there's a lot of logistical aspects of that a lot of people who are active in the community also have families and full-time jobs and it just it can be it can be a challenge right if not everybody kind of steps up to help make it happen it's one of the things that's just not going to happen yeah we totally relate to that I mean there's only so many hours in a day yeah that's why we were thinking of the that is 100% valid we're in the same boat it's everyone's like what happened to Rochester Pagan Pride you know why don't you guys take it why doesn't somebody take it because it's a lot of work and there's fund fundraising it's an OP for profit but that's why we're hoping with the idea of all right let's kick it off of the ritual a ritual just a ritual it's not as difficult it's just get together and do one ritual we can do it in a local park or if someone wants to do at their house it's certainly okay but that's why we're hoping we can start that spark again just by a ritual it's not a commitment random question how welcoming is Rochester as a whole to pagans witches like if you were to go and do say a 50 person ritual in a park are you getting ridicu are you having protesters how accepted are the pagans and witches in Rochester you know it's a go ahead Kelly oh I was just going to say with Pagan pride and the you know the all of the um marketing the promotion of it there's a lot of awareness so we would get protesters and get protesters they were it was they were not very nice but they never really got physical from my understanding I've never seen you know but they have signs and everything else you know up there um but there was also a lot of promotion doing rituals we're not promoting it in that same capacity it's more of a you know almost old school you know we're doing this ritual maybe post it within the Pagan groups but it's not going to be so public so I don't think we'd get protesters from there not for that no that sounds very much like the Pagan community in the Southern Tier that we were part of it was invite only I I wanted to to just quick ask um do you guys feel that your coven is something that you can continue to sustain in the environment that we are currently in I do the reason why is our coven is like I said it's become family it is more than just a group you know we um we are our own Community within it right um I can't and it's our lifestyle I I don't see it going anywhere the people and we have layers of commitment we have our Outer Circle folks who you know can come and go as they please you know we you're welcome and you know um they're welcome to join celebrate with us then we have our Inner Circle or we call the Stone Circle um and those folks are the folks that basically said this is it we're lifers we're together we're family your core inner Rock Solid group we're not going anywhere so we love each other we care about each other we care about each other's families um we're not going anywhere is there competition with covin there um I mean I think there's certainly there's a you know one of our great friends as a coven that started one year after us so that's always kind of like well we got you beat by a year but um you know I don't we don't really engage in that kind of talk I think think what we we've done and what we look for is and with Rony you had mentioned another High Priestess of another organization um you know and other folks too throughout the Pagan Community what we've tried to do is really just come together right like if I find someone someone comes to me honestly we had someone did come to us we are a group that's very family focused we have children um sometimes those kids are going to run around and they're going to be in and out and we're very open to that and open into their energy but there are some folks that just want to practice in an adult coven someone had come to me recently and they were looking for an adult coven so I was I you know geared them in the right direction of where they might want to go um obviously we're not a great fit um and they do the same other folks will do the same I just met with a woman who is in Wendy too we met with her a couple weeks ago who she was directed to us from another local coven you know they had listened to her what she was looking for they said you know what we think circle of the green would be a great f for you so they directed her in our Direction so we we try to work together with the folks that we know um to help find the right fit the right people for the right groups and hopefully provide a safe place so I actually don't feel that competitive I don't personally feel that competitive like um feeling amongst the groups I totally agree and I think one of the reasons for that is we're not trying to become a mega church right we would rather have two or three or four really good fits than the vast number of people and a lot of the other leaders in the community feel the same way so it it it helps us grow the way that we need to quality not quantity exactly but Wendy I I wanted to ask you something so here I am I'm getting ready to have a coffee meet here in the next week or so I am going in much like Lila did kind of the quote unquote 30-year veteran what should someone like me and I know I'm not meeting and greeting with with your group particularly but in general what should someone like me expect out of this because I have a little anxiety because I feel like I was 19 when I was on this side of the coin and I don't want to say I'm scared I mean I'm not scared but I I I I'm a little apprehensive like what should I expect from a coven like yours and I'm sure our listeners would like to know too when you say let's set up a coffee meet and see like what should I expect what what are we talking about what are we doing like give me a little info about that Wendy yeah so I mean if you were meeting with us right it would literally be first let's pick out our coffee and our snacks because we're not going to do any of this without our solid foundation of caffeine and sugar okay because we are real and we are humans and this is our life and Kelly and I and everybody else in the group we don't have anything to prove to anybody else so you're not going to get a lot of that hierarchal type of thing that that you're gonna normally I don't want it to feel like a job interview is that what meeting coven is nowadays that's what I'm looking to find out wasn't with them it was not yeah it's it's not with us because what we look for and I can't and I can't see obviously what everybody is going to look for but I will say if it's somebody who's worth giving their energy to they better be somebody who's willing to share their energy with you first to see if it's going to be a fit and you will know almost right away if that's true like you you'll find out relatively quickly if you're going to Jive um so you know for us it's having the conversations about here's a little our history here's a little bit about us it's a very organic conversation similar to what we're having here so you don't really have like a list of questions that you show up with and like you're checking them off as you go now for us it's like the generic what made you interested to come here right just that's probably the closest to the job interview that I care about is I want to know your interest I want to know what you want to get out of a group and that'll help us decide if this is going to be a good fit right because if if they want somebody who wants to come over every Sunday and study for six hours love that energy that's not us um but if you want to have real conversations where you can learn in an organic nature and while making homemade Play-Doh while making homemade Playdoh and slime before it was cool we're probably the people for you so my suggestion to you is and I'm sure you already know this but go in being your authentic self because if you're not you can't do this work with others if you can't be right it's not just about them interviewing you this is your opportunity to ask your questions to make sure they're the right fit for you too that's how we we want to hear from them as much as you know um we want to learn about them we want to tell them about us and we want to make sure like they would feel comfortable like this is who we are I feel like I'm going on a date and I love that you said that it's an interview on both sides because it really really is I think one thing for our listeners you know we do have a lot of of baby witches um out there a lot of a lot of new folks to to Witchcraft and paganism and you you want to make sure that when you are going and chatting with new people and and trying to find your fit remember it's not just the energy and it's not just the personality you really are I don't want to say looking for new best friends but these types of groups they are families they become families they become best friends I mean all of circle omra all this started because Leila and I met playing Spades in the College cafeteria and I was like hey you're into witcraft you're into Witchcraft and the next thing you know let's do a moon ritual let's do spells you know and it really is almost like finding a new group of friends not just a magical group but a new group of friends and if you're not looking at it that way maybe you're not a good fit because these environments they become your family they become your best friends and the most important thing is that you are getting that kind of best friend Connection not just yeah I can hang out with these people do a moon one once a month you have to be invested in the relationship with these people not just the magic agreed I wanted to ask if uh either of you Wendy or Kelly um or even shell if you've heard of something called The Seekers Bill of Rights no this is something that I've only recently found and I kind of love it um I do recommend anyone that's looking for a coven kind of look into it this was written by Charles Mars uh to protect and educate those seeking a pagan path and it's basically things like you have the right when you're looking for a coven or a group to work with to verify their credentials you have the right to anonymity Financial stability the right to sexual Freedom the right to physical well-being you know different things like that because you should consider these things when you ask to join a COV whether it's virtual or in real life you should be paying attention to what do they stand for and and who are they what kind of magic do they practice if you're not in Sex Magic don't get in a sex magic coming that's a very that's a very good point but um so I guess with the Seekers Bill of Rights you know you guys were very good about having the in-person um Meetup and and having the questionnaire but is there anything else that you would recommend to people seeking a group what I have done um before I have my tea meet because oh my God she wanted to have a team meet and I was like this is perfect I hate coffee I love tea meant to be I looked up their group I looked up their tradition as much as I'm into the whole Celtic gay like Welsh thing I had never actually heard of their specific tradition I looked them up I researched them do your research people we all got phones we all got computers we all got Google I feel like I did my due diligence by looking into them just as much as they're going to look into me so I'm not going to my meet and greet kind of blind I know a good amount of information about them going into it so research do your research yeah so I would say you know if if you're somebody who who is comfortable in the in the path and have been doing it for a while um make sure that you have those questions about what resonates with you to see if that resonates with others but if you're new to the path and you don't know what those uh questions even are because we've worked with people who are brand new and they just know that they've got a a poll and a drawing and they don't know that be honest about that too because you're not necessarily going to be able to to learn otherwise but if you're honest about it you can kind of vet out if this is a group that's going to be willing to teach you to embrace you and to Mentor you or if it's got a little bit more of a sand offish feel so kind of know what you're looking for even if you're new on what it is that you would like your community to look like and then ask those questions when you're when you're meeting as well as as well as what you're drawn to um you know like I said there's an open group here in Salem uh that practice vampire magic I didn't reach out because that ain't my thing you know kind of also keep in mind what you're drawn to see I agree with that too sh um we do we do have a website so people can learn about our group another important thing I I believe something that's helpful is understanding what that tradition is and and seeing how those people practice so Leela you are you may remember when met with you that was great we connected we're like yes we definitely feel connection here we loved your story it was very similar to our story but the next thing we did is invited you to a ritual we wanted you to come you know spend some time with us be in circle with us make sure that magic see if that feel yep I didn't immediately add her to our Facebook group or anything like that because I didn't want her to be uncomfortable if she joined us and came and then said wait a minute this is not for me but if the group is willing to let you come to an open I would definitely recommend that so you can spend some time with them feel their energy see if it it's a good fit for you before you make that commitment that you Circle yes and conversely if anyone asks you to sign something to lock you down right away before you get a chance to do that that's a red flag yeah run I see lots of yeah we're all saying run that's a big red flag nobody should ask you to do something that's uncomfortable or should ask you to sign your life away right away no signing your life away giving blood or anything like that right yeah they shouldn't ask you to break the law you shouldn't have to have sex with anyone you shouldn't have to do anything like that you should just be able to get to know them and go at your own pace and my biggest pet peeve you shouldn't have to pay a big fee thank you yes like you said earlier shell putting in a little money towards administrative cost there's always porta potties there's food there's candles you have to buy having a little one thing yeah but financially supporting someone or big donations another red flag yeah I will say what we've always done is you know when everyone's here in circle Wendy notice up we're low on candles because I have the covenstead here at my house so she'll grab candles or I might know we're going to need something for ritual so we've always made it into a group effort yeah and I think I saw on something about a small donation and I brought money that first time and you told me no I gave you money and you're like no just hold on to that it's no problem so that was really nice I thought that was pretty cool and definitely a green flag I thought we will never say no to snacks though so you're always welcome to bring the cookies or the cupcakes or uh you know the drink that we will never turn away when you come over I do have to say you guys have always liked my snacks I pride myself on bringing good treats so now for folks that are in um Mid to Northern New York in the rochest Buffalo area when is the next time they could have an opportunity to come to an open ritual with you folks with circle of the green um you know we are going to have our 20y year anniversary that's probably going to be folks in the community invite only um but I would say if there's interest you know certainly reach out to us um we're happy to we're we're very welcoming we're happy to people to join us if they want to you know join us for one of the the many holidays if they want to just celebrate with a group we're very welcoming so I I would say definitely reach out to us and I'll give everybody I'll give everybody a update because when I come to Rochester I'm gonna weasel my way into one of these folks rituals well I'll be H gonna invite you virtually you're telling me about in salum I was say we do have some members that have left the state of New York that still join us once in a while virtu really yes yeah yes absolutely I mean your experience will be a little bit different obvious but you'll still at least have that opportunity we send the ritual in advance so you can prepare so yeah anything sign me up let us know and one place that people can usually go uh Kelly and Wendy I think you had mentioned this earlier was I used to do rituals with local metaphysical and Pagan shops in the area and unfortunately there's not a lot of those now but that is a good place to go typically uh covens and magical groups please advertise at your local Pagan Shops and and if you're seeking a pagan shop or a local YuYu church is a great place to stop into and see if they have information on local groups that are practicing can I toss out my little plug about you know in a world where you can buy anything you want on Amazon and online supporting those local stores um is critically important to being able to keep the community going so yes I'm always willing to spend a little bit more for the seven day candles at my local Botanical than I than I would be ordering online big plug for that absolutely and shell like you said we don't all have the luxury of being able to step outside of our workplace and go to 50 million different Pagan shops but you know we do appreciate the ones that we have for sure you know you know darn well that Payday on my lunch break is dangerous cuz I go walking yeah we want to thank Wendy and Kelly um again Circ the green uh Rochester New York if you're interested and want to connect with them Leila will post contact info um we're also going to post info for the website mandor magic man oh God Leila I can't say this mandor yeah because uh that was intrical in me connecting with folks so Lela will post links and again we want to thank Wendy and Kelly wonderful ladies and wow keep it with you folks
