get together to tell each other's spooky Tales ghoulish ghost stories and haunting True Crime all wild smoking copious amounts of the finest cannabis the USA has to offer getting more faded than a poltergeist I'm Leila and smoking this cheapest stuff in New England that's rad Earth and rad I'm shell and Welcome to our episode today obviously we have both been pregaming beforehand a lot a lot you know I'm still uh I I I'm really happy like I can't even explain my happiness I have been getting these um these cheap I don't want to say cheap eighths because I actually been buying it by the ounce but like cheap ounces of good weed and I just can't get over it I can't get over it we do love a good deal it's true we love a good deal and you know the coupon thing can I just still talk about these coupons like you're gonna like if you spend I don't even know how much you got to spend maybe a 100 bucks if you spend over a hundred bucks you get like a 10% off coupon oh I love a loyalty program but then you can multiply up to three coupons in one purchase so you can essentially get 30% off a purchase with the way taxes in Massachusetts that's basically tax-free that's a lot of tax yeah right that's pretty so what are you smoking today that's so cheap and wonderful I Still Smoking more of that banana pudding Tain I ended up getting more good stuff you know this this batch was 31.5 for like I don't even know what it came out to I think when you broke it down it came out to 2550 an e which compared to 60 bucks Lord that's not too bad as far as things go in massachusett Massachusetts Lea's so high she can't even say my state today so today I am smoking some mule fuel mule fuel you know that's packaging by the way I like that packaging I like the little bags because they're not as detrimental to life as the big old glass jars yeah the big old glass jars at least can be recycled as glass I don't know how recyclable these are why couldn't they just be some type of hemp packaging I don't understand but this mule fuel here is little over 31% THC it's 31.5 s% THC right on my alley it's got 0.04% CBDs and I like that this has that what lab it was tested on the only problem I have with this connoisseur cannabis mule fuel is it is dry as Satan's farts I swear really that's sad because then it goes up like poof gone it really does you put this in a bowl you light it once you do not need to relight your bowl it burns like a joint and it will burn right down and you better be prepared to suck down the whole pipe in one sitting exactly the whole thing right there and I think it's um it could be like older weed but I also think this might be part of the trend where they dry it really really dry so that when they test it that will increase the THC percentage so I almost wonder if this is like a 28% THC that they dried to hell in back in order to kind of up that THC percentage just a couple points I Goa now does yours I know a lot of the time um my labels will say it was tested on such and such a date and packaged on such and such a date I'm thrilled when it's been packaged within like a month month and a half of when I've bought it I wish this had a packaged date because then I would know if it was dry on purpose or dry because it's old west coast weed it does have a tested by date the lab name and it was tested in February of this year so this has been on a shelf for a minute you know it's probably a combination of both they probably overdried it and it's getting old yeah it's probably a little bit of that you know and all things considered you'd think that uh the prices would get better no I was watching um Jim balushi you know one of the Blues Brothers yeah he's a cannabis farmer now and I think he's kind of fun he's an interesting guy and I love what he's doing in the Cannabis space right now and he has a TV show I forget what it's called but it's supposed to be like a sort of like a documentary but it's obviously scripted but he's trying to sell his own brand of weed and I don't know if he's in Oregon or Northern California but he's taking a pound of his pre super awesome weed to these dispensaries guess how much he wants for a pound of his weed oh my God 5,000 oh shell my poor Sweet Summer child you are going to be so sad when you hear this $600 for a pound $600 for the pound that's it what's this phone number right I'm like I'll go out there I'll buy a couple pounds and bring it back damn people out here are charging half that for an of pre we'll hop in a car together and we'll each get one Jesus that and a felony for transporting it across state lines but you know hey it might be worth it I don't know we would teleport it right teleport it we wouldn't do illegal things no never we would never have never would never do any illegal thing because that's wrong that does seem kind of wrong I'm a little sad and disappointed that on the east coast and in some of these I'll give I'll give them 800 to bring it to me right seriously but considering how expensive it is in some of these places I mean I know wholesale is a lot cheaper but that's a lot lot cheaper no no like to kind of give you perspective in most stores in Massachusetts you're gonna pay a little over 300 for an ounce exactly so two ounces or a pound same price what I've been finding in New York state same thing if you're going to buy if you want to buy good weed if you want to buy anything over 30% THC you're going to be spending at least a minimum of $240 an ounce closer to 350 and up right here you can get mids and lowgrade cannabis pretty cheaply but if you want quality cannabis you're still going to pay right out the nose for it it's very expensive remember six eight months ago when I was getting a hell of a deal getting an ounce for uh 288 exactly and that was a deal a deal now granted now I'm doing it more for like 200 but you know exactly shop around people shop around shop around and grow your own I I grow my own primo and I buy my mids because that's the that's the most economical way for me to do it and if you're like me and can barely keep kids and cats alive which by the way I've thought about getting a spider plant because remember a spider plant I can keep alive if I can keep a spider plant alive for two straight years I will try to grow some weed how about that yay I can't wait I'm so excited when you're ready sh I will come over and I will help you set up and we do it right this time you'll take my advice right I will give it my best yay now that we're all nicely toasty and we're ready for some spooky stories I have something first before the spooky story this is going to kind of cover our you know we we've kind of backed off our witchy part a little bit because we have started our new podcast um back on the broomstick but this is kind of like witchy related I person I find this so intriguing because I is an American citizen am such a monarchist TR she really is listen back to our old episodes I had to call her to make sure she was okay when the queen passed and I wasn't really okay as part of that issue but so this is interesting so the coronation is coming up for King Charles which is officially King Charles III not like is he gonna do it like on the The Throne of scone and like on that he is cool but the only problem is is that they're trying to make sure that the thing doesn't fall apart while he sits on it well it's ancient right I don't know I think it's like seven or 800 years old yeah yeah I mean monarchs for hundreds of years have been crowned on that I feel like it's been since like the 1600s if I'm not mistaken 16 or 1700s they've been sitting on that that what do they call it the coronation chair which is on or intertwined with the stone of scone yeah the Stone of destiny that th was built into the throne and that's where even though they can take it out I'm not into the whole monarchy thing what I do love is cool historical well and that's the stone is actually Scottish and that's really your thing is yeah Scottish so that that's my thing he's having his coronation coming up like May 7th I think it is and May 6th May 7th one of them days after belan I wonder if they chose that on purpose I know right wow funny you should mention that so I am actually going to I know our our listener folk can't see this but the coronation invitation please by all means everybody Google this because actually it's beautiful so I'm gonna share my screen with you real quick oh okay and I want you to see the invitation and this is gonna this is this is where our witchy piece is GNA come in so oh that is pretty that's beautiful it actually is beautiful wow how summery and oh my God yes there's the Thistle and strawberries this is Gorge oh and the green man this is gorgeous it is gorgeous you know everything with the Royals has a [ __ ] ton of symbolism in it every single thing so you've got the two coats of arms for Charles and Camila and then you got all these beautiful flowers and I'm glad you pointed out the strawberries because you know why the strawberries are on the invitation why because strawberries were the Queen's favorite and she ate strawberry jam sandwiches every day for like 70 years that is so sweet I'm loving everything on here the rampant Lions I love the bee oh my gosh this is beautiful there's irises so they they they put stuff that symbolizes things that are you know important to the the monarchy to the king things of that nature and this is all like renewal rebirth New Beginnings starting you know things starting over starting fresh that makes sense that it immediately said spring and summer to me because that's what those seasons are magically not to mention the coronation is in May right so it kind of fits the season but Charles is a bit of a naturalist very into conservation um that's probably his main Cornerstone belief is is conservation in whether it be Wildlife the ocean um or the Earth itself I guess that fits also with the with the whole motif of flowers and nature right so is this invitation is I like him more than I thought I would you know right he's very much more more indepth of a person than you'd think and this is very representative of him and his his ideas and the things he holds near and dear to him like I said there's representation um of his mother Queen Elizabeth II he's got stuff on there that represents all of the three countries that make up the UK Ireland England and Scotland as you so prominently pointed out at the very bottom of the invitation is a beautiful beautiful Green Man gorgeous and boy has that stirred up some controversy I guess I'm not really surprised the green man is such a big part of English culture you know Roslin chapel and and all of that that it's in it's in everything there so I I wasn't too surprised to see it on there considering the motif of spring and summer and rebirth and renewal because he fits right in with that and the whole natural thing you know the whole natural thing that he fits in with that but the more I thought about it isn't the monarchy Christian well yeah so so what are they doing using a pagan symbol on a Christian monarchy invitation just to kind of be clear here when you become the ruler of of the land over there as the king of England he is going to be the head of the Church of England true so you're thinking to yourself so so the head of the Church of England has a green man on his his in yeah that seems itri seems a little a little strange to me like they'd be at odds rosin Chapel notwithstanding it's not at odds but I am going to give you a certain perspective that is going to just make you want to just flip a biscuit oh oh I like your little britishism there yeah right so I found an article online on a online magazine called uh the spect and this article was by Francis Young and the title of the article is does King Charles's Green Man make him Pagan you know obviously I'm intrigued and because that that's that's been the brewhaha for the last couple of days is oh my God the head of the Church of England and his Pagan symbolism so listen to what this person has to say they call the Green Man an intriguing figure and it says he is not as many claim an ancient fertility God but something much stranger a 20th century creation a deity invented in modern Britain wait what Leila pick your jaw up uh I'm gonna need to see some sources on that so what this person is saying is in 1939 A folklorist named lady Raglin published an influential article which Drew together several strands to construct an imagined character that basically is the greed man they say I've heard of I've heard of the term Green Man was relatively recent invention so that's probably correct that's probably when that was invented but the term not ter concept yeah yeah ex not the concept exactly the the depictions of the Green Man often called Jack of the green or God of the wood that type of thing those have been around for a very very long time not just since the early 1900s whether that term was coined then or not are they trying to say that because the term was invented then that's when the Green Man himself was invented yeah unfortunately oh that's a bummer quite a stret there okay um and they're saying that the Green Man established his place as a British icon okay so now we're putting the Green Man in the same freaking boat as Elton here the green man is a British icon but it's it's supposed to be a symbol of the supposed survival of the old ways an embodiment of joyous fertility they kind of put into play around the 60s which went in with the flower power you know Live and Let Live Love and let love kind of era that that hippie era so they're kind of associating the green man with like the hippie movement which Charles was in his formative years then teenage early 20s years then right so maybe I don't know but yeah this person makes the Green Man sound like a new thing yeah definitely not I mean they've been those carvings in have been in ancient Greece they've been on ancient Roman I mean even an ancient Christian um what is it early you know 2 Century it's been around for a long time I mean whether someone made a name for it and it did kind of start to depict the GRE so there was kind of a Resurgence and a Reclamation but it was of a much older foliage God like the god of of the of the Harvest the god of the growing things this God has been around I mean Roslin Chapel was built hundreds and hundreds of years ago well before that person coined the term the Green Man and those faces and masks have been there so I don't know I guess they are on churches so I'm not opposed to the idea of the head of the church using a Green Man symbol because I almost see it as a bridge between our two religions well and that's the thing it was put on churches all all across Britain is kind of a I can't think of the term off the top of my head but what they were what they would use basically to kind of convert early Christians did a lot of that that's why Christmas is on Ule that's why Easter and oara are so similar in in celebration they pulled a lot of pagan traditions and times and places and held their holidays and their rituals to make that transition more palatable yeah yeah so there are green men all over the churches in England so technically being the head of the Church of England and those symbols are all over your churches hey now it is a symbol among other things obviously of our relationship with the natural world or in Christian terms God's creation and like I said Charles is a naturalist and he's very into conservation and he's one of those people that like I don't know every three months he plants a tree or something or maybe it's every four months he's like one of those people I did not know that I love that he's very down with that type of thing so for there to be that earthy naturalist symbol within the church that he's now the head of for him to use that symbol would make sense kind of it does a guy that you like Winston Marshall oh Sons so Winston Marshall had a little bit to say oh what did he say to quote him he says why is the Jolly Green Giant more prominent on the coronation invite than any Christian symbols he's the head of the church has he forgotten the first commandment Thou shalt have no other gods before me and he goes this is paganism what a shame oh I'm disappointed actually like it almost made me not like Mumford and Son anymore right well you know I kind of knew that they were they leaned that way a little bit but I see it from the the opposite I guess um I love the fact that he is a naturalist I love all the natural symbols there I didn't see very many Christian symbols at all and that made me happy and hopeful to be honest because it is such a shared symbol it has been used on Christian iconography and church is for such a long time as well as a pagan symbol I recognize that if if about to be King Charles can recognize that it's also a pagan symbol and recognize the the fertility and the natural roots of it then I'm okay with that I think that's cool surprisingly I do think that Charles has a grasp on what the green man really is I guess I'm going to have to research this royal family a little more I was just under the impression that they were all kind of racist [ __ ] that were a little kind of back in the in the last century but not all of them not necessarily they there's some depth to the royal family there really is and you know if King Charles is going to embrace naturalism and try to help all the [ __ ] that's going on in this world right now with the climate crisis and everything then [ __ ] yeah that is his number one priority um is the climate crisis actually he does get a bad rap because he is kind of a weirdo because I'm not saying he ain't kind of a weirdo because he is his brother's a [ __ ] pedophile so for real that probably won't go in the podcast there is there is the face of the royal family that we see and then there's the real people that they truly really are deep down and I think char Charles has some depth to him that is very aligned with some more natural beliefs see what I said about this will not stop burning it just won't stop burning the weed that just doesn't stop it just will not stop so that's what I I that was my little tidbit about the coronation invite I thought that was really interesting that a the green man's on it and be that it's caused such a brewhaha right down to Dam Mumford and Sons I'm disappointed I when you when you mentioned I I thought you were gonna say that was on the side of Go Green Man yay paganism no no I should have known it was more of uh what the heck why is that Pagan symbol bigger than the Christan symbols you know it's it's definitely a good mix between where paganism and Christianity can kind of align and I don't want to say Come Together necessarily but kind of come together I would hope so if we need to come together on some of this stuff we're on the brink of Easter here what better ghosty day than Easter I mean right like that's zombie day I love it like I laugh sometimes at Christians who are like I don't believe in ghosts that's a bunch of [ __ ] well guess what what you're all going to be celebrating Easter here in a day or so don't they say the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost it's right in one of their things I think they think it's a metaphor I was looking for for some Easter ghosts and there isn't any I Think Jesus has like the whole he's a lock on that he's the got a lock on the Easter ghost thing um so there isn't really a lot of Easter Tales but I did find an interesting place I ran across an article on the 30 most haunted places in the world oh we should go to all of them I was like hey which by the way Transylvania is on that list we need to go isn't there like some type of Festival that we should go to that's out there yes it's called Untold it's a techno festival with lots of weed and techno music oh that sounds perfect but anyway so I I kind of was filtering through on the ones that were in America because that's really kind of our Focus here right and came across a place and I'm surprised neither of us have mentioned it or heard of it it's basically called the Stanley Hotel of the South oo I'm intrigued I I've never heard of this it's called Driscoll hotel and it is in Austin Texas okay well I've been extensively in Texas I I don't think I've heard of it tell me the Drisco yeah what's going on at the Driscoll Hotel you know Yelp for what it's worth I don't really buy to Yelp because people lie but Yelp has actually named it one of the most haunted places in all of Texas for the second year in a row all right so it does rank on you know all of these most haunted you know type things don't they all though but this hotel like I said it's in Austin and it's located on the corner of sixth in brazzo or brazo streets in Austin this thing started it was built by a colonel Jesse Driscoll in 1884 to kind of give folks perspective it would remind you probably similar to to the New Yorker Hotel in New York City they built this thing for $7,000 that's it imagine building a big huge hotel for $7,000 yeah but $7,000 in what was the year again 1884 that's a lot of dollars yeah so they used to have these big like Grand balls there when it opened they had an inaugural ball with the Texas governor at that time so like that type of that type of people upscale people yeah it wasn't just like some you know gold mining Hotel type above a bar thing this was a prominent hosted very prominent folks former president Lyndon Johnson and his future wife ladyb Bird Johnson had their first date at the Drisco Hotel so you know even in the 30s because he was he was president in like what the the mid-30s so even then this was still you know quite quite the place to be so the colonel colonel Driscoll he had actually passed away in the hotel and he had passed away in room room 525 so you know how like when we we've talked about other hotels where a lot of stuff is concentrated in a certain room to the point where they block off that room nowadays um the Driscoll has has a similar thing uh room 525 is permanently blocked off to the public because of all the activity in here oh no [ __ ] like the bathroom in that one bar Place yeah pretty much yeah Colonel Driscoll dies in room 525 like 1890 he died I don't think there was any big Uprising in how he died um I didn't really get the whole how he died thing it just seems like he died there in the room in this hotel that he built so as you can imagine his hotel he built it dies in there he's going to be attached he's gonna stay things start happening later in time I'll have to find I'll have to find what to around the time frame but two jilted lovers separated by A Century Of History also died in Han room 525 oh wow really yeah there is a bride that supposedly died this sounds like it's ripe for a lady in white type haunting seriously so she was in room 525 and she killed herself after her fiance called off the wedding and people say that they see her walking the halls in a Victorian wedding gown but the second jilted lover because remember I said there was two jilted lovers about a century apart 1991 a more famous bride she was a socialite she escapes to the hotel like like kind of has this like left at the altar type thing goes to this hotel goes to the Drisco Hotel to kind of escape to hide away it's never happened to me but I would imagine being left at the altars if nothing else embarrassing yeah that's pretty traumatic you might need like a weekend away collect your thoughts feel a little better about yourself get some pampering yeah yeah so she was last seen going on a mass of shopping spree with her ex fiance's credit card nice she was seeing carrying uh several bags into that room into room 525 later that night while sitting in the bathtub she put a pillow over her face and shot herself in the head with a gun that doesn't sound like the actions of someone after doing a shopping spree though I mean maybe one of the things she bought was the gun maybe but so people have claimed to see her either carrying packages or carrying a pistol down the hall before she vanishes through the doorway of 525 so then there was a senator's daughter there's there's Tales of an a child that meets her untimely death and continues to play that same room yeah no [ __ ] yeah no one stays in that room right that's the one you said is closed off now it is but it hasn't always been on but Ed Edgar aleno once said of all the Melancholy topics that death of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetic Topic in the world morbid that's pretty morbid but it okay there is a lot of children ghosts that don't necessarily they don't have like an origin story but there is a lot of apparitions of children apparitions I guess there's been apparitions of toys I didn't know like a inanimate object could create an apparition me either that sounds interesting but people have said that they've seen balls rolling down the hallway that aren't really there like as if a child was rolling a ball down the hall yeah I wonder if that's kind of related to some of the recording ghosts that we've heard you know maybe it's not necessarily that the object has an apparition maybe it's just part of the ghostly recording you know and it just happens all you really see or notice is the ball you don't necessarily notice the entity that that recording was of I guess right it could be it could be well I guess that's true because you know sometimes they talk about ghosts that like they'll see them hanging well they gotta be hanging from something so you're kind of seeing the ghost of a rope right exactly yeah yeah so it's not necessarily that the object has a ghost it's just that it's part of a recording like one of those recording ghosts in an area not necessarily an actual entity there's even a a story because famous people still St at this hotel it's kind of a it's still kind of a upscale type Place well Austin is known for being weird so remember Annie lenx from the arhythmic yeah Annie Lennox stayed here and Annie Lennox is supposedly been haunted by a cowboy type ghost don't have an origin story for the cowboy ghost at that hotel she saw a cowboy ghost and actually said that he was dressed in a 19th century Cowboy clothing and that she thought he was so real that she went in her room and took a shower and he selected her stage outfit for her for wow I wonder what show that was for I want to see the outfit now like had a conversation okay I'm gonna take a shower now okay I'll grab your your outfit for you okay here you go and then he's not a real person damn he's also uh this Cowboy ghost has also been known to touch women on their arms or their backs kind of in a Romancing kind of way kind of like a hey baby what you doing so he's kind of a little friendly to women this Cowboy ghost um but again I don't have an origin story of the cowboy ghost some people think it's Colonel Driscoll himself but you know who knows it's not like we do checks here on the ghosts right you know there's there's been lots of sightings it's a smokefree place as a lot of places are nowadays there's been sightings of like random smoke and then people will smell the smell of cigars so there's somebody there from back in the day from a hundred years ago still smoking the old stoies so what I hear you saying is that when we bring our Ouija boards there we need to pack the edit yeah but they call them Phantom smells I guess it's not just the cigar smell like if you were in a bar you know those bars from like the 70s and prior that were like the smoke was so thick you had to carve through it with a night you'll be walking through the hotel and all of a sudden just get overwhelmed by like this W of tobacco smoke oh wow with nobody smoking there that's what you know that's one of those scents that seems to be very prevalent with ghosts maybe because it's such a pungent distinctive smell um in my family my father's father was known for smoking Cherry tobacco and that has a distinctive smell that has a very distinctive smell and so sometimes we'll randomly be walking somewhere or hanging out someplace in a place he never had been before so it's not like that smoke could have permeated the walls or anything or even at a park when we're having like a family get together and we'll smell that cherry tobacco smoke and you know that he's there so I it's interesting that that kind of as as bad as tobacco is it's one of those things that seems to be a a common indicator of a ghost I think there's a lot of stuff that has happened there in general I think it might be coincidence that a couple of bad things happened in that particular room but that's an awful lot of coincidence for one room I mean I wouldn't stay in that room would you stay in that room oh my God hell yeah people die in that room shell I mean I would go to it and do a I'd read some tarot cards in that room I'd check the vibe in that room I would totally check the energy there I would not sleep in that room it sounds like most of the people have killed herself like there's one ghost that they say has her name is Tara and this person got a lot of hard liquor um a carton of cigarettes some people magazines sounds like a night in yeah right but she set herself up in her hotel room at the Driscoll I don't think it was 525 I I'm not sure of that but I don't think it was she almost drank herself to death and then also had a newly purchased revolver who's letting these people check into these rooms with brand new guns I don't know but she would have certainly died of alcohol poisoning if she had not died from a self-inflicted gunshot I mean it's almost like you know how this is an interesting topic to kind of I don't want to go down a rabbit hole but we could at some point in the future go down this Rabbit Hole I do believe that there are locations that are kind of like black holes to negativity and black holes to to sadness and depression There Are Places and maybe this is one of them when you're in that place for too long unbeknownst to yourself you get overcome by that negativity and that sadness and that depression and it's almost like you've been sucked into something dark I agree can't get out of you know what I'm saying yeah I really do believe that there are some places that seems the ghost these have their clutches on you and you can't you can't escape that because of the spot like you yeah there's some areas there's whether it's due to lay lines negative energy in the area but they seem to be repeated spots of tragedy repeated spots of negative things happening and it just kind of seems to seep into those areas and and repeat there I mean just the same as you might walk to a spot and say wow I feel really peaceful here and really calm and very happy this spot feels good to my soul you can also walk to places that all of a sudden your hackles are raised and and you feel sketched out and everything's a little creepy and you don't know why it might be just as beautiful as of a spot that made you feel good but for some reason the energy of this one is off and I think this is one of those places yeah I think people can create or enhance those places too by by how you design a building how you decorate a building the materials that you use the things that you do while you're building it I think can either enhance the good or enhance the bad in some of these areas and I think that's exactly what what's happened here is I think that there's maybe some bad juju in the air at the Drisco Hotel and if if you're there and are maybe predisposed to some negativity or things of that nature maybe some inner demons that this particular location is going to perpetuate that yeah it's going to exacerbate it and maybe there's a maybe like the Stanley Hotel underneath it there's all that Limestone and water that we have found seems to be very common in places that experience Perpetual type hauntings maybe that's something similar here I'd be curious to know what's underneath this I think there was some tragedy back in the early days of it but I think anything recent is almost like just bad juju at this location yeah sounds like it attracts tragedy scary spot but I I am intrigued I would be interested in going maybe not staying in that room but maybe I'd stay in 526 there you go okay I would stay with you in 526 not stay in 525 put a glass up to the wall and listen did make the uh 30 most haunted places in the World list nice beautiful beautiful place still a host to popular aristocratic we don't use that word here in America more socialite celebrity type people might be out of our price range but I definitely think it would be an interesting place to go just because I am curious if it's just like a black hole of negativity yeah it would be very interesting to find out bring some tarot cards some of our homade boards our homemade B board that's right you have a very strong [ __ ] around and find out streak so I do this is right up your alley for sure that's my little tidbit on the Drisco Hotel so I've talked about the coronation invite in the Drisco Hotel what have you got for us today ilila I've got an asylum oh my God that's so unlike you I know well okay it was actually never an asylum because you were like the anti- Asylum girl I I am I don't like asylums they're kind of terrible this one is actually called a Asylum 49 and I almost didn't do it because Asylum 49 is a modern-day haunted house experience oh you know right around October they even have like a Hands-On haunted experience like the kind where people will grab you and like shove you against a wall to scare you I do kind of like those not gonna lie oh yeah it's got great reviews it sounds like it's really really [ __ ] scary but part of the reason it's so scary is it is legitimately haunted oh so even though I was a little turned off at first because it's not an asylum it was an old hospital and it does seem to have Real Paranormal Activity now where is this this is in tuilla Utah and it's it's actually the site of the old tuilla hospital since about 2006 it's been called Asylum 49 and half of this very large building complex currently operates as like an old folks home and then the other half which is used to be the old hospital was retired right around 20 2ish so there's still people today that were born there or had some different types of you know surgeries or what have you care and then in 2006 it was purchased by a gentleman named Kim Anderson and he turned it into Asylum 49 and he says originally he just decided to buy it because it was an old hospital and he wanted to turn it into a haunted attraction but as he was doing that he realized it was just as haunted as the people in the Town had been telling him because the stories of the hauntings go back to when it was originally just a house that was built back in 1873 for the family of Samuel F Lee he and his family lived in until 1913 and that's when it was turned into an old folks home like an alm's house you've talked about those before like where the poor people could go and be taken care of or uh elderly people kind of like the Indigent people of the time would go stay at an Al house right this alm's house was never an asylum but it did take care of a lot of poor and elderly people that's when The Haunting started so back in the early 1900s when it was a an old folks home Alms House they started talking about shadowy figures that would be seen walking the hallways including nurses people would talk about a nurse that had come into their room say you had like your grandmother was staying there uh and a nurse would come in to take care of her often patient would say oh the nurse was just in here checking on me and no nurse had been in so there was several reports of ghosts and different hauntings that happened then and that's when um the number three started to be a thing patients would die in threes even way back in the early 1900s when it was first an old folks home one patient would die and then very quickly two more would die to the point where anyone that worked there would know even today as as in the old folks home it still continues to happen when one patient dies they know very very quickly two more will follow yeah but that's been kind of like um that's that's that's always been a thing I've heard that my whole life as a child with my non witchy family that oh somebody died two more are coming or oh two people died who's the last one you know that's that's that's true things thing about things coming in threes but at this hospital it's it's definitely a thing and that's a little weird when you think about it imagine being number one right now so a lot of the the ghosts that are in this hospital and old folks home are people that were originally patients uh one of the common ones is a gentleman named Wes who suffered from Alzheimer's and he stayed in a particular room room number six he was usually a nice guy kind of quiet but he was prone to getting very angry and irritated when he was having an episode and when he passed away people reported seeing him still in his room or outside of his room pacing back and forth and of course he would disappear as soon as they got close enough to try and talk to him now he continues to be seen people will report seeing a disturbed man outside of room number six and you know nobody was in the room at that time and they would describe what Wes had looked like this particular ghost can either be kind like a kindly older man or if he's having an episode he can be a very angry ghost who's known to grab people or leave scratches or scream at them right around room number six currently now that it's a haunted attraction that room someone has kind of cheekily written 666 on um and people will still report seeing Wes either in that room or just outside of that room oh also back in the late 1900s early 2000s people would see Mists and dark figures and orbs in the halls and again I guess as being that it was an old folks home and a hospital quite a few people passed away there and unfortunately when it was built it was not built with a proper morg they just kind of picked one of the rooms in the basement and that was where they stored the bodies until the County coroner could come by so they weren't kept exactly in the nicest of conditions so some people think that that might have been a contributor to why a lot of souls stayed here you know maybe they weren't taken care of properly in Life or you know right after they passed but one of the scarier things that people talk about is a a malevolent dark figure that's seen usually right around the witching hour right around 3:00 a.m. and he's described either as an all black figure just like a shadow figure that they can tell as like a large man or as a large man wearing all black clothes clothing one of the stories about this black figure was that um one of the overnight nurses was at the nurses station right around 3:00 a.m. she saw a man dressed all in black come down the hallway and go into the room of one of the patients and this was well past visiting hours so the nurse went down to that room to tell him to come back later and found that the door was locked and she wasn't able to unlock it with her master key so she got a couple other nurses to come help her cry the door open and when they did the room was empty the only person in there was the patient and the patient had passed away let me ask you something what's that you got this haunted place okay you got apparitions you got ghosts going through locked doors walking through walls and [ __ ] so why are you going to put elderly patients who got dementia and Alzheimer still in part of this building who are going to think every damn one of these people is real I don't know I'm just wondering there's also several children ghosts you know there was the nursery in the area oh yeah because you said they had babies born there yeah babies were born there and unfortunately several children did pass away there and so people will see there's a couple different ghosts one is a a young blonde girl possibly called Jessica a psychic who saw her there found that she passed from a brain tumor and she stays there she's looking for her parents she wants to talk to her parents the other girl is a young girl named Sarah and she has been seen mostly by Kim Anderson the current owner but we'll get into her in a minute so they don't have any they don't have any like video or audio of any of these do they quite a few different people have gone to this to this Asylum 49 to do ghost hunts because one of the fun things that Kim does is you know in the Halloween season it's a haunted house the rest of the year you can book it to do ghost huntt oh private private Ghost Hunt Ghost Adventures has been there more than once uh there's several YouTube Ghost Hunters that have been there there's actually two movies that were filmed there one of them is Stephen King's The Stand they use that for um part of that movie love the stand but you can find on YouTube and other places various you know they've got quite a few EVPs of different spirits that are there there's the thermal imaging of shadow figures in different rooms and walking down the hallway there's quite a bit of activity here that's what kept me coming back to this as a haunted house I would very much like to go there and do a ghost hunt because it seems to be extremely active there's a lot of people who claim to see the nurse there's a a nurse in white that Kim calls um he calls her nurse ratchet because he says she you know she's all in White in that old traditional nurses outfit and she looks like a heavy set German lady and she's the nurse that she's the nurse that patients would describe as having come into their room the nurse that actually came into the patients room would say what nurse no one was scheduled to come in here and they would describe her physically and say the nurse all in white well the nurses here would wear colored scrubs they didn't wear like that old white nurse's outfit so they would so they would know that it was the ghostly nurse and not an actual nurse but it was common enough and everyone would see the same looking woman you know that know they know that that's someone that they see there why she's haunting there they don't know but she's a very interactive ghost much like Wes um who's often seen in his room or pacing outside of his room Wes is an angry interactive ghost well I would imagine um that she's the type of ghost that doesn't realize that she's dead and doesn't have to get up and go to work every day so she just she's just getting up and going to work every day yeah now I've I've seen some people's firsthand accounts one was from a person who used to volunteer to work at Asylum 49 she says that it's really fun super spooky but the most spooky time is when they they're open just for the ghost hunts but she says she volunteered there while it was a haunted house and she was usually either a clown or she would be dressed like in a ball gown with blood but one time she was there dressed and ready to haunt people when she saw a little girl walking through the attraction all by herself like a little six or seveny old girl now this is one of the like super super scary haunted houses this isn't one where you would take a little kid let alone let them go through by themselves so this employee say she saw this little girl walking and was a little worried about her and so followed her through the attraction this little girl seemed to not be bothered not really notice anything and just calmly walked through to the end and when she went around a corner the employee went to follow her and couldn't find her anymore she was gone other people had seen the little girl at different times walking through and the same thing had happened to them they couldn't find her when they would try to go find her to reunite her with her parents and nobody in the entrance or the exits ever saw the little girl come in or go out oh people who go to visit the haunted house will also report seeing this little girl she's usually in the conference room which is over near where the nursery used to be and a lot of times they'll complain um like in particular this one woman went with her boyfriend her boyfriend's little brother and her boyfriend's mom they saw this little six-year-old girl in the conference room trying to scare people and when they got to the end of the haunted house the mother complained to the manager about them having a child working there and such a scary haunted house and the manager of course was extremely confused because anybody that works there has to be 16 plus and they don't let little kids in but more than one person has reported or complained about this little girl all alone working in the haunted house when no such little girl exists the employees at Asylum 49 they're supposed to travel in twos they have to go somewhere at least with one other person because so many Poltergeist type things happen there they're afraid someone will get locked in a room or will get trapped behind something and they want to make sure that there's someone with them that can help because everyone that works there it's very common for things to go fly across the room stuff to fall off the walls on its own things to be moved when they go in a different room so much so like I said that they have to travel in pairs this place is also home to a portal to somewhere possibly hell there's quite a few psychics that have gone there who have described that there is definitely a portal there and interestingly people that are um close to passing away the people that work in the nursing home know when someone is about to pass away because they'll describe seeing this portal in their room or near their room and then within a short period of time inevitably they pass away and psychics have talked about this portal and say that it's guarded by a woman uh spirit named Maria and that all these Spirits are attracted when people pass away they're attracted to this portal but Maria for some reason tells them not to go that it's actually a portal to a bad place and she says that they shouldn't go into the light so nobody's really sure where it goes to just that it's there and that it's guarded by some type of spirit weird right makes me want to go check it out yeah now the one thing that kind of gives me a little bit of this is bull crap Vibes uhuh is unfortunately Kim Anderson himself you're all about like [ __ ] story today no I think it's real I definitely stayed with it because I do think the place is haunted there are too many reports prior to it being Asylum 49 and continuing after by too many different groups what this do to ruffle your feathers I think he's lying I think he's exaggerating some of his experiences to prop up his haunted house and I I don't think he needs to I think some of the Original Stories and the experiences people have had speak for themselves the biggest thing that got me was he says that he was in Asylum 49 fixing it up to be the haunted house and prior to it being a haunted house he didn't believe in ghosts they keep a lot of the hospital the same including a lot of the old equipment a lot of the old hospital beds you know some of the pressure cuffs and different things are are from the original hospital and he was in one of the rooms kind of repairing things and he saw some Poltergeist activity later when some of his original employees were working they all came running into him and refused to work because they said that there was a ghost in one of the rooms was the same room that he had been doing work in and seen the Poltergeist activity so he goes to this room and he says in the room in the center of the room was a little girl with black hair wearing like a white night gown and she was crying what would he lie to make money is that what it is I don't know I believed him up to this point so he says this little he sees this spirit this little girl Spirit crying in the center of the room and he asks her why she's crying and she says it's because she wants to scare people like the other kids are doing and so he talks to her and tells her that she can and that she can go hide under those beds over there and grab at people's legs and she gets all happy and skips off and goes under and grabs people's legs from under the bed and he says his wife at the time has also had experiences with this little girl where she felt something brush her cheek and the hair by her ear and Whisper you scared me that type of thing which I kind of buy that you know different things like that sounds good but he he continually describes having conversations with this little girl and like Lucid conversations back and forth conversations with this little girl Spirit where she calls him daddy I don't know something something's making my creepy Vibe go all hey he he goes by the nickname scar daddy and he does also have a a ghost hunting group now a paranormal group as well I'm not going to say that he didn't have these experiences I'm just going to say that a a ghost that's completely corporal visible to a person enough to have a logical back and forth conversation on more than one occasion that's amazing that's unprecedented I don't why can't he reproduce that in the presence of someone else right so so okay yeah I'm GNA call [ __ ] I think that's a little much I just do and so it was him unfortunately that almost turned me off from this place but the stories that precede you know that predate him and continue to happen there now that he's allowing ghost hunts to happen there as well there's enough paranormal activity that what I think is kind of [ __ ] is outweighed so I do think it's a good place to go I want to go there and conduct my own I do think you should check out the YouTube videos because there are some amazing very convincing EVPs shadow figures you know that kind of thing that happens but also listen to Kim Anderson himself and and you decide you know maybe I'm being too close-minded but maybe he's one of those people that is just trying to take advantage for the sake of making a buck right but there have been you know there have been psychics through there there have been a lot of ghost hunting groups through there and they have all had very similar experiences and corroborate a lot of the older stories and the older experiences that people have had there so there's definitely something going on and I don't know what the original Builder family was into I don't know what was going on on that land but I think just the fact of it being a hospital and old folks home has kind of for whatever reason made it a place where paranormal activity happens right so you can go on in October and do the haunted house and have a lot of fun and I think it would be fun I'd like to go when they're having a a ghost hunt for sure Ghost Adventures went there twice it was interesting enough they went there two times you know I understand the whole you call [ __ ] but a little the fact that Ghost Hunters went there twice there's got to be something there I agree there's definitely something there I think there's just a little bit of [ __ ] being piled on top of a real actual haunted site just to make it maybe more interesting I'm not sure because he wants to be the most haunted and the most popular don't they all you know so he's he's embellishing things right to try to up his rank in the most haunted list sure Kim Anderson invite us over to Utah convince me I would love to be please change my mind I would love that you seem like a really interesting guy your place is amazing invite us over we'll do a ghost hunt and we'll see if we can legitimize some of these stories I'm down I'll bring the homemade Ouija board and all I'm down all right I'll bring the ghost hunting tarot cards with that being said folks we hope you had a a great time sitting here with us today talking about hotels and [ __ ] calling and coronation invite drama and the devil's letter us the love of Our Lives that's true I do need to get a little bit higher my Bowl's empty I am ready for some more weed and uh get away from
