State Hospital welcome to the stoned Witches Hour I'm Lea and I'm hi and I'm back and I'm shell and I missed you all yay welcome welcome back sh so glad you're here I I I I was away for all of our listeners out there I became a grandma you know hard hard fact to believe you you welcome to the world welcome to the world I have a I have a grandson now his name is Morgan um we won't bulge any more than that but oh my God I you know this kid it is better than having kids because you you get to like walk away and get more sleep knowing that your kid is not getting asleep and there's something satisfying about that and hey it's even better being the great aunt adjacent I get swoop in and get baby kisses and have a lot of fun and I'm very much looking forward to that but in in the spirit of of me having been away and being back first of all it was so fun a couple weeks ago to be to be recording from New York it it was it was definitely interesting to to be back in my my hometown and doing the stoned Witches Hour but what I really wanted to point out was was last week uh Lisa an from Empower with flower she filled in for me she did so awesome we love Lisa an we we love her YouTube channel Empower with flower and I was sad to miss it and I was sad to miss talking to you ilila but Lisa Anne rocked it so Lisa an if you are listening I appreciate and you kicked ass oh she did such a good job she did her very best to fill your what did she say your pointy witchy shoes she did was so much fun Le say thank you thank you for filling in that was a ton of fun and it's definitely a great episode she that stone Sasquatch story twist at the end oh my goodness I as soon as it it posted I had to go listen to it partly because I was having like fomo fear missing out and I was like oh I gotta I gotta listen to what I missed but great stories you guys were talking about weed and some good stuff and and I was jealous that I wasn't a part of the conversation but you guys killed it great job oh we did smoke some good wheed I'm still smoking on some of that blue dream and boy it definitely gets very very Stony I have to admit though I splurged and I got some more of the very expensive bakio gelato but you know what first of all I gotta tell you I can't ever remember the name of that and I call it baklava gelato so if I ever say baklava gelato you know what I'm talking about and the other thing was I was listening to you and Lisa an last week and blue dream like I haven't had blue dream in so long and that is so great and when I was hearing about how it made you feel and how good of a high it was I was so jealous because I don't know Blue Dream hasn't been a while hasn't been around on the east coast in a while the blue dream like you said is so delicious so tasty and it just gets me nice and high and nice and happy ready to sit down and tell stories with my bestie H you need to you need to figure out a way to like pigeon carrier some of that blue dream man oh we do I what I really want to share is this gelato because it's some tasty stuff and boy does it hit like a hammer and I know you like the the heavy thc's so the gelato one you bought in the Blue Dream you grew correct right yes okay yeah and I had to splur I know I know I'm not usually the one to be spending a lot on on uh pot at the dispensary but I made an exception it's just so tasty sometimes you got to do what you got to do like this week I have I have been good I went back to this and I I I know I haven't talked to you in a couple weeks but um I went back to Dog Patch uh this week and you liked that I remember when you had that last time I did and it's it's only 26.2 n which for me you know I like those 32s and 34s right so it's a little bit lower but remember couple of weeks ago this is the one that made me freaking Chatty Cathy that's right you had that that really nice up high that you really like and right right like I I have some of my stuff in storage currently and I had to go today and and do do some reorganization of my storage unit oh never fun nobody likes that it's not it it's work you know you're lifting and moving stuff and organizing stuff that you packed away so I smoked a bunch of dog patch and was like I was ready to rock that [ __ ] hammered it out in like two hours and so it's like that get stuff done high you're still high but you're like capable cannabis is known to be anti-inflammatory it's one of the the main things that helps people particularly that have pain that's why I use it a lot for pain and so it sounds like with all the moving and and stretching that you did having you know being able to smoke some of that dog patch was able to help you away a little bit of pain well that and that's why I smoked a bunch before I started because you know as you know I have lifelong chronic back issue I was trying to basically Stave off killing my back because like this [ __ ] had to get done but yet my back doesn't like when I have to get this type of thing done so I was trying to Stave off you know killing myself and don't worry folks out there listening I was bending at the knees as best I could lift with your knees not with your back I was trying um but but I I I really like this one it's a what what is it a cultivar cultivar it's a good cultivar you know damn well next week I'll be rocking some 32 33% oh I know you will I know you will you're definitely going to go right back to that now it's funny that you said you were cleaning out a a storage unit because I was cleaning some things out and actually had a garage sale this past weekend I love garage sales I love other people's [ __ ] by the way love it love I do too thrifting one of my favorite pastimes now you know me I'm not a big Facebook user correct I do have a Fakebook account you do I love it I do so I was using my fake book account to sell some things because let's face it as much as fa I don't like Facebook Facebook Marketplace is an amazing local resource yeah yeah Facebook has its uses so it has its uses so I was I was more than happy to sell things on it because I got a lot of traffic when I would put things up on Facebook and I I started to notice a pattern anytime I put anything up it was over $100 I would start to get people who would text and the first thing they would say is is it available which is what everybody says it doesn't matter what it is they just do the standard is it available then they would say how long have you had it and what condition is it in and it was always some variation of that and the first time of course I was I told them and gave them the information you know it's a din dining room set it's EX years old and blah blah blah and then they said well I want my brother to come pick it up because I'm I'm out of town for the weekend due to accept zel and I'm like well I do accept zel but only in person and they kept coming up with these excuses why they would want so I knew they was eventually I knew it was scam and then I started seeing it over and over I would get five 10 15 of these people with the same variation I finally started messing with them I love it that's exactly what you do that's exactly you don't get mad you get you play their game man the first time they said is it available how long have you had it for and I hope it's in good condition so I said I've had it for a hundred years it's in good condition but it's haunted my great great great great grandfather brought it over from Scotland so they said oh my God can I pick it up at your house or a public place oh my God I'm like a public place is great let's do the local library because they have a paranormal section and I said I'm located at 420 marijuana Lane in Scotland oh my God so he says great my brother will come over to pick it up because I'm out of town and not available and I said okay I expect triple the price since you're having a second party pick it up now keep in mind this is $100 so triple the price would be 300 yeah so he says okay triple the price is fine how much is that and I said $2,000 so he says okay I wish I I wish our listeners could see my face right now because I am like dumbfounded he says I'll need your zel number I said okay I'll need the $2,000 and I'll also need to see your paranormal adjudicate license before I can let you have this very haunted item it's extremely powerful oh my sweet G Jesus he says give me your zel number for the money guess what number I said 40 no that see that would have been better I said Eric 123 8675309 oh my God Jenny Jenny and I said and I'm still going to need all the paperwork for the fantasm spectometer oh my God he says okay okay I'm gonna put the the zel through and I said all right but if it doesn't work that might mean that the curse has been activated and I would recommend shielding with a level three transmogrifier first oh my Lord if you don't I can't be held liable for what happens during an active past life haunted cursing oh my God I love you he says do you want to know his response what all right are you [ __ ] me I'll have my brother take care of it once he picks it up and I said does your brother have insurance against demons specters and fantasms if he doesn't I don't think I can sell this item to you in good conscience he says yes he has those oh my God oh my God oh my God so now I'm like I'd feel terrible if a demon was let loose on your family line for money I don't think I can do this in good conscience and he says friend are you going to sell this to me or are you wasting my time so finally at that point I I had had enough I I figured if he wasn't getting it by then that I said you and both know you were never going to buy this item good luck and I hope you're not haunted now and then I ended the conversation you're awesome you're awesome that's all I have screenshots oh my God I'm pretty sure so I went from getting like tons of them dozens of these responses to after that I I didn't get any anymore I'm pretty sure I got put on some sort of block list now I I want to you know not that I'm I'm I'm putting this out there for all of our listeners but this is a very special episode Leila It's My Birthday Episode sh It's Your Birthday Episode oh my goodness that's right happy birthday show happy birthday show happy birthday show yay happy birthday thank you thank you so I for my birthday I got a gift from my daughter which I did not expect because she just gave birth and I figured after giving birth I'm the least on her mind that's like the best gift you can get oh my God this kid knocked it out of the park both my kids do my son he's a listener he's a good boy he knows I love him and he does wonderful things for me too but this gift for my daughter we need to discuss briefly what' she get you I'm I'm intrigued one thing we haven't talked about much on here and our listeners are going to just drop their jaw of this I currently own 152 tarot decks it's a problem I have an issue I understand that's Michelle we love your we we love your little addiction we indulge you we like to get you nice little tarot decks for your collection it's a beautiful collection by the way it is so my kids you know I have a Google spreadsheet that I have shared with my children one does for your collection when you have that many tarot cards you need to have a Google spreadsheet just saying so I got this spreadsheet I share it with my kids and whenever they're not knowing what to get me they'll go find a Tarot deck that's not on my list is pretty much that works out so I get this Amazon package the other day and my boyfriend is like did you order stuff from Amazon I go absolutely not he's like well it's from Amazon and it's got your name on it I'm like I did not he's like were you in were you in bed High one night on Amazon I'm like no oh that's been known to happen High Amazon shopping oh yeah guilty I have done it and I'm not saying I haven't done it but in this particular instance I did not do it right right you would have fessed up if that was the case just not like well you know I got a little [ __ ] up last night went little crazy on the Amazon while I was puffing it's been known but no like legit never had ordered anything so I'm like what is in here and it never dawned on me that my birthday was coming yeah after a little while you kind of forget those things you but you know how once in a while you'll order something on Amazon it's backordered for a thousand years and out of blue I'm like maybe I ordered something a long time ago right two tarot decks are in this package with Amazon sent a little note the little note said happy birthday love my daughter's name and I was like a what a little good girl 78 doors tarot of the 78 doors this one this one is like kind of Victorian type but good Tarot deck I I'm not negating it but this is the cream of the crop this is what I have brought brought you here for today you need to look up and I need to show you this with your own bare hands the black tarot o all the cards are matte black this is where we need to do like a a a video episode and review tarot cards but they're all oh yes oh yes let's do that sometime oh those are gorgeous I'm gonna have to show you these in person you are the top notch and it's called the black tarot even in the video those look stunning yeah they're they're kind of the theme is a little dark um but it's the black I like the edgo edge color I love the edgo edge pictures on on tarot cards and those are very saturated and very pretty yes so u i when when we get together in a month or so for our our big Leila shell Gathering um I'm going to have to bring these because you you you need to see these you are going to love these These are right up your alley but like how a lot of the cards you get are like that glossy card stock this is this is like a matted card stock which I think adds to the whole aesthetic of it love love love my kid did a [ __ ] solid for me on this one nice way to go shell eldest the girl child girl child child the girl child I do remember the boy boy child this past summer maybe it was also Al for your birthday possibly last year I'm not sure I remember the Boy Child gave you a very nice Tarot deck recently too I think that was Christmas ah okay yes so they're good kids like I said when the kids are struggling they go right to the tarot list they're like what can we find that Mom doesn't have because Mom has like everyone every deck that's amazing we are absolutely I'm going to hold you to this so listeners let's make shell accountable we are totally doing a deck review yes episode that would be so much fun I'll bring in my measly like 10 decks we go we'll play with all of our decks I cannot wait to see all of your decks I'm so excited I'll just make sure I pick 10 that are the 10 you have right yes let me have at least one or two that would be fun no that would be so much fun show we should definitely do that yeah but like this for for anybody who is even if you're new to tarot because you know tarot cards to tarot cards it's the the the pictures you know they're different on every deck but the card meaning is the card meaning if you're into like good artwork and kind of a I don't want to say a darker theme but kind of a a little bit of a darker theme this black tarot worth every set I don't know what it cost because it was a gift but worth it check it out on Amazon I'm sure it's there that's where it came from the man gave it to me from his little blue truck a which is always nice so easy yeah love my Amazon man love getting surprise tarot decks how fun yeah so 154 I think I have as much as many tarot decks as some of the local tarot shops here in Salem but you know hey you know you should do like a little YouTube channel for each like a just a little thing like pull out a deck fan through it a little bit show some of the major Arcana some of the important cards you know maybe one or two of each of the the suit cards and talk about the deck a little bit you know 15 10 15 minutes tops on a deck how many people want to research it seriously though how many people want to research a deck and you have have like material for days for years to do a deck at a time do a little unboxing and a little review of each I would love to see that I would watch you do that get high and do tarot do tarot reviews especially because as you know I have decks like from when we were first when we first became friends some of those decks they don't they don't print no more you have some beautiful Decks that are out of print hard to find decks and even if they're easy to find decks how often do you just see the one card on the back and you can't see anything else and you know being able to see a video of that would be really fun I think I think people would appreciate it yeah that would be cool stoned witch does tarot stoned witch does tarot it would be fun it would be it would be I just did a dab I just did a dab of some jet fuel gelato which is a really nice this is kind of a diamondy sauce let's see if I can show you oh yeah it's kind of really nice it has little diamonds in it it's a little little Saucier than some of your normal wax or shatter or or Butters it's very good very tasty excellent excellent I always joke with people and say that they created a national holiday for my birth which is partially correct it is time it is getting Beach weather like I don't know what it's like in California but in the east coast holy but Jesus let me tell you like it was 94 degrees the other day and you can't hate that you cannot hate that it's early summer for us I love that weather that's some of my favorite weather it's blue skies all the time we had a little bit of overcast this morning and it's a gorgeous 78 degrees today so I'm feeling a little New York weather has rolled in to kind of celebrate that you have returned to Massachusetts yeah right it was so weird I I was in New York for a couple of weeks as you know and it was like blue skies and the best weather ever I come back to Massachusetts and I must have brought that Doom and Gloom of broom with me because it has been like like it's warm and it's humid but it's like gray it is gray y so we had a little nice little gray morning but it's gorgeous so I'm definitely looking forward to Summer I'm looking forward to getting to the beach I'd love to get outside this the state is amazing for that and I know you guys like to do you and your boyfriend are all over the East Coast every time I see you on social media you're hopping here you're hopping there you're going camping you're checking out the coast you guys love the ocean you're always doing stuff shell do you have anything wonderful planned for this summer I have a couple things planned for this summer camping is a must I actually gathered up my camping stuff earlier today camping is a must there's something about you know whether you're you're of the witchy persuasion or not something about sleeping outside but you have to be in a tent because mosquito bites hurt and they itch but sleeping outside it's therapeutic it is really therapeutic and there's nothing like like I can't wait till we get together and camp this summer there's nothing like a campfire good friends big fat bowls and bongs you can't beat that well I have a secret to share I have been looking forward to Festival season and as long as monkey pox doesn't mess everything up I am planning on being back in the east coast for two weeks this summer for a major festival at one of our favorite places OMG are you talking into July yes I am are you canot wait are you talking in Western New York yes I am yay I I

why shell needs to go to Serious rising in San Kofa Festival yep yep yeah we'll use those to convince boyfriend it'll work I need you people I need you so now that we got our summer plan shell do you have a spooky story for me I'm getting pretty high over here I actually do there is a very creepy Asylum you know I love these asylums I hate asylums where do you keep coming up with these why does the East Coast have so many asylums and how do you keep finding them because they're everywhere this is actually this one actually is really close to home this one is maybe about 10 miles from my house maybe not even that far this is the creepy creepy Asylum they if you look it up online it'll say it's near Boston but essentially it's in Danvers uh Massachusetts and it was the Danver State Hospital also known as the state lunatic hospital that sounds terrible now you know how how this story starts it was built as a compassionate and enlightened treatment place they always say that I don't think any of them mean it do they know what those words mean they don't no no I don't think they do and of course true to Asylum form patients endured periods of overcrowding and abuse shocker I'm so surprised this is my surprise face shell look yeah right so surprised this one actually was featured in a in a kind of I don't want to say be movie horror movie or lowbudget horror movie but kind of a be movie horror movie lowbudget movie and hey by the way for our friends at uh we all pod down here if you are looking for a offbeat horror movie you're going to want to check this one out this would be a great one for you guys review uh from We All pod down here they were a guest on one of our episodes we had a lot of fun with them we also guested on their podcast so check them out we all pod down here wherever you get your podcast for the We All pod down here guys you know this is a movie for you it is um we'll get we'll get to the movie in a minute but anyway so this building uh 1874 all asylums were like mid to late 1800s maybe it was a thing in that period you know it was yeah maybe it was like an in fashion Maybe was in fashion for them to try to help people they all they did all start with with the idea of being compassionate and trying to solve a problem that they saw I'll give them that well the psychiatrist who um recommended this be built Dr Thomas kirkbride he was an advocate for treating mental health patients with respect so you know every every idea has a good intention initially it's just what the [ __ ] happens from there that goes Haywire how's that old saying go the road to hell is paved with good intentions correct you know he thought that having plenty of light and air circulation would promote mental health healing you know there's something to be said for that yeah I don't think he's wrong he's not wrong when your mental health is going a little Haywire go sit by a pond in the woods you'll feel better there's something to be said getting out in nature getting you know getting to do something I know it helps some people obviously it's not going to help all things you know but you're feeling a little gloomy you need a little pickme up for sure right so you know he tried to create a bunch of um private rooms for folks to give them comfort and privacy again his intentions were great they really were sounds like he had really good ideas yeah now one thing to also keep note of and and this is a different podcast that we're going to do uh later in the year more towards October Halloween time but what a lot of people don't realize is that the Salem witch trial technically didn't happen in present day Salem there you go boom I put that out there for you so spoiler alert yeah right so many people didn't real don't realize that the Salem Witch Trials um took place in at the time in whatever 1692 it was called Salem Village but now modern day is actually Danvers this Asylum is on what's called Hawthorne Hill and it's in what used to be be Salem Village the Asylum is built on what's called Hawthorne Hill and Hawthorne Hill is located in what used to be uh back in 1692 Salem Village and it's um the same what do you want to call it it's the same place where John Hawthorne had built a house and he was like basically the judge The [ __ ] who decided to kill all these people and he was the one who decided the sentences of everyone right right so so this guy who who was the judge lived on what's the modernday property of the Danver state hospital so you got that creepy energy going on oh great so it already is built on a basis of ick ick now it was like what maybe 200 years later or like 180 years later but still as as we've talked about before that ick stays with land oh yeah ick like that doesn't wash away in 200 years that's that it's going to go deeper than that I'm going to jump ahead really quick and tell you what this place is currently because I I've actually been up there they have of course you have of course you have um it it was a big complex with dozens of buildings all that's left now is a couple of the main buildings which are super cool and old and kind of like gothy looking um but the other buildings were torn down and in the main structures that still stand and in new buildings that have been built are now like rich people condos wait so like you can buy a house there ew well you know like a condo like in New York we'd call them Apartments but in Massachusetts everything's a condo but it's really an apartment in my opinion and you bu yeah and you buy it rather than rent it right and I totally want to go live there wouldn't you want to go live where the Asylum is no I do it no I would not [ __ ] yeah I'd do it you know I'd do it I know you would do it and you would love it and You' probably make friends with all the ghosts but you know unfortunately as you can tell as my stories about asylums always go it was meant to house 450 patients when it was built in 1874 by the 1920s there was more than 2,300 patients crammed in there that's like five times sh that's ridiculous and they NE the staff levels remain the same how does this always happen why does this always happened do they run out of money what the hell that's terrible the late 1800s early n 1900s they didn't think about that they just kept bringing people in not looking at the down the road so care about people at all so as you can imagine going from 400 to 2300 with the same staff levels there was a sharp decline in patient care Oh surprise shocker they did prefrontal aies they those they over overmedicated they physically restrained people if I remember correctly sh from other asylums a lot of these people were probably drunks who had sobered up uh women who were abused or people who had postpartum depression super poor folk super poor folk uh people who had some type of you know mental illness were you know maybe they had PTSD maybe you know they were in shock some of these people were just old or too sad and if the orphanages were filled this is where they sent orphaned children if the orphanages were filled as well terrible so there were kids that had no mental illness that grew up here so basically it became a Dumping Ground for the people they just didn't want to see anymore correct society's less favored grouping of people basically I gota and Let's Pretend We're taking care of them because we're sending them to the Asylum yay now in 2001 they actually did a horror movie there called session nine so for all you be movie horror folks session nine check it out the plot centers around a crew that was tasked with cleaning up his buce as they were trying to like rehab it into these apartments or condos or whatever interesting premise I know this is fiction but as we've talked about before sometimes renovation can make hauntings worse right the whole promise of session nine is they pissed off some ghosts long story short um sounds fun I like a good be movie yeah and I mean obviously session nine was not fact 100% fact but they they do touch on some factual things in there but the whole plot is essentially not necessarily true sounds fun though so they found in 1997 they found a cemetery on the grounds they didn't is this real or in the movie real oh wow they didn't have traditional headstones just numbered Graves oh no 770 oh no oh shell that's terrible yeah just numbers they reduce these people that sucks that's awful your like your headstone said 452 no well mine would say 420 but that's still terrible right the public and Danvers um volunteered and worked together and in 2002 they actually created a memorial and had a memorial service for these patients oh I love that that's really that's actually really nice and the state actually now uh tends to the land to the cemetery portion I know it doesn't matter to them anymore because they're dead but maybe it matters to something to their energy somehow or and at least to the people living I mean I think that's a nice thing to do as you can imagine you know I didn't really touch on a lot of the abuse there but you know frontal labotomy not holding people people down like [ __ ] was crazy there you got three times as many people there were they were there were missing patients patients would wander off the grounds because see as a lot of these places were in the late 1800s early 1900s it was kind of designed to like be self-sufficient like they had cows there for like milk and cheese and butter and they grew their own vegetables and you know they they were supposedly to rehabilitate the people but probably really for like cheap labor so they could have cheap food right and not spend a lot of money so as you can imagine with all this sadness neglect abuse trauma it has Stained the land and then you add the freaking Hawthorne thing from the Salem witch trials and Jesus that land is is just unhappy and it's got a history it's got a dark history visitors often report seeing Deep Dark Shadows um flitting about the property others see grayish Mists moving slowly around and following people who come to the site they follow people Fair like a grayish yeah I have only been up there a few times and I've only been able to drive around like I said it is now an active Shadow follow you I was in my car and it was did I follow your car not that I noticed are you sure because it's a Apartments now you can't just wander around but I would love to just randomly knock on someone's door and be like hey man can I bring a Ouija board in no you said no Ouija boards sh you're breaking your own rules but I am experienced and know how to oh yeah you're the expert you get to use a Ouija board you're terrible I know how to hand unlike unlike like my kid I know how to handle my business well that is true that is true but another weird thing happened on April 7th in 2007 they claim that the ghosts there burned down part of the building no no they're not allowed to do that ghosts are not allowed to do things like that nope nope nope burn down a building sh that's not no that's no the fire was so large it was visible all the way from Boston which is 17 miles away holy [ __ ] how did they start a fire that big well they don't know how it started they no they don't you turn you turn a Haun Asylum into freaking condos what do you think is going to happen a lot of unhappy condo residents maybe do they I wonder if they have a high turnover of ownership there you know I've looked into them and at the moment they're a little bit beyond my financial cap but I I've had my eye on on those on those I have I'm not gonna lie to you I'd love to live there probably a gorgeous view you just got to put up with you know a murderous misogynistic [ __ ] judge who like to hand down shitty sentences for women and uh you know tortured Ted inhumanely treated patients you know the whole people walking down the hall Dark Shadows following your guests around you'll hear the crying you'll hear the moaning very keep some incense and some salt water by the door so everyone who comes over can cleanse themselves before they leave right that's all that's all you got to do but I I've driven up the hill and I've I've driven you know around around the property it has a sadness the hill has a sadness like so there's like an aura about it you can feel the energy there if if you're sensitive to energy even if you don't know the place you're like some bad [ __ ] happened here right there's not a lot of like you know fantastic stories associated with it but people frequently see and hear things and have throughout the years and and I think that the the the biggest thing that sets this apart from other asylums is the tie into the Salem trials because that's bad ju guu to begin with right on top of bad juju like as well done it on top of an Indian burial ground while they were at it I mean my lord it's not like two wrongs you know two negatives make a positive in this case it's like two bad juju make a really big bad juju that's pretty how it goes and the weird thing is is it's in a very um [ __ ] what's the word I'm looking for it's a big hill in what is a busy area obviously it wasn't a busy area back then but they never Disturbed that whole hill there's like no business or buildings you just drive up this like wooded Hill and this is all at the very top of it it's it's it's very surreal so it seems almost undisturbed as you go up this hill until you get to the condos at the top right because everything around it is like very what is the word I'm thinking of p i don't know it's a very busy road with a lot of traffic and a lot of businesses and gas stations and this and that strip club this that and the other but you start going up this Hawthorne Hill and there's no business it's trees and grass it's just different from its surroundings urbanized is that the word I'm looking for yeah so it's not as urbanized as the surrounding area everything around it so it's like it almost like stands out and you're going back in time a little bit when you go up the hill and got this heaviness yeah you said the aura it had like a sad an aura of sadness around it yeah that sounds really creepy sounds like one of those hauntings it's more pervasive like little noises and things that you see out of the corner of your eye and those dark shadows and that uneasy terrible feeling as you're walking around right but you know and then you wonder is it Hawthorne related is it Asylum related what's going on here how much sadness is just baked into the hill itself and you know yeah they they did do like these numbered Graves but there has been rumors of also Mass Graves just bad juju man bad juju it sounds terrible sounds like an awful place now when you went up there did you bring any equipment with you or did you just go and kind of sense try to use your own senses and abilities to see what it felt like I I I went up there trying to use my own senses and abilities because it initially started out I was out doing other things and my boyfriend friend was like hey you want to check this place out I was like oh my God yeah and it's going to pass up an opportunity to go check out something that's that haunted right but then when I realized you know there's probably 100 150 condos up there so it's it's not you know I don't live up there I'm not going to go creeping around you know right nobody really wants a an unknown car driving slowly around their neighborhood that the next door and the neighborhood apps are going to go crazy right right you know I I didn't want to be invasive but I I definitely had to take a stroll through in the car the Asylum itself is gone though like the building itself is gone the main building is still there was that turned into condos or is that empty no they rehabbed it into condos actual building you could live in the [ __ ] OG building oh no I wonder if you could figure out if your room was used for lobotomies or something creepy like that um on a lot of the online sites if you look up the Danver State Hospital you can find the original blueprints of the floor plan so no no no oh creepy that's so creepy now I want to go like door to door and ask if they had any experiences that's terrible I wonder if anyone has hey you live there let us know originally there was either four or six huge buildings for housing and the main building was part housing and part like the medical Stu the labotomy and all that and there's one residential building and then the main huge building that was half residential half medical that are still standing and have been rehabbed into condos oh wow interesting interesting no one I I wonder if you can find their floor plans on Zillow like can we go kind of look at them I admit I have a would actually go in and wander around with his friends in this abandoned Asylum because the condos are new within the last five or six years so he would wander around and they would do what teenagers would do looking for ghosts and this and that a little Urban exploration and the abandon tunnels those tunnels are still there he thinks that when they built the condos they might have permanently blocked them off my boyfriend is much like me and he's like hey if you ever want to go on adventure and find out let's do this are trouble squared we are like a trespassing ticket away from fun it's not that it's an extravagant story with lots of like specific ghosts but it's definitely a very haunted location it's on one of the top nine haunted locations in the state of Massachusetts and not that I'm telling you to go creep in someone's condo complex but if you're ever in Massachusetts man it's worth a drive-thru because if nothing else that main building is so cool it's just that one of those old huge like it's it's just cool to look at if you like old Asylum architecture really is interesting I'll give it that it they do make definitely very cool looking buildings creepy cool and again the movie they made that was semi based on it and actually was filmed on location there um was session nine great movie interesting it's just a beor movie that's all so my story as well involves a place that's not really very this is a true crime and there's a tiny paranormal element but you love your true crime you love your true crime like nobody's business yeah true crime it it creeps me out man I think I looked into a lot of True Crime especially when I had kids because I wanted to know what to look out for I wanted to know what I had to be careful for and now I'm kind of interested in True Crime because the world is really shitty and sad right now and there's a lot of horrible things that are going on and yeah and it breaks my heart to look at the current news and it there's not a lot I can do you know I can donate I can I can March I can vote I can do those things so sometimes you know it's nice to look at old crime that maybe has been solved or uh and to look at paranormal things and kind of take my mind off of what's going on right now you know I can look at these things and maybe by looking at these old things I can give a little bit of a little bit of memory a little bit of honor to the victims and I can maybe learn a little bit and maybe help somebody learn a little bit to avoid it happening again you know and and you know I'll definitely admit that there's a little bit of I need to kind of take my mind off of what's going on right now and these these are things that are interesting but not something that I have to try and fix and I do hope that that for our listeners out there I do hope that you know on a serious note that you kind to find the same Solace uh with with Leila and I's little podcast project here we hope that with everything going on that everybody's doing great and we hope that we can give you an hour hour and a half of some giggles and Stony High fun stuff and take your mind off of the real world for a few yep and that's exactly what I'm trying to do so I know these things are kind of creepy and they're definitely really sad and my heart absolutely goes out to the families of of the True Crimes that we cover and the horrific crimes and things that are going on right now so that being said this area story what's your story let me take a quick puff because I'm sad now and I want to take a hit this story takes place in Northern California okay and it's called the KY cabin murders now like by the redwood forest or this is in the sea Nevada Sierra this is up in the Sierra Nevada mountains so there are red there are redwoods there this is in the community of called Ketty it's very small it's outside town named Quincy so it's also near a town in northern California called Quincy oh okay so this takes place in the early 80s there was a woman her name was Glenna Susan sharp and she went by the name Sue Sue was born March 29th 1945 she's an Aries and uh she got married kind of young to a man named uh I don't remember his name anyway she got married and her husband was very abusive they had five kids and it's rumored that he even abused the kids in multiple different ways but I couldn't find any verification so I'm not going to go there but he definitely was abusive to her so she fled him oh she interestingly enough Glenna Susan Sue sharp was born in Springfield Massachusetts no [ __ ] not too far from here yeah not too far so she lived with her husband and again he was abusive and she decided to take off she wasn't going to put up with it anymore once he started abusing the kids so the rumor goes smart woman exactly and she went to Northern California where her brother lived in outside a town called KY and he lived in a trailer park and she moved into the trailer that he and his wife had just moved out it was a little one-bedroom trailer now Sue had five kids John was about 15 Sheila who was 14 Tina who was 12 Ricky was 10 and little tiny Greg was the baby and he was five that's a lot of kids lot of kids on a one-bedroom trailer so that didn't last very long now Sue was trying to better herself she was working part-time and she was also going to college and she was basically living on welfare and student loans trying to to take care of herself her kids and make something of herself God bless her really hard to do with one kid little five right or even on your own I mean damn she escaped this abusive man she's got her kids she's living in a trailer she finds a cabin in a place called Ketty Resort and this cabin was much larger it was two-bedroom with a big basement that they could make into a room for the oldest boy John they moved into cabin number 28 in the Ketty Resort the front looks really little but it's quite a big cabin so they loved it and it's right in the middle of all these other cabins so not only did they have a lot more space in the you know in the woods they also had neighbors that had kids of the same age and children started to make friends with the people right next door the seag gates sounds like a perfect life so far I could totally go live in a cabin right now and be loving life right so she has escaped this this abusive relationship she's bettering herself her kids are in a better place things are going pretty good for Sue but but unfortunately that didn't last very long Sue I assume so Sue was described as a very private person she kind of kept to herself but a good person and she dated a dude named Daryl just a few times and that didn't work out but it was reportedly nothing special nothing crazy nothing bad well need be picky when you got five kids right everything was going good until Saturday April 11th 1981 things at the sharp family at cabin 28 were going just fine uh the two girls Tina and Sheila were next door at the seates daughter you know hanging out with the seagate's daughter and the eldest boy John he was off with his friend Dana now I have seen Dana referred to as a girl in a couple websites and I'm almost 100% sure Dana is a boy so okay I have an Uncle Dana by the way shout out to my Uncle Dana love you shout out to Lila's Uncle Dana awesome dude so John and his friend Dana went to Quincy looking for trouble basically as 15-year-old boys wanted to do at that time you know they were at a arcade they tried looking for parties it was rumored that Dana felt acid or that they were looking for acid but again that was a rumor I couldn't confirm acid like like BL paper go for a nice strip acid I got you okay I just wanted to make sure sure that I was on the same page right so at the sharp house is Sue and her two youngest boys Ricky and Greg and one of their friends uh his name was Justin now this house again like I said before had two bedrooms on the first floor was the little boy's bedroom the two little boys shared a bedroom right off like the main living room and then in the basement was another bedroom for John the oldest boy and then there was a a third bedroom that Sue shared with with the girls Tina and Sheila so the two little boys Ricky and Greg are in their bedroom with Justin playing and they planing on playing all night and then crashing in there and having a little sleepover Sue's hanging out and don't know where John and Dana were seeing in Quincy about 9:30 10 o' so they know they were there it's about 10 o'clock that night Sheila decides to spend the night at the seag gates and Tina heads home the next morning Sheila was going to go to church with the SE G family so about 7:00 a.m. she gets up at her friend's house and goes literally next door to her own house to change into clothes for church but when she opens the front door shell uh oh oh man that poor little girl she was only 14 and when she opened the door she saw her brother face up in a pool of blood and Dana face down and her mother covered in a yellow blanket with blood everywhere shell what happened Sue and John both how old was how old was the girl 14 Sheila was 14 and she saw her mother at and John both had their throat slit they were bound their hands and their feet were bound um and and there was literally blood everywhere they were all gagged all the kids were dead except Sheila she didn't know At first she saw the bodies and it apparent then she ran next door and told them what had happened and I guess the mom the Seagate mom and her oldest son they went to the house and looked in the windows and they they looked in the windows of the boys's bedroom and they were all sleeping so they opened the windows and got the boys out the window so they wouldn't have to go through the front room and see what had happened but the three little boys were all alive and they were sleeping I bet you that that that that the older boy something happened he tried to go help his mom and was a casualty of it and I'd look at the boyfriend and the ex-husband that is a theory they called 911 and of course they came right over and they found Blood on the ceiling in some rooms they found Blood on the bottom of Sue and John's feet which means at some point they had been walking around Sue and John had both been fledged with at least one type of hammer and also possibly with the butt of a BB gun and so their cause of death was blows to the head as well as loss of blood from having their throats cut oh my God the other boy Dana was also bound he was found face down and his um wounds were to the back of his head again Hammer type blows to the back of his head and he had been St he was like he was running or gotten from behind basically he couldn't have been running because his feet were tied his feet were bound he did not have blood on the bottom of his feet and he had been strangled to death instead of having his throat cut and it wasn't until it wasn't until a little bit later that investigators realized that one kid was missing they didn't know where Tina was the 12-year-old girl where' they find her they didn't they didn't find her the FBI they did eventually they did eventually but at back at the scene of the crime they found a hammer that had been used in the attack and a steak knife that had been used in the attack and they had been stabbed so viciously that the blade of the knife was bent at a 30° angle and I don't know somebody must that's horrible and you know getting your throat cut that's going to leave a lot of blood and they must have been moving at some point because there was blood in so many different rooms shell it was just horrific but how did it get on the ceiling possibly from what I understand when you cut someone's jugular there's a lot of blood spray so maybe they were stabbed viciously enough or maybe from from from the oh man that sucks maybe from uh from getting their throat cut possibly um I'm no forensic I'm no Dexter but you know there's something um Sue was found naked from the waist down and her legs were spread apart and she had blood on the inside of her thighs her underwear had been shoved down her throat that's why I was sick at boyfriend or ex-husband right her underwear had been shoved down her throat and a bandana was shoved after that and then her she was gagged with electrical tape all of them had been gagged and bound sounds personal it does it does you don't go I've watched enough NCIS and all that to know that you don't go through all of that unless it's personal supposedly according to the autopsy they didn't find any evidence of forced sexual penetration so they assumed she had not been molested but all of that sounds like maybe she had been I don't know but according to the autopsy she had not now the boys in the beginning said that they hadn't heard anything that they had slept through it there was one neighbor that was a little ways away that around 1 or 2 a.m. said that they did think that they heard what might have been muffled screams or yelling but they didn't hear much of it and didn't know where it was coming from and and so just kind of ignored it but nobody heard anything else not the seag gates NE next door not anyone else until they question you not how do you not hear that well I guess if they gagged them all early enough maybe they wouldn't have heard anything and little boys sleep pretty soundly so true you know maybe if there was some thumping and some yelling they could possibly have slept through it or just thought it was their parents fighting maybe possibly they thought Mom was fighting with somebody maybe dad came now Justin Justin een the boy that had been visiting he later said he was awake and he did see something but he also said it might possibly have been a dream how old was he I think he was around eight or 10 he's the stepson of a man named Martin smart who was one of the neighbors who also happened to be one of the main suspects oh when the investigators talked to Martin he mentioned out of the blue that he had recently lost a hammer didn't know when right like like why would you volunteer if Had A Hammer missing would you even know I probably wouldn't know a and if someone just got blood to death with a hammer down the street I probably would kind of keep that to myself just saying Justin een the little boy that had spent the night um with Sue two young Sons now he originally like the other two boys said that he had been sleeping and later he said that he may have witnessed the murders but he thought it had been a dream and under hypnosis which now I'm a certified hypnotherapist and I will be the first one to tell you that memories under hypnosis are not reliable we are not reliable chroniclers of things that we see and experience and really yeah we we're really not good at that you can ask anyone about eyewitness reports and things like that we're we're just not good at it hypnosis is a wonderful tool to help you with all sort of sorts of things you know help you get through some trauma help you lose weight help you learn to sleep better help you love yourself better it can help you with all sorts of things and it can help you remember some things but it's a better tool to help you put P the past that you may remember into perspective anyway I'm getting off topic it's not a reliable tool but they did use hypnosis on this boy to help him remember what had happened here's where things start to get weird the police department decided to use a volunteer sketch artist who had no artistic ability and no training he wasn't even an part of the police department he was just a civilian who occasionally volunteered with them they let him do the sketches of the two men that this boy said he had seen even though the FBI now the FBI was involved because Tina was missing even though the FBI offered their own well-trained sketch artist they went with this untrained volunteer something is weird about that right right from the GetGo right from the get-go and so they had some information from this boy um and he said said that Tina had come in and seen what would happened and one of the men that there were he said there were two men and that Tina had come in and saw what was going on and one of the men took her out back and then when he came back in Tina wasn't with him but that was the last anyone heard about her for a long time and the FBI did investigate her disappearance but after about a month with no leads and no clues they pretty much dropped it they just dropped it and were like a whatever yes now that's what happens when you don't have family advocating for you unfortunately and that's shitty but [ __ ] true she was a poor single mother and they pretty much did not care now the main suspect was Justin's stepfather well yeah and you said he lived near them he did he lived very close by Martin smart The Stepfather of Justin een was married to Marilyn Justin's mother and they all kind of they went to school with Sue they had kind of you know they lived nearby they also took some classes together and they were they were somewhat friendly kind of like grew up together no no she had moved here remember after being abused by her husband so she kind of she met them from the neighborhood so Martin and Marilyn were friends with Sue Marilyn more so than Martin because Martin was an excon who was reportedly very abusive to Marilyn and from all accounts Sue was trying to counsel Marilyn to leave Martin and he of course was not happy at all he also they never are he also hated Sue's oldest son John and said that he was a little punk and thought he was a little jerk and just hated him were any of the kids his any of the younger kids no okay no when Martin was questioned he volunteered that he was missing a hammer just huh I'm missing a hammer it don't know when I lost it and the police chief is noted as saying that Martin was a veritable font of tips he had all this information and all these ideas that turned out to be true and he it was always information that led away from him as being a suspect according to this police chief which I think makes him more of a suspect to be real I think so too now Martin says his Alibi was that he and his friend Bo this guy named bo bued bo bid Bo bid B I'm not really not sure how to say his last name bo we just we'll just call him Mr booby Mr booby so Bo booby was living with Martin and he says that he and his friend Bo and had taken his wife Marilyn to a bar called The backd Door bar for some drinks and that on the way they'd stopped to ask Sue if she wanted some and she said no she was going to stay home and they left and that they said that was the last time they saw her now people did report they saw them at the bar and they were dressed Bo and Martin were dressed extremely flashily fullon suits hair did shoes shined making a lot of noise about the music being too loud or not this was like the 80 the early 80s right so they were going from that disco to that weird 80s Vibe right some people also think that maybe after the murders they went there to try and give themselves an alibi and wanted to make sure they were noticed and they so they definitely did get noticed no one saw his wife Marilyn however and she contradicts his story she says she went to bed and he wasn't home and she doesn't know where he was that night oh oh she says Martin was abusive kind of an [ __ ] and always getting into fights so it's his Mo it is she left him it gets worse and worse for this Martin guy Marilyn left him like right around that same time oh now the case go cold he has a lot of things on his plate that make him look suspicious very suspicious he leaves right around she his wife leaves him and he heads off I believe to Nevada and Bo disappears as well oh none of this is ever followed up on why I I don't know it's one of those cases where it seems like all these leads came and and nothing and nothing ever came of it they just kind of dropped all these different things like Keystone cop crazy [ __ ] like you would almost have to wonder is there someone in the police force that is a part of this or hiding or covering for somebody like this sounds like the kind of shotty police work you find on a TV show like what's going on it really does and sadly like I had mentioned before the FBI did get involved trying to find Tina but even they gave up after about a month and everything just kind of stopped about three years later April in 1984 someone was hunting or mushroom hunting this the accounts vary but someone was out in the woods uhuh around near this place called feather Falls which is 50 to 100 miles depending on which account you read and they found a skull a human skull oh at around that same time the but County Sheriff Department receives a tip they get an anonymous phone call the caller says you know those bones that you found that no one knows who they are well do you remember that 12-year-old girl that went missing and KY a couple years ago maybe may you should look into that oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] the anonymous anonymous and back in the 80s I don't think that the call tracing was what it is today that call the recording of that call disappeared but they did do some testing and found out that those bones were Tina Sharps now did that did that phone call go into that same police station just well I'm not sure it went into the bu County sheriff and I'm not sure if that's the same Sheriff's Department that was searching or not the medical examiner couldn't determine exactly when she had died or how because the remains were pretty much just bones a jacket animals up in there yeah all they found were some bones a nylon jacket some jeans and um an empty tape dispenser and everyone had been tied up kind of like with electrical tape I mean the tape dispenser makes me think it probably happened pretty soon but why was she a 100 miles away from the scene of the murder anyway they determined it was Tina sharp and somehow this and the coroner felt that she had possibly died six months six months after the murder so they the coroner thinks that she was possibly alive for a period of time before she was killed and she was obviously transported at least 50 if not 100 miles away from her home so that part is extremely mysterious and no one knows what happened with that it definitely has to be in my opinion like someone who knew knew the family right the door wasn't forced there were no signs of forced entry nothing was stolen now the case kind of went cold even after they realized that that was Tina's body nothing nothing came of it in 2004 that's shitty that's so shitty the infamous cabin number 28 where the Ketty murders took place was demolished in 2004 and there's not much left of the resort Kenny Resort at all interestingly probably a good thing in 2013 the case was reopened some new investigators um Sheriff Greg hagwood and special investigator Mike gamberg found some evidence that none of the initial investigators had even bothered to look into had even bothered to find they in this pile Treasure Trove of evidence they found a letter that Maryland Martin Smart's wife had written or had received from Martin oh after she after she left him he was pissed he had been trying you know abusive dude he wants to keep his punching bag around right right in this letter that they found it Martin wrote quote I've paid the price for your love and now I've bought it with four lives and you tell me we're through great oh [ __ ] also in 2016 one of those investigators gamberg found a hammer in a pond in KY that they believe was the one that Martin had been missing and that would have been pre- DNA testing correct yes yeah back when the murders were committed it was yeah they didn't have any of that information they did find some DNA on on some of the tape they found a f a partial fingerprint and some DNA on some of the tape I don't know if it's enough to crack the case yeah but even more evidence now points towards Martin because in 2016 one of his uh counselors I guess he was um he was getting counseling at like the Veterans Administration and that counselor states that Martin had confessed to him that he had committed those murders just a few weeks after they'd happened I I know that there's a whole thing of of like confidentiality and everything but I didn't realize it extended to like murder oh neither did I Martin says that he killed he killed the W he killed Sue and her daughter Tina but he he says even up he said at the time he didn't kill the guy so I guess he's trying to say that Bo killed the two boys John and his friend Dana I don't know and and according to this counselor he says that Martin told him that he killed the girl because she had witnessed things which kind of lines up with what Justin had said now both Martin and Bo are deceased and so we'll never really know and there's some speculation that maybe they were some type of informant like Bo was involved in some type of drug group and he had special um and that's why the cops kind of brushed stuff over and that's why things kind of got hidden and brushed over wow you know so who knows is Sheila still alive I don't know you know I imagine she probably is I would have to check into that but you know the the were doing okay for a while as far as last I as far as I was able to track them I didn't track them too far into their adulthood but you know they did go live with relatives from what I understand yeah because that would have been 30 years ago so they'd be well into their adulthood at this point you know at the time that it happened it was interesting because it was just such a mystery this little girl goes missing it kind of looks like a kidnapping if they were going to kill her why didn't they leave her there why did they take her with them and did Justin see it and his stepfather was like go back to bed you didn't see anything I mean or did he really just because of the brutality of it and remembering it he started dreaming it and having some type of PTSD which would be completely understandable or did he actually witness it why weren't those three boys killed I have so many questions shell I feel like the police for whatever reason created some sort of cover up you you can't have you can't have a sheriff's office make that many mistakes and lose that many things that's right and and there was so many dropped balls here it almost seems like they didn't either they didn't care because she was a welfare mom you know single mom with five kids and who cares about the poor mom when you've got no family breathing down your neck for a resolution as well right and what are these little kids going to do they're not going to pressure the police to do anything and just a very very small town I think I saw somebody's YouTube video about it I believe said that KY is a town of 66 people oh wow and that's just very tiny you know who maybe they just didn't care or maybe those guys were part of some sort of witness not witness protection but maybe they had some sort of immunity because they were turning evidence on other crimes I have another theory I have another theory you know me and my crazy theories I want to hear what's a crazy shell Theory give it to me so you're talking Northern California yes I have never been to California I just know what I see on TV but I have watched some of these shows about the Emerald Triangle and some of the crazy stuff that goes on there where cops are afraid and just kind of look the other way because there are citizens that really run certain areas more so than the police you know what I'm talking about I have heard that you know and we did talk about that a little bit with Lisa Anne Our Guest on episode 20 and there is a lot of crimes and they say that because of the denseness of the forest and everything up there and how spread out these towns are sometimes you you never know people can go missing and you would never know and in this particular case there just wasn't enough evidence but could this be a similar case where you've got this in the middle of Jesus's ass crack nowhere in the woods where like your cop your local Town cop the sheriff is also like the Butcher and like the barber and probably the postman as well and like his wife is probably like the Midwife and the shopkeeper it might not be what we consider a sheriff's department you know what I'm saying it could be very in the middle of nowhere like what you think of when you hear the stuff about the Emerald Triangle area which is also in that area yeah exactly and maybe there was a drug aspect here you know there were rumors that John's friend Dana and possibly even John himself were involved in some sort of drug trafficking they're pretty sure that uh booby Bo was involved in uh drug trafficking himself possibly out of Chicago or some other big gangs there were rumors that he was involved in things like that so I mean could it have been a drug deal gone wrong maybe could Martin have been pissed off at Sue because she was trying to get his wife to leave him that kind of seems pretty logical I mean they have practically a written confession in that letter where he said that in order to try and keep her for people paid with their lives and he confessed to his counselor which wasn't even found out until years later I don't know just seems like a a lot of dropped balls but very mysterious I still don't believe what happened to Tina that's just so strange to me it it you know whole different podcast but it's stories like this that makes you kind of lose faith in investigators and detectives and stories like this just kind of emphasize you know with the West Memphis 3 and other cases where we will now never know what happened because of how shoddily things were treated maybe because they didn't care or they got a Prejudice right away or were shittily trained or different podcast different podcast not our Vibe not our podcast so in the spirit of cheering things up Miss bong smoker yes please do you know I just want to kind of go back to a couple of ideas that that we talked about before we talked about our stories we've kind of had an interesting an interesting show tonight usually we're both super chipper and thrilled and like I don't know it's almost like we're like Mercury retrograde Downer Debbies today so I think we should should we should end our session today with talking about something a little more fun I agree we need to bring a little light into everything right now we do we do and you know you kind of joked about we should do a little spell at the end um your little spell joke but in all reality we got another holiday coming up another another another tick on that wheel I don't know why I started saying tick on the wheel I don't know where that came you've said that for a very long time and it's just a shell ISM it is it is I even make up my own words folks so another tick on the wheel is coming and I wanted to kind of give folks because the weather is is more progress than the calendar currently some ideas on on how you can kind of celebrate the changing season it's not the summer solstice yet we get that we know when it is trust us but it's rising it's the rising summer solstice it is and but but we're getting into that season shift and not everybody experiences the same seasons as us but when you're going from like dead ass winter to like sum spring summer combo it's like life is good again there's something about the Sun the warmth the lack of layers of clothes we're we're we're making a good good shift and yeah it's Mercury retrograde but that [ __ ] comes and goes it abs and flows it's like the tides for me it's about the growing things now my garden is established my outside plants are blooming I I find a lot of solace in going outside and in growing things and in doing crafts with my kids and and being out in nature where people are and sometimes we need those touchstones especially now when things are so scary and so sad and so violent you know we kind of need to bring that fresh air you know watch some flowers grow be with the people that we love and you know do the things that we enjoy right now you know what I did today and I haven't I haven't been able to do this in a long time weatherwise you know I hate the cold I hate the cold I am like the only person on the planet who lives in the freaking Northeast that hates cold I think there's more of you than you think I think in another life I think in a past life I must have lived in Hawaii I had some time all by myself today and I had some errands to run I had some stuff to do and I was like hey I'm out of the house and I'm driving around and I'm all by myself which generally doesn't happen terribly often not that I'm complaining just a fact I was like well how can I waste x amount of time I found myself after having that thought parked on the side of the road at the beach because you know what when you got nothing better to do and you live in Salem Massachusetts get your happy ass to the ocean oh man the beach is such a nice place that's one of my happy places too I love it so much and you know being a a native New Yorker everybody in New York goes to the Thousand Islands I don't know it's a thing we all go to the St Lawrence River it's a thing and growing up my whole life going up there I got fascinated by the big ocean liners and I always called them big boats um as you're aware I've even had paintings and photographs of big boats all throughout my house throughout I just I don't know what it is about those damn boats I was sitting at the beach today and three big boats out in the ocean it was low tide which is weird around here I feel like low tide is like 30 feet lower than high tide even though I can think of with low tide is um Monsters Ink the when they look for the colognes he's like you got any wet dog or low tide that's all I can hear now when I hear the words low tide but I I because it was the middle of the day and I was driving around I did not have the opportunity to smoke and get high at the beach um but but but there is something to be said to just take in a minute take a minute people everybody needs a minute especially right now take a damn minute I like that I can't think how many minutes there are in a 24-hour period but you can take a minute to just kind of sometimes it feels like especially now there are not enough minutes but you're right if that's what we can do that's we can do you got to do what you can do and you know there's people out there we all have motivational issues on on occasion and we all procrastinate stuff and sometimes you say you're going to donate but you never get around to it you say you're going to donate and then your Tire's flat and you can't afford it you know you can do nice things without it costing exactly you can only do what you can do and and sometimes money is not a thing you can do and you know you and I live in very hustle and bustle locations where traffic is a [ __ ] there I said it people traffic it's a [ __ ] the bane of my existence it is and you know sometimes maybe you can't donate to an organization but you could let someone pull out in front of you without being an [ __ ] wave them on let them out on your neighbor see how they're doing you know see if the elderly person down the street needs help with some groceries or cutting their lawn you know things we used to do back in the day hold a damn door for God's sakes baby steps people baby and if you can donate money donate your time volunteer do things in your neighborhood to help out as much as you can we we got to look out for each other people we got to take care of each other everybody says they don't ever want their voice taken away you take your own voice away when you don't use it boom oh well I wasn't going on the vote thing but vote that's a good way to use your voice vote but for all you high people out there that are just as high as us it's not time to vote yet just so you know you got actually I'm voting we're doing primaries here in California so partial voting some places are voting but when you can vote anyway but yes good stuff and I'm going to uh I'm going to smoke some kind bud I'm going to hug my children and I'm going to go look and see if there's anything in my local community that I can volunteer and do because my brain will not let me stop until I do something I would volunteer to test marijuana right now oh I would volunteer to I want to volunteer to do that like give it a rating system like I'm all over that you have to look out you know every once in a while I get a wild crazy idea and I think I want to apply to one of these jobs where you like review pot you know you go you buy it and you review it wouldn't that be fun I don't think I'm a good enough writer to do it I just be like every single every every single strain every cultivar I be like
