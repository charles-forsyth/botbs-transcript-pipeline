guys so much for joining us now I found you guys on Facebook and absolutely fell in love your site there is so much fun and interspersed with these fun little witchy memes are these gorgeous amazing you kept that a secret for me you didn't even tell me that you found them I did no she didn't tell me I knew nothing nothing yeah once I found you guys I knew our one year Ann first we was coming up so I knew I had to get in touch with you and have custom brooms made because that is something you lovely ladies do and we were very excited to get them I have of course scoured your website because I'm a big fan and Monica now your bio says that you are a Halloween born witch well actually day before hey that counts day before day after before yeah I call it all Halls Eve Eve I love that that time of year has always been really really significant to me and an to me and so ever since I was you know a little one um just I always been drawn to kind of U you know magical things and occult things and um yeah when I was in my early 20s I was initiated officially into the craft by a well-known witch and herbalist up there in Upstate New York Susan weed so you may have heard of her she has a couple published books really excellent wise woman herbalist and um that kind of officially kicked off my journey I guess but it's always been in there you know so I've been practicing the craft for about 30 years then and but the broom broom thing is fairly new but you know kind of fits right in there and is just a great you know continuation and extension of of my practice you know I was gonna ask you Monica how many times as a kid did you actually dress up as a witch and have a broom every Halloween I think like a black hat me have slipped in there on that sounds familiar same yeah now hasper you and I had a bunch of synchronicities when we were talking while I was keeping things secret from Shell they just kept popping up and one of them I think is that um not only is someone in your life an Aquarian but we also share the same birthday and I think you're a Gemini I am a Gemini you'll have to tell me your birthday again and then I could tell you February 1 oh that's my mom's birthday yeah but I have an aquarium is rising so what's your Gemini birthday because I'm a Gemini yeah May 23rd oh you know that that's the day before my dad I'm May 31st oh well I had a chihuaha with that birthday see synchronicities make a synchronicity anywhere that's right so tell us about your witchy journey I think well you know I have very unconventional parents and so basically I was raised by very open-minded new aged hippies and they were incredibly accepting and encouraging of um exploration particularly in theology or philosophy so we had access to just about everything when we were young so when I talk about like books that I've read you know like I was reading them as a kid even but I think when I my first introd introduction to Witchcraft was really in the early 90s so when I was a teen I think like most people and I came across like Scott Cunningham's book like incense oils and breu and that was like the very first book that I ever great book by the way yeah it is a fantastic book and so then I just kind of read everything along that genre and I was fortunate enough to work in a metaphysical bookstore when I was a teenager too so then again I had access to all these great resources um I live in the midwest so I have not a super strong connection but I have um uh a connection to Circle Sanctuary because that's not far from my area so I had been up there but no fancy initiations or anything like that I did study I think oh gosh and Monica and I were trying to remember cuz I was going through like a priestess program again back in the 90s and I don't even remember that's how bad my memory is which one it was that's terrible was it sisters of Avalon I can't remember it was sisters of Avalon yeah and so but then again you know I I never really did anything substantial with it isn't very solitary and to me it's always just been a personal journey and it's really changed but when I look back back it's been like over 30 years of practice and research anything in the occult I think I've always had a fascination with even as a really young kid so that's kind of my journey now I'm very curious now now shell and I met in the Southern Tier of New York kind of over Rocky Horror Magic the Gathering Spades and Witchcraft I think when we were it sounds like fun yeah it was so what what's your uh what's your meat cute story for your friendship how did you guys get together okay pagor here we go um we are actually relatively new friends too and again the synchronicities were astounding we met online which is kind of partun we both it's a new way to meet people it's pretty common now I bought a house the town that she grew up in in Galina and I won't interrupt I'm just going to add into your story hus but I'll let you tell the story but I'll start it off by saying I bought a house um in Galina we'd been visiting that town for about a decade and just fell in love with you know the driftless area which is just the unglaciated area it's the part of the Midwest that the glaciers didn't flatten so it's not flatten boring like everything else and it's just gorgeous Rolling Hills and you know has a lot of historic charm and I've always been into Old homes and antiques and everything like that so I fell in love with it over a decade ago so we finally purchased and then I was like hey I wonder if there's any other is in this area and so I searched for like a witchy Facebook group and then we were all introducing ourselves and that's that's how we met go ahead you can you can finish well yeah we met very casually on this uh driftless Pagan Group Forum and I think it wasn't like we had like the best introductions or anything like that I don't even know how we really started I feel like I I know I want to take credit like of course you do of course yes I don't know what it was we just loveed each other right away no you posted a picture of yourself dressed up with your hubby at you know as the whole fantastic beast in your Harry Potter room and I was like oh my God who is that woman dressed up in that fabulous costume standing in that fabulous room filled with all these magical things and she seems kind of crazy and it's wonderful and I really hope she'll be my friend that's what I remember thinking yeah yeah I just I don't know we I think you were talking more about your house outside of that group think you messaged me first I did I think maybe about your home in Galina or something like that and it turns out just the more we started communicating the more we realized how actually connected we were not only did she buy this historical house she bought the house right next door to my childhood house wow you know that was kind of neat and even in house that I had spent a great deal of time in growing up because ownership had changed and I had friends that lived there and things like that so that was neat but we also shared the love of the same art form so we're both like needle filters and she had well of course I was like stalking her a little bit on Facebook you know like looking at her profile I think this was before we were even friends but I was just like who is this  you know it was like a mutual infatuation yes and um and so I saw an image of like a Needle felted rooster that she did and I'm a big needle felter too so I think at that point I messaged her like OMG I'm sorry but like you're my best friend now I hope you go along with it so I hope we've been Inseparable since really like you know she's the first person I contact in the morning she's the last person I contact before I go to bed and all day long there's constant correspondence and we joke about how we share a brain but really it's like we kind of do yeah yeah I get that there was a point in mine in Lea's relationship where um my first EX husband was starting to ask if she was going to contribute to the lights and gas bill yeah I was there maybe a little bit a little bit maybe a day or two a week so out of this friendship this infatuation obviously you're both Crafters which I love shell and I are both Crafters um how did the broom thing happen well I want to take credit for that okay so yeah I I said to hper one night I was like wouldn't it be so cool I remember seeing something about a learning how to make brooms Workshop here in the Chicago area and she's like oh my gosh yes and so I looked it up and um I think it was a place called Sideshow Gallery here in Chicago and but they weren't offering it currently well this is like right still in like the scope of covid and um I couldn't find any classes couldn't find anything and found something online and I was like oh my gosh I found this person who teaches room making classes online you know let's you know let's think about doing this and the next thing I knew she's like oh yeah I thought about it and I signed up for like the next five classes she's always miles ahead so I went on to Etsy and I found these handmade brooms um I understand now that they are made on traditional um handwork machines so they were machine made but handmade with machines if that makes sense um but they're beautiful they're black handle and all black and you know I sent her one and I a little note included that says we ride at midnight nice so it was like that's kind of like what kickstarted everything so yeah hper was the first one to actually watch uh the tutorial and learn how to make a whisk and then I was a few months behind her just kind of getting through the holidays myself and um visited our home in Galina over that uh holiday break in 2021 and she came over and she showed me in person because I'm a very visual learner how to make a whisk so I made my first whisk there and I'm looking at it hanging in my kitchen right now but um so she actually showed me how to do it because she had been Mak making them for a couple months already am I remembering it right yeah your recall is good yeah for the most part yeah we both really just dove in it like once we started we just didn't stop and then I think it seemed like such a a um a natural art form for both of us and very instinctual as well and so it well it is difficult to do it's not that Brew making is easy it it can be learned just like any skill or trade can be learned by repetition and practice and whatnot but it's it's just something I think we both enjoy doing and it consumed our lives like yeah very much you know like our hands kind of remembered it was a remembering that's the best way I can describe it so but we look at some our early brooms and we're like oh my God they're fugly oh yeah so there's definitely been you know an improvement with our application to the craft and it's so nice to see that progression and Artistry you know with attention I'll be honest I am blown away and you know I'm definitely putting on my customer service space while you were telling your story because I am in utter shock these like I've got mine right here behind me and like this damn thing looks like you been doing this for 20 years like this is top this is freaking topnotch thank you you can tell from the pictures online your Etsy Shop your website on your Facebook my gorgeous hagatha you can tell the magic the love the beauty I can see that your hands remembered because these are gorgeous I mean the colors the things that you put on them the dried flowers the crystals the care you took everything you would want a witch's broom to be these are a they are I'm absolutely phenomenally in love with my broom as hesper knows I named it before I even got it that was a good sign I saw the picture and I was like that one's mine that one's Shell's and her name's hagatha so to make and they do actually they are a sister set which is not easy to do I mean every room is different of course everyone is completely unique you can't really remake the same broom twice you can make it similar but it's not the same but even the sticks and they're both on ashxs are similar they're almost mirrored in a way which is like they are if they're together they they're a set I loved it I that's why I knew that when Lila's had traveling issues that's why we knew that that that it would arrive because one arrived the other had to it just had to now I'll link in the show notes the episodes where we talk about my poor broom's journey and Shell's mean part in it it's your own fault seriously I'd do it again in a heartbeat but honestly even though it took well over a week or so more than it was supposed to I honestly was never worried you guys said that you have never lost a broom never oh that's true I had no doubt I got a little angry with people when I was emailing people because they're like well just contact the company and have them send you another one I'm like you don't understand there is no sending another one this is a set their sister rooms they're beautiful you can't break up a set but I knew that it was coming and I did have a lot of guilt because it was a surprise for me my broom showed up right before I was traveling from Massachusetts to New York to go see Lea and I'm at her house for four days and UPS was just not coming and I knew I had almost quasy cursed it so I'm feel I was feeling such guilt and this guilt was like inperson guilt and and I'm like no it'll be here before I leave it'll be before I leave and I left and I was like God damn it it isn't there but didn't it show up like the day after I left the next morning yep the next morning it showed up it was better all right so Monica hesper I have some questions now shell you're gonna have to play this game too okay all right let's do this so we're gonna test everybody's friendship so I'm gonna ask you some questions I feel like I need a buzzard these are like a who is question so you'll answer either with your own name or your friend's name so whoever is most likely or least likely to do whatever these questions are oh I'm excited I don't know the questions oh gosh I'm kind of afraid all right so first question now I know our listeners are going to know the answer for shell and I but in your friendship who is the around and find out one I think that's you Monica that is you Monica you and I are the same the same I'm a Scorpio you know so I'll just blame it on that you know I you know it takes a lot to get me rattled but then you know you want to  around to find out you ask for it all right you ready sh we're gonna answer sh definitely all right so who is the Practical one again Monica yeah I'd have to agree all right say a name shell are you ready yep really you think I'm practical the hell sometimes yeah no probably me I'll take organized you get practical okay that works I'll go with that that's that's fair all right so who do people think is scarier Monica I think this is you again I don't know do I win a prize so shelle who do people think a scarier show and so second question is who is actually scarier so on the day we'll go with hper really I still think it's you but you know I have a good defense answer for this okay I know that I come across as a scary one and I know that nine times out of 10 in reality I am the one to be scared of but you get Leila to that point man and she if you get her to that point I'm nothing for sh the line's right here for me the line's way over there so I think you geta to that line she blows me out of the water yeah I'd have to agree with that okay next question hasper and Monica who is most likely to be killed if they were in a killed first if they were in a horror movie I think that's me you think it's you asper it is me know I don't know do you think it's you Monica I don't know I got some fight in me so I don't know would you to like duke it out to the end would you be the sole survivors I'd be like I'll go ahead and die I'm not playing any silly games I'm not be tortured there's worse things than dying I'll I'll go first that's fine take me grab onto your broomstick witches back after these messages hey all you witches pagans heathens and magical Souls shell and I want to give a big thank you to all of our donating patrons and we want to

April 8th thank you so much to everyone who's donating to back on the broomstick it really helps out the show keep it witchy all right sh what do you think who's who's gonna die first I think it's gonna be me because I'm around and find out and because I am the I'm the one that's going to test the limit right from the get-go I always say that when when the world goes to pot you're the one I need to be with because you're going to be the one who's going to save me I'm going to be the one that's going to get us killed a see I would I would say I would like to think that we would go together to the end we would be together we would beat it and we'd survive at the end but alone I'd be dead first all right next question who is most likely to accidentally summon a demon while cranky it's a tie I don't know I love how sweetly you said that well but like with Monica there's no accident about it like if she's pranking gonna summon a demon it's coming no accidents there did did somehow were were Monica and I cut from the same cord I think so that was my second question is who is most likely to summon a demon on purpose well cranky Don't make me say it I feel like this is the shell in Monica show painful magic but you know hey everybody needs an itchy  spell around right right so who is most likely to get a random tattoo on a night out oh that's probably hper got an Aries moon I'd go with Lea I think that would be both of us yeah I'd go with Lea yeah I I'd be down for that random tattoo yep I'm I would do that speaking of which there may or may not be a tattoo in our future at the end of this month Poss what well we'll tell you guys but we won't tell anyone else but it's going to be a yay on our tat list yes I love that we'll send you ours so you'll have to send us yours when you get them but nobody knows yet so it's a secret all right who's most likely to be a low-key conspiracy theorist oh that's hper me me mea no I am no you said lowkey that's where you oh that's true I'm low key you're high key that's where you just nixed me out of it when you said low key good point very good point I I con seeed point because I am a loud and proud conspiracy theorist Bigfoot is out there damn it and I'm true that's true okay I'll give you that one on a technicality all right our first podcast we um mostly talked about paranormal events and ghosts and and things like that and I'm telling you every single place has a portal to Hell really I don't know why but they all do so out of the two of you who is most likely to stumble upon a portal to Hell Or Another Dimension ER think she grew up with one yes I did oh now I would say me but in m and huser's defense we'd also be dragging Leila and Monica who would actually willingly go okay just because we find it doesn't mean they're not willingly going with us that's a good point so this leads me to my last question which you may have already answered a little bit but who has lived in the most haunted places oh H me me me me yeaha I would say me although shell has lived in some pretty haunted places until that time I spent the night at your dad's house and just wanted to run screaming different podcast we'll talk about that another time but it sounds like hasper you you lived in a place with a bad portal or a bad ghost I wouldn't say bad I just not bad yeah a lot of activity in my childhood home growing up with the one that's right next to the house that Monica had purchased and um the town that we live in Galina Illinois is notorious for its own sort of Paranormal Activity and yeah I just think every little house that I have been in has had something not my current house but and nothing terrible nothing really frightening I think the most frightening place I ever lived was actually a place in Chicago where I lived but yeah just weird stuff can't explain it I love that yeah same thing very active I wouldn't say bad necessarily although there were some places that yeah I would say really not that bad just active that one bedroom just that one room the one I made you sleep in all right so on your website you have a page of broom lore and I loved it uh because I also have a you know obviously back on the broomstick we also have a whole bunch of broom lore so is there any particular broom lore that's your favorite or anything that you think about while you're creating brooms question well the first thing I always think of when you say broom L is that scene in Practical Magic of course one of my favorite movies same when you know when one of the ants says you know broomf company's coming and you know one of the pieces of broom I love the most is if you know somebody's overstaying their welcome you want to get guests to leave or not show up at all you just put a broom bristle up by the door yes and I think that works I may or may have not not have tried that out before but I do think it works it's something about a bristle up room which is like see you later time to go boundaries just to add a little bit to that in some different places depending on what folk magic tradition you follow I've heard some people like bristles up because that keeps the luck in the broom I've heard that so they keep bristles up regularly to keep the the luck in the broom so I think for them turning it upside down like if you normally keep it right side up if you turn it upside down that's kind of like the switch to get people out of your house so if you normally keep it bristles down and you turn up bristles up just like Monica said that's that's lore I've heard to get somebody out of your house or just keep it that way by your front door just kind of like I don't want anyone coming in at all I think origin of having it bristles up is also for a practical reason because you'd never want to store a broom actually sitting on its bristles because it'll just you know mess with the longevity of the broom and we we've seen some brooms that are hundreds of years old that are still in like decent condition because broom corn lasts a really long time when it's cared for properly so you know we put little hanging loops on our brooms just for the purpose of not actually storing them on their broom on the on the bristle part you know that could be part of that lore of keeping it bristle up but I've heard that also you know keep it bristle up to keep the luck in and then you know the thing about just brooms symbolically sweeping away the negative and clearing out your space you know and sweeping through your house you know opening both doors and going from the front door and sweeping everything out the back door as just a form of energetic cleansing and magical clearing is something that you know we do ourselves and we encourage and I think it's a good practice spring cleaning yes I mean brooms are one of those really amazing sympathetic Magics I mean if you think of what a broom actually does that's what it does magically like in Practical Magic which shell and I love too at the end of the movie all of the neighbors all the women get together with their regular mundane brooms to you know trap that energy and then sweep it out of the house that's a another bit of broom lure I've heard is you're always supposed to sweep from the center out of a room you're not supposed to sweep into the center is that the whole point of sweeping away yeah sweep away those bad energies kind of thing but again it kind of follows a very practical you know if you think practically what the broom is doing that's what it's also doing magically and I love tools like that that's one of my favorite magical types of tools me too I'm a big practitioner of sympathetic magic like it has to make sense to me symbolically in order for it to be meaningful in my brain and connect on that magical level so and brooms are definitely a magical tool that's easy to do that with I know on your website you say that um all of these these gorgeous brooms that you folks make can also be used to actually clean oh yeah you first of all I want you to to to just talk about that real quick but second of all I just want put it out there this thing is so damn gorgeous I would never dare sweep my kitchen that would be blasphemy to me blasphemy but but they are you can use the brooms that you guys make for actual practical oh yeah I would feel horrible doing it well ours are ours are special they're you know these ladies were created for Magical use not necessarily I know but I'm just saying in general the brooms that that that they offer on the website yes they're made out broom corn which is sorghum vulgar did I say it right and it's a type of grain you know that's what's been traditionally used especially to make American brooms for hundreds of years and they really do sweep they you know the little bristly ends pick up all the dirt and dust and everything else and they really do sweep and I actually clean my workspace with a whisk broom a handheld whisk broom that I made when I was first starting out and I still use it to sweep the floor I'm a little obsessed with broom corn I love growing things so I've actually started looking into how to grow it so I'm going to try that going to try it'll be fun but I heard that was it Benjamin Franklin introduced broom corn into the US so a little history there for you I also see on your website you guys sell um hand fasting brooms which are so gorgeous I think those are very very beautiful do you know any broom lore about hand fasting and broom I think there's a pretty rich tradition and it actually comes from a lot of different uh cultures too about like jumping the broom to symbolize you know fertility protection of the marriage but really I think it is The Binding of the two you know the two energies together so a lot of our brooms are done on sort of a forked stick it looks like a couple yeah they do they look it looks like a couple holding each other I love it yeah and so they come from a lot of different cultures and people um talked about the African origins or like the Celtic Origins uh predominantly so again but a lot of times too I think hand fasting in general or wedding traditions have changed and or have been modernized too where either they're using it as um like a purification or protection of the actual ritual or right place or the actual like jumping over it as the symbolic we're we're reaching this threshold together we're we're going into our next life together as part of that traditional I I've actually used a broom and did a broom jump in a hand fasting and I think that the symbolism for me is that I look at a broom as both male and female you know how Certain Magical tools either have a like a male aspect you know the Chalice is very feminine the athme is very masculine I find a broom to be kind of both they are male and female the bristle is the the feminine aspect and the fic aspect of the stick is obviously the masculine aspect so it's the joining of those two energies which make it perfect for a hand fasting ritual tool I think I think so too it's also very symbolic of a home and you're joining homes and you're creating a home when you get married or hand fasted and a broom is a I mean you see a broom you immediately think of your house I mean where else you don't really see brooms outside too terribly much they're usually in a home so what better symbol of a house or a new house together than a brand new broom another piece of broom lore is that you're supposed to um never bring an old broom from your old house to your new house you should leave it there or and you should bring a new broom into your new house it's your own magical broom yes magical brooms are different different tool but yeah a broom for cleaning I think and that's just a symbol of you know a new beginning with your new space which makes sense I don't know if this is maybe a regional thing but I've actually in Upstate New York moved into several Apartments where you move in not a damn thing in the place except some Rando broom and it's just like you took all your personal belongings and you left a broom in the corner but that's happened at more than one place when I was younger I moved into common gift too to uh to give somebody a a bro when they're moving into a new house so hopefully they weren't leaving their old crusty broom behind maybe it was a gift of a new one I don't know no unfortunately it was it was pre-loved oh okay we'll call it pre-loved a symbol of protection so you know I know that a lot of um customers buy our Broms to hang them by the front door or above a door um because again it's that whole thing of you know here's a protective barrier I'm only going to let the good in you know sweep away the negative um also cleansing for anybody that comes through that door I mean there's all sorts of ways you can magically charge a broom with intention while you're hanging it up so and we've you know been sent lots of great pictures by um customers who have bought brooms from us and they're doing just that they're hanging by the door or above the door and they look great and they're doing their job and we're you know we're happy to populate the world with brooms I am too because these are beautiful and I have now I have I don't know if you can see it but I have a like a regular Dollar Store broom that the the coven here that I work with uh gifted everybody in the circle and they actually spoke about Practical Magic and we put the brooms together kind of like they did in in that movie to form a circle and I love this broom it's a dollar store broom it's plastic and metal but I do love it it's definitely itely still a magical tool even though it's it's the intent that was put into it exact yeah exactly so I'm not going to you know I'm not going to shame her she's you know a dollar store room it's okay but my the but having you know having a magical tool that's crafted by an artisan with obvious love and care and dedication I I'm thrilled I know you said before that that matching those the the shafts of the broom wasn't easy for shells and my sister broom and I really appreciate that I knew it was kind of a big ask when I said I didn't want them to be twins I kind of wanted them to be sisters and you you guys definitely came through but it's details like that that you guys do in these brooms that truly make them special and I I really really appreciate that well you're welcome thanks for reaching out to us that was a real honor for us to do that and from my perspective it was like the most amazing surprise Leila tortured me and like I don't take secrets well unless I'm the one keeping them and even then I'm usually the first one to like spill my own damn secret when you're trying to hide something from me it takes like a feet of Epic Proportions to pull it off and she did it all I knew was like what was it a week before you just said you're gonna get something in the mail and I'm like well what am I get in the mail I don't know I can't talk gotta go by and you know I I see this big thing and I'm like I know that's a broom the only thing that could be is a broom and you know I said this on the episode we we had an episode where we talked about when we got them or right when I got mine and Lea waited I have to point out and I pointed this out in that episode people are not going to get something that is better packed for shipping than these brooms like I have never seen something packed for shipping so thoroughly and so safely this thing could have gone through a nuclear bomb and still would arrived in my hands in perfect condition but after 20 minutes of opening it because it almost took me that long I just couldn't believe what I was looking at because again for me I had no idea this was a total surprise I had no idea what I was opening and I was just I had no words when I was opening this and saw this so you guys do an absolutely amazing job absolutely amazing yay your Facebook page is so much fun you guys definitely have a lot of fun along with crafting these beautiful brooms we don't take ourselves too seriously at all and part of you know I think our journey as friendships too is that we have a very similar sense of humor which is kind of you know we're an acquired taste too not everybody gets us not you know like we're not for everybody we're a little out there yeah and so that's just part of who we are that's that's like essentially we're just goofy a little dark oh maybe very dark um but fory I think if you're going to understand us as artists or as people or as creators that that's a big part of it is that we're going to have fun while we're doing it I think that's the important part of it or what's the point I mean have fun doing it or what's the point oh I love that yes that applies to so many different things it really does Lea mentioned your your socials and your website and I have a burning question because I am a a a closet cat lady maybe not so closet who has the gorgeous cat that's on your website because I got to know that gorgeous is it Charles is he kind of the cross-eyed goofy looking crossy yeah yeah that's that's mine so I have I had three cats now and he just showed up I live in the forest so there's about 500 Acres of woods behind me and he just showed up one February with a big gash on his face and he was KY I know he wasn't doing too good and I I did not want to like him at all I'm a cat lover but I was like not another cat not another cat I mean I'll get him fixed and I'll get him shots and we'll treat his wounds and everything but then he's just going to be an outside cat no not he's so lovable um but that's Charles and yes he is you know officially a broom Squire he's gorgeous who's the Baba Yaga fan oh that's yeah both of you I see Baba Yaga a lot there and I just love that tale and and she's pretty amazing one our obsessions I think
