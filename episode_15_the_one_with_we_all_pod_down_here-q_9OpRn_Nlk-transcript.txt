so shell I'm a little nervous today so I'm kind of pounding down joints of of my homegrown I've rolled a whole bunch so that I can just keep smoking them one after another to try and calm my nerves power smoking right because tonight we're having Britney and Dan on from the podcast we all pod down here and I want to make a good impression it's witchcraft [Laughter] [Music] hi welcome to the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast we smoke weed and scare the crap out of each other with stories of True Crime and the supernatural I'm Leila and I'm shell so while we wait for our guests to arrive I am smoking way too much what are you smoking today I'm actually I got a new one today I love when you get something new you're always willing to try something yummy what did you get and I always get so excited too you do I'm like a kid in a candy store um Mac one it's called it's a hybrid this one is 36.2 THC oh yeah oh yeah shell going for the big stuff reaching for the top shelf right away every time love it you know for for anybody out there who's taking notes each week on the percentages that I smoke we're going up here friends I seem to be getting no I seem to be finding stuff lately in like the mid to Upper 30 percentile and I'm kind of happy about it that's great that's really nice one of the things about the gas station that I don't love is that not all their stuff has the percentages on there so just a little bit nicer when places do but their customer service topnotch cannot be beat I'll tell you I will settle for slightly inferior product not that this is but I would for really great customer service because you guys always talk about great bud tenders and I'm so jealous but some of the guys out here are pretty great I I I do feel bad because it seems like your experiences have not been consistently as Stellar as mine customer service wise that's true well I'm going to start going to some high-end Bud places because I want to start trying some of these um Stoner celebrity weeds and just to see what all the hype is about so I'm gonna go into some bougie Stoner shops and I'll report back and let you know how that goes definitely definitely so tell about this Mac tell me about the Mac one it's kind of got like a like a flowery taste and I'm not talking like flower what people call weed but like flower like what you buy your girlfriend on a holiday flower I love cannabis that has that kind of flower that bouquet I love that so much floral floral scent call me a girl but I like that but it it it's not overwhel it's not like that overwhelming you know how sometimes you get that weed that kind of tastes like perfumey it's not like that at all yeah no this is like an it's almost like a a natural floral flavory scent yes anything I get that's too intense I automatically suspect that they're putting tpin in it and again don't mind as long as they tell me but right you know if you're going to flavor it up all grapy intense and then try to pass that off as natural weed I'm G to be a little Su you know that that's kind of sucks because you know pot doesn't taste that intense you get a hint of it you know so a nice hint of floral sounds fabulous how's the high it's it's actually really good it is an indicia but very it's a very good daytime smoke I love a good daytime Indica love it this is definitely not a calm you down get you ready for bed melty into your bed kind of thing this it like I said it says hybrid but it's really is it one of those kind of Zone into work and really get your [ __ ] done listening to some great music and being productive kind of weeds yes absolutely absolutely hey and that is perfect timing Britney and Dan our guests for this evening have arrived joining us today in our search for truly spine tingling Tales are Britney and Dan from the podcast we all pod down here hi guys why don't you introduce yourselves and tell us a little bit about your podcast hey so I'm Britney um and our podcast we basically just go in and talk about horror movies uh we also do dive into kind of just ranking them sometimes sometimes we just review individual movies um and Dan and I are married so Dan's my husband and I'll and I'm from Maryland originally but we both live in Florida now um and I kind of really got into horror as a kid I actually grew up just a like within about a f minute walk of burkettville Maryland where the fil so now that is one of my favorite movies but before we get in there let's say hi hi so yep I'm Dan um she's certainly my better half um I'm from monoville Pennsylvania if you're familiar with the town monoville it's probably from Dawn of the Dead Oh all the dead movies are filmed in Western Pennsylvania where I grew up so that's how I got into horror was Night of the Living Dead and more excellent movies yeah that series of movies is will always be my favorite and what got me into it it's such a big cultural thing the Pittsburgh area so you two essentially got together and got married based on the fact that you were both originally from towns where horror movies were sparked from almost we actually oddly enough met because of um mutual interest in heavy metal we have um friends that are from all over the world that listen to metal and we they ended up Mutual ones introduced us so yep that's how we met and then now you're wearing a t-shirt of a of a heavy heavy metal band and this one's kind of important right yes so I'm wearing my um self- good t-shirt it's from my friend Serge's band he's actually from Ukraine originally uh his family still lives over there and so of course with everything going on in Ukraine we thought we'd show him a little support uh he just had a new album come out so if anyone wants to check it out um we can give you guys the link if you'd like definitely we'll put links to that down in the show notes for sure and hopefully does he know how his family is doing are they safe some of them I think he's found I don't know if he's found his yet unfortunately I think I think his mom's okay as far as I know I I think she might have gotten out of there a little while ago but like before all this madness started but um yeah he's originally from one of the occupied cities that was occupied a long time ago and yeah he's he see his family has seen some really terrible stuff he's a really wonderful guy I've known him for a very long time he lives in Pittsburgh now that's where I met him through the through the metal scene there yeah and that's how you guys met too so our our hearts definitely go out to them and again we will put some links in the show notes if if you want to support the band or check them out excuse me if you want to support the band or check them out we'll have some links there for you yeah they're they're really great they have all of pagan themes actually oddly enough when he did one of his interviews He got interviewed by one of the big metal websites because originally they put up an article about like some of the Ukrainian bands and his part got taken down because apparently some Russian Bots like went to them claiming that he was supporting like neo-nazis and stuff but but what they found was that what they were claiming was quotequote supporting neo-nazis was actually a pagan symbol in a photo that he was in and they were like look it's a Nazi symbol it's like no this was a totally Pagan symbol had nothing to do with Nazis so that's a big problem with some of the symbolism is a lot of the old nsis symbolism a lot of old Hindu symbolisms Al symbols have also been co-opted by Nazis so you know you kind of run into a little problem there not that I'm saying all I I know some heavy metal has to do with old Norse thing I just just throw yeah it's it's a big thing for sure there's entire sub genres of metal dedicated to that really I didn't know that now Britney can you tell us again one more time what is the name of the band his band is called self good okay one word self God self God it's one word so and we're gonna have um a link uh put up on a tag to this episode for them awesome thank you guys y thank you now you guys talk about um horror movies and you talk the way I found you was um the deep house is that the the title of the the deep house I had just watched that movie and was kind of looking it up because it was interesting to me and I saw your podcast and it was you liked it Britney and I don't think you liked it d as much I I I liked aspects of it there are certain things I felt like they could have done a little better but overall it wasn't bad there's just little details like the whole premise was brilliant I that's what I liked about it I think kind of the horror of the relationship itself you know getting and getting trapped in that but again different podcast but I do have a serious question though very very important question for my horror movie of fici andad here who is it that dies first the most in movies is it the stoner or is it the person who is having sex oh I think it depends but I would say a tough probably some words AC cross there's probably some words AC cross would say probably this the Stoners would die first mostly I knew it I knew it why I I my guess it's because the stereotype would be that they're just so relaxed and not paying attention out of it not not not paying attention to their surroundings kind of thing maybe like they're just kind ofed out have you seen the the rise of Leslie Vernon no I have not there's a really funny part in there there basically it's it's very much like screaming that it's kind of like making fun of itself a bit you know and being very like meta like that but supposedly the basic premises these people are following around the guy who's supposed to be the next like Jason Vorhees or Freddy Cru something like he wants to be the next one so it's kind of like as if this is like the real world and they're just following him around to see how kind of thing yeah his preparation and everything yeah like how he prepares and it makes fun of itself the whole time you know just it's really silly but there's a point where they have the Stoners and he's like the Stoners are going to be right there so I can get them easily and so it like has like and here's the people having sex and there's the people that do this wrong and it's really funny but I think you guys the Brownie and the Stoners the first to go right they're gonna come running exactly they actually I actually I love my favorite movies of all time um is the the Friday the 13th series um granted the wor the the more they make the worse they get like Jason should never be in Manhattan I'm just saying or in space in space but that's where it kind of got ingrained in me that if you're having sex you're the first to go first to go Jason's G to get you and gets you too that's but is as a side note I thought it would be very interesting to point out to you to you guys today is is our guests that this past Halloween um my boyfriend and I went as Jason and Michael he is he he's a a big Michael Myers fan so he was Michael and I was Jason with Tails but it was cute it was cute I love it that's awesome I might have had the pigtails but I had the machete in the whole bit yeah she's the most adorable serial killer you'll ever see I think hey our our pitch was the killer couple there you go I love it now I do find that um there are several movies out there the first movie I ever saw cannabis in was um uh Poltergeist polter with the parents smoking in bed they're kind of smoking a joint and it was revelatory to me because they weren't they weren't Slackers they weren't kids they weren't being stupid they were just a couple of adults smoking a joint at the end of the day and they didn't die which I thought was really great they were actually the heroes of the movie so I thought that was cool but there's other movies like uh what the scary movie franchise doesn't somebody die by a pot plant in one of the in the scary movies so I can't remember which one but don't remember which one of them yeah so but do you guys have a favorite horror movie or anything well you had mentioned because of growing up in pit the Pittsburgh area you familiar with the the Dead series yeah dawn of the Dead's number one for me there there's nothing that even comes close we just did a ranking where we ranked our favorite franchises and like that one's my top and that's the the quintessential horror movie for me what makes it the quintessential like is it because it's so scary is it because it's so fun it's psychologic I love psychological horror I don't usually like horror that's just about blood and guts torture por and stuff I think that's really stupid I totally agree with you stuff that has no story no plot no nothing the the whole idea of zombie films that George rer tried to put into them is a lot of social commentary uh they placed it in a mall because you looked at people in the mall and thought they look like zombies just walking around to store to store and the whole I the whole like he was like the anti-consumerism kind of thing and how it messing up a lot of things in society and the whole idea of a zombie apocalypse is a real psychological thing because no matter how now there's fast zombies so zombies whatever but like it's the impending doom and that that no matter what you do they're still coming for you and trying to survive because it's a lot about it's a human story too about survival and for me those themes just hit really good for me it's interesting because right now I I loved horror movies when I was a kid and then when I had kids I kind of stopped for a little while because it was too real and now I like them again and I think because it's the world is so [ __ ] up and everything's so bad I'm like well okay maybe it's almost World War II but at least it's not World War III with zombies and yet yet yet you know I'm not GNA try and give the universe any ideas here but I think that's a little bit of an escape for me right now is is watching things that are scarier than real life I think but do you have a favorite Britney this is always tough for me because I have like for our ranking I actually ranked Godzilla for the franchises that was my favorite because that's kind of what I grew up on uh of all things like my parents always would be like this is too scary for you don't watch it and then I'd watch it and then and then I would be scared and so always I was such a scared cat as a kid you go back again anyway yeah there's so much like that I'd be like oh this scared me and then I'd be like terrified mom's like why do you keep watching it then I'm like I don't know it's so good I need to yeah that's exactly how I was I really I can really relate to that but yeah it's hard for me to pick a favorite I've thought about this a lot and I still haven't fully decided like what my favorite is because there's so many things I love about individual ones like I always said the one that comforts me the most of all things is uh probably Jaws which is there's some Deb of whether it's not whether or not it's horror I'm like well you know what for a whole like couple Summers no one went in the ocean so I feel like that counts as horror so I still know people that won't that won't swim in any body of water because of that movie so I think that counts as horror yes there's a place in Texas that I live in coastal Massachusetts man that just hits a little too close to home I can imagine there's a place in Texas a convention who does a screening of it while in the water that's just mean that's downright mean they do that up here as well that's awesome do they really that's so fun that's just awesome I want to do it I would love to do that I would I would absolutely love to do that oh my gosh cuz they're like in inner tubes watching it I was like the best my boyfriend wants to do that so bad on an inner tube I will take pictures of you from the beach but I am not I am not going out on a totally join them that sounds fun maybe not on an inner tube no you guys can all you guys can all do that now because that'll be the night that Jaws actually comes back Bruce is going to be there I'm sorry but in an inner tube your butt hangs way down in the I my butt would be clenched so tight the entire movie just don't fart it'll it'll it'll give give them does that a track sharks don't I don't think so but more blood than anything I don't know yeah we're actually we're supposed to be we were supposed to go before Co to Australia for my birthday and so one of the things we're going to do is I want to do the cage dive with the great whites so that's like my I'm like Des yeah oh that would be fantastic I love sharks so you're still trying to convince me to do that yeah Dan's like I'll go on the boat with you I don't know if I'm going to go in cage I'm like oh no I'll be in the cage you want your own Jaws moment I want to give him a little pet that would be kind of cool actually you have to post pictures do you guys have an Instagram or anything have to put them up we do yep so we do for we do have one for the podcast and then I just have like my own individual one which is mostly just videos of my pets being stupid but fine do you want to shout out your your yes the um so for the podcast it's just at We All pod down here for my person one just at Tiki 108 so there you go so you can get scared and when you're too scared you can go see cute pets and get a good G if you're in the middle I also have um I breed reptiles actually so and tarantulas so I have um it's called Tiki Exotics is my other one that I have for if anyone likes snakes or tarantulas I love snakes and tarantulas well there you go there's actually what kind of snakes most of all pythons I have a couple other I have corn snakes I have hog nooses I have Kenyon sandas I have a little spotted python um but all pythons are adorable they're like the puppies of the snake world exactly they have the little puppy faces they do they scare the [ __ ] out of me people they did me at first too but now I'm used to it I used to work in a pet store and um we sold some big snakes we used to have some beautiful gorgeous um Burmese pythons uh we had one albino that was about four feet long and there was this little girl I swear she couldn't have been more than 5 years old she and her parents used to come in she was fascinated with this snake it was big than she was and it was the sweetest snake after a little while she would let it drape around her and we'd let her walk around the store with it I cannot tell you how many people would run screaming from the doors when they would see this little girl with a snake that' be me it was cute though she loved that snake it was it was wild this little girl was just so drawn to it it was weird I would not have gotten the cat's food that day if if it meant going by that snake see that I would have been the little girl I my my for Mom and D when I was a kid I was like can I have a pet tarantula cuz I went to a Nature Center and they let us pet one it was a little rose hair and I was like I need one and my mom was like absolutely not she's like I all she could think of was the scene from Home Alone where it crawled on his face and she's like that'll be me I can't have this yeah yeah I guess that is kind of a fear do you have a tarantula I there's about an army yeah there's about 60 of them behind me right now so so you're you're breeding a critter Army in case the zombies come you can unleash the hordes yep exactly smart smart I like you're thinking ahead I like that I like that okay so we have to bring up the witch in the room because you grew up near burkettville which was made famous by its very minor appearance in the movie The Blair Witch Project and I'm sure you get this a lot but I love that movie so much love it it's so good I I know it it divides a lot of people because it's not that good but it's really really great and the footage when I first heard about it I I saw the documentary I saw the website before it came out and I was like I know this is fake but there's a documentary what the hell like wait a minute is this real it gave me motion sickness gave me pause for a minute I actually Wonder but there's there's questions I have though I understand that the there's the story and there's the legend of the the Bell Witch I almost said The [ __ ] Witch the Bell Witch but having been from that area two questions one how did the movie affect life in that area and two is there really any basis for this or is this just another Amityville horor that's just kind of based on some [ __ ] so there there is actually no Legend whatsoever that's NE that was completely made up for the movie there's never been a legend there never was any Blair Witch there's actually the whole movie actually they the initial like opening scenes you're driving into the town that actually is burkettsville um it's going I actually know the exact where they're going down um 17 and it's going right into the town but the bulk of the movie was actually filmed in a different County because there's not that many woods actually around burkville like you go up the the one Hill it actually it's funny they have a Spook Hill like one of those um you know like the gravity hills where It'll like pull the car up the hill because of the illusion so they actually have one of those right in burkettsville but when you go up the hill like and you get out of burkville there's some Woods up there but the actual Town itself there's mostly just like there's a and then there's like a bunch of Farmland that's just like open land around there I'm wounded I'm hurt there's no Woods in burkville not really because the town is so small like like I actually where I grew up I grew up technically my ZIP code was Jefferson like I could walk five minutes and be in burkettsville but we had 15 Acres that was almost all wooded so around our whole house was woods and when the burkettville carnival would come around the carnival would be playing music and it could you could hear it through our woods so like we moved there actually when I was 13 I grew up right in like Frederick which is like it's all the same county but we moved out to the actual like area right next to sausville I was 13 and that area like you could hear that coming through the woods and it was the scariest thing the first time so my mom was like oh my gosh there's people squatting in the woods something's happening it took us forever to figure out it was the carnival music coming through there but she thought we had people out there and I'm like no Mom it's the Blair Witch she's here I can if you can't if you didn't know what was going on hearing carnival music come twinkling through the the woods would be scary as hell so creepy and it's killer you think to kill her clowns from outter space and clowns I'm sorry are the worst clowns worst killer clowns is the best oh God people come to burkettville after the movie did they oh my gosh yes so I got stories about that so my friends that actually because I my bus went right through there every day so my I had several friends that lived like in the houses like right at like the Main Street town area so right where that area is there's now like this there's just one intersection of the town like it's literally just like one road that goes in one road that goes the other way and one one stoplight Town kind of thing yeah and there's no stoplight it's like a one stop sign Town sign even smaller small small town but yeah so there's now if you look at it there's a cobblestone like for that Crossroad area there didn't used to be Cobblestone there the reason there's Cobblestone there is when the second movie came out because of everything that happened from the first movie they were like we're not doing this again and they actually shut down the town and and the excuse was they did to make this Cobblestone little like Crossroad just because they didn't want to deal with it anymore so they shut down like the whole town for like months smart that's like a small town solution we don't like you and so we're gonna like passively aggressively do something to keep you away yeah so for the when the first movie came out people came from all over the world my friends have pictures of like people that came from Germany to see the town like people came from all over and some of it was nice they just came to see the town take photos be you know everything was kind of cool um they had friends that they actually dug up rocks in their yard and wrote like from burkettsville and were're selling them from like $5 a piece like in their front yard fantastic tons of money but then there was the best that for people did a lot of like damage to the cemetery it's like a really old Cemetery there there was headstones knocked over there was stuff stolen there was actually people that were like trying to take bricks out of like the walls in the houses that's too bad that's it God yeah that kind of Tourism ruins it for everybody I know it's like it's one thing it's fun where it's like they came they just want to take photos of the town and everything like that's great buy somebody's backyard rock yeah exactly like you get the official burkville Rock so but they weren't lying they weren't wrong yeah exactly like this is legitimately here a cigarette smoker and so when I on the days I actually have to go into work you know I have to go outside to smoke I am living in Salem Massachusetts and I promise you I am in probably thousands of tourists photos because people just walk down the street taking pictures oh I'm sure I'll be out I'll be out on the sidewalk smoking a cigarette and like crowds of tourists all year not just October all year W yeah now one of the things I really loved about granted the performances I thought were amazing for people who didn't know what they were doing who just went out there and kind of AD lived everything it was just the movie was a lot of fun the psychological part of that and I think the way they filmed it and the way they made it look like it was a home video and not a movie production is what made if that was like a movie movie I don't know if it would have worked yeah but the handheld camera aspect that is what pulled you in quick and it made you it made you freak the [ __ ] out oh for sure and there's so many people that fully believed it was real like the the people that were the actors their families for months afterwards got calls about people trying to like help volunteer to look for them and stuff like that like because and again you couldn't do this nowadays because of the internet being so much bigger and people would figure it out in moments but back then they had like at the actual Premiere um I believe it was at Sundance they had actual photos like missing flyers for these kids yes I saw they had passed them out I think not just at the premiere oh shoot sorry but at actually other places too like um at other music festivals and stuff that they passed them out they went all out for this and a lot of it was stuff like the reason a lot of it was ADB and stuff is they literally gave them like a premise and we like run with it and the real famous scene where they have the woman that's telling the story of The Blair Witch they still don't know who that was like they haven't been able to figure out like who this woman was they were interviewing because she just kind of like made that all up on the Fly they just told some random Town folks that they're like here's what we're going to be doing like mess with these people and they just ran with it yeah fastic you like little boys like no no no and like trying to cover her mouth like that just was like random people on the street they don't even like have that person like on the payroll or anything I love that and like the scenes with where in the woods where like they like rattle their tents and stuff like that they didn't tell them that was going to be happening they would just randomly decide to mess with them at various times and so these people probably were genuinely like they knew this was going to happen probably a little freaked out anyway but just being out in the woods and just having random stuff happened to you like was this the was this the The Producers or was this someone else you know right that sounds like such a fun scary movie to have made but yeah so the the Bell Witch like I had heard okay Blair Witch is fake everybody knows that but I had heard rumors that it was based on a a true story of the so-called Bell Witch is that a true story or so the Bell Witch story is totally separate that's actually I want to say that is Massachusetts also if I remember correctly but the Bell Witch is one where it's a of that was like in the I believe the 1700s I'd have to look up all the details um but basically that one is one where I don't know if they was ever inspired for the Blair Witch all I don't know if they actually used that information but that one was more just based in a house that they had this haunting where it just seemed like this what they this they called the the Bell Witch because it was I think it was the Bell family or no you know what it was in Tennessee I remember now there there's the yeah just like clicked in my there yeah there's the bell witch cave yeah I just looked it up it was Adam Tennessee Okay so maybe that rumor came about because Belle and Blair sound similar yeah that's what I think may haveen I they may have been like Loosely inspired by it but that one was mostly just based where it was just kind of like a a haunting within the actual like little cabin that they have interesting that's pretty cool I I kind of love the whole uh ad lib part like the whole the my mystery lady with the ad lib Story how fun is that yeah and it's interesting because everybody seems to have a story or know of someone who has a that might be something that she had heard and was kind of riffing off of to kind of mess with them you know because so many different places have stories and houses too and like you guys have some spooky stories or have had encounters yourselves you'd mentioned a little bit I'm gonna let Dan go first on that one because he's got some really good ones and I've been talking a lot so so I have two major ones um I guess I'll go chronologically one was in my grandparents house I guess it's sort of an older house probably like early 1900s um and I would stay overnight there my cousin was visiting for the summer so we I would stay overnight there a few times a week we just hang out whatever and just as a quick aside isn't that always nice like kids who can when you can spend some time with your grandparents in the summertime like so much fun stuff usually happens there not always hauntings but fun stuff usually fun stuff definitely you know we built a snow shoot one time in the winter and made our SL made a slip and slide before they actually existed and flew down a hill things like that perfect perfect childhood stuff and ghosts this was this one was a little freaky so I'm sleep I'm we're sleeping in the we had like a pull out sofa bed so we're just CRA kind of watching TV crash in there and it's falling asleep and there there's always my my grandparents have mentioned various things happening there um my aunt had a when an had a thing where she was you know using a Ouija board or something and some some Apparition came up and said told her to stop shell loves a story that starts with a Ouija board and it just literally told her to stop don't do this ever again no [ __ ] like an apparition came up and like said that Dam and she she never touched one again I wouldn't either yeah people [ __ ] with lu Ouija board and wonder why [ __ ] happens now she's a hardcore Christian yeah oh now she's a hardcore Christan wow wow that scared talk about the opposite ends of the spectrum yeah ran straight to what she felt was safety apparently wow it really isn't right no yeah different podcast what what happened was um with me so we're we're kind of crashing out and the we never went into the attic there was always some weird stories with the attic or something I don't really remember but it was a two-story house living rooms on there's a basement living room like the regular floor and then upstairs so up the upstairs had a door that would you could close and my grandparents would usually close it and you know if one of them had to come down get drink of water or something you'd hear the door open whatever coming down the stairs but no big deal so I hear the door open and slam really hard and I assume that it's probably my granddad or my grandma going to get something to drink common noise you're used to it click click stairs you know this this very familiar sound walking down the stairs except no one comes out I don't see anybody uh oh and I found that very strange I kind of get up look around there's nobody downstairs that's creep my cousin's fast asleep snoring away and I'm just like what the hell's going on here so I kind of go back to the bed and there the door to the cellar was visible from the bed doors doors closed why would you put a bed in visible view of a Cellar Door how are you supposed to sleep bed okay I guess that's a little bit of an EXC pull out couch that's rude to your guests how are they supposed to sleep staring at your Cellar Door but it's like it's just kind of in a hallway so like the main hallway and the door is kind of on the right and I'm just like a little freaked out because this isn't normal and then I see the Door Creek open and slam really effing hard you saw it yes how old of how old of a kid were you I was probably like 10 okay just slammed really hard I am freaked the F out I'm freaked out so I I just throw the sheets over my head and you know smart move how is that saving you no that's smart blanket are safety know that it's good it's it's total like you know ignor like ignorant like childhood ignorance you know I can't see it it can't hurt me kind of thing see I disagree I think it's the power of the blanket' seen under the blanket know you're safe under there gives protection yes are the best too that's right so so I'm just I'm freaked the [ __ ] out and then all of a sudden like I I and I heard the clipping and clopping down the stairs into the cellar oh no and then I hear the clipping and clopping going back up oh [ __ ] that's worse yeah and I I heard the Door Creek I Heard It Slam there's nobody around what the [ __ ] did the demon want some water oh my goodness I don't know why they're going in the cellar it's just my grandfather's Workshop but there was a lot of Sharp Tools down there I was hoping no one would come out with one but then went get a weapon you let it arm itself oh my goodness I it did not come back with a weapon thankfully oh you never know but um I'm freaked out and you know a lot of times when people have experienced something like that if the spirit is whatever is near you get that cold paralyzing feeling so this is in the middle of the summer granted there's no central air conditioning the house is hot as heck and I just get this chill like this bone down to the bone chill and I'm just paralyzed I'm just paralyzed like I can't e eing move I'm gonna just like and it kind of went away nothing else happened I didn't sleep very well that night and I talked to my grandparents the next day like did you come down at about like two in the morning to get a drink of water anything like no we didn't we just through the night like what they didn't notice a thing no they were out cold and I'm like you're not going to believe this WOW to their credit they they're like totally believed everything I said and I don't know if that's worse that they believed you but does that mean that they had had experiences there too right not really like they said there was like they've heard weird noises in the Attic before that they thought was something weird but there was a story I don't really recall but so but something you're just a just a trustworthy kids so they I didn't really get in any trouble I didn't lie I still don't but but like it was just very very weird experience that's very creepy that is that is truly a creepy experience what is it with ghosts and stairs I don't understand why do they like to go up and downstairs that's creepy and the the the noise pattern is it's exactly walking down stairs it was the exact kind of like you know space between the sounds that of somebody walking down and they were the the stairs made a lot of noise they creaked a lot and they had like a i for it was like a plastic cover like thing on like a rubber thing and like if someone has slippers on or shoes or something You' hear click click click click so it would be very apparent if someone was walking down the stairs and that's exactly what it sounded like or if it's a demon going to the basement to get something to do a little slice and dicing somewhere the you know if it came up with like a like a like a hacksaw then we would had a problem did you know any of the history of the house at all do you know if there was like anybody who died on that property or anything that nature there was and that's the whole like adct story there's somebody who passed away there before my grandparents own the house like the people who lived there before and there's like some weirdness about it but I I really don't remember the actual story behind it pro probably whoever whoever's in there now has probably met these these things but oh my goodness but this the only time it happened it never happened to me again did it happen to anybody else in your family not not that I'm aware of wow not not not exactly like I experienced at least I always wonder if people like Dan and I are just a little more sensitive to stuff like that so which we both had weird experiences so I think so you know I think some people are more sensitive and I think those people do tend to be drawn to things like horror movies or you know searching conspiracy theories or you know stuff like that we people are drawn to because we have questions you know and so you absolutely and so you start to want to look for answers and it kind of leads you to some interesting places so I wouldn't be surprised it sounds very much like you were in the right place at the right time and and a little more sensitive I think and and were able to see something that's wild my cousin didn't see [ __ ] he SLE through the whole thing out cold even he SLE through the whole thing he's like are you crapping me and he totally believe me because I mean again trustworthy guy he's a trustworthy guy too that age he was probably pissed that he didn't wake up and experience oh yeah he was a couple he was a couple years older than me so he was just like man I would have liked to have seen that why' you wake me up I'm like I was too scared dude Dan do you think that um when you experienced like that chill and the paralysis do you think that was due to fear or I know some people in paranormal situations describe a similar type of paralysis and chill that wasn't could have been fear-based or could have been something else kind of holding them in place you have an idea of which it might have been I felt like it was something holding me in place that's it's like I was already scared but like the chill was really strange and it was it was something like I had never experienced before not like a scared chill just like down to your bones kind of chill like I want to move but I can't kind of thing that's one of the things that fascinates me now that sh and I are kind of looking more deeply into some of these things stories that interest us is the similarities and and you describing that feeling of of feeling like you couldn't move like you were being held there is a is a commonality through a lot of these stories and I I find that kind of interesting yeah for sure kind of find it freaky that too it wants your attention apparently yeah I guess so I wanted you to know mission accomplished yeah yeah now is your experience in a house similar to that too Britney or kind of so I figur what we'll do is because Dan has another story I'll tell my next story and then if kind of go back and forth a little bit that works yeah so I'll tell my story from when I grew up where the house I grew up in so the this is the one we moved out to it's near burkville so that house was built in 1863 so already it's you know we celebrated 150th birthday there so wow very creaky house like the wood was very like you walk on those floors you heard it it was almost all original stuff there like the there was a mud room that was and like a extra bathroom that was eventually like added on as an addition but the bulk of it was like the original like floors like you can actually see like the Grain and everything from it the um the B was like the original cut from the house when it was first built so you see that more often on the East Coast the East Coast tends to have a lot of older houses you know farm houses that have a lot of the same trim and everything out here on the West Coast the house I'm living in we're the second family to live in it and there was nothing here before and that's that's pretty common we have all the pretty boxes neighborhoods you know from the weeds opening that's here I live there the ghost permeated houses over here right and so it it's interesting you know houses on the East Coast do tend to have a lot of that history so the houses in FLorida don't have as much of the because we live in Florida now we have a house that was just built in like 2007 the advantage though it does not have stairs so there's no stairs for things stair ghost Y and we don't have basements no basements in Florida because of the sand we we had a basement but you also can't hear them coming because you guys don't have old enough houses that are going to and crack you're going to hear these things coming at you I would hope one of the dogs would pick it up and freak out but there you go but at the same time no basement no stairs I mean you're kind of on an upside even without the creaking exactly so but the house I grew up in did have stairs did have a cell basement kind of thing the the basement you had to actually go outside to get to which was any way yeah and it was it was very much like like the one side of it had a like actual like concrete floor but then you went around like the corner side and it was literally just still like a dirt floor on there cold seller where they would store food and stuff yeah y exactly yeah and bodies with with the horor but because the house was built in 1863 so of course dead center the Civil War like where that house was um if you went about 20 minutes past burkettville you went right into um where Sharpsburg is which is where the Ana Battlefield is so it's like one of the single bloodiest days of the war you go right up you know about 30 minutes north you're in Gettysburg so there was a lot of things that happened like there's still like original like you can still see like the original like stone walls that they had built for the for like a lot of the the Civil War rough neighborhood to begin with pretty much so yes ghost super high so much history there's so much history and and there's a lot of this kind of activity there probably because of the Civil War yeah yeah so and of course I being the kid I was my mom had her original Ouija board that she got in like I think the 60s that she let me play with because I don't know why she's worried about me being scared then she's like here have a Ouija have fun so it's silly are you your mom would do I I know my my mom your mom's wonderful she's the sweetest but she's just so silly it's like stuff like that I'm like why she an aquarius because it's something I would do you know um I'm so bad at the days so she's a she was born in September early September definitely not okay so I'm terrible with which ones are which I know I'm Capricorn know sarius Sagittarius that's the only ones I remember so um but yeah so what happened to me oh sorry what were you GNA say oh I just need gave you an antique Ouija board to you know play with just don't scare yourself yeah pretty much so how do I not scare myself she actually gave it to me originally when we were in the house we were in before which that one was like we owned that house from like the moment it was built so that one never had any weird things happen there of course and then when I'm 13 she's like let's move to the country and to Ghostville see how yeah with ghost to a Civil War era house yeah so we went from a house right in like Frederick that was built in like 91 92 is to you know 1863 great idea mom so I'm play we played with this Ouija board of course in my room in that house and everything and I eventually stopped playing with it because I don't remember exactly how long after we'd been playing with it with some friends but I kept trying to like talk to my dad which is you know my dad died a little kid so I was like always trying to like talk to him or see who we could get in t touch with and that's never a good idea of course but what ended up happening one night is I remember I woke up and it was about 3 in the morning and I remember cuz I sat up in bed and I turned and looked at my clock that was like right above my head and it was between like 2 and 3:00 in the morning and I remember I wasn't even like scared I always feel like if you're scared you know you're got more heightened emotions you're going to like be more likely to hear something even if there isn't really anything no I'm not scared I'm just like oh gosh this is inconvenient I have to be up in a couple hours for school this this is not good and before I even sat down right next to my ear plain as day I heard something go bad just like that and I was like oh that's the worst not good it's apparently bad so I was like I laid down bed I say put my head under the cover so I was like I think this will be fine I'll go to sleep it'll be fine so didn't play with the Ouija board after that no but other little things that happened like even when Dan was over like when you know as an adult like I would you'd hear uh like feet on like the like with sound like heavy shoes walking around and the whole house of course is wood floors so you can hear stuff very easily the attic was creepy as [ __ ] so that like Dan I took you in the Attic at least wants to show it to you right yeah it just oh so you got to experience it too MH yeah he oh interesting my mom sold it eventually she apparently sold it with the condition it wasn't haunted but I was like she's like no it's pretty experien we Stu it's fine no one else had a problem when she set the house up she put out all those porcelain dolls oh my gosh she had these old antique porcelain dolls the real was like she put up porcelain dolls in an really old farmhouse that has a little bit of paranormal and trying to build it is UN haunted thought they look nice and trying to sell the house and the real was like you cannot do this he's like you will never sell this house smart realter I walked in and I'm like why are there these porcelain dolls over there and why are they staring at me oh I would a noed right out of there now I know where your love of horror has come from really is your love her yeah so and she always claims she didn't like horror that much but then she would do stuff like this and so but yeah she would had she had them set up in like this back bedroom that was like really ancient looking the house the way it was set up there was like three bedrooms you had to like walk through one to get to the other and that bedroom where they were was the room that had the stairs to the attic so I was like Mom this is the worst idea so because she left that room there used to freak me out and there was no locks on any of the doors because they were all like the original doors so I used to like take like suitcases and barricade the doors because I was like nope uhuh not not getting me yeah was creating you a ghost army with those dolls oh my goodness like the damn Annabelle Factory much like you are now with the snakes and the and the spiders Annabelle Factory no let's not have one of those sh no no I was expecting to hear one of them click clicking around walking across the floor oh don't you guys have Robert the doll in Florida we do yes Dan I've told you stories about that yes so it's down um it's way south of us it's down um I want to say it's in the keys um I think so yeah we're in Tampa area so it's down couple hours Southwest be they still have it on display you can go see it if you want to see the terrifying doll that would run around the house at night I think Robert the Doll is a good friend of Britney's mombe apparent I should thring her down and be like Mom what do you think of this doll how about this doll yeah yeah that's unfortunately an East Coast story so that's in Shell's territory know I don't get to talk about Robert the doll but he is spooky so you didn't have a Robert the Doll amongst those porcel and Dolls I'm guessing no thankfully they never I never heard them do anything I just was convinced they would eventually so well they're all evil at some point every porcelain doll is going to do something creepy it's just a matter of when yeah or or it's going to be like Seinfeld with with the one that looked like George's mom he thought it was yelling at him I thought you were talking about the dummy like in for Seinfeld where they have the dummy that runs around he's like oh yeah he's like Mr Marbles those are all evil too it's well known they toist they're all demons it sounds it sounds like the house didn't necessarily have anything angry or um benevolent it was just more there that's what I'm thinking the only other thing we had happened that was pretty creepy that happened to everybody was we were one night like all of a sudden we wake up in the middle night and it is like a billion degrees in the house and it was like an old um like the heating system was all like an oil heat thing and their little thermostat on the wall was one you actually like move it like that it wasn't like a button one with buttons like they have nowadays so it was just this real old thermostat and and we woke up midnight and someone somehow had gotten flipped all the way to like the hottest setting oh wow so of course we turn it down it's like course dead of winter too so my mom's like gosh darn it my heating bill is gonna be out the wazu this month so she you know we turned down everything we opened some windows try to like get some of the hot air out what we thought had happened was my brother and my niece had been staying were both with us and my little brother and my niece both were really cold when we had gone down to our cabin in Virginia because the heat wasn't working properly and again dead of winter so we all were really cold there for that weekend we went so my mom thought maybe my little brother cuz he's like maybe like seven or eight at the time or my niece who's about the same age one of them probably turned up the heat not realizing they were turning it all the way up that had to be what happened right so about a week later my niece is you know back with my oldest brother and my little brother was actually staying at a friend's house at night so just me and my mom and we're both upstairs and wake up again billion degrees and we're like okay so clearly it wasn't them my mom's like clearly the ghosts want to cook us so the way she resolved the situation until she could get a new thermostat installed was she took a uh a was it toothpick she took a toothpick and wedged it in there and taped it in like so the lever couldn't get pushed to the other side that's smart it's to this day I don't know if it was that I like logically I'm like maybe somehow the cats jumped up but it was like really high on the wall so I don't see them be able to jump up and like smack it so that would be a onetime thing not multiple times yeah exactly that would be a chance random thing wow that's creepy maybe they were trying to terraform the house so the demons could come in and be comfortable I think she was right the first time the ghosts were trying to cook them yeah I think so so like a slow cooker I guess but modern technology prevailed when we got our new F and it didn't happen again so and toothpicks toothpicks yep toothpick mom Ingenuity and but you probably you probably had something there honestly that didn't realize the war was over and still thought it was coming home from a day on the battlefield oh maybe they were really cold you know and they wanted it to be warmer I mean in in that general area you're you're talking about like these these poor wartime spirits that just don't really have a clue that they're dead yeah and I know that I've heard before that like water seems to like have some like possible paranormal like Connection in some ways and so of course there's a stream that ran right next to our house there was a pond in the backyard that was like you had to walk a little bit ways to get but it was a really big pond and apparently it was on some kind of natural spring so like if it rained enough you start seeing water bubbling up from the ground so my mom was like there supposed to be this possible underground Lake underneath the house on top of it so you're just an a mass conduit for paranormal it everything I was like yep so in a Civil War era house right so I have heard that with the water though and like the in SS Park the um the Stanley Hotel has water and Limestone and i' like the stone tape Theory where different types of rock and things I've heard similar things with running water can kind of record events and hold Spirits there and to top it all off all of Frederick's on a giant Limestone Quarry so there you go it's all connected there so yeah so there you go they're just all stuck there interesting so now for for real quick for your West Coast stuff I don't have any good ghost stories from it but I remember listening to one of your early episodes you mentioned the Queen Mary we have stayed on the Queen Mary oh have you really right now so kind of jealous when they reopen they have a ghost tour they do where they have two different ones one's where they just do a regular tour and one they like take you to like two or three in the morning and you do like an actual like Ghost Hunt overnight and they give you like all the equipment and everything so if you get a chance definitely even if you just get the chance to stay there it's great yeah it's just a cool ominous kind of kind of locations I love that it kind of like sleeping over on a cruise ship kind of vibe on a really old cruise ship yeah really old but yeah a little bit because like cruise ships course nowaday are real modern and nice whereas still feels very very old it's but still like those same small compact rooms it's going to be different it was closed for covid now it's been retaken by um the either the city or the county I'm not sure but they they've retaken control of it they've had different subcontractors kind of own it for the past several decades I guess and now they've taken control and it's shut down for remodeling so they're going to completely remodel it maybe once that's done shell you can come out here and we'll we'll have to ring up Britney and Dan and be like okay which room should we stay in where should we go and there are rooms they actually most haed rooms too so they always cost a little more we were we were only able to stay there for like one night and we had to get up really early for a flight the next day so I was like let's just stay in one of the regular rooms tonight since we're already doing we're doing the ghost tour but not the full Ghost Hunt so was cool that sounds very cool if you guys want guests we'll we'll come out and join you we okay all right pencil that in sh we're gonna do that sometimes that be fantastic fun Y and if you guys want to come see the Robert Robert the Doll we'll take you down there we have oh my gosh it's going to be road trips okay I'm so down scary road trips we're in ghosty road trips all right it's all right definitely now Dan you have you have more stories that wasn't the only spooky thing that's happened to I have a really good one yeah this one's really weird so this happened God trying to remember what year this was it was late two late like 2009 is 2009 2008 Nish probably um I was staying at um an ex's house and um it was not an old house so it was a house that her mom had designed herself had they built it and everything so it's not like there was anything that were from before and nothing really creepy happened to me there really and until until this so I just kind of woke up in the middle of the night and there was like a like an apparition that looked like it was probably you know Depression era kind of like wearing that kind of clothes and stuff like that looked very very frightened and sad and it was just right there like plain as day and it was it scared the crap out of me was it like right at the end of the bed right at the end of the bed staring I remember you guys say about stuff coming up for your feet it's it kind of like came from the corner of the room and sort of went towards the end of the bed now you said look frightened what do you think it was like weird you guys were there where it get so it's just kind of SAR to me it looked really it just seemed like sad and it wasn't as scary to me as it was like wow what is going on here and I kind of just like okay I'm going to try to go to sleep now and just there's a ghost here whatever I'm like I don't know am I seeing things am I losing it I I don't know but you guys all think the blankets are going to save you people they are they are they have to they call it's why they call them a security blanket exactly see smart so the next day I talked to um my ex's mom and so like I saw this figure and I'm describing it and she goes let me this sounds familiar let me grab an old photo book like an old family photo book oh [ __ ] and and she starts flipping through it I'm like and she's like I know this sounds familiar and she's someone who's very um very spiritually connected she's she's a yoga teacher one of the sweetest people in the whole world just so you know have good contact with her to this day she um he's like thises it sounds really familiar and she's like does it look like this person I'm like that is that's it that's no [ __ ] and she gave she explained the story behind it that it was like a like a great great uncle or something during the Depression era who committed suicide and there was a lot of people in that era who committed suicide financially ruined committ suicide because he stepped in right on train tracks and got run over by train wow that's terrible there's a lot of people who there that ER who unfortunately did that and the guy had like a you know like like the the bowler hat or whatever and everything and it's like handle more mustache very stereotypical wow of that and the picture was one to one I'm like that's exactly what I saw damn and she was so fascinated by it not scared at all she's like oh my God that is amazing she's like I hope neither of you were scared of this girl she's like I hope I see it I hope I see it she sounds like think she ever did I don't think she ever did but like yeah that that that really blew me away yeah there's Pro right there how could you see someone that you had never heard of never ever in my life I I i' never known about this part of their family history but it just yeah that was I recognized it right away that's spooky and of course commonality right at the end of the bed that's just where these things happen that's I say all you got to keep your feet covered and stuff I've talked about it before that is why you have to have those little toes covered when you sleep they'll get tuck the bottom of the bed yeah like really tucked really tight so like I was like I I mentioned once I was like there was a thing I read online somewhere someone joking about like how you can't keep one foot off the bed because if you do that's where the the demons will get you and Dad was like I've never heard of that and I'm like they do it's true it's true it's a thing yep or my dog will lick my foot and scare me one of the two you know there you go that happen yeah that's also I don't care I don't care how hot it is I could rip every blanket and Sheet off of me but from the ankles down has to be covered or I wake up instantly cuz it's end of the bed ghosts there is a plague of end of the bed ghosts apparently yes yep there is that's probably what helps us those our dog sleeps she has a bed right at the end of our bed so you're protected our protect wouldn't notice yeah she she's she's 13 and she wakes up a lot at night and just like randomly barks at nothing so yeah that's what you think you think they're randomly barking at nothing girl isn't getting scared every be awful yeah old dogs are great you know you both you both seem fortunate enough that you had people in your lives that didn't think you were batshit crazy yeah for sure for each of the scenarios when you told someone else you were believed and it's rare that's important and it is rare and it's important because this [ __ ] happens and you can ignore it and pretend like it doesn't but it does and it's spooky and it's scary and it and there's some sort of comfort in someone not thinking that you're lying or full of [ __ ] and crazy yeah absolutely telling you a you know similar story although sometimes sometimes validation makes it scarier true yeah like oh you think you so I'm so I'm not going crazy okay yeah I have to deal with that yeah until you saw that picture Dan you could have been like oh I just had a weird dream but then you saw the picture like oh [ __ ] no that it felt it felt way too real to be a dream and it was like one of those things where you know like during you pinch yourself and like yeah I'm not dreaming here yeah and I I know she's someone who's like very open to this kind of thing she's very much into like like reincarnation things like that you know she she she's very spiritually connected person so like I I thought this someone like I could talk to her about this and she's like oh my God like oh I didn't expect there to be a connection here but there was that's pretty cool she she's the sweetest I've we've H we've hung out with her many of times so nice wow even though it's his ex was all very good terms so yeah we're all friends that definitely speaks to someone's personality for sure what type of person they are if you can get along like that yeah yep do you have a story too Britney yeah I have another one so this one's kind of sad but it's like always been a very big Comfort to me so as I mentioned earlier my dad died when I was a little kid I was seven when he died um it's okay a long time ago now so but he was um it was very sudden he had a unknown heart condition just went out of nowhere so when my mom came to tell me though like I remember it was really weird cuz my grandma I was at my grandma's house and it was um I think it was like just after school or something like that and she got a phone call and then she just like started like crying and I was like what is happening again I'm seven so I went I sat in her la like it's okay Grandma I'm here like I don't know what else to do so well that's so sweet though yeah so um but what happened is then like all of a sudden more of our family started coming over like my oldest Brothers started coming over um they're techically my half Brothers but I just call my brothers so they they all start coming over a couple uncles show up and I'm like what is going on everyone looks upset no one telling me what's going on my mom apparently like wanted to be the one to tell me so she finally shows up and she takes me outside and it was like my grandma had this H like little she had a porch like right off her back um like a so it's like you could come out like from the top level or the bottom level kind of porch and on the bottom level there was this really nice little swing you could swing on and I remember she sat me down on her lap and you know the best way she could tell me she's like today Daddy went to heaven and like I just started crying and all of a sudden out of nowhere from behind me I hear his voice say you're an angel too and I remember turning around being like because my first thought was someone has pred a horrific trick on me and of course he's not there so um I remember tell my mom and she's like well maybe that was dad trying to comfort you and so like make me oh my goodness yeah and I've never i' not super like religious but I always felt like that you know like the angel idea was kind of more just like kind of like you know you're my angel kind of thing you know like in a loving way so yeah that's always been a huge Comfort to me there's at some point I've been planning to get like a tattoo on my back that says that but I want to put like bat wings with it because I always felt like my dad my dad enjoyed the fact that I was a weird kid that tulas and stuff like that I have chills and I'm crying at the same time that is like that is and laughing so because that is just sweet and yeah so it's always always been a huge Comfort to me that I always feel like that was like you know maybe there's reincarnation maybe there's like I don't know it just always felt like I was like well when we die it's not just like you know like is it Frank from from is it Frank from like Danny deo's character and it's always sunny it's always sunny he's like when you're dad you're dead oh God I won't go into the rest of that quote it terrible but like I always well even if I don't know what it is but maybe there's something afterwards and like you know that it's not just the end kind of thing and so I was like if I'm wrong then hey can't do anything about it so that's right I've always liked this the scientific theory that energy can neither be created nor destroyed and we are energy so I don't know what happens to it but that energy still has to exist somehow and I I don't know what form it takes but I firmly believe that your dad your dad was right there telling you you're his angel you're an angel too I love that yeah so it's always been like just a huge Comfort to me but that's like one of my technical I guess you count as a ghost story kind of thing so absolutely wow wow similar one actually with my grandfather you have I was gonna say you have one more I was GNA it prompt you to tell if you didn't tell it the the one with your granddad when he died yeah so when it's the same house where from the first story so um his seller the seller was his Workshop he was um like a hob a carpenter as a hobby right the one the demon went to yeah all his demon murder tools so he made so many he was a master woodworker like he didn't I wish he would have gotten some more claim for it I feel like back then every Grandpa was MH like if if he if he was around today I'd probably try to help him s stuff or something but like he made he made like all the railings in my parents house out of out of wood and stuff you still have yes absolutely there's actually um right by my desk here there's a a wooden picture that he made he did a lot of wood burning and stuff and my grandma was a pretty good painter and he did one of The Simpsons the family and it's a wood carving um of The Simpsons my grandma painted it so I have that I have I have I have other things little the SE made too there was a board game he really liked called triominos and he made a wooden version of it I still have that cool they even has some old um like score sheets score sheets yeah seen this when I was a kid so I never got rid of those but this was like right after he passed and he had a lot of heart issues and stuff like that but like he I learned how to work with wood because of him you know we spend a lot of time there and I was just a fraking wreck like even talking about it chokes me up a bit but like I was just so distraught didn't know what to do I was just he was my best friend so I didn't know what to do and he just I just felt this warmth and he just I hear a Whispers like it's all gonna be okay a oh my and he was down in like the wood shop wood shop area in there in the cellar that previously was creepy stuff but then it's like now it's like this real Comfort oh yeah it was still a place of comfort for me so with with that it was just like a really positive experience is something I really needed at that very much so I can tell how close you guys were and just to have that interestingly I have a similar story this was with my step-grandmother oh D tell and we didn't get along at all the woman hated me she she was not the nicest person in the world at least to me um and I was living in Colorado at the time I was in my early 20s and I knew she had been sick but I wasn't really talking to much of my family at that time and one night I with my friends we're at a pizza joint we're sitting in a corner Booth my back is to the wall I don't like sitting with my back to open spaces so like back to the wall because things can sneak up behind you it's not it's not smart exactly so you know we're talking and I kept seeing what I thought was a waitress come like down the side aisle just out of my and I kept looking to say something to her because I thought that was kind of weird why are you sneaking so you know but there was never anybody there and it was bugging me and I kep asking my friends and they're like there's nobody there and I'm like there's a woman she keeps coming over here she has dark hair and it's really freaking me out to the point where I made them we got our food we got our pizza I'm like I can't stay here and eat this is really bothering me so we got the pizza and we left a couple hours later I get a phone call from my mother my grandmother had passed away um and I was like no [ __ ] what time and it was the exact time we had been at the pizza joint and to this day again it's kind of a comfort because I was sure she hated me but I think she came to say goodbye and honestly the the healing that that did was huge and I I'm pretty sure I never saw her it never happened again but it was the same moment that she had passed away and I'm sure she came to maybe say I'm sorry or something I don't know but just knowing that she came to see me was a huge comfort for sure that's awesome that's beautiful I heard of that a lot they call it a crisis Apparition where right when someone's like about to die they they'll have something like that happen where there's someone who you know even whether they were close or not like will just like appear to them and they're like and they'll always find out was right around that exact time was when they passed so oh that's wild I didn't know it was a thing thank you for that that's yeah if you look at it's called a crisis Apparition it also could have had something to do with uh it's kind of like when you call somebody on the phone if you're in a situation like a Christ Apparition situation you're going to call someone who you know is going to pick up and Lea is sensitive enough to those types of things that Lila would have picked up whereas maybe maybe other folks in her family might not have picked up that message whereas Lea would have so it might have been it might have been I'm going to someone who I know is gonna hear me yeah and and you know I mean with you guys with with Dan and Britney you guys again I feel are very sensitive to that type of thing and so and not just that you were super close to to that person but also because again they knew you would pick up you know they they knew that you would see that or hear get that message and you needed that message I think I needed that message yeah absolutely but I do think sometimes it it does partially have to do with who's gonna hear the message let me go to who's going to hear me yeah I can see a lot of people in my family not receiving said message so you would have yeah and you would have so you would have been like the goto for the family yeah well that's kind of a neat Theory I like that you know too it's kind of nice I have no like scientific basis for that theory but there's a lot of logic behind it I think and Sh has had experiences with with loved ones as well I know your grandfather is a prominent you know yeah I mean I Leila can attest to this I everybody who knows me that can pick up on energy has at one point in in in their time with me met my grandfather whether they've liked it or not my ex-husband uh at the time uh we hadn't been together very long and he kept telling me about this man who was in our bedroom doorway and I'm like what are you talking about there's no man in the doorway and he described this person and I was like oh my God I know exactly who that is just based on the description dug through a couple of old photo albums pulled out a picture and he's like yeah that's exactly who it is and it was my grandfather um who died when I was 10 and we were very close my grandfather is actually the reason why I could not sleep with my feet uncovered because shortly after his death when I was 10 um he appeared at the foot of my bed so he is the spark of why I can't sleep with my feet uncovered but um I've had multiple friends um multiple acquaintances in certain situations be able to describe my grandfather what he's wearing hairstyle everything right down to a te where they obviously never met him they've never seen a picture of him and it it's it's an exact description I it's almost like for me personally if shit's about to get bad in my life like bad [ __ ] is about to happen my grandfather appears when life is just trotting along he's nowhere to be found so it's kind of one of those if I start to see or sense my grandfather around it's almost like ah [ __ ] now it's gonna happen no no yeah yeah but but there has been multiple people who can just describe him right to a te having having no idea wow who he is or what he looked like I love that um some ghost stories aren't scary per se that they're comforting and loving and and give us a little bit of hope you know I I have no idea what happens after people die and I don't like to think about it much because it's super scary scares the hell out of me on a too but I also don't think they just are gone either yeah Y and I and I love that and I think we kind of need to hold on to that especially when times are like they are right now everything's kind of [ __ ] in the world and you got to hold on to some things that are hopeful you know even if I am escaping into scary movies I still want to go out and smell the flowers and have is a good thing it help it helps keep you centered absolutely keep some happiness in your life even if things look like that's right so on that note what's your do you guys have an episode coming up that you're excited about you want to tell us about your your next project so we have a couple ones that we're working on we're going to actually do some fun comparisons of a couple of like Asian films and like the American remakes so especially we're do we've been working on it for a while but we haven't had a chance to finish all of it yet but we're going to be doing the Jan Series so it's the Americans The Grudge so because there's a bunch of them that they did for in like the Japanese version but then there's just a couple of the American don't watch the 2021 it was terrible waste of time yeah the like at Le like we both had said like we watch the the first remake the one that they just did the first Grudge movie that came out in like the early 2000s that one we both were called not liking it when we saw it but we actually rewatched we're like this was actually wasn't as bad as I recall it being because I think especially it was definitely the Lesser like like the original was was far superior I personally have a traumatic experience with that movie that has nothing to do with the movie at all we both went on bad dates to see the movie that's all very very bad horrifying like to the point I'm like the same movie you guys went on that's funny this movie is awful and this person is even more awful and I think they're making the movie awful and I just want to run as fast as I possibly can see mine wasn't the date wasn't bad at the time it was actually like I like was dat I dated for like two weeks in high school and so like but it was like so we broke up so shortly after I think my mind was just like nope that was bad so I decided that the movie was bad but watching it as an adult I was like oh you know what this actually wasn't as bad as I thought I think I like that it was the original director actually came in to direct it which a lot of times they don't do that with a lot of the remakes they just kind of make it very Hollywood and that's it you know yeah why it always so bad do it good if you're gonna do a remake make it good that was originally an Asian movie Yes Japanese there actually um four so there's like two that are um kind of like more just like shorts that lead up to it and then there's two Jan movies and then the third movie is actually The Grudge and that's the one that they remade so yeah the first two are on YouTube first two movies are on YouTube they're scary as hell very low budget but very good but the feeling is there man it's they're so good I'm a fan of lowbudget horror the American equivalent don't hold up and unfortunately a lot of the times that's the case they try to take something that from another place then they try to dumb it down for a mass audience and it ends up being really crappy the original Grudge is good and it's because the original director was involved I'm convinced if they weren't involved it would have been trash just like the 2021 is utter garbage and it's not even worth watching the trailer yeah no we watch it CU I was just like just watch it and I was like my gosh we're complet so like we're going to do this comparison we're going to watch all of them even the ones that to weep yeah you guys must watch a lot of movies we do we do yeah why make a movie a remake that's going to be bad I'm really hoping that like the success of squid game means that we can take more foreign films and just have them and not have to try and re americanize them they're remaking squid games no no yes I'm sorry there's another one mind there's another one called a wonderful movie called trade to bassan and unfortunately unfortunately they're working on a remake of that and they're gonna make it terrible why it's all it's all about trying to well make money off of something that exists so you'd have no original idea so and they try to dumb it down for a mass audience and make it really easy entry kind of thing they they take all the the heart and the and the creativity out of it that's bad in reality if they would have left it the way it was they would have probably made more money and spent less yeah yeah well that would be interesting then so check out Britney and Dan on We All pod down here for all your horror insights we just we've had a blast with this obviously obviously our
