welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode we are stepping into the wild and the sacred with our guest who is an author a folklorist a teacher and a community leader we have with us today h Byron Ballard Asheville's beloved Village witch and keeper of Appalachian magic and folklore and in this episode we're going to talk about her upcoming book a feral church as well as the goddess in Winter Ule traditions and so much more now I'm shell and I am damn excited because all those things that Lea just said she forgot that Byron you are just the coolest chick around you really are and we love you so welcome welcome it is so good welcome back yes and it's so good to see you both again it's as much as we all complain about social media the good thing about our socials is that we kind of keep up with each other and it's really important So yeah thank you thank you for having me back distance isn't a big of a thing anymore and I love that that social media has taken away that that distance issue years ago in the I guess in the 80s maybe we we talked so much about oh imagine if we just meet in the astral and we could really communicate deeply and when I see you in the astral I will be an eagle well I will be a wolf and now of course Zoom is the astral made in the astral all the time yes and I am a woman in a bathrobe usually when I'm in the astral now real quick speaking of meeting we're super excited and and and Lea I know we didn't talk about this but I'm left turn in here we were just talking about how we had met you earlier in 2024 at Sacred Space and we are doing a ritual meditation in 2025 at Sacred Space and we were just talking about how amazing it was that we met you and so many other great witches there and actually that was kind of the first time I was introduced to you at Sacred Space because I'm kind of a recluse mostly and you just this this last year of of being exposed to you and your your vast knowledge and wisdom has just been mind-blowing for me so thank you for coming into my sphere oh that is so kind thank you thank you for that she is she is a sweetheart but I do want to take a I'm G to take a left turn because I am super excited about your book a feral Church you have been writing about this a little bit on Facebook there's a Facebook group for it and this is my kind of magic this is right up my alley I was a feral child I was looking for magic in the world and truly feel that the Earth is our mother and I truly feel most at home whether I'm tending my plants in the city or I'm outside in the forest you know I I just feel that connection to Earth and meditation as shell knows is one of my things and I know that's a big part of this pathworking journey that you've got in your book so I understand it was kind of inspired a little bit by uh Dr Carol Christ who was one of our founding mothers or of the Goddess movement can you can you tell us a little bit about that absolutely and I'm going to try not to cry when I tell you this um and you all know have been for the past almost three months we have been up to our eyeballs in a natural disaster here so my tears are really close they're really close to the back of my eyes so if you hear me going I even have a tissue to blow my nose so um I don't know how many years ago was that two three years ago I was at um Appalachian summer solstice Festival which is in Southern Ohio at Wisteria and I had I heard you know picked up my phone early in the morning and heard that Carol Christ had died and I never met Dr Christ but her work had a profound effect on me and so I just sat there being contemplative and a little weepy and sad and and it some of it was very selfish I was sad because I was never going to meet her I would never get to do one of her pilgrimages none of that so it was very kind of personal w w as it it's okay for that to be too um and a friend came over and said oh you okay and I went well yeah but and told what had happened so we sat there pouring Irish whiskey into our coffee our morning coffee um and and talking about the profound effect she had had on both of us and the goddess movement in general so I get back in my car on Sunday and I'm driving home it's a about a seven and a half hour Drive uh and I kept hearing this voice going well it it's probably time for a new goddess theology book I mean she hasn't written Dr Chris hadn't written anything new and big in a long time and we have we've had kind of a Dar of goddess spirituality new new information and I went yeah oh I hope somebody does that so I was having this kind of internal dialogue with myself and and I think I personally think that part of that dialogue was in fact the great mother saying yeah that'd be a good thing to happen yeah I wonder who could write that who could push push who could possibly do that and I kept going yeah I don't I don't really know and thinking about some of the great thinkers I know who are goddess theologians and then it it hit me well you could write that and and imately I was like no are you not that du nobody knows me for any of that work impostor syndrome rears its head exactly and then came very clearly you're a woman who throughout her entire long years has been a goddess worshipper I have never ever seen Divinity in male form so that when I would go to church with my grandmother when I was little and they would say God he it didn't make it didn't make sense to me like why why would you say that that's so weird I mean I got that Jesus was a boy that made sense but the whole rest of it just it made no sense to me which I guess means that I didn't think of Jesus as a Divinity but we can let that go and and I am one of the founders of a goddess Temple that has been around for almost 20 years so who else could do it you weren't being asked you were being gently told yeah I was being what did we have a a member of our circle of council who always brings her very strong husband when we have work to do and he always sort of bows his head and goes yes I was volun told to be here so so that's how it felt like I'd been volen told now you get to write this and then of course I didn't know where to begin real quick I just want to kind of touch on the the backstory what really kind of drove you and your clan of people to found what is now the mother Grove goddess Temple and can you talk about um that Temple a little bit for us like what was the inspiration back when when this came about for you we were a very very active and still are a very active Pagan Community here in Asheville and early on oh gosh during one of the Bush administrations I think Bush two we decided we wanted it was necessary for us to do a pagan nonprofit that did Social Service stuff because there were far too many Christian groups here that in order to get a box of food you had to pray to Jesus right yeah right which you know that happens all over the world and has for hundreds of years doesn't make it right no it doesn't make it right but it it's it is normalized as I say so we did that and we created the Coalition of Earth religions for education and support which is still active today it's called series c r s like that and out of that group we we met during the the uh witch Wars of the 90s we just kept broadening what community looked like and and I and several other people tried to push that organization to consider doing a goddess Temple and they were really firm that that was not their Vision it was not their mandate and so sorry this is kind of long but it it's kind of weird and cool too so Earth Day to me has always been the ninth holy day on the wheel yes and in Asheville Earth Day is when we have a big party and there's a lot of great beer and the and bands and what else and it always just infuriated me and I couldn't figure out why and then I woke up about two weeks before Earth day was supposed to happen and realized that I wanted to do a ritual so I called a whole bunch of people and ask if they would come and bring a song or a prayer or a dance or we would meet under this big tree at a public park and we would celebrate Earth Day well we did that we had a big huge turnout and afterwards we all met at somebody one of the women's houses around the fire in the backyard standard operating procedure we drank yeah we drank a lot of tequila and over the course of a few hours we determined that it was that we would do it we were going to start a goddess Temple and we did the paperwork to do our nonprofit status we submitted it to the IRS on the summer solstice and we reserve res re and we got the word back on bastile day that we were a nonprofit church that's how fast it happened wow so there has always been a sense that we live that we lead a kind of a Charmed existence and what we're doing now is is is no surprise to any of us that we've jumped into what we're doing with um the Helen relief I'm glad you mentioned that because actually an interview with you was requested by our listeners in particular because you know they wanted to see how you're doing you are quite a favorite amongst our listeners we have a a discussion group on Facebook and they requested that we have you come on and uh talk about your book and also ask you how you were doing with those relief efforts how are people doing and do they still need help um yes yes yes um at this point much of the triage work has been done so the work that we could do which was bringing food and water and um propane heers I know more about propane heaters than I ever thought I would know Mr Heater your propane buddy is also our buddy and we now have six of them at mother grab goddess Temple ready to go out into the community that's wonderful yeah um but what has to happen now is that it's people literally rebuilding their homes and that's that's not something we can be much help with we can we can ask people to send us money for Lowe's gift cards so we and we just hand those out to people but we're in this for the Long Haul it's going to take another two or three years just to establish a baseline of where we were um it has devastated Helen and the ma aftermath of that devastated an area the size of Belgium in my County alone we lost almost 50% of our mature trees wow and that wasn't from the flood that was from the rain and the wind and then this past few days we've had more heavy rain and wind and we've lost more trees so we are I mean we're all in it for the long haul um but we're tired I'm I'm profoundly tired but I also am energized by by the work that we're doing we're operating like every little Baptist Church in Western North Carolina we are we have a food pantry and we're handing out warm clothes and heaters and gas cards and and we're doing all those tending to the community things that we think of churches doing but without the toxic you don't have to pray with us to heck you can just have a box of food right right you can just have a heater you can just be there yeah and I think that's the next evolution of paganism we are all individuals but having groups having places like mother Grove goddess Temple that we can turn to that we can uh donate our time to that we can be part of is is going to be vitally important it's great to meet here in The Ether and I'm so glad it's here for people that can't meet in person but I do think that we need these real life places as well real life churches right and and physical places are really important I agree we sent a load a car load of things out the Tuesday after the disaster and we encountered a group in Bernardsville that was primitive skills people and burners and anarchists and just a whole plethora of folks like that and they had organized a mutual aid station that was an Old Firehouse and the first Bay was missing persons the second Bay was uh medical help then the next Bay was clothes the next B was food and outside the building there were probably a thousand cases of water and it was so beautifully organized and it could it could happen because they were they knew how to organize because that's who they are I mean anybody who's been around Burning Man or rainbow they know we as high as most of the people are they still know how to organized Mutual Aid yes but what was really important is they had a space they had a physical place to do that they weren't doing it in the parking lot of a five and dime they were they had a place to be and that in a disaster is incredibly important absolutely there's something to be said for having four walls to work out of yeah um and we were lucky at mother Grove is Tiny it's three rooms in what used to be an old hospital and we basically boxed up all the books and put them in a corner and we made room for more food and we brought in all the food and water we could and then we ran out of space for water and in the hallway outside the temple there are just cases and cases of water and um somebody said aren't you afraid people will steal it and we said well steal it it's it's for people to have let them take what they need and so we made sure everybody in the building knew that that water it wasn't our water it was our water it was their water and so people take water water shared is life shared that's what I believe so that has been really it's been good for us we were initially at the temple every day seven days we did that for about five weeks wow and then we realized we just we C we couldn't with the number of volunteers we had we just couldn't keep that pace up so now we're there Monday Wednesday Friday or by appointment so if someone says oh I can't be there is anybody going to be there Sunday then one of us will step up and go yeah yeah I can come by Sunday what time are you coming so it's been really it's going to sound weird but it's been so good for us because we feel like we're doing important work and yes public rituals for each of the holy day is important work it is uh having a food pantry for years is important work but this feels like serving the community in a way that we've never had the opportunity to serve before and I love that you were there and are able to help so many people I've I've followed Along on your social media with the things that you get and have been able to help in the community and it's just so heartwarming um I will make sure to put links to all of that because you your your community is going to need you for the near future it's not over no it's going to be years of helping to take care of people just being there for ceremony for ritual not just the food pantry and the Outreach but all sorts of needs so I'll make sure that there's links people can find you and and continue to help thank you and that's been one of the joys of this too is that people can come to Mother Grove and we will light the candles on the main Altar and we will leave them in the chapel so that they can do what religions spiritualties choose to do which is to spend time with the Divine and just meditate or pray or cry or just find a place of some comfort and that's been really beautiful because we've never done that done much of that which is just to be available as a a place of worship I love that you offer for that and I wish there was more of that across not just the country but across the world really me too me too especially nowadays so I am going to Veer a little bit but still in the same vein of of physical places uh one of the big cornerstones of your belief system is in animism is spirits of place uh it seems to be that you know you're very much tied to the land can you talk to us a little bit about connecting to spirits of PL into the energies of the land particularly in winter time as always I'm going to tell you that by telling you a story that somewhere in my socials and I don't remember which one someone was saying that the river one of the rivers that flooded is the French Broad River that which is perhaps the third oldest river in the world it's a very it's older than the Appalachian Mountains and you know how old those are and this person was saying that he was afraid to be near the river now because it did cause so much destruction and so the the vibe felt wrong to him and other people chimed in with oh it just feels dangerous and it feels like it doesn't like me anymore and I came into the conversation to say third oldest river in the world amazing River we take advantage of this River all the time and we don't treat it with the respect we should but the point is that Rivers have a limited number of things they do they flow and when there's a lot of rain they flood and when there's not enough rain there's drought and they dry out and that's what rivers do and it's not personal the French Broad did not flood to punish the people of Asheville and bunkham County neither did the swanana NOA none of these Rivers the big Ivy none of these rivers that flooded flooded in a punitive way because they hate people they do what rivers do and it's the same with the trees yes Wow we lost we lost so many oak trees it still hurts to see these 100 year old 150 200 year old trees that just uprooted themselves and fell over and their roots are still reaching Skyward as the tree itself dies and it's a hard thing for people like me to look at but again the trees didn't fall over because the wind was mean and the trees didn't fall over because the rain drowned them the trees fell over because the wind was too strong and we' had too much rain and the soil let go and it's not it's not emotional I mean it's emotional for us we feel it very deeply but but for all those pieces of nature they don't do that to punish us they do that because that's how nature behaves it's just what nature is and what nature does yeah and so many people were saying things like oh who could have expected this and a lot of us said well we expect this because it's happened before there was a flood on the same river on the French Broad in 1916 that my family lived by the river and I heard stories growing up my whole life about the great flood of 1916 and at that point the French Broad Rose to 22 4 feet I think above its banks wow and this and this time was 27 so it was arguably worse than the 1916 flood but 1916 it's not within living memory but I'm only two generations removed from that living memory because my grandmother remembered it she was 12 years old she remembered it really well so we did know that and in 1940 it flooded and in 2004 it flooded but we love to forget about those things because that feels icky or oh that couldn't possibly happen again because now we're so much more sophisticated and we're just not because as you all know mother nature always bats last always that's true we can think we have some control over nature but we simply don't no no and and it can be scary sometimes especially if you feel disconnected from that if you feel like it is a personal attack or if you don't feel that you have that connection to the place do you have anything that you can recommend magically that a pagan a witch or a heathen could do in in a place to help them feel more connected to the space that they're in I'm always going to tell people to ground themselves just ground yourself feel what the Earth itself feels like we had a little bit of a scare a few days ago maybe two days ago with the New Madrid fault and do you know about that yeah it did a little kind of shimmy and for those who know they know that that fault in 1812 it busted loose and the mississipp part of the Mississippi River ran backwards that's how powerful it was not every event has to have a sinister meaning behind it things just are yep exactly and it's it's different if we're talking about places in Pennsylvania where there have been so much fracking right and the old coal mines those are bad yeah yeah and those are bad that's human intervention into natural activity and it usually comes back to bite humans on the ass so we do it to each other it's not nature doing that you brought up Pennsylvania and that reminds me of a question I needed to ask you so I had to actually write this quote down I was I was doing some back research um on feral Church before today and I was listening to a couple of interviews you did and you stated and I love this phrase so much you are from where your grandmother was born my question is maternal or paternal either one I mean what good question by the way um yeah when I was growing up that was the understanding in this part of Appalachia is that you weren't even from where you were born you were from where your grandmother was born well my grandmother was born in bunkham County so I am from bunkham County but I also was born in bunkham County so I think in olden times that made sense now if we had been we were I think most families are like this we were more focused on one on my mother's side than we were my father's um and I think that happens with a lot of people they're focused on one side or the other often yeah often whichever side is physically closest or or is nicest I don't know because I love concept but I'm I sitting there and I'm like okay is this is this my mother's mother that grandma or is it my father's mother that Grandma and actually one of my grandmothers was born in Central PA so that's how Pennsylvania reminded me of that I'm like okay so I I I apparently I am from central Pennsylvania oh uh how does that feel have you been there have you been to central Pennsylvania um I actually I used to spend as a child I would go two weekends a month down to my great-grandmother's down and w very Scranton area so I actually did spend a lot of time in that area as a child so yeah I actually it's Hollow when I think of wberry Scranton Pennsylvania and for any listeners in the that area I apologize it just feels Hollow and I know it's because it really is because of the coal mines because that whole area is literally Hollow underneath maybe 68 feet of of of top soil and that's exactly how it feels there is hollow that would be such a interesting oh Reclamation Act is how you could fill those Hollow places with love or enchantment or healing so that so that there was some even if it's if it's uh spirit it's bulky so that there's something under there and it doesn't feel so Hollow oh I'm gonna be thinking about that that'll be actually spark you to want to go to central Pennsylvania but yeah that's kind of almost the scent you get is that not not hollowed ground is how we normally think of hollowed ground but Hollow in a sense that there's nothing underneath you but you know in in European tradition anyway folk and fairy tradition there is a wonderful concept of Hollow Hills OH mountains and oh I love thinking about that so how would you then people those underground Hollow Chambers with Spirit folk that would be looking out for the land itself and maybe they're already there there's a lot in Pennsylvania has a very strong crypted and Forest creature and land Spirit you know this is a very strong land for that around every every tree around every Rock there's a different type of creature that's here so I would not be surprised if those Caverns weren't already filled with something oh oh I love that yeah yeah yeah little people are pretty active here in Pennsylvania and it's it's a huge Spirit place I I love Pittsburg sorry I know people look at me like I'm crazy the first time I got to Pittsburgh I was like how did this place gets so magical and people go Pittsburgh what is wrong with you but that place where the manonga Hala and what's the other River anyway where they come together at a point and form the Ohio and underneath there an aquafer that literally shoots out of the ground wow so it is it is the place of Four Rivers flowing in the same direction in one place feels incredibly powerful and I know Pittsburgh is weird I've always found River confluences to be a very magical place and I feel it's not Ashtabula but it's an a name like that is that the alagan river yes sorry alany I was going in my head I was like it's a mountain range it's a mountain range starts with an A yes the alagan and the manonga Hala come together to form the Ohio and the tip of land where that happens I mean it has a pretty sad history from native tribes and enslaved people that I think probably adds to the dimensionality of it but there's a found where the aquafer just shoots into the air I I just can't describe it it's so incredibly powerful and magical so there's a lot about Pennsylvania that is that is just amazing amazing and I would love to see people love Pennsylvania a little bit more and be less embarrassed by it oh my gosh I moved here in March I live in north central Pennsylvania and I'm absolutely in love with this whole area absolutely love this place I'm not from here you know my people and myself are more from the fingerlakes area of New York but I feel like I belong here you know from the moment I stepped onto this mountain and started walking these Woods it feels so good to work with the spirits here with the land spirits and going out into the woods I know shell has encountered quite a there's a lot of ghosts here it's an old church so there's also a lot of other types of spirits here as well but it just feels so good to go out to this place and to sit with the spirits of this land and to just be there with them and I you know that's something I absolutely love when I move to a new area is connecting with those Spirits yeah until I'm sleeping in your spare bed and all your windows are filled with those Spirits watching me sleep yeah good times there's a few ghosts here too bir yeah and and something that we don't talk about much that I would love to see especially the Pagan Community really jump into a little bit more is that the time between sa and the winter Solstas is really the time of ghosts and spirits we've talking about that a lot more yeah yeah because we had the big Blowout at at Halloween and S and we go oh that was great all the ghosts but I'm telling you this last days away from the winter solers everybody's gonna have people looking in the window while they're sleeping everybody not just not just Santa Claus this time no there's the Christmas witch and there's Krampus and and allat O yuat Odin with the wild Hunt and all these different gods goddesses spirits that help to shuttle or or fairy are dead from sa to the solstice this is the time when they all ride through and that's kind of the New Perspective I've had and and and I'll admit this is something that is kind of a New Concept for me to be following but I'm starting to look at this this time between sa and Ule is kind of like everybody shows up at and then by the solstice it's time to go you you know like like you're it's almost like when people come for the holidays they're all showing up during s and by youle okay move along you don't have to go home but you can't stay here kind of thing yes exactly and something that we play around with uh play around is probably the wrong phrase but something that we honor here is that when the wild geese are making their southern migration that they often pick up the spirits that need to be moving on and I call it in northern Europe they refer to that is the gab gabble ratchet um and when we see the and hear especially the gabble ratchet moving south we acknowledge hand over heart ancestors because the ancestors are going home now to the big home which has led me because I'm you know I'm Western European to the core I always think about the other lands the summerlands the Apple lands that they're in the west but the older I get and the more I think about all the people that move from the colder part of the country Southward and I think about elders and and ancestors moving where would they go they'd go to like kilargo wouldn't they right right they wouldn't stay here there are so many cultures I I believe it's the the Norse or some Scandinavian cultures it's the swan that carries spirits to the afterworld you know here in America it's geese or sometimes Cardinals or sparrows so I think that's pretty interesting you know that when they fly south that they're they're taking the spirits of your beloved Dead with them I think you know maybe the summerlands are in the South where it's warm they liter they literally are that's true now speaking of of the solstice and Ule we want to hear a little bit about some of your Ule Traditions some of your Solstice Traditions what are things that you try to whether it be on a spiritual work level or a DI DIY super fun holiday craft like what does Byron ballad do for you and Solstice well my daughter who is now 33 it's so hard to even believe that she was raised Pagan she is a cradle Pagan I to since the time yeah yes and since the time she was very small uh we would get we get up before the sun comes up on the solstice and we sing the Sun up and we make noise we had have noise makers and drums and all that and we would and as we can see the light because here the sun comes up but and it gets light but we don't see the sun because there mountains between us and the sun right right so it takes a while for that to happen and then we would sing and then the last thing we always sing is Here Comes the Sun da D and then we would go in and I would drink coffee and she would have hot chocolate and we did that all the way through college because she would come home from college then when she went out into the world we don't do that anymore and I do it most years I will go out with a cup of coffee and I'll you know rattle a bell or be a drum and then I will sing George Harrison and then it's like yay yay yay um so that's one thing that I love doing I collect early on in the in the season I collect Hanukah gelt the chocolate coins because they remind us that the sun is returning Soul Invictus and so I put those in all my gifts um so you might get a loaf of hand made By Me banana bread chocolate chip banana bread and some gold coins to remind you that the sun is returning and I still laugh every time I say that I laugh and think well the sun has always been here the whole time the planet is just the Tilt is changing that's what's happening but that's not nearly so romantic as the thought that the sun returns Sun returning yeah the unconquered sun returns coming back yeah and I think there's something so beautiful about that and and just me thinking that of course because there are so many holidays holy days around the winter solstice and that is just absolutely agriculturally based because at that point the days will get longer now they may be snowy and Subzero but the light is really really important I think for humans and even from a scientific perspective there's something absolutely stunningly beautiful about how dark it gets how deep you have to go within going towards the solstice it forces you to be quiet to go within a little bit more and then the knowledge that that light is coming back we love the light I mean as much as the dark can be comforting and a place of healing we do also want to go towards that so just knowing that now what the Tilt has changed what is it the axis tilt is the reason for the season but absolutely right but we know that and but that doesn't mean that it's any less profound or spiritual or beautiful just knowing that that light is starting to grow and get bigger and bigger is is just so wonderfully beautiful you know it doesn't have to be some crazy uh oh the sun might not come back if we don't make the noises but you know whether it's scientific or spiritual it's still absolutely beautiful and I love it you know that that old-fashioned notion that people made a lot of noise and all that at the winter solstice because they were afraid the sun wouldn't come back you only had to live through one cycle and you would go oh no now is the time when the days get longer it literally is not rocket science it's just observation and so you if you live in a community of people the oldest people will know yes every year that happens it'll be fine I mean we can do some stuff if we want to but it's still just going to happen and there would always be a shell who would fail to wake up at dawn because there's no way she's getting up that early and yet it would still happen and it would still come and so every be like it's okay well we slept through it this year and it still happened we're good we're okay you can sleep through it next year now there you go well it's really it's the beauty of following the cycle of the seasons isn't it so two solstices two equinoxes we don't have to believe in that that's astronomical it's going to happen right it is a hard concept though especially when you are in like say where we are located in the Northeast you know yes the sun is returning but that's the start of bitter cold season and sometimes it's hard to equate the light half of the year with such cold it really is you have to kind of trick yourself with that I think because just because there is more light doesn't mean there's more warmth right right and I'm a big Bridget person so we get to imul which I believe is the beginning of Spring and people go why are you out of your mind it's going to be like 12 degrees but it's the very bitsy bitsy beginning of Spring so that we see the snow drops come up we see the daffodil starting to come up so just like with a lot of cultures and the and the Kelts were one of those the beginning of it was subtle and small and it required you to pay deep attention to it and then you could go oh it is spring because look in this place where we had 36 degree weather for three days the chickweed is already up and that happens and it it forces us as humans to really pay attention to the world around us and not wait for and not wait for the big signs but to see the subtleties we need a little more of that paying attention to the subtleties yeah and I think that's what it it sounds like a lot of what a feral church is about it's a solstice to Solstice Journey right there's meditations with each chapter with each part of it and I think it's all about paying attention it sounds like it's about getting in touch with all those little things well that's part of it I mean that's really more my uh book seasons of a magical life that came out a few years ago that was really it was all about things you could do as the season rolled through FAL church is about the original subtitle was Finding goddess in the wilderness and it's about going either going out into places that are wild and untamed and natural and that's harder and harder to do because there aren't so many of those places anymore but a lot of those places are in here they're in our hearts and in our heads so feral church is about going inward or outward or in actually both and finding the place where you meet the Divine and the Divine meets you even if you're located in the big city you can get into that deep dark forest in your mind and meet the Divine well or you can find the Divine in the heart of that deep of that that big crazy City because there's a chapter in frell church where the conceit of the book is that this group of pilgrims move from place to place encountering different aspects of the Divine either within themselves or outside and one of the one of the chapters takes place with pelting down rain in a city that I imagine is New York because it's a big city I know pretty well and they're going to meet um a psychologist and a counselor who is a sin eater who practices the ancient art of sin eating and it's all about whether it is the built environment of an urban setting or it's the wild environment of the steps is is still a place where these encounters happen all the time and to pay attention to those encounters lead you into a deeper relationship an objection I have all the time to goddess figures that come from you know the places where you buy oh I'd love to have a picture on a statue on my altar of a particular Divinity is that they almost always look like the cover the fretta covers of the 70s for fantasy art and they have you know enormous pointed breasts and Tiny waists and Tiny hips and little skinny arms and you just think yeah yeah it's I never see her that way I never see them that way so I really want FAL Church to be an a way to open your eyes to the multiplicity of divine female but also to find all the places you can feel that I don't know probably you two have never been there but in Nashville Tennessee there is a recreation have you been there big tall gold statue is that what you're gonna say yes seen that I have seen that it's extraordinary because we are so used to oh the goddess she's about you know 10 Ines tall and she's made of plastic and you walk into the Parthenon and she is so huge that standing in her hand is winged Nike the goddess of Victory and winged Nike is six feet tall yeah yeah she just and the she was my Athena was my first goddess so when I saw that in Nashville I literally fell to my knees weeping it was like that's that's what we had in Greece and Rome that's what we had and the idea I mean I can't imagine it would take to commission an artist to to to sculpt that but just imagine if regionally we had these hubs of goddess worship like Ephesus was and there are many many different kinds of temples and chapels and and she can be everywhere well we are unlikely in this Christian dominated Nation to ever have that honestly um actually me sad when I said my mother lives in Middle Tennessee she does live outside of Nashville and when I when I went down there um I I did went and I went and saw the Athena statue and and all I could think of is and it's true this is probably the only time I will ever see in the greater public in America a goddess statue and Lea for frame of reference this damn thing is like 100 feet tall if not like it's literally like a 100 feet tall like you don't see goddess statues like that in America and I loved it so much and it was just just it was so striking being that shiny gold and being so big that you're just in awe you're just in awe yeah the fact that that was that I knew at the time time I will never see with my own eyes another goddess statue in America other than this one it was definitely a profound thing wow yeah wow well with having mother Grove goddess Temple and other other places uh around the country hopefully we can have more and more of them hopefully we will have more and more people starting churches and groups and local I was going to say local groups again but churches and groups and and local circles whatever Groves however you want to do it I think that's going to be very important going forward we're going to need to find each other I I've had probably a half dozen maybe more people contact me just on the strength of what they think FAL church is about to say this is the group I work with in Arizona Colorado Oregon and and is this a feral church is what we is this thing that we're doing a feral church so what I'm going to say to the two of you because you will get this and the people who listen listen to your podcast are going to get this this book is the tip of the spere it is the tip of the spere of a movement that is all about reclaiming Divine female great mother the mother world it's all about Reclamation and celebration of all of that and there is a a website that will be out when the book launches in January and a series of white papers one of which is what is a feral church and are you one and do you want one nice and and it is all about going into oh this is g to be the most controversial thing that I'm going to say and that you're going to hear I think I think of the abrahamic religions as this beautiful old building this wonderful old structure that has been abused for decades for hundreds of years for centuries and I am going into that structure and I'm taking out everything that works so I'm taking out the concept of the House Church I'm taking out the concept of religious education I am taking out the concept of mutual Aid and of feeding people so I I think of it as going into this old old structure and I'm taking out the copper pipes and I'm taking out the copper wiring and I'm taking out the beautiful mantle pieces that are made of marble and I'm taking down the new posts that are carved from Oak and taking all of those things that still have value out of that structure and we're going to use them in this movement to Rive not only the worship of the divine feminine the goddess the great mother and throughout the book I refer to them as singular and plural because I don't care if you think of it as one one being with many aspects or many aspects that are attached together I don't care and it doesn't matter how you think of it not about dogma and then at some point all of us together are going to take the roof off that old building and let it collapse yes every hair on my body is standing up yes absolutely when is when is the book out live for order oh you can
