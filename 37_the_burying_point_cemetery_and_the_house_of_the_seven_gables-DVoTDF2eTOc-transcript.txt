Crickets because it is a beautiful night and we're together in the Harvest Moon is a horizon it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 420 a.m. hi and welcome to the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends on opposite coast of the country tell each other my cat is being a brat we tell each other that your cat's being a brat do really actually I think we've done that before uhhuh tell each other's spine tingling Tales from the West and East coast of the USA but tell them our secret yes tell them our secret we're hanging out together in Salem Massachusetts Shell's current Hometown and the home of lots of spooky scary tales and frightful history and tonight for episode 37 we're talking about the House of the Seven Gables and the charter Street Cemetery also called the old burying Point Cemetery so tonight in Salem Massachusetts I'm Lea and I'm spooky High show Salem has got to be one of the most fun cities especially this time of year well from my perspective maybe not from a local so much holy moly can we just say how many Sanderson sisters have I seen this week you don't even know yes Hocus Pocus 2 is out yes it is it is and you know what can I tell you something I'm a horrible witch I'm a horrible Salem resident I haven't watched it yet because I've been busy I I I'm getting to it I'm hoping I watch it in the next day or two but I just had a lot of [ __ ] going on man sh I haven't watched it yet either okay I don't feel so guilty I had plans with my kids to watch it the day it came out which was the 30th and we didn't yeah because we didn't have time and so I'm trying I can't watch it by myself I got to watch it with my girls and so we're trying to find time to all get together but I cannot wait and then you know how it goes I I need to set aside like five hours because well you got to watch the first one into the second one that's right it's really kind of like a two movie thing but yeah Salem is it is heating up I mean you've seen the people they're everywhere everywhere everywhere insanity and you know I kind of love it except for the parking yeah parking on those streets is insane okay so all of our listeners I have a question are there any parking witches out there any anybody out there know any spells for parking spots because shoot them my way the stoned witches at gmail.com I need your parking spells people I imagine this time of year it's the place is probably just crawling your your population skyrockets I imagine but we saw people in costume of all sorts not just Sanderson sisters and taking pictures by the ropes mansion and in the gardens was so much fun I have to say you know there are people there are a lot of people dressed up already and I'm thinking to myself people you still got 20 some days to go horses no hey my house has been decorated since before the Equinox so I imagine people wear costumes probably all year round not just this time of year actually funny story one of my my co-workers in my day job they start going around town dressing up usually around the 20th 25th and uh they have eight to 10 costumes they rotate through the week of Halloween that's fantastic the only time I ever came close to anything that cool one year for the month of October when I would go to pick up my kids at elementary school I would wear a different witch hat every day in the month of October because I I do have a collection of witch hats I would just go pick my kids up at school in a cloak PE that was enough to put people over the edge in Upstate New York like oh my God and I'm like yeah I did the cloak on occasion but yes different witch hat and I have I have very simple ones to very elaborate frilly full ones with all sorts of different fun things on the brim and I had a lot of fun with that so I imagine having a bunch of different costumes to go walk around go to work in Salem Massachusetts yeah how fun is that I can't dress up for work so I just I'm wearing all black this month there you go hey that's a thing to do and I I did notice I was quite surprised when we went by the Bewitched statue which has recently been cleaned of red paint because I guess half the residents love the Bewitched no some dick and he wasn't even a Salem resident first of all oh really some [ __ ] came and he dumped like a bucket of red paint on the Samantha statue you know to be honest little serious note here I actually think that once the man was convicted did um I do believe he was a homeless person that did have some mental health issues but still dude a [ __ ] bucket of red paint on the bewitch Statue couldn't you have vandalize something else and I've heard that there's a little controversy over the bewitch statue some people love it as an addition to the witch City and some people think that it's a little too commercial and not really in keeping with the the history of the witch trials or with the current climate of you know modern witches and pagans going there doesn't really seem to fit in with either well here's the thing you can't have your cake and eat it too it's where you got to find the balance between witches witchcraft history and then pop culture you can't not like Samantha and then come here and go to every damn freaking Hocus Pocus filming site you know you can't be okay with Hocus Pocus and not okay with Samantha thank you for saying that actually I'm okay with Samantha from Bewitched being yeah you can't be okay with one and not the other you can't go to Every filming location you can't go to you can't go to the commons and see where Hobie Halloween was done and then complain about the Samantha statue you know exactly and I will admit when I went up to the Samantha statue I did rub her nose I'm quite surprised well yeah she who doesn't want a little bit of nose wiggling magic in their life I was very surprised that her nose is not like rubbed bronze but I expect it'll take a couple years but but yeah do you see my point though where is I do see your controversy issue but you can't have your cake and eat it too you can't be okay with Hubie Halloween and Hocus Focus and not with Bewitched I'm not a huge fan of the commercialization of anything but I mean let's get [ __ ] real if Salem wasn't commercialized there wouldn't be so many cool things to do so it's kind of a necessary evil I'm glad check this out here's another point if it wasn't commercialized they wouldn't be able to raise the money to preserve some of these awesome historical places excellent excellent point the other thing I wanted to bring up is a lot of this goes to fund the Historical Society of Salem a lot of the events uh that happen even some of our most favorite characters like um Bora like Bora is part of and we love Bora Bora is part of an artist Collective that works in Salem that help actually Bora Bora founded the artist Collective the Salem Black Hat Society Bora came to town uh oh Jesus uh six seven years ago or seven eight years ago and saw the need love doing what he does and he got together Jack Skellington he got together Satan which by the way Satan gives free hugs in Downtown Salem he's a wonderful gentleman I'm sad we didn't see Satan I am a huge fan of the Church of Satan so it would have been really great to see Satan and get a hug and he wears a big sign around his neck that says free hugs how can you not love it who doesn't like a good hug they call it the what do they call it the Autumn pumpkin head I don't know it's like this oh I saw her yes I ran into her wagon complimenting her on her dress they have one that that does Maleficent one that does the IT guy the Pennywise from it yeah so yeah so Bora started this Collective of of street performers called Salem's Black Hat Society and they just add to the vibe man I love they really very much do Salem just has so much going forward it's such a rich culture right now and and it's a lot of fun to be a part of so go check it out make sure to tip your tour guides get involved in all the local happenings and have a lot of fun we certainly did today when we went to the House of the Seven Gables and the charter Street Cemetery you know the thing about the cemetery is some people get confused because it's called the charter Street Cemetery because it's like on Charter street but most people know it is either burying point or old burying Point there's like two or three really old cemeteries here and the funny thing is and we're gonna talk about another one on a different episode but this is like the most popular if cemeteries can be popular this is the most popular Cemetery in Sal I think they can judging by the amount of people that were there during the day when we were there it's very popular not just the memorial outside of it but the the walking paths that they have through the the actual yeah the actual Cemetery where the you know the what do you call them burial plots what is yes it was packed with PE it it was absolutely packed with people and there was a very that's right except for that one mysterious Corner that we were over at but we're gonna talk about that corner in just a second we will we will we even have some live takes from in the cemetery itself got a couple Hawthorns there including the judge that was Judge Hawthorne of the witch trials who is the great great grandfather of Nathaniel author the author of the book House of the Seven Gables yeah so we got to see his his um grave site which they've actually preserved his Stone which was kind of cool um and it's I believe it's his ghost I didn't see it I don't believe you saw it but people do say that they see the ghost of Judge Hawthorne wandering the cemetery they do and it's funny because remember that part of the cemetery where there was like a big tree in the center and there was Graves all tucked up against the tree and then there were chains around it yes yes that one family plot that's and I think it was peel if I'm not mistaken yes that's where I'm feeling Vibes is around there in the back half I I believe on the opposite half from where judge Hawthorne's grave is there's a couple really interesting trees that have grown in very strange ways and it's interesting there I would agree with you that that side of the cemetery including that one lone gravestone that you pointed out me off in the one corner it's kind of all by itself I was so wishing that the path went closer yeah why do you put a gravestone by itself explain this to me like I had questions that I didn't get me too it's an almost empty corner but just the one gravestone while there are a lot of historical people buried in this cemetery and there is a map right there there are a couple spots where people do believe that enslaved people were buried and also poppers were possibly buried without being marked so they they do think there's quite a few Graves there that they can't identify the people because they know there's more people buried there than there are gravestones and you know we actually we talked about that um in one of our recordings as we were walking through those people are probably the ones that are given the Spooks in that Cemetery right I don't feel no Hawthorn stuff we saw a couple peab bodies there we call it Peabody because we're from upstate New York but it's PE pey you're here but but for all you all you Massachusetts listeners it's p a B- o d y That's peab Peabody people Mr pey um is buried there so you know there's there is some very historical figures but I think it's it's not the historical figures that you're getting the vibe from what I very much enjoyed I I did enjoy wandering through the cemetery and looking at the very very old grave Stones I mean it's amazing and it's rumored that Nathaniel hawor the author himself would walk through those cemeteries with his wife who used to suffer from migraines and so to help soothe her in the evenings they would walk through the cemetery and it's rumored that some of the names that he got for his book including hepsa that he got them from the gravestones themselves now one thing I think people don't always realize because people come to Salem with some ideas and no history backing it not one person that was accused of Witchcraft is buried there yeah Hawthorne is there but there is no accused folk there but I know what you were leading into the gorgeous Memorial right at the the entrance of the cemetery so why don't you give me your impression on that because honestly I don't mean to brag here but I go there for walks on my lunch break what was your impression this Memorial was dedicated in 1992 I believe it was August 5th 1992 there was a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and a team of artists named James Cutler and Maggie Smith created this Memorial and the very first thing I noticed walking in was on the ground the the line of cement and in the cement are all the last words of the people that were killed you know I I've noticed that but I've honestly there's always people there when I walk through at lunch so I've never been able to read them all were you able to catch any of that I was able to catch a few I wish I could remember them at the moment but of course I can't but what did strike me and and it was hard to read there's a lot of people there I mean I'm looking at a picture of it empty right now and it's so beautiful and so big but it's usually full of people so it was kind of hard to read but I believe what they did was they cut they cut them off it's not the entire last saying of each person okay like parts of it it's just the first part as if like their life had been cut short kind of thing so it's like an artistic thing that they did where it's just the the first part of each person's last words you know it's weird every time I go there though I step over it it again it's it's hard to see it's on the ground it's it's you know it's not very highlighted no I mean I step over it like another Superstition I follow from when I was a kid stck yeah don't step on a crack you'll break your mother's back subconsciously I always step over it well that makes sense I never step on it and I didn't think about that until it was there with you and I no that I subconsciously do not step on that I W I step over it kind of don't step on the crack you break your mother's back kind of don't step on something that's holy those are powerful words I mean those are words that these accused spoke and no one listened right and somehow in my mind it's disrespectful to step on it yeah I love that I love that and so when you walk in it's this low wall it's not even waist high it's just a low stone wall surrounding three sides of they almost look like Stone benches gutting out from a stone wall kind of like kind of that height almost like a bench height yeah instead of sticking up like a grave these Stones stick out like you said like a bench from the wall and carved in each one is the name and the date and how they were killed Martha carrier hanged August 19th 1692 of course I saw the one for Giles Corey pressed to death September 19th 16 1992 and walking around it it really hits home when you see name after name after name killed on the same day and that's really when it struck me how terrified everybody must have been in the town at that time just the thought that at any moment your neighbor could accuse you or your child or your spouse of being a witch and you were standing in the same location where these people were fearing for their lives granted 300 years ago but like here's the thing and and and and this kind of we talk we touched about this a tiny bit in in the last episode and I'm sure we'll touch on it again you think you're gonna come here and get this Wich trials Vibe but what you're really getting is a washed over tourist watered down you know what I mean you're not getting a lot of that old witchy Vibe and in certain spots and in certain locations and at certain times you feel like what it would have been like like in you know last episode we were talking about it with the stained glass windows at the at the witch house you know somebody at one point 400 years ago was looking out those same windows we were and in in this spot people were fearing for their lives in that same exact spot where we were just hanging out and you feel it in that Memorial area whereas you might not feel that walking down Street or what have you but in that Memorial area it becomes a little more somber I think I think if people are going there looking for everything to be haunted I think they do that's the problem you're you're not exactly going to get that I mean I guess it is a little I mean it's haunted with the weight of History there's so much there and and again just to walk around and to know these are the very streets and the cobbles and the stones are there and these these dark gray buildings that are all preserved they all kind of preserve that moment in history so I don't know I guess haunted with history it could certainly be that it's almost like it feels like it's like an onion that you just keep peeling back and peeling back you know and there the more you peel back the more there is you know what I mean and if you're coming from a town where there's maybe one pagan shop that's disguised as a as a gift shop or something been there done that right to go to Salem where not only are there shops upon shops upon shops Becca everyone there will talk to you about witches and Witchcraft they'll talk to you about spells you can look like a witch and no one turns their head in disgust you can walk down the street I love that velvet dress awesome where'd you get it fantastic cloak oh you made it yourself cool you know that doesn't really happen anywhere else it's fully acceptable here and so if you want to go and get that Vibe it's it's wonderful it's Rich it's thick it feels good you you're you go from being in the broom closet and quiet about who you are to wanting to wear that overwhelming acceptance you go from you go from the broom closet to overwhelming acceptance because here no matter what your flavor you fit in and everybody's cool with you and that that's a Salem's kind of like a Melting Pot and not not just religiously but in most demographics whatever your deal in life is it's okay in Salem and that's different what I'm used to in a small rural Upstate New York town yes and I I loved how you said that because it's so true that that radical acceptance that that wild everywhere you turn you're it's going to be okay to be who you are that you don't get that and that's beautiful and that's fabulous and I mean go there for that if nothing else one Halloween I saw a guy wearing a speedo and everybody he was just walking down the street people like go you man happy Halloween exactly exactly and and it is a wonderful place to experience that especially as a witch I mean I know there's so many other types of people who have difficulty being who they are just in real life obviously witchcraft is not like the worst one but just to go somewhere and not have to second guess you know wearing your witchy best it it just it's just a lot of fun you know and everyone you talk to is going to know what herb is good for your headache they're going to know what crystal is going to help elevate your mood it's just a really nice Vibe oh you want to do this type of spell well maybe you should pick up this and pick up this then get a pinch of this and a dash of that oh here you go do you want a little silk bag for that yes it's very validating and very fabulous I love that you get to live here I love that you get to experience all of this wonderfulness that Salem has to offer and I think have a lot to offer back you know sometimes I'll walk down Essex Street and even though it's so commercial the middle of the street is still the Cobblestone and like sometimes I actually trip on it because I'm a clut and I'll be like you know how many people over how long have walked down this cobblestone street because it's you know the original Street and the way it's built you're like they built this for horses and carriages not for cars today I went to emese Botanicals today and there's like two walls that are nothing but jars of herbs and they'll measure out how many ounces you want out of the jars there were two shops in particular that I really really loved going into and absolutely have got to go in again we know one of them's Lor cabbits Enchanted nope didn't even make my top five to be honest I know I know sorry it just didn't it just didn't I loved it don't get me wrong but loved way more let me guess right by my work and it had the bones you could buy teeth there hien Forge yes that's exactly it hi and Forge is on 30 Church Street in Salem Massachusetts and they describ themselves as eclectic finery and peculiar Oddities featuring 30 plus local makers and curators so it's hi and Forge craft and curation Collective and I adored them that shop was Fant fantastic well everybody loves freaking the twin boys um Black Veil that's Ito yep so yeah and the other one was the Black Veil and I'm absolutely going to be getting an appointment to have a tattoo from one of those gentlemen that shop is gorgeous I loved everything in there it was a really great place I want to go do a ritual in their back room hell right I I would love it it looks like somebody's been doing ritual in there judging by the candles in the tree but uh I guess they competed on Inkmaster in 2016 oh no [ __ ] who knew I'm going to have to look up that season of inkmas but yeah the the twin brothers from Black Veil which is a tattoo shop and a regular sales shop in Salem Matthew and Ryan Murray they're identical twins it's the Black Veil Studio of tattoo and art on cabitt street and they're kind of cute by the way oh yeah they were on season8 of Ink Masters I'm going to have to check them out how did they how how how did they fare is the question I don't no that is a good question I did not see that season but the Black Veil Studio was a really really cool shop let's talk about our visit to the House of the Seven Gables what did you think what was your first impression so here was my opinion now it's funny because you know I guess I kind of I joke and call it a part-time resident of Salem for the last six years I've lived here full-time for two and a half and never made it there never once made it there and then once we started doing this podcast and talking about you know doing a Salem month because I lived here I purposefully didn't go there waiting for you to come so that we could go together oh it was such a great tour I loved it well worth it you got in for free I got in for free by the way Salem residence free but I would have paid it I I don't even care I would have paid but to get into the house of Seven Gables if you are Salem resident like shell you can get in for free or in October it's $25 for a guided tour package I highly recommend it it was very informative our guide Katie with a c was fabulous so and you can get a grounds pass if you just want to walk around and look at the buildings or look at the gardens which are gorgeous that I believe is $12 here's the thing I am actually glad that I waited to experience this with you because first of all anytime we do anything together it's super kickass so much fun I guess I didn't know that it was more than one house okay that's actually a really good point The House of the Seven Gables is a park essentially yeah you hear House of the you don't hear houses you know I I didn't I didn't know I it's actually considered a museum site and there are five buildings there all of which well most of which were moved to the Mansion the Mansion itself The House of the Seven Gables was built on the spot where it is right now so it's on the original spot then there's also something called the retire Becket house which is the Museum Store and that was moved there in 1924 then there's the Hooper Hathaway house and the counting house and those were moved to the site and also the house that was the birthplace of Nathaniel Hawthorne that's the house where we ended our tour that was um originally on Union Street I guess and that was moved to to the museum site in 1958 you know what I liked about that house what that house was red yeah and all the other houses were that black wood that we've talked about in our previous episode but but but the the Hawthorne birthplace it was red and it was cute it stood out I wonder why that one's red and the other ones have that special paint on them to preserve I I didn't like legit did not know that there were that many I just thought it was one house I I thought it was one house my bad like I didn't know now the counting house was closed when we were there it looked like they were doing renovations but you could see into it from the house it was cute and the little Museum Store which is the retire Becket house I don't know who that is I feel terrible but that wasn't really a focus of our particular tour but you could walk through that house and and you know purchase things at the store which was a lot of fun including Nathaniel Hawthorne's books copies his books that are for sale there if you are looking for souvenir that relate to Hawthorne in any way um actually the gift store at the House of Seven Gables Rock Solid 110% great no I was just going to say that when you go there it's not just the houses you want to experience you really want to check out the garden we keep saying this how many houses what that must have been a thing in Salem Gardens it must have been maybe that time time period I think all houses had like a vegetable garden at the very least but these Gardens are stunning and they're kind of in the middle of all these houses and the museum proper yeah very very pretty and interestingly on the second floor of the House of Seven Gables you me and my husband when we looked at our pictures later we had all stood in apparently the exact same spot at the exact same window and took a pictures of the garden in the exact same way wasn't that so weird when we figured that out cuz that was so not planned do you know what I read later doing research oh Jesus you're going to freak me out now aren't you can't help yourself now Nathaniel Hawthorne did not live in this Mansion This House of the Seven Gables his cousin who he was very close to lived there and her name was Susanna ingera and she was [ __ ] wicked cool but we'll get into her later power to the woman right apparently she is well known to have stood in a window on the second floor overlooking the gardens in particular a window that had a view of the gardens and this and the water so I would like to add to this little tidbit of the story that you know that was a super cool location first of all but you know you and I kind of go through things with the oh I wonder what we're going to see or feel or hear or experience blah blah blah blah blah and you go through this whole house lot of fun very cool very historic that stairwell not for the claustrophobic no we'll we'll get to the Hidden Staircase note to self please do not wear short dresses to the House of Seven Gables tour I had the best view but you know we're going through everything you and I had both agreed after the fact after we left and we're we're driving home the same room that we all randomly took the same picture was the only room that we all said that we actually felt something yes because isn't that the room I know I'm gonna let you talk about it and tell the story but isn't that the room where you felt like you might have seen something yeah and I'm GNA preface that when we get there I'll talk a little more about it I'll preface it with it could have been another tour it could have been a tour guide I'm not sure but we'll get there maybe I saw a ghost Lea's just talking [ __ ] because that place isn't big enough that there wasn't enough room for another tour to cast a shadow but we'll let her talk her [ __ ] keep going so we went to the House of Seven Gables not because maybe you didn't go there before because the house of the Seven Gables isn't technically a witchy house it was there during the witch trials I think people think that any of those houses that have that black color or witchy mistaken assumption they do look witchy and this is a historic house that was there during that time period and someone related to the house judge Hawthorne who is again the great great grandfather of Nathaniel Hawthorne he was part of the witch trials so what would live there would he have been the great great great great great uncle to Suzanne ingersol then I think I think they were cousin cousin so maybe the same he would probably also be her great great-grandfather okay so there was technically like a a DNA tie but there was no tie from The Witch Trials to this this I think some people do make a tie there because the book The House of the Seven Gables that Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote takes place during the witch trials and the house figures into that do you know how cool it was was to be in some of those rooms and be like Nathaniel Hawthorne was in here thinking about the pages he was writing right when he was there with his with Susanna there weren't Seven Gables on the house there were actually only three so let's a little quick history of the house itself it's actually called the Turner ingera mansion and it was built in 1668 by a captain named John Turner who was extremely wealthy however his father came to the United States as an indentured servant which is essentially a slave for 12 years so his son was born while he was here in the states as an entered servant and so he grew up in poverty very quickly this boy took Salem by storm he started as a hat and shoe Merchant and by 1668 had made so much money that he built the the Mansion which at the time I think our tour guide showed us what looked like originally it was a very large two-story building but still didn't have Seven Gables actually if you if if you guys if any of our listeners take the tour remember she had that model where she could pull apart in the Attic yeah what it looked like that was super cool very cool I I I know I know you're trying to give a little bit of the history but for those who don't know and there's no shame in the game if you don't know because I didn't know until kind of recently can you kind of explain what a Gable is I'm so glad you asked like what the [ __ ] is Seven Gables what is one light alone seven sure a Gable is a fancy way to say a sloped roof that's shaped like a triangle a pointy roof so they had seven pointy roofs yep so I had seven yeah exactly it had seven triangle pointed roofs but in the beginning it just had two Gables I believe well I just figured some people don't know what a Gable is it's not like we call it that nowadays pointy roof Gable's a pointy roof and so it was small but very large for the time and he continually added on to it and eventually it did have Seven Gables it was very large house with beautiful fire places by the way freaking beautiful fireplaces the whole thing was gorgeous and it was constructed in a way to show off the wealth from the types of pillars that were used down the the height of the ceilings being high to show that they could afford to heat such large rooms people think the witch trial stuff is like super old history but bear in mind the House of the Seven Gables was built what 30 years prior to the witch trial so actually The House of the Seven Gables predates The Witch Trials yeah and again the house itself has nothing to do with the witch trials other than the fact that someone lived there while the witch trials were happening and had a distant relation to a judge isre that's really the only tie is a dis in the future in the future that judge's offspring would have a tie to the house house but in a small town in that time everybody's related to everybody folks that's the same judge hathorne whose gravestone is at the burying Point Cemetery one thing that I felt was interesting and I didn't know did you know that green paint kind of meant you were rich I didn't know that and and Katie our tour guide with a c um explained that it was like a copper paint and then I find out that that paint can kill you so if you're rich you can afford expensive K that's gonna kill you Bravo how fun by the time so Susanna angers saww was na Nathaniel Hawthorne's second cousin and by all accounts they were very close and it was her Tales she made it that Katie made it sound like they were like best friends and spent a lot of time together and that he spent a lot of time at her house she was the air but I loved the story of how this my favorite part of her story right kind of bucked tradition and fought her family to get her inheritance and keep that house women were not allowed to have money and property especially if they were married um you had half a chance to have money and property if you were single but the minute you got married you forfeited that to your husband that's [ __ ] by the way and Susanna made a name and and a fortune for herself you know she from what I understand she created she um when she inherited the property her let's see her mother inherited the property when her husband Samuel and her son Ebenezer died um of a sickness after a journey I believe it was yellow fever and then three other children died so Susanna was the only remaining child her father and her brother die and then her mother dies in 1811 and Susanna inherits everything I believe she had to fight her uncle for it do you remember it was it was dis a more distant relative and I remember that um you know someone in our tour had asked that she got remarried and they were very adamant that she would not entertain getting married no matter what because that meant forfeiting everything to her husband and you know back then let's be legit people didn't really marry for love and someone would have come after her just to take her [ __ ] and then lock her up in a Gable I don't know and right she was not willing to give any type of power to anyone so she would not she chose her inheritance over love and you know back in that day you had to do what you had to do I would have done the same but she fought it in court and one which I think they made it sound like that was not a normal thing either right and and so very strong woman kept it you know kept it together very close to the thaniel and by all accounts a very good Storyteller it was her stories about what the house had originally looked like with Seven Gables because I guess throughout the years it had gotten built up and then kind of changed as Styles changed so it no longer had Seven Gables when Susanna and Nathaniel would play chess but she told him about the time that it did and that struck his fancy so much that that's why he um wrote it that way in the House of the Seven Gables I almost felt like the way the tour guide explained it in in their closeness and all those stories and and and playing the games and stuff it almost felt like they may co-wrote some of it oh oh I love that thought did you did you get that impression maybe now that now that I've pointed it out to you did you feel like maybe she was implying that Suzanna might have contributed maybe I don't know I definitely got the impression that that her Lively conversation certainly sparked his imagin and had a lot ofation on stuff yeah May yeah maybe I don't know it was the way it was implied is they were more like best friends than relatives you know what I mean yes yes I very much got that impression as well and a later relative I don't remember what her name was much later another relative um put back the Seven Gables and actually added a few things to the house to make it close more closely resemble the house from the book The House of the Seven G I think that's about the time that they were looking to then use it as a museum if I'm not mistaken yes she added the storefront she added a few things to the house itself uh just she added back all the gables to to come to a total of seven um to make it more of a tourist attraction and um one of the more fun bits is the secret staircase that you get to go into that's in the dining room right next to the fireplace yeah you're calling at fun bits cuz I had on a short dress and you were behind me well it was nice to be distracted because very claustrophobic we'll put a picture up on the website of the door it's a very very narrow very narrow staircase I'm not joking it's tiny and it kind of pops out from the wall it looks like a panel of the wall next to the fireplace and our tour guide popped it open and told the story of a character in the book who was known to move about the house secretly and so this particular owner of the house put the staircase in to again more closely resemble the book and we know this because it's in the plans for that year the staircase although several websites that I went to alternately said that it was put in the house when it was created to um save relatives from the Salem Witch Trials also that it was put in later and used during the Underground Railroad but that house was never a stop on the Underground Railroad and the staircase did not exist during the the sing Witch Trials basically it sounded like there was a family member that was kind of of like a recluse and they would use that stairwell to move about the house because they were recluse there ain't no big drama story here people there a't that was it yeah in the book that was in the book yeah but I mean it that to say that it used is is the Underground Railroad and and in the W that that's just false but I would like to point out you did not like this so that staircase actually leads to a room that you then feel that there's no way out yeah there was no door and and I was good with the staircase that's because you were looking up my dress that helped it was your L son I believe the night before who was regaling us with stories of when he had gone in so I knew to expect the staircase and I was prepared for it and it was fun enough that I was able to kind of breathe through and look up your dress as we were going up this teeny tiny staircase I knew it was going to be okay so I was I was good with that but then we get to this little teeny tiny room but it felt like a room with no door and no way out it did the only doors I could see were the one little door that we came up in and there were people coming up through that door so I couldn't go back down because it's much too tiny there's no way you could I could go down that until everyone had come out and the only other door that we were near was a um a closet so I started to get a little panicky in that very small room so keep that in mind if you're claustrophobic but there's a couple windows and we stood by a window that helped a little and then once we could see I saw that there was another door on the other side of the room that it actually didn't really it didn't even really look like a door it looked like a panel that opened up now yeah you're short and we still love you but I had to duck to go through it so like this wasn't like a fullsize like what you're used to as a door it almost felt like you were walking between the walls when we left that room didn't you almost have that sense like you were walking between the walls yeah yeah it feels like even though it was kind of like cobbled together later to be a secret stairwell in a secret room it very much feels like a secret room it's a lot of fun it's tiny and it's it's tucked back and it's got these little windows that you can look out it feels like you're in a place that no one could find you if they didn't know that room was there it really does the doors are kind of concealed in the wall and as you come out like you said the the house is settled a little bit so a lot of the door frames kind of angle down right so as you go through most people have to duck I'm barely 5 too so I didn't have to but you Amazon people all had to duck quite a bit be jealous but it it it's a really really cool house and there's a lot of history there and a lot of stories and it's just fun to experience that our tour guide had so much to tell about the space that's one thing I do want to also point out um for anybody coming to the Salem region any time of year even not October the tour guides at the House of Seven Gables like they get quality folks um they give them historical education um you're not getting no [ __ ] you're getting the facts the history and if anybody in the Salem area is listening Katie with a c who is a tour guide at the House of Seven Gables deserves a raise because she did a bang up badass job with us and we were just fascinated start to finish weren't we totally fated I hug on her every word it was a lot of fun she had so much information about the house about the time about all the different little tiny details that you might have otherwise you know what I loved I'm such an ass I loved the secret panel that opened up to like a liquor cabinet that was beautiful I wanted to put my weed in there it was so ornate and pretty and you could put bong you could actually put Bongs in there and then oh yeah a lot of space I don't know if I'd use it for liquor but totally this is my cannabis cabinet it's beautiful look at it let me open this up which would you like would you like a pipe would you like a bong pick one what flavor now there is one room where they're they're not doing so many Renovations they've kind of left it so you can see what it looks like and and they have a few different I believe it was the room where we took the pictures we were kind of going past that room on the first part of the tour and that's where I think I may have seen a ghost or a tour guide or another person or something but what I saw as we were going down the hall past this doorway that that ended up being that partly finished room with the displays that we went into later I know that one of the displays was pressed tea from China yes very cool stuff and so as we were going by there my eye was caught because I saw a woman with like brown hair all I really got an impression of was someone who put their hair up like in a big messy bun somebody with dark brown hair big messy bun and like a dark maroon either baggy pants or dress maybe I don't know didn't really see them full on just caught an impression that there was someone there it struck me because the room itself looked different from the rest of them so I saw this person go by and kind of stuck my head that way so I could look into the room because it's not as finished or polished as the rest of the house and I didn't see anybody there and I didn't see that same person later so I don't know I like to think maybe I saw Susanna just for a second I would just like to point out folks that I'm nosy I look at everything around me I don't know was built into to me to know my surroundings especially with people around and not once was there anybody matching that description anywhere near us in that house just saying yeah I'm not sure now the tour guides and the people that work there will swear up and down that it's not haunted yeah but I do think that that room I didn't you know all the other places gorgeous like the Hearth fireplaces downstairs I would die for that [ __ ] but yeah but that room that unfinished room and and I can put up a picture um on Instagram uh for y'all to see but there was this one corner and you didn't you didn't catch [ __ ] in the beginning until we got home or back to my house I should say I was showing you my pictures but this one corner kept pulling me and for some reason I zoomed right in where the the the what do you call it crown molding meets in the corner of the room yeah and even you when you saw the picture you were like yeah there's something about that I don't know who or what I didn't get a who or what or why Vibe but there's something that was like in that room I can't even say if I felt positive negative and different I I don't I just something and I kept drawing to that like the corner of the room or the crown molding Meats at the top to the point where I ended up taking a picture of it you know and it's that room where people have said that they people have said they have pictures of Susanna herself standing in that window and historically it's said that that's where she would stand and look out at over the gardens now remember see Shadows tell us tell us what you found out because I remember you specif I hope you remember what she said CU I'm calling you out on it I remember you specifically asking the tour guide what was that room the house was built in different sections there was like a main section and then there were different wings that were added on to it at different points in time the unfinished room was at one point the master bedroom I was trying to determine if that was the master bedroom at the time Susanna owned the house so I'm fairly certain that that room above the dining room was Susan her bedroom which would make sense because again to to Circle back to something we said previously this is also the same room where where myself ilila and Lila's husband all took unknowingly all took the same picture out the same window of the same thing and it's not like there's just one window here this is the whole wall of Windows you know there's you know we were wanding around taking different pictures of all sorts of different things we just happen to take the exact same photo obviously when you're looking out windows you can hit anything from any angle we took the same picture from the same angle of the same thing like it was yeah [ __ ] up other people do report seeing shadow figures in the corners uh particularly in the Attic a lot of people like to mention the attic which is above the room that we were in when you were looking up at the crown molding uh they also seal the ghost of a little boy and there's different rumors as to who this little boy might be none of them kind of really fit but enough people see this little boy separately that they know he's kind of there I don't believe I heard a backstory on that do you remember a backstory on the boy no I don't have any backstory on the boy just that people see the ghost of a little boy playing near the attic and that a psychic went there once and took a tour of the house she said she saw a young boy playing up the near Gables and she took a picture of him oh other people have reported that they too like possibly I have seen Susanna angol Walking The Halls and have taken pictures of her peeking out the windows at the gardens some people have reported when they've gone up into the attic a whole tour uh started feeling nauseous all at the same time they went up to the attic and a couple people started feeling queasy and and uh dizzy quite a few people in the same Tour all reported having the same the same feelings and they're not sure why people have caught faces in the upstairs windows so there are some reports of ghosts here and there but not a lot and again most of the tour guides and employees will will tell you that they haven't seen anything and that they feel it's not haunted I mean I don't know just like anything else it's all a matter of perspective I this is going to blow your mind I believe I felt more activity at the House of Seven Gables specifically in that room than I did at the whole witch house I believe it there's been a lot that's happened in the House of Seven Gables I mean I'm not surprised I'm not surprised I'm pretty sure I saw a flash of something and a lot of people have reported seeing different things there so that's interesting we've talked in in a lot of episodes probably almost every damn one Jesus um we've talked about like locational hauntings that are tied to the location I do think you it was Susan that you saw and here's why because I think she loved that house so damn much that the [ __ ] won't leave I believe it she fought for that house she was more than willing to uh you know I don't think she was like slayed to death there I just I just think she is stubborn and will not give up her H that's her house that Mak damn house and she ain't giving it up for nobody no matter how many hundreds of years that's her house and that's kind of it ain't witchy you know it isn't creepy it's just she fought for that house and she's still not given it up 400 years later that makes total sense that's the haunting Vibe I get like this is my house MH yeah no I do too I I very much get that as well you know her story is so wrapped up in the story of the House of Seven Gabriel I just wish I knew the back story of the boy because she didn't have children and stuff so that's where I'm kind of like where did the boy fit into the whole history of the house but you get a handful or a dozen or a couple dozen people who see it you know I ain't going to dispute it I just am curious to the backstory okay so I didn't find anything specifically about a boy who had died there or a boy ghost it's not entirely accurate that Susanna didn't have any children it's true that she never married even though she had many offers and she always signed her paperwork as Susanna ingersol single woman so that part's true and she did love the house and pretty much lived there her entire life she did however adopt a son named Horus Connelly and he became her Heir but he didn't die there and he did grow up there also another interesting fact about Susanna is that in the 1830s a woman named Mary clof began living in the mansion with Susanna some people thought maybe that she was the housekeeper but not much as known about her she's listed in some records as a servant and sometimes she's only listed as a member of the household but nothing else is really said a few people and I'm definitely one of them think that she was Susanna's love Susanna's life partner and there are also rumors that Mary was horus's biological mother we also know that when Susanna passed away in her will she wrote that Horus would inherit the property under the stipulation that he take care of Mary until her death interesting Susan was definitely very cool interesting woman and a badass but let me tell you if you are a history buff this [ __ ] rocks this [ __ ] rocks I I mean and and we both are the same we like the ghosty the Paranormal the spooky Wookie but we also like history and for the sake of History it is worth however much they charge you to get in because I wouldn't know because Salem residents are free and one of my favorite things and I'm not going to give it away because you have to go on the tour to find out was in the Attic we went up to the attic and the tour guide showed us you can see a lot of the different pieces of construction and some of the old ways of construction in the Attic which is cool enough there's also a miniature of the house that the tour guide used to show us how the house was built and added on to and taken away from years yeah and there's a secret in the floor and I really really liked that detail that came with a c our tour guide pointed out and I thought that was a cool fact and I'm going to keep my lip zipped on it but I was like oh my God that's F yeah right what a fun historical fact I really really enjoyed that one so it was unexpected it wasn't what I thought and when I found out I was like are you kidding me like I was quite surprised not what you would have thought no not at all not at all what anyone would have thought which was which what made it kind of interesting and it's silly little things like that that stand out but if you want to know you have to go up the secret stairway ha and if you're lucky enough to get Katie with a c as your tour guide tell her that the stoned Witches Hour sent you and that we love her and she deserves a raise that's right tip her well we didn't talk about what we're smoking I got a eight for eight on endgame I'm still smoking endgame really yum we've talked recently about the harvest my father grows outdoor in New York York State and he has harvested and I managed to visit him recently and got some of his weed so to continue our shery Board of cannabis this bowl that we're smoking on is some of lless dweed also smoking some blue coffee which is something I've never heard of before and I couldn't really find it doesn't have any THC content listed and I couldn't find it online so I don't know what blue coffee is but it's kind of delicious it's very very um it's kind of not really purple but kind of dark red and it's got some super dark green leaves and it's very dark it looks a little orangey yeah it's got It's kind of dark red it's got like a dark red dark green dark red because I've had this endgame for so long I just feel like and I feel like such a mooch smoking all your weed but we're gonna smoke all your weed because you have different stuff than I do I'm always happy to bring stuff over to you and you know my dad's stuff is a little shaggy he he is definitely not a trimmer at all he just kind of cuts the buds off that's why we love your dad's weed your dad's been we've been smoking your dad's weed for 20 years like that right right you take the fan leaves off though and you just kind of this is definitely good stuff and stuff and shove wouldn't you say I mean it's an AER it's not as tight but it smokes really good and I would just like to point out to everybody that for as much as Lila has ridden my ass episode after episode after episode about my damn silicone pipe that I love more than anything she ain't bitching she ain't bitching about it when she's puffing off it are you now I can't stop smoking it I've broken yet another glass bowl thankfully they're only like 20 bucks that's cuz you didn't get a silicone pipe and that's why you you know what I don't you love my little top it's perfect I love the whole thing it's cute I thought it was gonna feel weird or smoke weird but no it smokes perfectly I love it well now you want one I do I do well I do and I also don't I love my glass I love can we just talk for a minute because now that you're in Salem and have actually experienced it how do you like just being able to smoke Whenever Wherever here we are let's just smoke how'd that strike how nice is that you know you see people just walking down find a nice little spot to smoke because I think this is I think this is the first time that we've hung out together in a legal State true so it was very we were both acting like people are looking people are going to smell weed and then we're like oh yeah that's right puff puff pass you know you go to a nice little outdoor smoking spot and and it's nice to be able to just sit there and spark up a joint or grab your little silicone pipe and puff on it it's forgot I forgot when we did our last episode to ask you that because I I did want to get your impression of did you the legal thing I love it the legal thing and just being able to kind of I mean we went we were just smoking going from place to place how fun it's just a little surreal to go from being closeted you know the weed closet to to being able to smoke on the street if we wanted to very similar from going from the broom closet to were we ever in the blue room closet you and I weren't but we were the exception and not the rule that's true I was very much as much as I could be in the weed closet because you had to be you know it was very much illegal so to be able to see it you know going down the street or being able to see the shops everywhere we walked into a couple head shops I looked at pipes there and it's I think it's great I mean they they verify that you're 21 but Jesus I can't even buy a pack of cigarettes without being verified that I'm 21 so what's the difference but yeah and it's not you know I wasn't smoking like right next to a bunch of kids or anything we we were being good about it but it's really nice to be able to be outside and to not have to worry that I'm going to get a ticket or for [ __ ] sake go to jail yeah you know lose my job lose my freedom over an herb it's very nice to not have to worry about it you got a new book I want to know what is your new book who is it by most importantly and what is it like a book book a PO a book of poems a book of rituals like start talking woman well after reconnecting with Gail Hami from for never again the burning I discovered that she has a couple books up on Amazon and so I bought one of them called the fourth face of the Goddess by Gail perago Hami and on page 73 is the poem never again the burning oh no [ __ ] yes and it is slightly updated she said she's barely touched it since she wrote it she said she wrote it and just like it just like came out of her and she just like wrote it all down it was great but um so what like what do you mean by updates is some of it rewarded like just a little bit the very end of it she says you know how they say oh sisters and brothers here uh she changed it I wake in a cold sweat and cannot drink from the glass you bring me oh sisters and brothers here our daughters our sons must not dream these dreams we must defend ourselves stand with each other and make the arsonist let us be oh my kin folk here never again never again the burning so she says that she changed the last first to include those beloved kidsmen I have found over the years it is not just my sisters to whom the task Falls to keep our children and ourselves safe from those who still would do us harm and she says Let Us stand together in this day and age if we will not help each other how can we ever help ourselves so she kind of changed it a little bit in the end to include not just our daughters but our sons because as we know whiches are male female and every flavor in between so she did update it it's just a tiny bit instead of just o sisters it's O kins folk that was so I like the update you know Gail if you're listening God I hope you are I would love this to be re-released with that that I don't even want to call it music background because it wasn't music I don't even know how to describe it but I would love for that to be like re-released and if she re-released the new version how cool would that be that would be very cool and I think you would really like this book it's not just poems it's it's short stories I mean it's mostly poems but there's quarter calls in here there's really she's got a little thing about the Arcana tarot cards like her little her own little thoughts on the cards you know is it almost is this almost like literally like Gail's side Book of Shadows it feels very much like her little Journal you know Gail's little personal book of Shadows and What's the title of this again this again is called the fourth face of the Goddess which as you know I geeked out about because decades ago when you and I were doing the Pagan Festival circuit my main you know presentation if you whatever you want to call it was called the fourth face of the Goddess where I talked about you know the you see the triple goddess with the crescent and the full moon and the other Crescent I talked about the new moon the Dark Moon that we would celebrate in our coven Circle amarat and I talked about the warrior goddess the part of woman and goddess that you're told you're too much you're too loud you're too angry um you know that part of us that is a warrior that part of us that you know you're kind of taught should be silenced in order to be a good girl and how I always kind of saw the fourth face of the Goddess is you know how when you go to some of those witches stores you see those little statues or even in pictures and whatnot you'll see like the the maiden face the mother face and then the Crone face or like that triple goddess look you know what they you know what you never get to see the warrior goddess what Goddess is on the back side of that that's right that's right well there's more to us than just that in the Statue they kind of almost like put them like a triangle well where's that back piece that back piece is the fourth face of the goddess four you know you have four seasons you have four quarters there's four faces of the Goddess there are are and she is she is that that dark self that Shadow Self sometimes and and I love that Gail has kind of brought that out in this in this book it's fantastic fun fact anytime I've ever thought of the fourth face of the Goddess you know who I always think of well who guess just try what Goddess would I think of no Lilith oh really oh wow I don't know why I don't know why but when I think of the fourth F you know she does embody that I think I think it's because of like the weird tie into to the whole Adam and Eve well Lilith was was created at the same time as Adam to be his equal and but they don't tell you that they don't want you to know that they want to shove that aside that's right like the fourth face of the Goddess like the fourth face and she was too much she was too loud she wanted to be his equal she wanted to be on top during SE she wanted she wanted to be a warrior and he didn't like that and she went and she met a snake and the snake told her that God was lying to them and that the tree in the center of the garden that God had said would kill them would actually give them knowledge and she should eat some so she went took a bite was like holy [ __ ] God did lie I'm not dead I just know a lot now and so she tried to get Adam to eat some too and he of course wouldn't do it and so because she ate from the Apple God was like [ __ ] you get the hell out of my garden and he banished her to the coast where I think she went off and had sex with lots of hot dudes who wouldn't duh who wouldn't right and then God created Eve out of a rib from Adam so that she would be subservient to him so there's that Legend of Lilith who's very cool and and Gail says in the beginning of her book she says what is the fourth face of the Goddess she is the Dark Moon the the opposite of the full moon equal in power her time Falls between the last Light of the waning crescent and the first glimmer of the new Crescent no light can be seen from the Moon then she is the hidden face and you know sometimes we all do that we kind of wear a mask I guess but yeah so check out the book go to Amazon we have links in the show notes if you want to try it so yeah it was a good book lots of good poetry in there including never again the burning I'll be honest with you I'm going to buy the book partially just because it's scale and I just want some insight into her magical witchy ways right just fun stuff good poetry I would like to take two seconds and you know we we because we've been together the last couple episodes we forgot to mention this and it breaks my heart that I forgot to I did post something on Instagram about it but real quick rip Queen Elizabeth rip Coolio oh Coolio Coolio man gangster paradise I'm I was shocked when I heard that was quite surprising you know what shocked me was that kolio was 59 and then I'm thinking to myself oh my God oh my God we're old if Coolio was 59 we're [ __ ] getting old man yeah I don't know man I poor God 59 to die why would you why I yeah no just the fact that he was so young I mean I know 59 is not any spring chicken or anything I mean I cried I actually cried and if anybody wants to judge me kiss my ass um I cried when I found out the queen died which by the way I just want everybody to know my best friend in the whole wide world Lea called me to make sure I was okay when she found out that the queen died that's what friends do so I know how you feel and I wasn't okay that's the worst part yeah like you know how I believe in threes when people drop so the queen Coolio like we still got one more man uh oh is it going to be another queen or is it going to be another king I think it's going to be another queen and let me tell you [ __ ] Elton John Dies I just I'm gonna just I'm just gonna fall apart that wasn't the first queen I thought of you know Beyonce was right was where I went to and I thought Queen but she better not die everybody light a candle for Queen Elizabeth II and Coolio what a weirdy here I like people must be like that shell she has the weirdest taste in life if she is like Coolio and the queen manio and the queen man I wonder equally devastated you know what that Queen was so badass I bet Elizabeth listened to Coolio at least once maybe I don't know you're you're the queen expert I don't know much about the royal family she probably dancing around Buckingham Palace singing gangster paradise do you think she's haunting Buckingham Palace I would because she's probably pissed and want to whoop her family's ass now that she's not in the spotlight they were my family I'd haunt them all just cuz I was I
