on the broomstick hey witches welcome to the 100th episode of back on the broomstick I'm Leila and shell and I asked you guys what topic you wanted for our 100th episode and a throwback to the stoned Witches Hour one in a landslide more than happy to bring you an episode of stoned witches on a broomstick where we'll be talking about a curse throwing tarot reader from The Summer of Love in California and a creepy crawly crypted from Ohio so I'm sh and we have a surprise for y'all tonight this is going to be great and for for any of our listeners that don't know what we're talking about Leila and I did a little diddy prior to back on the broomstick we did oh maybe 75 episodes of a little podcast called the stoned witches our a little True Crime a little hauntings ghosts Cryptids we talked about tea we talked about weed and we just we just overall had a really good time people want to hear that people have been listening to that they've been going back to those old episodes and the masses have spoke damn it the stoned Witches Hour is more popular now than it was when we were putting it out and we haven't put out an episode in about a year and a half I'm sorry that is so weird that it's more popular now than it was when we were doing it we had a lot of fun doing that you know we started right after covid or during Co during covid yeah it was mostly an excuse because I was living on the west coast you had moved to the east coast and we missed each other and Co had happened so we kind of got back together again talking about paranormal [ __ ] and smoking really good cannabis and drinking good tea and talking about it we were having some East Coast West W Coast Wars though with our stories I remember for a little while yes we did I'm pretty sure I won I had the scariest stories you said you won I guess people are gonna have to go back and listen and see who had like Vote or something yeah yeah something but you know then we we had a great idea to kind of focus more on the witchy aspect which is where back on the broomstick got birthed from but tonight it is the stoned wi is our folks tonight we are taking it back for our 100th episode I've got a witchy story about a disgruntled tarot reader throwing curses at a party girl in the 60s Shell's got a what did you come up with I know you were having some trouble I I was having some trouble but I really I really wanted this to kind of focus around the time of year and you know I was like ooh you know our 100th episode Groundhogs Day BB's 2-year anniversary this is like a trifacta of things my Groundhog Day story went a little ay so so I I do have another story but I really do want to touch on the Groundhog's Day thing that I was trying to come up with yeah Groundhog's Day like the movie you know those weird time Loop things are yeah me too that's really freaking fascinating what what did you find out about that now first of all who doesn't love Punk Satani Phil I'm just saying that my new Saint thank you my home so in this movie Groundhog Day a a person person who maybe not be a stellar human being I guess you'd say kind of gets trapped in the same day over and over and over which happened to be Groundhog's Day you know the theory behind the movie is you have lessons to learn and sometimes if you are not listening to the universe the universe is going to make you listen trust me been there done that the universe is speaking to me now but you in theory can kind of get trapped in that literal Loop until you learn your lesson and combust out of it which is really what happened in the movie Groundhog Day so you were looking for a tale that was similar to that I was because you know you hear stuff about time loops and there's a lot of time Loop stories in movies and in in in literature and I was really looking for a real person or real people a real story of a of a Time Loop situation you there was a couple like in I think it was 1943 a 20 something year old uh guy in the UK flamed to be in a Time Loop there was another story uh that a gentleman who was dressed in Victorian clothing just like appeared in the middle of an intersection and unfortunately got hit by a taxi and died oh wow but when the police you know you know when they do the thing they do when you die investigate they take all the things out of your pockets and such every single thing he had was like a hundred years old wow that sounds more like a time traveler than a Time Loop but that's really cool so but you didn't go in that direction I didn't because I couldn't find anything real concrete no real indepth stories and I just couldn't make something of it so guess what I did you know what I did guess what I did I'm betting if I had to put money on this it would be a crypted I'm doing a crypted yes I knew it I knew it and for our folks in Ohio because we have some folks in Ohio this crypted is for you but I think the time Loop thing is something to think about Groundhogs Day or not it is a good lesson in learn your lessons because the longer you push them off the harder it's going to be because you're still going to have to learn them you know we've had this conversation before when it comes to life lessons and the goddess or the universe kind of keep putting the same things in your path over and over again because we might be a little stubborn that is possibly something that has been said about us in the past sometimes I need semi for Flags I'll admit it that's right sometimes we need that lesson to be repeated what I think they said it was like some crazy thing like hundreds of years that Bill Murray was trapped in that time Loop before he was able to learn yeah somebody figured it out like how long would it take to learn each of the things that he did did and figured he was trapped for like 500 years no I think I saw in print it was like more close to like 10,000 it was something ridiculous some ridiculous amount of time to learn it so we kind of need the same thing sometimes if we're not learning the lessons so if you if you are aware of a lesson you need to learn please save yourself in trouble handle it now just handle your [ __ ] there you go but that's not actually what we're here for I've got a story about a curse and Shell's got a crypted no no no no more importantly I need I I need to know two things from you right now what's that what are you drinking and what are you smoking okay yes let's get to the good stuff first of all I have to say that I've had some gummies today before we started this whole thing and normed face normally gummies don't work on me and it this is not a tolerance thing people's genetic differences can affect how your liver enzymes metabolize THC and some people have more of the cytochrome enzyme that metabolizes it really well when you ingest Edibles and other people don't have it shell and I just happened to be people whose bodies don't efficiently convert THC to uh 11 hydroxy THC which is the kind that your body can absorb I'm I'm glad you had told me that at one point a while back because I was eating all kinds of Edibles like what the hell I'm not what the hell what a waste of time and money and then you told me that and I was like oh I must have the part of the the liver that really says [ __ ] you to Edibles however I found these gummies that are absolutely amazing they're 50 milligram gummies from this company called red eyee now you know me back in California I would be eating the 500 milligram brownies and it wouldn't even touch you exactly and these 50 milligrams if I eat two of them I am sitting back in the chair melting into space very happy very chill so these are very very good gummies I like them a lot is that the gummy you had me eat the last time I was at your house it is indeed yeah 10 Stars people 10 10 out of five stars I had a couple of those before we started and I bet you can't guess what cultivar I'm smoking okay uh something something something gelato how'd you know it's gelato cake oh my gosh sh you're a psychic you know I am you are and I love gelados okay it's true but yeah as why I'm smoking on some gelato cake now this place doesn't put the THC on there so I'm not sure what this is but this is kind of like their their mid-range so I would guess going by how it smokes I would say it's probably 27% to 29% is right around there so decent but not super high but it's really tasty how about you shell what are you smoking well I was going to say what's it taste like oh it's very sweet it has kind of a berry Cherry taste to it it definitely has that delicious yeah the tpin on here are very yummy it's got those gelato sweet tastes that you know I love okay now I've got something new here oh knowing me the way you know me what is the most important factor right off the bat THC that hits you upside the head correct so this is called because you know this all comes from legal stores in Massachusetts British Bake Off that's fun that's a fun name I thought that was TV show it is yeah you love all things British and it says hybrid so I'm not so sure I buy into the whole indicia sativa whatever but it says it's a hybrid no we've talked about it before and it it's more tur content that determines that yeah okay I know I've asked you this before on stoned Witches Hour but that's been a minute what is there's a thca in a 09 THC THC a is the unactivated form of THC so you can add those two together and that'll give you the THC content that just means you have to decarbox it like heat it up either with your lighter when you hit it how the hell do you think I'm smoking it if I don't light it up well sometimes you can decarbox it by putting it in an oven at a very low temperature for a little while to activate that THC because the heat just activates it and turns it into uh a form of THC that your body can then absorb so if you decarb it using your lighter when you smoke it your body can absorb it through the smoke if you decarb it in your oven then you can bake with it and you can absorb that THC when you eat it well we all know I'm not a cooker that's right you're not baking [ __ ] so what you're telling me is I need to add these two together yes add those two numbers together oh my God because the first number is 32.4 five and the the second number is 0.53 so we're talking like 33 and a half% now some of that THC will burn off when you decarb it but the final number is still going to be right up in your favorite Stratosphere and it has okay this confuses me Lila and you need to tell the people because I can't be the only one under the thca it says 32.4% top three tpen and then it says D9 THC 53% lmon Delta 9 is THC basically Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the psychoactive oil that's found in cannabis and it's the main psychoactive component in cannabis and Delta 8 is the less potent version of Delta 9 and a lot of times it's hemp derived people get it from um the hemp plant that doesn't really have thca or Delta 9 in it yeah and the lemon that means the top tarpine is lemine but then the next tarpine is called Bellic caropine beta beta caropine and then the third one is beta micine merine like what the hell are these things I just want weed man I just want weed lemon is the one that makes it taste like lemons just like it sounds like yeah now that's more of a sativa that's more of a sativa tpine so that being the top end you're exactly right it being a hybrid and lemon being up there and that THC being so high I'd say it's more of a sativa end well let me tell you it's freaking awesome the merine that's one of my favorites very delicious very good it has very relaxing properties and people use it a lot to help with sleep stress anxiety it has a sweet and fruity taste that um some people say is like ripe mangoes it's a little musky a little earthy musky sweet little spicy the mercine was last that's okay you like the lemon so having that first is going to be really good uh we talked before about the different tpin that will help your back yeah and beta Carlene is one of the Tarpin that will work for pain relief it's sometimes called like the pepper tarpine because it has that warm kind of spicy woodsy kind of smell and taste they say that the four best Tarpin to help with pain are lemon beta carene merine and pinene three of which you have in this cultivar the only one that you don't have is pining which unfortunately is one of the tpin that we've found that really helps you in your back pain and that's the only one this particular strain does not have rlock next time but it is going to be delicious and very Stony you know it's almost like during the day it makes you energize but at night when you know it's kind of relaxy time it makes you relaxy it's a mind set just like in spellwork intention is very important I'm a weed manipulator there you go that's what you call it but I am nice and high I'm feeling pretty mellow and good with my gelato cake what are you drinking I right now I'm just drinking some regular black tea I got some it's called Quan Yin and it's a a black tea yeah I got it at Wagman's they have it just some different loose types of tea there so just a little black tea lemon and honey very delicious on this cold crappy night but what are you drinking all right people seriously Tetley British blonde got at the store not going to lie we both went basic tea [ __ ] tonight yeah yeah that's all right I'm all right with that so I've got a really great story that involves a curse a Tarot reader and a gorgeous apartment in San Francisco did you seriously are we turning this into a west coast East Coast thing again holy [ __ ] I guess we did didn't we all right lay it on me tell me about your ghostly tarot stuff I guess we literally did did go back to the stoned Witches Hour my West Coast without without even planning all right so we'll start with my West Coast story and then we'll go to your East Coast crypted okay okay this one's really cool shell and I had a lot of fun looking this up because it basically involves so many things so I've got in this story a party girl influencer well this was the 1960s so she wasn't really an influencer but if the 60s could have had an influencer Patricia Mont on the subject of our little ghost story here would have been it this whole story takes place around 1969 which was just 2 years after the famous Summer of Love in San Francisco interesting if you think of San Francisco shell I'm sure there's a few different iconic things that you think of right the bridge in the Steep roads yes thank you oh I'm so glad you said steep roads because this apartment is on probably one of the steepest roads in the world and it's very famous for its extremely sharp switch back turns eight of them I guess and it's Lumbard Street in San Francisco and that's the one if you ever see like the cars going really really slowly back and forth uh that's the street where this Mansion was at the very bottom of Lumbard street now Lumbard Street was built to connect the Russian Hill I guess with the downtown area and where it was built there used to be cemeteries and supposedly that's also where they used to do the hanging so it has kind of a history the land is Tainted so to say right yes and as we know from our previous stories in the stoned Witches Hour this always causes problems you know it really does does so Patricia madon called Pat was born in 1928 she was one of eight children and they were poor in the Great Depression in Oklahoma and when she was 17 she met an older man about 10 years older than her very wealthy dude and as soon as she turned 18 they got married on a radio show called brides and grooms is that like the Bachelor of the 60s I guess so I did not realize that they had you know let's get married shows back on the radio but yeah so anyway so she gets married and he quickly decides he wants the traditional stay-at home be a good little woman wife and that was the last thing that passed wanted to do he was also very abusive by all accounts so she left his ass got $200 a month alimony for one year in the divorce and had $400 in her pocket and set off for San Francisco in 1960 she got a job working in the financial district and she says she was really lonely so she started throwing parties to meet people her parties very quickly got her noticed by everyone in old money super conservative Upper Crust San Francisco and her party started getting written up in the social Pages they would talk about who would go there the gossip columnists would talk about her they would run her photo she was very beautiful because she threw such cool parties famous people started going she had a gossip column of her own she was an activist who fought for women's rights minorities rights oh and she also had a TV show they put her on a channel called K o and she had like a a late night TV show called Pat's prized movies and she was so popular that in 1968 she published a book called How to be a party girl so she basically became a celebrity she really did and she did it through force of personality and all these parties so her TV show started taking off because it just started out basically with her kind of doing a TV podcast where she would just talk about movies picture one of those old late night TV shows like on the cable station you know the weird stuff they'd play before the end of the broadcast day her show started out kind of like that but it gained a really big following so she started doing more and more on the show things like baking or showing recipes and talking about current gossip as well as the movies and it got so popular she was getting a ton of fan mail like 6070 letters a day so she moved into this beautiful apartment at the bottom of Lumbard Street 1,000 Lumbard Street and it was an old mansion that had been made into three Apartments she also started looking for an assistant she put an ad in the paper looking for literally a girl Friday and she found a woman named Mary Lou and they quickly became best friends Mary Lou moved in and helped her with all of her letters helped her with her fan mail and they would regularly throw amazing parties at these parties people like Andy Warhol oh wow Danielle steel oh wow Frank Sinatra she dated Frank Sinatra he would go Eldridge Cleaver I have no idea who that is and Joan Bez the singer songwriter and activist would go like all these famous people would go to her parties and she would regularly throw themed parties so you see where this is going I was gonna say who'd she piss off that killed her well she they didn't kill her she's actually still alive she's 96 she turned 96 December of 2024 and she's still alive yeah she actually wrote a book she's written several books okay side just side quest real quick one of her more recent books was written in 2014 and it was like a memoir and it was called peeing on hot coals which actually turns out to be more sad than funny but anyway no comment about pissing on hot coals I'm just confused on how if she's alive where does the ghosty part come oh she's not the ghost she's the one that was cursed oh do tell keep going so she throws the themed parties right and she decides because astrology is huge in the 60s everybody's into astrology and and Tarot was starting to pick up a little bit exactly so even though these were like the big uppercrust people the Hoy pooy the super rich people her parties were very earthy and hippie like she basically gave them a chance to let their hair down exactly I guess Ted Kennedy even went to one of her parties wearing love beads it's rumored that she had visited the Satanist um Anton La at his black house on California Street with her friend to get a sex potion I don't know who the sex potion was for but it said that that's where she got the idea to have this astrology occult themed party she invited uh an astrologer she invited someone who used a crystal ball Palm readers she had her whole house decorated with zodiac signs and candles and draped Fabric and you know just very Bohemian and she had hired a Tarot reader now the tarot reader showed up late and when he showed up he came with a bunch of Uninvited people he had a whole Entourage and he was wearing green velvet from head to toe and some sort of feathered Cape I like it right and I guess he kind of swirled in with an attitude and Pat wrote a book called Intruders about this and in the book she described him as having a fierce red beard and that he was a fussy imperious little bastard sounds like somebody I know honestly if a dude with a red beard wearing feathers and green velvet and imperious little bastard shows up to read my cards how freaking fun would that be I'd be excited well apparently he had a bad attitude and immediately asked Pat to bring him a drink and so she went off into the party to fetch this tarot reader's drink and she says she got distracted She was recently divorced from husband number two and there were a lot of handsome very famous people there so she was flirting and forgot all about the tarot card reader and his drink request and he got [ __ ] she forgot him for about half an hour when she went back to see how he was doing he's like where's my drink she's like oh [ __ ] I forgot and she says he literally cursed her out out and then cursed her she says that he lost his temper in front of everybody and she said he was literally quivering with rage he said he'd never been treated so rudely called her insufferable and ungracious Hostess said that he was leaving and that he was going to make sure that she never had any happy moments in that house again oh [ __ ] yeah she said he was so mad that his face was red that he was spitting with with rage over a drink over a drink and he said quote I lay a curse upon you and this house I do not forget and I do not forgive remember that ouch she says he swirled out his entire Entourage stormed out with him shortly after he left an awning that was on the ptio caught fire and fell down mysteriously or did it she didn't think much about it because she says that she's not superstitious she doesn't really believe in astrology she just thought all that was kind of cool fun so he cursed her he cursed the house and he did say he wasn't going to forget and he didn't because just a few days after the party he called the press to [ __ ] about her and told everybody what a terrible Hostess she was and also said to both a newspaper and a radio show that he had cursed 1,000 Lumbard Street oh yeah people that she worked with at the examiner where she had her gossip column said that they were getting calls constantly talking [ __ ] about her her friends said that they were getting calls where people were talking crap about her a few weeks after that her house was broken into and she started to feel really uneasy she started hearing noises in the middle of the night and people that would come into the apartment would feel dread like they'd come in and immediately start to feel negative energy she says that it became almost impossible to keep the house warm she and Mary Lou would turn the temperature up to 90 degrees but would still have to wear coats in the house because it was so cold do you really think one person has enough quote unquote power to do that all that really see that's what we'll talk about later and I think that's why it's important to note that he didn't just curse her he called called a newspaper to reinforce the curse then he called a radio show and reinforce the curse this wasn't just a one-off he kept reinforcing this and we'll talk about that later when we talk about the Witchcraft and the cursing part okay there are people who think that the location where the house was built already had issues Ghostly and negative energy issues before his curse and that he just woke up some sort of bad energy that was already there and it was a com of that and his curse that caused all the problems okay because yeah you're right it would require a lot of energy the weird things really started happening after this she says that she would lock her doors and windows and she'd come home and all the doors inside the apartment would be unlocked but the outside doors would remain locked and no one had been there she says that sometimes the doors and windows would unlock and open themselves when just she and Mary Lou were home that would freak out and a strange smell started to permeate the entire apartment except for the master bedroom and they could never find the source of it why not the master bedroom she doesn't know so she had a dog a Lassa opso that she named dog and dog started to act really strange right around 2: or 3:00 a.m. every night he would bark at the same place in her room and sometimes he'd go out on the patio and he'd bark at something that no one could see there but if they went out there they could feel a cold spot where he was barking which we know animals can sense things like that so more likely than not there was something there exactly so this previously super Placid very sweet dog started to get really extreme anxiety and she says he was gnawing his own fur off and she feels like the dog could really sense that negative energy like I said when people would walk in the house they could feel this negative energy she did eventually have to give the dog away to a friend because he was just so upset and was so not like him and within days of being at the new place he was fine let me guess he was absolutely fine she said that after the dog left she started being woken up at 2:00 a.m. hearing a song called Mocking Bird Hill on repeat and they couldn't find where it was coming from and the neighbors above her and below her didn't hear it and denied playing it any particular reason for that particular song yes there was was a reason and I will tell you later in the story both she and Mary Lou reported hearing that song at 2 a.m. move move people pet move her car outside kept repeatedly getting destroyed even her boyfriend's car was getting destroyed then it got stolen all these problems kept happening one of her boyfriends eventually left her because his car had been broken into then it was pushed down the hill and damaged like three or four cars before it crashed at the end and then it was stolen and then he decided he'd had enough and he was out can you blame a guy no no I can't she added extra telephones she hired an actual security guard to come keep an eye on the apartment move she loved this apartment and I'll put a link to the Zillow listing in the show notes it's [ __ ] gorgeous the views stunning holy crap but like the bathroom's very old though so some of it's you know it's like a 5 million doll apartment at this point but she started to have trouble with men um at one point one of the men that she was dating like violently attacked her trapped her in his car and wouldn't let her out and started sexually assaulting her and told her he was going to take her to Lake Tahoe with him oh jeez she tricked him by saying hey take me back to my apartment so I can get some warm clothes for Tahoe and then we'll go and he thankfully said okay so she tried to run inside he caught her on the steps and started strangling her before she was able to get in the apartment call the police and he was arrested yikes with all of the turmoil in her personal life and the strange happenings all the strange crap that was going on at home her public Persona her job started to take a hit she was no longer the golden party girl of San Francisco and rumors were flying her career took a hit people started gossiping about her she got invited on a rival TV show and when they aired the show they called it from party girl to call girl oh because what they were doing was interviewing Pat the party girl and then going to air at the same episode an interview with a literal call girl only they asked the call Girl part of the interview at the last minute but kept the title ouch yeah so people were sending her hate mail they were sending her bloody menstral pads in the mail which could have been the tarot reader with the curse she had an overdose she was getting sick one point she called the police because there was a red stain that started dripping that had appeared in the middle of her living room ceiling what what was the source when the police got there they went into the apartment above hers to investigate and they found what Pat said in her book looked like some type of Ault activity and in the like center of the apartment they found the remains of a bonfire like they had broken up furniture and created a fire right there in the middle of the apartment according to Pat it looked like some sort of uh occult ceremony had happened there the fire was right above where the red liquid was dripping from the ceiling in Pat's apartment yikes she married her boyfriend Al Willy at the time and he moved into the apartment he also noticed the strange feelings Mary Lou who lived there Pat and now all started feeling dizziness headaches disorientation and although they got checked out no one could find a cause in three years of this curse three women all close to Pat and all who had lived at 1,000 Lumbard Street would be dead two of them by Suicide and the third under mysterious circumstances some of the sources I found said that they did it in the house other sources said it wasn't but I'm not really sure but they did both commit suicide her cousin Carolyn who had lived in the house with her for a short period of time and also an assistant that she had had for a while named Vera Scott who had also lived in the house oh after it had been cursed both of these women had left the house because of the weird happenings and they didn't feel safe there they said it felt like the house was evil in an eerie twist Pat's cousin Vera had told friends that even after moving out of 1,000 Lumbard street she kept hearing the song mocking bird Hill like it wouldn't leave her alone so it didn't try to like kill her so to say just make her suffer well she did get sick multiple times she had um double pneumonia she almost overdosed on pills so maybe it did try oh jeez but the worst thing that happened in the house was Pat and Al decided to move out because it was just too much living in the house and they moved into a house together somewhere in Hollywood I believe but she had just signed a one-year lease on the apartment so she didn't give it up and her assistant turned best friend Mary Lou her son had just gotten married and she decided you know hey why don't you let me stay in your apartment and that'll give my son and his new bride some space because they they lived with her Pat said sure no problem go stay in the apartment so Mary Lou did and then about a week later on June 22nd 1969 Pat got a call uh oh about 4:00 a.m. she gets a phone call from the police fire had broken out in her apartment and they needed to know who had been staying there oh jeeez oh jeeez Pat called Mary Lou and got no answer so she knew exactly what had happened yeah but it was very weird the police determined that the fire had broken out in the master bedroom where Mary Lou was the master bedroom was locked from the inside and all the windows were locked from the inside Mary Lou was found face down on the bed only her lower body had burns on it that's weird they first said that the cause of the fire was a cigarette but Marylou didn't smoke she didn't smoke anything there was no one else in the apartment and like I said the bedroom was locked from the inside so once they realized well it couldn't have been a cigarette they started looking a little more the fire started in the closet and it burned outward in a vshape Towards the bed there was a TV that was plugged into an outlet in the closet so they think maybe it was a short in the electrical that burned that way or was it when they examined Mary L's body they could not find a cause of death she had no smoke in her lungs she had normal oxygen saturation but right I'm confused her organs were all healthy the best that the coroner Dr Henry turl could determine was maybe that she died of fright he said quote I should explain to you that we have examined Mary Louise Ward as carefully as we know how and at Great length and we cannot establish any reason for her death we don't know why she died I don't like that so they have no clue why she died now George Lucas like George Lucas like the film guy George Luc Lucas no different George Lucas funny though this is the San Francisco Fire Department chief inspector who also worked on the case he said that the origin of the fire was very weird and that it bugged him for years that they couldn't figure out how Mary L had died he went back on his own to try and solve it because it was so perplexing and he said that in his 22 years as a member of the fire department this was the one that stuck out to him because it was so strange and to this day no one has been able to determine how Marylou died the best that they got is from the corner and he said quote the most unbelievable coincidence that this would be an electrical fire occurring by chance after someone is dead for no apparent reason so this was the third death caused by the apartment and then Pat was really motivated to dig into the history of the house she learned that there had been an unusually high number of the tenants of 1,000 Lumbard street that had severe relationship problems divorces abusive relationships and also alcohol issues like a high number there was at least one suicide in the house and neighbors told Pat that the woman who had committed suicide had been listening to the song Mock and bird Hill on repeat for days before she died so after trying to take care of things her self and not being able to do anything about the curse herself she sent in a couple of psychics in 1973 she was over it so these psychics did tests and photographs and all sorts of basically ghost hunting and paranormal investigation that you would find now they said that there definitely was a curse and that there was also an older evil feeling or or um energy in the home they got some really strange pictures that kept changing over time they saw shapes and images and one of the investigators was Frank R no Serino and he wrote in his summary quote you are and will be protected from anything in the house by an exorcism that my group and I have done from a distance and from symbols left behind in the house itself I can only again suggest that you do not go there if at all possible in particular never go alone after that she never had any more problems and eventually it seems like the hold that the that the curse had did break because Pat went on to write more books she became a climate activist uh she was an activist for gun control women's rights she founded a lot of Charities she was an ambassador for peace well and you said she's still alive right that's right she was nominated for three Nobel Peace prizes no [ __ ] and I don't know about now but back when she was 93 I could still find mention that she was hosting lunch and parties at her house in Beverly Hills forever a socialite right she's still a freaking party girl so yeah apparently that curse really seemed to work she's lucky at wore off interesting so you have an East Coast crypted story I do so you know I had to take it back to my roots you know I love a good crypted I I just love a good crypted so I was digging and I was like What if not done because I I have done a lot of crypted stories and I found a good one now this story comes out of Ohio Loveland Ohio as a matter of fact this is the Loveland Frog the the what now the Loveland Frog how am I supposed to be afraid of a frog because the thing is like five feet tall oh oh so it's like a my siiz frog it's a Laya siiz frog it's a it's a Laya size frog with that you should have started with it's a Lela siiz frog this frog has been seen to be in like you know the regular frog stance they're they're kind of down and close to the ground but it's also been seen upright on two legs what like standing up on its little we Webby hind legs as tall as you like the like the frog in uh I think it's something in the Frog I don't know the Princess and the Frog that might be it yeah so it's standing up like The Frog Prince and the Princess and the Frog Disney movie it is it is well that sounds kind of cute the pictures didn't look so cute no no no no no the deal is is that there has been sightings as far back as like 1950s is is what I can see so in 1955 there was a a what were they called door too salesman people so this door-to-door salesman driving along you know an old dark Road in rural Ohio Loveland Ohio he swears that he sees this four five foot frog up on a tin legs walking across the road really yeah yeah okay how much had the salesman had to drink well that is exactly what I have thought too but a local farmer also was said to have seen this shortly afterwards they poo pooed him off off because the farmer was kind of known around town for a little drinky drinky they thought you know he's just kind of jumping on the bandwagon kind of thing so it was kind of it's not that they didn't believe the salesman but you know how like an outsider comes to a small town make some outlandish accusation and all the locals are like who are you and why you here star in trouble so people kind of didn't believe him because he wasn't a local or because he said he saw a five foot frog walking across the street you know one of those two things well yeah yeah so he described it as like grayish and had a frog likee head with bulging eyes and kind of a leathery reptile type skin but that its lower body was more human now I'm not going to lie to you I did find a picture that kind of had a butt naked frog did it have a butt it had a butt and no pants on a frog with a butt a frog with the butt so after 1955 you know no one really heard much more about it no one really said they saw it did he have frog feet though then 1972 rolls around now you know door to-door salesman from out of town okay you don't want to believe them okay then in 1972 on March 3rd at 1:00 a.m. the local police officer Ray shaki he was just driving around doing his rounds and he stopped because he saw something cross the road and he thought it was a child and again 1:00 a.m. middle of March probably a little chilly in Ohio so he was like I better stop and look he saw this Crouch down in the regular frog position I guess you'd call it he sees this thing Crouch down and then shoot straight up stared the cop right in the eye and then jump over the guard rail off he goes now this was in an area called The Little Miami River so he goes back and he's like telling all of his co-workers who kind of think he's a little nuts and they're like yeah okay I guess you saw this frog sure buddy they go back and they find that there are scratches that they can't explain where they've come from on the guard rail oh like okay not like car crash scratches but like unidentified sourced scratches okay so two weeks later another police officer Mark Matthews he also said he encountered on the road that night a four to five foot basically froge headed person he said it it was it stood up from a crouched position then the Cop fired its gun missed it but he thinks here's the thing one account said he missed it and one said he seemingly injured the animal but then it still got up jumped over the guard rail off it went later on this guy Matthews here's where it got a little weird this guy Matthews later on claimed that he lied about his story and that he had actually seen a big lizard that he thought might have been an escaped Pet iguana that had lost its tail first of all I didn't know iguanas lose their tail they can get pretty big are you telling me there's a damn 5 foot iguana somewhere cuz if you are that big scared I mean with the tail and iguana can get that big but I don't think especially a domestic iguana in like Ohio I don't think it's G to get five feet long but he told people that he made the story up because he wanted to make his co-worker see less crazy okay so the one guy did see it and the second guy made it up the second guy made it up to basically make his right right right right right not seem like he had been uh drinking too much alcohol on the job right okay I can see someone doing that for a friend if I was worried that you would lose your job because you said you saw a crypted i I'd back you up I probably wouldn't lie about something you love as much as Cryptids but I would absolutely back you up now he claims that even a couple of weeks after that so he lies about it okay I get it you're trying to save your buddy I got you buddy got it I get it but then a couple of weeks later he then turns around and says that this time he actually saw it Oh no yeah no no no sorry boy who cried crypted here no right so then he he claims to have a photograph of it which the photograph is you know 70s garbage at best right right really bad attempt at 70s Photoshop yeah right but there was something on the books is recently so there's no more stories after this so the One Cop swears on his life that he saw the other guy's just a fiber can't stop lying wants a lot of attention so people are like okay these people claim to see it in 55 we got one cop in 72 that says he did one that lied about it h no one else has really seen this thing this is where this story made me think of you hardcore fast forward to the year 2016 okay so at this point you're talking what like 40 years since there's been a sighting two folks are out walking around in the Woods playing Pokemon go that is I love Pokemon go and I love walking in the woods such a you thing it is it is the screams Leila yeah they supposedly see and again photograph what they think is a humanoid frog like creature a real life Pokemon in the woods a real life Pokemon in the woods yes the problem is is that these were teenage type kids and you know how kids are playing pranks and this and that no one believed him probably out there drinking in the woods probably out there drinking in the woods I'm starting to see a pattern here shell Yeah Yeah so basically what has happened is there's been what like five six seven eight sightings nothing really substantial but there is some sort of skin that was found by I can't remember the university and I can't find it at the moment but was a university that was doing some sort of research out in a similar area to this out in the area where these things all seem to happen because it was all in a refined area um and they found a weird like almost like a shedding of skin that was too big to be any snake on record and they have basically traced it back to a frog like creature and this skin fits that 4 to 5 foot description and it's all like one small area yeah yeah it's in this one little area in in Loveland Ohio like it's not like there's sightings in like New York or or Illinois or wherever it's just in this refined area is there like some sort of marsh or Pond or something there that a frog would like to live in it seems to be some of the pictures actually show I would call it a lake in New York terms I'd call it a lake yeah yeah you know what I'm saying bigger than a pond but not a huge body of water okay you know what I'm saying yeah so maybe hiding out in this little foresty Lake area is some sort of creature that's been hiding I get Bigfoot Vibes I get Bigfoot Vibes big frog foot Vibes big frog foot Vibes you know like I believe I truly to my core believe that there are creatures out there that don't want to be found by humans and have mastered that I am I am a squatcher well as a crypted lover of course that's your position and everybody gets caught with their pants down once in a while especially frog men apparently especially Frogman the picture was so funny Lea the butt was butts I do think that there are unexplainable things out there that have mastered the art of hiding just like Bigfoot because I also you know I I feel like I've seen Bigfoot Bigfoot has been in my hometown before there's newspaper articles to prove it your whole town saw right yes it was in the local newspaper and that's right and I feel that you get enough sightings of things over time especially when it goes from generation to generation to generation can all these people really be lying seriously I don't know I don't know I don't think so 1955 and 2016 like these AR in the same friend Circle you know what I'm saying I love these stories too but you know Mass hysteria is a thing lying so your friend doesn't seem drunk or crazy is a thing but these kids the kids that seen it in 2016 they claim something completely different and in addition to the Original Stories and sightings that it had like this wand like thing that like basically it described it as like Spitting Fire okay hold on it had a wand and it spit fire I'm just thinking of magical frog now it's a magical frog that's what I'm thinking we need to go to Ohio I know right our school holy dang let's go to Ohio I want to go our Ohio listeners please tell me what you know about the Loveland Frog because I need to know if this thing has a fiery wand because I want one I want to go camping on this Lake and see if we can find the Frog I mean if it spits fire does that mean it's technically a dragon oh yes no they specifically said a wand so the wand spits fire or does the Frog spit fire the wand spits fire and the frog has the wand oh so somewhere between 1972 and now it g a wand he got a fire spinning wand he's been on quests man apparently frog has seen [ __ ] him and Bigfoot shop at the same damn store Bigfoot's got magical wands too but I understand making things up and sometimes stretching the truth but can can you have so many consistencies between decades long you know what I mean you know what I me that's the question that's the question right I want to go camp there that's all I got to say this is one crypted that won't kill you it won't steal your soul it's not going to make you bleed to the end of time well I don't know it's got a fire spinning wand it might be pretty dangerous unless it's using that wand to toast marshmallows or something that's that's probably not a good thing I mean what is he doing with it like is he casting magic spells where did he get it was he hiding it he didn't have pants on so he couldn't have been hiding it he he had no pockets did he leave it at home or did he get it somewhere I like to think he went and got it and if he's living in the water how is he living in the water with a wand that shoots fire right maybe he lives on the shore we're inventing a whole backstory for this frog I am I am I'm totally inventing a story for this frog I like to think he's gone on a quest and earned that wand he has so the thing is maybe we should go camping in Ohio because he hasn't been seen since 2016 and it's been about 10 15 years it's time go it is time it seems like he appears like every 15 20 years so but why just in Loveland Ohio why not in Cleveland well I guess it makes sense he's just in that one near that one Lake you know he's just in that one area of the woods you know maybe that's his habitat is there more than one you know I like to think it's just the one it's just the one and it's been him all along and now he has a wand that spits fire that's what other magical so much what other iCal tool did he obtain in the last 10 or 15 years is the next question and I need to know how he has man legs but frog feet this I need to see now I know that the listeners aren't going to be able to see this but I am totally you let me share my screen I am gonna let you look at this one picture because you have to see this and I will try to remember to post this because you got to see this and if I forget you need to at least Google it okay can you see my screen oh my God look at that cake all right has got a butt right so this is um basically like an artist's rendition of when the cop saw I guess you could call it now in this it looks like he has a tree branch in his hand now he does I wondering if that's the sparkly wand that they didn't catch on to until 2016 maybe this is the start of the wand maybe this is where the you know maybe he created a wand I don't know I'm I'm going to say this is where it came from but yeah he's got he's got a nice looking butt there whoever their crime scene artist was back in 1955 kudos to you my friend captured the essence of Frogman PE perfectly he doesn't hurt anybody he's just waving his wand around and I need to know more if you are a listener from Ohio tell me more about the Loveland Frog because I need to know this information all right so now that we've told our stories and I am packing another Bowl let's talk about curses let's talk about so if a disgruntled tarot reader flaunts into your party late and Demands a drink and then curses you literally for bringing it late what should you do how do you know if you've been cursed and what do you do if you have been cursed well can I also say that just because you're having a string of bad luck doesn't mean you're cursed either that is correct I would have to say my first bit of advice about curses is you prob probably haven't been cursed right it's almost never a curse uh it's usually like you said bad luck or sometimes it's what I like to call unintentional hexing except for that one time I was cursed most of the time level one I like to think of is it's your coworker that you just don't get along with that's constantly shooting daggers at you and thinking shitty things about you every time you look at her it's the neighbor down the hall that hates you because you got the apartment over his best friend and he's constantly talking [ __ ] about you and whenever you say hello he's sending death threats with his eyes your way can I just say that if level two Massachusetts drivers there you go yeah you're flying down the road and you're cursing out I hope that cop gets you yeah I hope you step on a Lego I hope you have an itch on your behind that you can never reach or whatever that's where my itchy [ __ ] spell comes in level two level two were you mean to send bad energy at that person and those things can build up you know that type of energy can build up on somebody and so regular cleansings can help you get rid of that right like taking a cleansing bath or using a smoke cleanse or a music cleanse you know and you should incorporate that as a regular part of your you know your witchy hygiene anyway and there's nothing wrong with some salt and mirrors either yeah and the evil eye I mean people give you the evil eye without meaning to or by meaning to all the time and there is a Talisman also called The Evil Eye that you can carry with you you can carry different Stones hematite um Herer diamonds are good for that you know to help repel negativity on a day-to-day basis from those level one and level two unintentional little shitty things right but real cursing requires energy that's why every time you think shitty things about that driver that cut you off he's not going to go home and have horrible [ __ ] happen to him even though like you cursed his whole marriage and his lineage cuz probably forgot him by the time you got to work and bitched about them saying the words isn't enough yeah just saying it really isn't enough at most maybe they'll step on a tack that day or something but the energy you put behind it was minimal so the result of it is going to be minimal yeah a real curse requires intent it requires power and it requires that to be maintained which is why you probably don't have a generational curse either because that's some heavy [ __ ] but you do get cursed because there's witches out here that are there's witches everywhere man there's magical practitioners everywhere Pat Mont andon did not intend to insult someone who would curse her but curse her he did and you asked the million dollar question and I'm so glad you did you said when I talked about this curse that a curse had to be maintained right he didn't just do a level two you know Screw you guy who cut me off in traffic and then forget about it spell he maintained it he called and he remembered enough kept following up with it and he put it out into the world he told other people about it who then talked about it at the time fed into it which can feed into it fed into the energy yep oh what that's another good point if you think you've been cursed just don't accept it don't feed into the energy just be like no I don't accept that [ __ ] and if your Wards and stuff are good enough for that you can just leave that curse right in the cursor's hands that's a great thing with curses if you don't believe in it and your WS are good enough most curses aren't going to affect you so I'm rubber your glue bounces off me sticks on you woman I have that written in my notes as an effective thing because it's surprising how effective that charm is it seriously that is funny though is funny that's good that's good so he that's what he did is he he empowered that spell he didn't forget he remembered to keep putting energy into that spell which is really what you have to do for a level three curse think of it like a fire you either let it go out on its own or you keep feeding it and he kept feeding it and he kept stoking it which is why it kept working if you feel like you've been cursed you should definitely first remember it's almost never a curse if you still think it is check in with yourself are you in a good place how's your mental health how's your stress level are you hydrated have you been sleeping and and if after you've checked all those things you still feel like it might be do some meditation Journal do your favorite divination try to figure out where this might be coming from who might have cursed you and why why do you think you're a curse write it all down start working through it bullet Point Journal it make a list like shell says I like lists better than Journal yes whatever you need to tell yourself and then after that if you still feel like you're cursed check in with a trusted friend shell think I'm cursed man what do they feel how do they feel about it check in with a clergy person check in with someone who does readings professionally that you trust bounce the idea of someone else what if that someone else says yes you are then okay there's a couple other things you can do I do know of a couple tests that you can do to see if you or your space are cursed oo do tell one of them is very popular it's a folk uh folk magic uh you might have learned this from your grandmother I know Appalachian magic is very similar to the Hill People magic that my not witch grandmother not a witch grandmother used to do but you take two matches and you light them and drop them into a bowl of water and if they Cross Your butt's been cursed if they touch each other somebody tried to curse you and it didn't work or you blocked it if they don't touch it all you're not cursed you're good you know that's so funny because I actually remember doing that as a kid see I knew you're not wi grandmother would it's again it's a very common folk magic is my grandma would call it a Superstition there you go this is very common in a lot of folk Traditions so another one is to take a lemon or a lime which are fabulous for uh getting rid of negative energy just like a lemon can cut through grease and dirt it can cut through [ __ ] exactly so if you take a lemon cut it in half and then cover the cut sides with salt and you can use herbs if you want to protective herbs but it's basically just salt and lemon take one half and place it in roughly the center of your home and you take the other half and hide it somewhere near where like you feel the center of the negative energy is in the home so this lemon one is more to find out if your house itself has bad energy or has been cursed so first one in the middle of the house out in the open second one hidden somewhere where you feel the negative energy is the strongest and you let them rot or Harden now if the lemon just hardens up as it dries and it just kind of gets really dry and hard there's no negative energy in your house there's no curse if it rots or gets moldy you got some [ __ ] you got some bad [ __ ] going on in your house that's a way to check if your area has been cursed again like we talked about curses need upkeep people have to be talking about it just like the unnamed tarot reader they have to be feeding that fire he was feeding that fire for a very long time uh for years he would put this energy out into there I guess when he said he would not forget or forgive he meant it he was serious about that [ __ ] right but you know who's really gonna do that who's ever really gonna how mad do you have to be to like do that I've met some vindictive people I don't know all right so if you are cursed if somebody does curse you pretty hard shell you've been there I I have what are some things you can do you know I think in my opinion probably the most important thing is and I I I've mentioned this several times is the mirrors you know we joke about the I'm rubber your glue it bounces off me sticks to you but you know the same thing with the mirror thing whatever you're sending is reflecting right back to you and it ain't it ain't hitting my sphere so I I I very seriously take the mirror shielding thing physical representations you know I I know that people have said you can meditate and imagine yourself surrounded by mirrors no go get some damn mirrors and Surround your space and yourself with those mirrors literal if you've done the check-in steps and one of them is to journal or write a list of what the curse is who you might think have done it if you know who did it or you think you know who did it you can write their name or make a representation of them take a real mirror and angle it so that just their name is reflected in the mirror and back at them yeah and and then just basically say whatever you are sending you receive back and then just leave it that way you could put their name in between two mirrors and then just tuck it someplace out of sight if you got it wrong and that's not the person that's sending you negative energy it's not you're sending them Goodwill that's right you could just not accept the energy you could just say I do not accept this you have to mean it I get what you're saying with that I do but I also know you know as you recall and and when I had a little issue it didn't just affect me affected others in my household so it wasn't necessarily about me not believing it you know I can't just sit there and tell everybody you know so you you kind of well there's level three and then there's level three yeah so you you you sometimes ignoring it isn't always the answer but like I said I am I am hardcore on that mirror stuff yep call in your ancestors pull up your Shields and let them go to bat for you and then for bigger batter curses call a friend call a friend clean your house whether you're cursed or your house is cursed literally clean it because you ever notice like when your house is clean everything's put away everything's all nice and clean how good you feel I just got a Practical Magic Vision with the brooms and yes yes but you feel so good you feel good in your space you your body feels good mentally feel good it's an energy shift yes you have shifted the energy in the house as as well so literally clean your space and then rearrange your furniture that confuses negative energy that can confuse negative powers that are trying to come in rearrange everything do something to banish the negative energy Practical Magic Moment buy a new broom and sweep the negative energy out do whatever you need to you smoke you sound get the negative energy out and then Ward and protect your house put up your sigils put iron around the doors ooh I had a great idea yeah you know we like to camp and we go through tents relatively often we are hardcore campers that's right now sometimes these tents come with those really shitty little tent Stakes you know like they're like just a little piece of steel wire right yeah we always replace them with better tent Stakes so I have a ton of those sitting around metal holds energy really really well so if you use those tent stakes and charge them with the intent to protect your home ooh good idea right you could etch them you could put oil on them roll them in herbs have them in ritual and charge them with power to protect and then drive them into the ground all around your property that's a good one or you could put them up over windows on window sills over doorways because that metal also helps to prevent negative energy from coming in so if you've got them charged for protection you can just keep them around your house so that's a good way to Ward it so do a cleansing spell and then once you've done all that it's important to remember you have to fill that void so invite in the energy that you want call in the energy that you want to have there and bless the space and bring that in like attracts like if you are positive you will attract positive and talk to your space if you think that you are living in a space that has negative energy or has been cursed talk to it talk to the house basket what it needs set up an altar for the house or the house Spirits you'd be surprised at how well that would work I did it in the house we lived in in Rochester and it immediately stopped all the [ __ ] and things got a lot better much more harmonious and no more tricks were played after we set up a house alter such great ideas but just remember more often than not it's probably not a curse I have a margarita curse breaker but maybe that's for oh okay all right last thing what if you think you have accidentally cursed someone we've had a few listeners who are concerned that their negative thoughts can be causing curses and before we go any further no that's not how it works you're good again let's use the car cutting you off an analogy shell angry driver happens some people are worried that maybe they're cursing that guy you know mayor sphincter burn with the pain of a thousand suns they're worried what do you do if you've accidentally cursed someone and you're worried about it can your random thoughts curse someone I don't think your random thoughts can know um I think it takes a little more time and effort than just a rando thought y but I also want to say that not every witch follows the three-fold law and not every you know some people don't necessarily worry about those consequences but just because you think something doesn't mean there's going to consequences it does take some level of thought and energy more than you bastard you got me off I hope you get a flat tire you know it's gonna take more than that yeah exactly even if you're really mad at them I agree it has to take more than that I do know two different ways to call back a spell if you did curse someone and you'd want to bring it back okay okay I'll listen all right so the first one very easy you dig a hole in the dirt prefer in the ground but a plant will do just a very small hole then into that hole whisper what happened whisper to the dirt who you cursed why and why you want to take it back I mean say you're sorry literally you have to do it three times say it three times into the hole just whisper it then put in an offering something like a a piece of fruit a note that says you're sorry a crystal a coin it should be a gift to counter the negative of the curse right so you put that in the hole cover it up turn around don't look back and walk away a different route from the way you went to get to to where you put that in that'll break the curse no this is a little more unconventional but honestly I would just probably light a candle and ask deity you know be like hey man I I I I [ __ ] up I'm sorry can we can we take this back I'm real sorry I didn't mean to do that another really simple fast thing is uh take a little bit of tea take a sip of tea and in your mouth while thinking about the curse that you said run the tiny bit of tea and your tongue over your teeth over the inside of your mouth and then spit it out into running water just like your TAP turn the water on and then spit it out and that will get rid of the curse as well and then slap yourself in the face so it's basically taking the words that you said the things the words from you said right out of your mouth you can also like bite a little bit of lemon and do that and spit it into kind like the added slap yourself in the face and slap yourself in the face cuz why' you curse somebody a that's Shell's addition to that spell there you go Crossroads are good places to leave curses too just walk to a crossroad say it at the crossroads and take it back and then turn around don't look back and walk away so there you go there's our cursed House story and oured frog story and what to do if you've
