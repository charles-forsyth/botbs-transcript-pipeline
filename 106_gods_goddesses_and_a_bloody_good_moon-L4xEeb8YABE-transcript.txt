[Music] welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and on this episode we'll be talking about the recent blood moon and a few of our favorite gods and goddesses and I am shell and my main goal for this Blood Moon is to be awake for it the blood moon happened in the early hours of Friday morning March 14th and it was a full moon with an eclipse and that's what made it look red which is how it got the name blood moon I had a funny with this whole thing because people were asking um you know what are you going to do what are you going to do and I just had a flashback remember that time when I don't even remember what was happening it was some like meteor shower that like only happened once every couple billion years and you made me get out of bed at like 4 in the morning climb up on your roof which by the way I have a fear of heights and you make me get on your roof and watch this meteor shower at like 4: or5 in the morning and and this was very reminescent of that because I was like man I got to stay awake for this all right listeners let's go back to the ancient times when shell was my roommate we lived together for a little while in a little town in Upstate New York we lived in this I'd swear the person who lived there before us was probably a witch or an herbalist of some type because the backyard was about an acre and it had a whole bunch of apple trees and so many different herbs that at the time I did not appreciate as well backyard was jungle just say it it was it was amazing great place to do ritual and actually we did do ritual there when the local newspaper came to do an AR yeah yeah so there's pictures of that backyard but it was a one-story Ranch and the roof wasn't that difficult to get up on there was a meteor shower and I woke you up at like 400 a.m. and listeners of this show know shell does not do mornings I don't and and and I don't like heights either and you can tell the people it was story fine but I really thought I was going to plunge to my death anyway yeah but you didn't though you didn't die but you did see cool meteors I do credit your husband for my safety though I'm just saying it was worth it but at the time I'm like you're gonna make me get up and do what and you're glad now that you did though right right so me staying up for the Eclipse worth it but in the moment I was like man I'm tired me too and that is why I took some steps ahead of time to ensure My Success I really really wanted to do something for this Blood Moon things have been a little crazy in both of our Lives lately and I'm ready for it to settle down and get back into I want to get back on the broomstick I'm ready to get back into my witchy happy space so I set an alarm for 2:30 in the morning and I set everything up outside because I'm I'm also not the greatest morning person so I had everything all set up outside I had a little fire pit in my backyard so I made sure everything was all laid everything I would need for the little fire that I wanted to do was all right there made sure my fluffiest bathrobe was nearby that way everything was set you're so organized I love it 6 PM me is organized but 2:30 a.m. me is pissed off and cranky and really cold and wants to go back to bed right so unless everything's laid out for her she's not going to do it but as I as I learned from you with the rooftop meteor shower there are certain things that are worth dragging your dead ass out of bed for absolutely and I found that if you set things up like that night we had the ladder all set up before we went to bed we made sure that there were snacks and flashlights and of course a little bit of weed everything was all set and laid out for us so we didn't have to think about it too much makes it easier yeah and you know I was a little concerned because people were on the old inter web people were saying you can't do like any sort of magic because it's a blood moon and it's like evil and whatever no moons were harmed in the making of this Blood Moon I promise it's just an eclipse what was it that they thought that ate the Sun during solar eclipes didn't they think like a dragon or something ate the sun yeah I guess it depends on what culture whether it was like a dragon or a worm or a crow or there's a whole bunch of different ones well nobody ate the moon either nope they didn't it came back and the good thing about eclipses is the spell that I wanted to do during the eclipse was kind of a what some people would maybe call a Road opening spell it's kind of a let things be a little easier clear the way I guess help clear the path that I'm walking so that I can walk it a little better kind of spell and so an eclipse is a great time to do that the moon is full and gorgeous and then the Earth kind of Lumbers in the way and becomes an obstacle blocking the light of the Sun and then after a little while the Earth gets out of the way clearing the path essentially for the sunlight to shine directly on the moon again so that was the focus of my spell did you do anything for the blood moon I didn't really have a a spell per se but we had a listener on our Facebook discussion group that was going to do a Justice spell for this Moon and I don't know for some reason I felt compelled to like Focus her some energy for her justice spell so you know who you are you got some of my mojo that is an excellent time you know I I think that a full moon coming into that full power like ramping up to that big huge amazing full moon power you know if you need Justice you want the biggest guns you got right you want the biggest magical slingshot you can grab and the full moon is it and like with my kind of Road opener spell justice is the same thing you want Justice to Prevail you want the light to shine again so I can very much see how an eclipse could help with Justice energy you want that Clarity the lifting of the fog so to say yeah exactly exactly getting out of the way of the light full moons are wonderful especially this time of year oh my goodness the Spring Equinox ostara is next week I'm absolutely in love with this time of year you know what else is coming up what you and I being at Sacred Space I cannot wait for that either okay full moon today with an eclipse next week is the Spring Equinox and after that Sacred Space

I thought about that and my excuse was that it took us away for a little while and I would like this year to just kind of stay and immerse myself also I heard rumors last year that there was a tattoo artist after hours that was there at the conference really I don't know it was true or not we need to get into that crowd yes we do and if you are going to Sacred Space send us an email or a DM let us

really fun to do you know how much I love to do meditations you and your meditations let me guess you want me to bring a journal too well yeah actually I'll be honest with you already got one set aside to bring I know you have more than one admit it yeah stop why you gotta call me out like that I am evil now I had a thought and and I'm glad you rolled with it I was looking around on the internet this week and a lot of talk about deity a lot of talk about gods and goddesses you know who do you worship you know who do you work with and that led me to what are we'll say for the sake of time top 10 gods or goddesses that that you think or we think everybody should be aware of so I thought that'd be a fun topic for tonight and it's in when I found different people's perspective on the quote unquote top gods and goddesses Every Which Pagan person whoever should be aware of what do you think about that I'll tell you what I think because when you told me that you wanted to do this as a topic I I think I sat in a stuper because there's so many gods and goddesses and there was no way at first I was like H I could think of that easy and I made a list I know we agreed to come up with four or five each but you know I like Overkill so I still came up with my own 10 and then I was like oh but I forgot this one and I forgot this I could come up with a list of 20 to be honest my brain short circuited and so I brought it back and I just decided to go with three gods and three goddesses that were very meaningful to me for different reasons you know I I do have to mention if you do Google such things there are a lot of folks out there that Focus strictly on Greek so I tried to stay away from Greek as much as I could with my list I do have one Greek Roman goddess but I'll tell you why when we get to her I have a couple but you know it's but they're they're they're more my personal preference so I can't help it but I am G to let you go first since I picked the the topic give me number one all right I'm going to give you my number one and I will start with that Roman goddess that I chose back when I was in Middle School a week or two ago a week or two ago in e8th grade they gave us different languages you know you just took a short little course in it was try it yeah you try it tried three the ones that they would teach in high school Spanish French and Latin and in the Latin class one of the things that the teacher did was have everybody change their name at the very first class she talked about the Roman gods and goddesses and she told us about a whole bunch of them she put pictures up she had names she told us all about them and then she had us pick she said you know research a God or a goddess and that will be your name for the class can I guess what you picked yeah for some reason I want to say Hera no I chose Diana I chose the goddess of the moon the goddess of the hunt the goddess of the Wilderness now I was a total nerd as a kid I was very much into folklore and mythology so I already kind of knew about Diana also known as Artemis in the Greek pantheon so I chose her as my first deity for this list of goddesses because she was my first goddess right like that's the first time I took a name of a deity even if it was for class and that really kind of kicked off even stronger of a love for gods and goddesses around the world and so Diana is a twin goddess her brother is the god of the sun and she's worshiped as a goddess of the hunt you'll often see her with other maidens with a bow and she does rule the moon and the Moon cycles and she's a patron of animals and the Wilderness unspoiled places she's considered a virgin goddess so if you do follow the maiden mother Crone of deity she's a maiden goddess I just need to interject this when I was in eth grade we did a similar thing but I I was in Spanish and I picked my Spanish name as Carmen irrelevant to deity but Carmen well I have to thank my Latin teacher I can't think of her name in eth grade but it was her idea she you know she introduced this idea to the class and we all loved it so I was Diana for like a month and a half in eth grade and I loved it yeah she's a very good goddess she's an easy goddess to look to because she is the moon you know she's represented by the moon and a lot of witches are drawn to the moon so it's very easy to be drawn to her especially if you're outside in the woods full moon she's a nice goddess to look to now I'm going to give you my easy answer the first on my list is hkat shocker oh I'm so surprised right I love a good Crossroads deity for sure but my view of hiate is probably different than a lot but I kind of see her as like almost like a kedwin which I'll get to in a minute because she's on my list as well kind of the witch of all witches I guess she's kind of all things to me other people might see her as a warrior goddess goddess of the crossroads goddess of all witches but to me it depends on what I'm working with and what energy she's putting into it but she's kind of everything to me to you hak is the face of the Goddess Capital the goddess okay right I see that I love that she's the goddess of witches she's the goddess of linal spaces she's a very good goddess for anyone to work with as long as you can handle the yeah you've got to be able to can't handle the truth we always well I want to say we always talk about goddesses but we focus on goddesses a lot so I really am actually interested what would you pick for a God in your top list people should be familiar with my number one God and he was my first experience with deity and I do think he's very important but my my number one is konos I knew you were gonna say that and and actually that's my number one too but I wrote it and I know people think there are people on two sides of this coin that these two are one and the same but I have konos slth green man oh yes konos the green man and the horned God are all sometimes not always sometimes the same thing the same but different that's right they are different they are different but they are kind of all aspects of a similar thing and sometimes Kos is the horned God and sometimes konos is the green man but they're not technically the same thing right but on my list I kind of have them as one and I think the reason why is because they're all gods of the wood gods of wild places gods of the forest of nature nature fertility of natural cycles they're Gods of Primal energy and and they are all very similar gods of the green Wild Spaces you know and and kind of how I matched him up as number one with hak being number one they kind of share that God of the crossroads god of the journey it's almost like in my mind they're cohorts konos is also often seen as a god of death he's part of life's cycle not necessarily like a death God but part of the whole cycles and he's what's called sometimes a thonic god which basically means he's an under thee God I was gonna say what the hell does that word mean Sonic deities are associated with the underworld so for konos it's because he is nature all of life and death is his domain like a Hades well sort of but thic just means they're associated with the underworld and death not that they're necessarily a death God and maybe it means under the Earth literally like the tuad like under Hill I have to say that another God and I'm glad you mentioned his name another one I have on my list is Hades and you want to know why my children are aware of Hades thanks to Disney yeah but Disney has him as the goofy bad guy they do they do you know with the Flaming hair I did love the Flaming hair but I like the fact that even if not completely accurately portrayed it put enough seed like for example in my kid's head to want to know more you know what I mean but I have demer on my list as well and I think the pany demer Hades thing kind of all roll together I feel like a lot of my on my list are like cohorts partners what you'll find as you go into a lot of these stories and and a lot of this folklore especially when you get into places that are very close like I know in some of these European places a lot of the Legends will kind of blend and blur together depending on where you're at so that happens sometimes but it's surprising how similar all these different cultures and pantheons can be in what we choose to deify and the stories are a lot the same that is a big problem I have with the Roman and Greek because well they literally stole them they are the same people with two different names you know what I mean but if you don't realize that it's super confusing well they do have some minor minor differences and stories associated with them but it is very cool to see how similar a lot of them can be who's next on your list all right so you mentioned kedwin and kedwin is also on my list kedwin was the first deity I dedicated myself to she is the Welsh goddess of transformation she's the goddess of the cauldren she's the goddess of potion she's the goddess of knowledge and shape-shifting she's part of the story of tasin of Merlin you know every time I think of kedwin all I can think of is that picture you know the picture we've all seen the picture with with the woman with the dark hair and the long staff stirring The Cauldron you know the picture that's cared one in her cauldron exactly I kind of look at her as again another goddess of all like Universal you know kind of no matter what your need she's got your back kind of thing exactly well hey when you're the goddess of wisdom you can pretty much pull whatever you need out of your bag of tricks I think you're that smart you can do it but she's also the goddess of Prophecy enchantment change she's also another linal goddess uh she can be a goddess of the other world because some people say that her cauldron is of birth and death I look at her as a softer version of hkat you know hkat is very much you know you can't handle the truth and kedwin more of the let me wrap my arm around you and hug you as I tell you the truth in my opinion I kind of see her as more of a maybe it's how I've manifested her in a more caring way I do and I know you're looking at me like I'm a crazy mofo but I do kedwin is transformation and transformation is not easy she's not going to put her arm around you unless it's to push you into her cauldron but I see her more as guiding you through that transformation whereas hkat is kicking you through it she's a mother which might be where to you that aspect of her might be stronger is the mother aspect she does have a son and she in her cauldron was brewing this uh potion that was going to make him the smartest man on the planet right and instead her assistant guon got the first three drops and as everybody knows only the first three drops are good the rest is poison so don't drink it so Guan got the good stuff and she was so pissed she decided she was going to kill him and he used his Newfound knowledge to like change himself into other creatures to try and get away there's actually a very cool song that I love it's on that playlist I shared with you today it's called kedwin and tasin it's by Dom theard but it tells the story so she chases him because she wants to kill him and she eventually eats him and then gives birth to him later so she destroys him and then gives birth to him as tasin she's a pissed off mother who then had to go in her corner and calm down and then she didn't go in any Corner She chased him across the earth I see her softer than hkat that's all I'm saying okay fair enough but yeah she's the goddess of transformation and knowledge and uh apparently of chasing people down until she gets what she wants you know that really kind of fits my personality I don't know but yeah kedwin was my first goddess I liked that she was the goddess of wisdom and I was very much seeking wisdom I still am I loved that aspect of her plus she is also the goddess of poetry and I wrote some really shitty poetry when I was in my early teens so that resonated yeah but you also wrote some good stuff later on oh that's so nice thank you so who have you got next next on my list this is a good one I've got Odin oh Odin ah old one ey himself when I think of Odin I think of the hanged man tarot card oh I like that yes hanging from the tree kind of taking it all in thinking thing is think before you act I think of Odin very much as a like a wise Grandpa you know what I mean I love how you see the softer side of all the DVDs except for hiate you're just like hiate has beaten me down so much that all you guys look like kids pretty much you know you spent 30 years with hiate and everybody is soft and Squishy but I I think Odin kind of brings that Wise Old Man to my list he's seen it all he's done it all and he's more than willing to teach you if you are patient enough to listen that's a good one I like that I love that aspect of him as well you know he's the Alla the allseeing the all knowing but demands patience kind of thing oh well you can't know it all fast how it relates to that card the hanged man is it he kind of forces you to take a minute and have some introspection you know what I mean yeah exactly I love that makes you kind of think about taking that step back for a minute I can't think of what deck it is but I have seen a deck that shows the hanged man as the yasil tree sorry if I pronounced that incorrectly but the the world tree yasil and it's Odin hanging upside down from the world tree I feel like I might have a deck that has that yeah I can't think of what the deck is called if any of our listeners know what deck that is please email us back on the broomstick at gmail.com all right so I've got another God probably who I go to now a lot you hear a lot of Greek pantheons you hear a lot of Celtic right this is a Hindu god oh my god I know what you're gonna say because it's on my list too oh awesome okay go ahead guess Shiva nope ganes oh damn it I should I do love Shiva Shiva is the Lord of bong and he is you know the weed God I know he's way more than that but I'm just I'm glad that we both had a Hindu one on our list it is something that I think is absolutely wonderful and beautiful and the stories fascinate me I just think it's absolutely fantastic and ganes appealed to me actually our friend John who's been on the show before who was in our coven shortly after I first met Jonathan he introduced me to ganisha the remover of obstacles and now this one if you want someone to put an arm around you I kind of think Gan would but he's very often seen as very friendly compassionate so yeah he would put his big elephant arm right around you I was gonna say is that the one depicted as the elephant yes he is the elephant headed God he is the son of Shiva and parva so he's a very large man body with an elephant's head with one Tusk and he's often seen with a little mouse at his feet and from what I learned the mouse stands for desires and your ego and your unchecked subconscious and these are all things that Ganesh has overcome and that's symbolized by him being with this little m the mouse also symbolizes things like other ways to get around you know Gan is the remover of obstacles and the mouse is another way to get around obstacles you know through little spaces or through cunning or intelligence so the Mouse has a lot of different meaning and Gan is also the god of new beginnings and he's the god of love he helps to clear energy blockages he is just wonderful if you need wisdom if you need success if you need someone to help you move forward or remove obstacles you just need someone to be nice and listen to you ganes is your God I love him Oh you mean it's not kedwin nope I would go to ganes for compassion before i' go to gwin who's next on your list I have another God this time from Irish mythology the dogda he is the chief of the tuad deanin he's sometimes called the good God and he's another deity of Life Death and rebirth he's also the god of the weather and Agriculture and growing things a lot like Caro he's seen as a loving father A very wise leader and a powerful Druid like kedwin he also has a cauldron but his is a cauldron of Plenty and he makes sure that no one ever leaves his table hungry now I think we listed actually more than 10 and I had a problem I really did because you know this was my idea and then I list like 20 I think that really what it comes down to is you know you have your favorites I have my favorites but who works with you best you know are you following a certain Mythos it it's going to be different for each person and just because this is my top 10 or your top 10 or somebody some Rando on the internet your top 10 is going to be different based on what you're called to and and what is drawn to you and I think when I looked at my list it was predominantly Greek and Celtic you know I did have Isis on there I had Odin on there I actually had Diana Hermes and Zeus like that's what I'm called to but maybe I think the point of this is there isn't necessarily a top 10 that every damn person has to be familiar with maybe each one of you needs your own top 10 that you are familiar with even if for no other reason how wonderful to have 10 different deities that you can go research because I do love learning stories I love learning the folklore I love learning how they're seen in different cultures and how they're woried how they have been in the past and how they are now and how they're connected to other deities from other cultures it's almost like they're kind of the same or similar depending on where you are in the world you know exactly like Lilith a lot of people thought that she came from Mesopotamian from the Sumerian lore before she was part of the Jewish lore so a lot of times some of these deities traveled they may have traveled with people as they went from one area to another or or they did trading sometimes deities T different regions yeah exactly and you don't need to worship deity at all if you don't want to if that's not part of your practice that's fine it's not a necessity I find that it enriches my practice to learn about them some people feel that they'd like to dedicate themselves to one or more deities for a certain amount of time shell has dedicated her life pretty much to haata dedicated yeah right I was marked she was kidnapped by hiate who will not let her go right but the best thing for you to do is to choose a de you're interested in choose an area of the world you know choose what you're interested in and and learn about that but over time who that is could change and that's okay oh absolutely or maybe you only want one and you have no interest in anybody else but one again okay yeah I'd say you should go learn about more but you're right that's okay it's totally okay some people are are drawn just to goddess energy and want nothing to do with God energy because maybe a bad experience in a earlier part of their life with a different religion we won't talk about that but they only want to focus on goddesses again okay I'm still blown away that you think we have such differing opinions on cared on kedwin she's such a complex goddess there's so much to her I mean Christopher Hughes wrote a whole book on kedwin she is a very complex goddess of witches inspiration of so much well actually side point here part of the coven I am in I had to pick deity to focus on and I actually picked kedwin to learn more about her and work with her and I am starting to get into delving into I don't know what to say the depths of her story more so than that I ever have before so oh very cool I'm excited to see what you find with that so we'll have to come back to kedwin in like six months or something and see how you feel about her then and you're you're not wrong you're not wrong there is that motherly side to her but I agree that I might not have the whole picture because hiate is really where I have put most of my energy for a long long time and I scratch the surface on a lot of other deity but I've never put the time in like I have with hkat and I am trying to do that right now with kedwin oh she's a great one to choose I I like her I very much like her a lot so hopefully you have gotten some information on gods and goddesses maybe it sparked an interest and you want to go check them out a little bit more I will put some uh websites and books in the show description which is in case you're wondering
