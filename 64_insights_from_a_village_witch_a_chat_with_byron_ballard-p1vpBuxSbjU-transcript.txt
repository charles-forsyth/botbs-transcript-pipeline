join us as we get back on the broomstick welcome to back on the broomstick the podcast where two witchy best friends get together to read magical books cast Wicked spells and interview cool pagan people today interviewing Byron Ballard I'm Lila and I'm shell and this is like so exciting I could just burst oh I'm thrilled we have been waiting for this forever since before Sacred Space conference but definitely since March when we got to actually meet Byron at Sacred Space and of course after reading her book small Magics she's just cool I I can't wait to talk to her and we also had the pleasure of being able to attend a couple of her workshops at Sacred Space and let me tell you if you get the opportunity you got to sit in on one of these um so let's bring in Byron Byron is a teacher a folklorist and a writer who has served as a featured speaker and teacher at festivals and conferences including Sacred Space that shell and I were recently at where we had the the great privilege and a lot of fun to be honest to sit in some of her workshops she's also a senior Priestess and co-founder of mother Grove goddess Temple and the Coalition of Earth religions out of Asheville North Carolina shell and I would love to welcome to back on the broomstick Byron Ballard welcome um thank you so much I've been looking forward to this a lot we had so much fun at Sacred Space we did I thought oh this will be great hanging out with this G is going to be great you know you actually gave us a heart attack before we ever even saw you at Sacred Space no how well we were so excited that you were there and we were going to get to be at some of your workshops and as we're walking around just kind of soaking in the Ambiance and seeing everyone that was there this lovely man approaches us and he goes are you Leila and shell and we're like yeah and he goes have you talked to Byron yet and we're like um no no were we supposed to and he's like yeah yeah you are supposed to she's looking for you and we're like oh boy at first like are we the right Leila and shell are does he have the right people it was Sam it was Sam that that we encountered Sam and I we are old buddies from way way back I can see why fabul I love Sam we're hoping to have him on at some point in the future as well to talk about metal magic his wife's tea shop oh my God that tea shop I I just have to for a minute just give me one minute I've been in a lot of tea shops in my time because I'm a tea drinker I love tea and he took me in on the way to Sacred Space we went by to to load up on some tea for the trip and it is the most beautiful tea shop I've ever seen anywhere Bar None just exquisitly beautiful makes me want to go to North Carolina and check it out yeah please come before we elect somebody as our governor who doesn't think women have the right to vote would you good gracious we will we definitely will oh my God hopefully that does not happen so that was that was shocking at sacred C face to be honest we fan girl for a few minutes because a few months prior to that we um actually did a review not too far back on small Magics so when we realized that you were going to be a Sacred Space with us we kind of had a fan girl moment and then to get there and have Sam say that you were looking for us so we like us who us that is so funny I went to look at your uh Instagram today and saw you two were so cute about and we're going to Sacred Space look space so did you have a wonderful time we did we even got matching tattoos while we were there we did no way oh they're beautiful no I saw them you posted them on um on Instagram we did we did we have you know just like the the podcast is called back on the broomstick we are witchy friends from way back and we used to do festivals and conferences a lot a while ago and then there was a long kind of break and so it's really fun to get back into doing it again especially with shell and and just to have these experiences and and go to workshops and conferences and just meet cool people and learn new things and it's just absolutely wonderful no matter when you get to go yeah it it's really true and and Sacred Space is for my money it's the high-end conference yeah oh you're G meet some not so experienced people but the majority of the people there are really high functioning magic workers so if you have a question and you know you could pose it on Tik Tok and get 20,000 bad answers but you can actually go up to somebody who's been doing this for 40 or 50 years and say this is my predicament what do you and they're happy to answer that question I like how Sacred Space kind of promotes itself for the intermediate to advance because there are those those conferences and festivals that are geared more towards beginners and Sacred Space kind of it it sets that bar for itself and it well meets and exceeds it yeah I just wish I had more time and could go to all of the workshops because too many good ones were at the same time right yeah that's really true so does this mean you all are going to start doing a little more festival and Festiva and um conferencing absolutely we're both presenting at a central New York Pagan Pride cool are you going to Brushwood this year because I'm presenting again at Brushwood oh okay you know I love I love the land at Brushwood and I've been the series Rising twice for me the point of doing festivals and cons is to really connect with other people and if I'm not doing that if I'm basically hanging out with my buddy I could do that way closer to without the 12 hour drive right exactly exactly but yes we are planning on doing more we have some Workshop proposals out we actually got a a hint from you today about convocation 2025 so we're talking about workshops and rituals for that next year you should totally do it I had a wonderful time because that was one thing that that we really liked about Sacred Space is the fact that there was actual several ritual options during the conference not just workshops and classes but actual ritual options during that and that was kind of a a nice added thing that we haven't you know when we were doing these 15 20 years ago that wasn't kind of a part of the festival atmosphere necessarily um so to see that added in is very very exciting it it is and what I also love about sacred spaces now they've got built in like social time because in addition to learning from other people and meeting new people and doing ritual it's really important for people like us to be able to sit down in a fairly relaxed atmosphere and say this is what's going on in my community what's happening in your community this is what's going on with me what's going on with you that keeping that connection and network going is is of prime importance especially nowadays I think it's vital that we all keep Communication open and a lot because so much is so much is happening right now and there still is something to be said for inperson face tof face communication there's no substitute as far as I'm concerned now I do have a question that does kind of relate to festivals a little bit but I'm gonna take you take it back for a minute in in 2019 I believe you were part of a of an Interfaith panel that you said was more like for Abra haix and and one wi you and in that interview you described yourself as quote a genuine tree loving dirt worshipper which I loved I I very much related to that comment now with that in mind as someone who is very much an outdoors dirt worshipping witch what are your favorite witchy ways to feel connected to the earth when you're somewhere that you can't really get Outdoors like like at a hotel conference like Sacred Space or you know if you're somewhere in a city where you can't necessarily go say hug a tree you know do you have any earthy natural ways to connect I do we have had people say explain to us how how are you making these same connections when you're in the city or L you know in confined spaces I am G to take you back even farther to about 2005 oh and there was a um there still is a religious community here in Asheville and it it's very I referred to it as new age neopagan Methodist so they were it was all creation spirituality it was the Matthew Fox stuff mhm and their their leader their pastor had gone to Japan and he was lamenting the fact that he felt like he had never really been on the land in Japan because he landed at the airport he was on the tarmac he was on concrete he was in a car he was on in the car going to a hotel he stayed in a hotel he never he was never on like raw soil like the dirt between his toes kind of thing yeah and here I liken I likened it to this so if you and I were to meet and it was winter time and you were in those gorgeous Woods that are behind you and it was colder than whiz and we gave each other a great big hug while wearing our winter coats does that mean we didn't give each other a hug because we had clothes on no no what that meant is that there was a layer of stuff between us but Spirit doesn't see that Spirit doesn't feel that so to be in an urban setting to be in a human-built environment is an opportunity to Rebrand everything you know and reframe everything you know about nature because we think nature is I'm out on the land oh look there there herbs they trees oh look at the sky all of that it's all lovely but if we're talking about energy s signatures they are all over Urban settings so if for instance you want to cross into cross through a Lial space and into another place you hit the traffic signal button and you wait for the red hand to become the little green walking person and then you walk through that energetic linal space to the other side so you can use that in the same way we would use any kind of walking a labyrinth or or uh setting up a kind of energetic boundary to walk everything that we can do on Raw land can be done in an urban setting we would not poooo uh being in Stonehenge or Aver and go oh well but I mean it's not really nature because it's a built environment no no is if it's an ancient built environment then we're like oh oh but feel the energy it's so powerful and amazing am I so I think it's up to it's up to humans and it's up to pagans and witches to understand that a built environment is still a magical environment you just have to reframe it in your head to work for you you have to connect with the energy of the place and the spirit of the place and figure out where the spirits are so yes it's easy to know where land Spirits are in my backyard you go in my backyard and there are places that you go to them and you go oh whoa whoa whoa whoa calm down y'all calm down is the same is true in a skyscraper so you go into a skyscraper and is it the elevator I mean do spirits love to hang out in the elevator because it's always moving or do the spirits of that building go to the basement because they really want to be kind of in this bowels of the building so it requires us to work a little bit differently but not really it requires us to reframe in our heads what nature is and so the buil environment is still the environment all that concrete and steel and stone and brick that all comes from the earth it don't come from anywhere else now that kind of Segways it's a little bit of a left turn but it kind of Segways into a question I have now you are she's good at that she's I am good at that now now we might we might have to pause on my question and talk about some pronunciation because we've been Leila's been getting her hand SLA you are a if I'm saying this wrong please correct me and we'll get into why Lea and I do say it wrong you are an Appalachian folklorist is that correct okay um this is one of those why does why do people answer a question with a question so the appal the appalachin range is vast in fact I talked I had an interview with a man on Monday who is in Nova Scotia which is the end of the appalachin range was invited to Pittsburgh um years ago doesn't matter when a while back and where I live which is the Southern Highlands we say Appalachia and appalachin and the way to remember that is if you say Appalachia I'm gonna throw an Apple at you so we say Appalachia is it different in the north it is so I arrive in Pittsburgh which is very appalachin in a lot of ways and they meet me at the airport and they hug my neck and they go we just wanted to really be clear that we are Appalachian too and so that kind of chill went up and down my spine like well if you are why do you say it wrong the truth of the matter is that it is a long mountain range of multiple cultures so in my culture Appalachia and Appalachian are the appropriate way to say those words in Pennsylvania it may in fact be Appalachia and Appalachian there's somewhere else and I can't tell you exactly where it is where they say it with an S appalation and appalation I have to throw a little wrench into this and give you a third option oh good I am from originally the Southern Tier of New York um on the New York Pennsylvania border and we have a small town called appen that's spelled the same way oh I've heard no it's got one less P there's only so appal Appalachia Appalachia we just were getting confused but so now that we know that it is kind of a regional pronunciation exactly I'm gonna segue back to my question so I love especially small Magic's awesome book everybody who hasn't read it really needs to go get it but speaking of kind of that quote unquote magic of place how does someone take a book or some knowledge that's similar to small Magics um talking kind you know taking some of the the Appalachian folklore and translating that to say City urban life you know what if I live in New York City but want to translate some of those small Magics to my big city life do you have a good explanation of how to kind of transfer that Appalachian Magic to your place yes and first I'm going to say small magic is not Appalachian at all it is the building blocks of a basic magical practice you can do that anywhere I think you assume that because that's the way lelan marketed it so for lellan I am their app appalachin girl so everything I do has to have Appalachia on it I gotcha um so small magic what is it the secrets of an appalachin Village witch that's not my title none of that is my title I wrote small magic so I'm going to go back a little bit you know how we do um I wrote small Magics because I'd been teaching a class for years called Simple Practical Magic I started teaching that because I kept running into primarily young people but also new people who were not young who had absolutely no idea how to practice magic they they read thousands of spell books and they and they can find a spell for whatever the thing is they're doing but the things that I learned literally decades ago about grounding yourself deeply pulling energy out of the earth pulling energy from the cosmos pulling energy from all around you into you and not using your own personal energy or your life force you pull that energy into you you store it in the battery between your breast bone and your belly button and then you use that that's what you use well I would say that and and these new people would be like I don't I don't understand you mean I don't just point my $700 magic wand and say this spell that I read in a book that's not how magic Works no darling that's not how magic works at all so right as one does and I know that neither of you have ever done this because it's so ridiculous I got into an argument on Facebook with [Laughter] somebody well yeah I know well who it's a thing happens um and and I was so exasperated I said oh my do I just need to write a book about magical practice and yes to be fair my editor L Ellen saw that and said you know maybe a couple hours later um we should talk about that so so that is the Genesis of the small Magic's book and then of course I had to laugh at them because only a publisher like Luellen would take a concept as big as the building blocks of genuine magical practice and call it small Magics so right good point it does really does have all those building blocks in it and and things that you can do and you know it's funny that you said that because shell and I not too long ago did a couple episodes on that very topic the fact that a lot of witches are reading these spells online or in a book and they don't they're just reading them and like you said pointing their $700 magical wand at their $500 crystals and not and wondering why it's not working they don't have those basic building blocks of raising that energy holding it raising a cone of power or however you refer to it releasing and then grounding that energy it's it's surprising how little of that knowledge is out there there's work that goes into magic it isn't just buying magic you have to put work into it you can't just throw dollars at it get your $700 wand and boom magic appears you have to put the work in you have to I mean that's why we call it practicing magic because if you don't practice it you won't be good at it and there are so many people that get shocked when I say as I do in the book and and also in that class practice magic all the time don't save it for a rainy day because by God it is thundering right now the storm is here and the more you practice it the better you'll be at it and you all heard at some of the classes I did at Sacred Space I often be in a class by saying we are in partless times and I need any of you who consider yourselves magic workers to practice all the time so that you're Adept at it because things are moving so fast we can't wait for you to go oh no which book was that in I need to go pull that out and look it up you need to ground yourself pull energy into you get your Shields up prepare yourself drop your seals and do the work and it has to happen that fast it is everyday magic every day magic day every day and start with the practicalities so I live in a tourist town if I'm going downtown guaranteed I'm going to need a place to park so perfecting a parking spell if you're in that situation makes sense learn something first that you need yes every every 17-year-old wants to conjure a demon I don't know why but they want toon well that's going to do you no good you don't know what to do once the conjuration happens and frankly the conjuration is not going to happen because you don't know what to do right but figure out what you need what do you need getting a parking spot that is an attainable goal magically yes and you can you can do your math you can go okay I did this working and I got a parking space I did this working I didn't get a parking space so then you can do a double blind test you can make it into science and go well that this is the one I'm always going to use and you use it until it doesn't work I have people all the time who say but isn't Magic supposed to always work and I go no and anybody who tells you their magic always works is either a big fat liar or they don't do a lot of magic right yeah or they're trying to get something from you exactly because there are always times when we have to admit whatever that working is that we're trying to accomplish it may not be our job to do we may negating something a lesson that somebody else needs to learn we been may be negating the flow of history that it has to go it has to March forward in this way and if you interfere with it you are you're in for a world of trouble some things you can't intervene on and I call it one two three brick wall so the first time I will do a general sort of ground myself Focus do the work if that doesn't work then next time I'll consider the phase of the moon I will give myself some privacy I will cons walk myself through it I'll do it and and be a little more intentional about it and if that doesn't work the third time I will see where Mercury is I'll see where the Moon is I'll see if the moon is void of course I'll see what's happening with the sun I'll raise an altar I'll put on my best robe I'll stink the place up with the worst in sense you can imagine I'll fling myself full length in front of the Altar and beg the divines to do what I'm asking them to do and if that doesn't work but if you hit the brick wall with that one it means it's not my job to do and I can push it and push it and push it but it's not it's not gonna work or if it does work it's gonna be awful I Absolut I'm so stealing the one two three brick wall thing because I freaking love that now I am a compulsive journaler and I have dragged shell along Kicking and Screaming she is now also a compulsive journaler and and I I call it note taking note taking I love writing spells down components of rituals what I did what didn't work what did work and just like you said adding to it or subtracting from it but if you don't write those things down you're going to forget I always tell myself I'll remember that chant I just made up I will and don't so but I love the one 123 brick wall because I think that's such a good idea and I I'm absolutely going to write it down and I'll write it down for all of our listeners too so that they can practice and try that too it's also it's also good practice know when to say when and you know know when you did what you could and it isn't supposed it isn't meant to be so move on exactly or it's not your work to do so here you are you're a seasoned magic worker and you have decided you're going to take this thing on but maybe this is the opportunity for someone who does not have as much experience to tackle a thing that seems big and hard and be successful at it and if you go in and do it then you you know whatever one more notch on your belt but if that fairly new person does it and is successful then you've got another strong witchin training and we need as many of those as we can get frankly yeah to the call yeah absolutely and to take it back just a little bit to small Magics and and doing things every day and helping people work their own magic you talked in there about helping people to cleanse their space you know as the village witch you get called on sometimes to help someone clear energies out of a space and a lot of times it's them shell and I have are familiar with this you're the problem yeah they call us up and we're like oh honey let's sit down and have some tea and talk first but in the book you mention a broom thing that you have them you have that person actually go through their home with a broom from the front door to the back door sweeping everything especially the corners to get that energy out to cleanse their space and that's something simple that a person can like you said you gave them the tool you said here's what you need to do this is your mess you need to sweep it up and and clean it up with your own energy and so rather than going into their house and being the Great Village witch and cleansing everything for them you you gave them go clean your own up that's right that's right and to me that's more you know that's down toe witchcraft that's everyday magic you know the other part of that is if they do it then they are less likely to call you three weeks later and go oh you're really screwed up because it didn't it's not good at all I had a situation with a woman who is now moved from the realm of matter to the realm of spirit as we say and she she was she was a bit of a psycho frankly uh but but a sweet woman a very sweet woman so she called me and my then partner to do an energy clearing on her house and but first she had to talk about it for about an hour and a half and tell us all the this and the that so then we go through the house and do the thing we always do and we determined she did have in fact some two pair of sisters that were spirits that had built their father had built the house and they lived there she confirmed that oh yes no I know all about them um so you know we did our whole Spiel with her and it was fine for a couple months then she contacted us and by then my partner was on to doing something else and she didn't do that anymore so I went there and she said the problem is my bedroom so I go in the bedroom and I walk through this one area and she had a lay line that ran through her bedroom and it was like walking into a stream of cold water all over your body it was very very active and I came out and I said well here's the problem you've got um an energy Channel a lay line that runs through the house and that's not unusual we find them because the mountains here are so old there's tons of energy lines that run across it and she said well how do you fix that and I go oh I don't I mean that's move yeah you you live with that and so I suggested all these really practical things like she was getting out of bed on that side of the bed so she would get out of bed and step into this cold flow of energy every morning and I mean it could be like taking a cold shower I guess to invigorate you but she didn't like it and I said well if you'll get up on the other side of the bed and come around it'll give you a chance to kind of acclimate yourself before you step through he's in but I don't want to get out of out of bed on the other side I don't want to get out of bed on the other side and I and she had told me when we were there before there was another room that had some boxes and whatever in it and I said well then if I were you I'd move my bedroom into that room oh no no I can't do that either and I said why can't you do that well I mean it would be a lot of trouble and I said well we can get people in to help you move everything around if you like if You' like to do that no that really that's just not convenient so can't you fix this no I can't fix it it's a lay line even if I could fix it you would not want the result of it right oh yeah and so she was never happy never never never and she finally she was renting the house so she finally got out of that house and moved into another house and and that was even crazier so yes often the person who calls you is the problem and sometimes the solution is practical and not magical even when you're dealing with a magical situation exactly just get out on the other side of the bed I don't I don't understand why that's a problem rearrange I don't know that's but no I mean you could use that like a spa treatment you know when you're feeling kind of sluggish and uh and and and like you got energetic Barnacles all over you just imagine stripping off all your clothes and standing in a layline and just like blowing it all out and then you know give yourself 15 minutes set a timer and then step about you would be like invigorated work with what you've got yeah use it to your advantage yeah that's what we do but we're you know we're people who do this we do this that's right that's who we are that's what we do now speaking of invigorating energy I'm gonna I'm G to call you out again on another post that you made this one was about this was about belain and you had posted that you were up you were cleaning your kitchen you were doing all sorts of things you were busy and you're looking at your oven thinking maybe you're going to tackle that next when you realize I'm still buzzing from all the energy of belain and and that's something also that shell and I have experience with you know you do a ritual or a working and you don't quite ground enough and you have still have all that wonderful energy just kind of buzzing around and hanging around you yeah what what are your favorite ways to kind of ground and reconnect with you know your calm centered self after something like that I will I will often have a cup of um like herbal tea and I'll eat something and I'll eat something that's bready and kind of heavy um my my go-to comfort food is a cheese sandwich of mayonnaise and it's nice and solid but it's not heavy and disruptive in my tummy so I'll do that um yeah because that how I solved the problem of oh should I clean the oven or should I go ahead and tackle the bathroom um I went oh wait a minute I know what this is have a sandwich yeah well I didn't even have a sandwich I just laughed at myself and then I did I mean the technique I use as the one of the little Roots growing out of your feet to the bottoms of your feet so I just dug my heels into the floor and immediately my body went oh oh yeah home I'm home good I can relax so it was it was a matter of mother Grove didn't do public rituals for several years because of covid we are only slowly getting back to where that feels natural again and this time we had wonderful volunteers who came early and we decorated the space and we set up a beautiful Altar and we put the mapole under the Gazebo because it was supposed to rain all day so we really it just all worked perfectly as it does some sometimes so beautifully that at one point we all stopped because there was a little boy maybe 3 years old maybe four and he had picked a dandelion that had gone to seed and he was going to blow it and make a wish and we stopped the entire ritual so that we could watch him and we could all have a wish with him so it was that kind of really family lovely juicy yeah it was all good so buing from that magic good magic is what it sounds like this spring has been really good for that I reconnected with part of shell and my old community in the Southern Tier of New York which was really beautiful and being able to just be out get in my garden and and just kind of dig into the Earth has been very healing I guess I really needed that I seeing the dandelion I am a dandelion fiend so I'm just loving all the dandelion everywhere but do you have any outdoor things you like to do any gardening or any particular um you know outdoor witchy type things that you like to do this time of year everything you haven't seen my post on Facebook today I guess where I said my daily practice for the past few months has been tending soil and planting seeds and planting plants and thinning plants and eating radishes radishes radish is and all of that has been so soul enlivening and so enriching for me because it can't only be about pouring a libation at the new moon and saying my prayers in the morning and remembering people who are sick or dying or pregnant there's a lot of that going on right now what was happening nine months ago what was that llamas yeah um so I that has been my practice but at belan something changed and it's like I can feel the religious part of my spirituality coming back in and that's good that's good because I'm I mean I am a I'm a gardener and a farmer and um Rider and a witch but I'm also a priestess and for me witch and Priestess are two different things so Priestess is my obligation to the Divine and then in my case that is the the ancient mothers and the goddess and then my witchery is something that is practical and and daily and which is not to say my religious stuff isn't daily too but it's it's a different feel to it so being outside one of the lovely things is is to grow things you can eat so the radishes were amazing this year and I kept writing about and talking about them today I pulled the last two radishes from the spring batch and I just wiped them on my pants and ate them so that's how it should be yeah I think so too so what the composted Cal manure and the leaf litter and the soil and all that yeah I got all that too and that's never killed anybody so I got the flavor of those things directly from the soil and I also spoke my gratitude for those beings those radish beings giving their lives for me now I would not want to have a diet of nothing but radishes I love them but too much but for all of us to be aware that for us to exist other things cease to exist and to remember that and that that has to do with humility and it has to do with acknowledge kinship to everything that is around us but it also has to do with the Practical matter of I planted the radishes I watched the radishes grow I shook my fist and cursed whatever was eating the radishes that was not me and then the radishes were done and now there is okra where the radishes were and it reminds me always of the cycle of the seasons and the wheel of the year because nothing is ever linear in my world it's a spiral it spirals in and right now we're in the time of spiraling out and then we are going to hit the summer solstice and we're going to start spiraling in again oh I do love that there's so many cycles in our lives daily Cycles seasonal cycles and finding a Harmony in that rhythm is something that is is where I find a lot of Serenity and I find a lot of that's where my daily practice comes if I can just remember where I'm at in that spiral sometimes just kind of paying attention to that is enough for that day oh I wanted to talk to you a little bit about tea now I I drink tea but not like shell I drink tea shell is a tea woman and a half and she definitely loves that and I know you have mentioned tea a couple times Along With Sam and his wife's beautiful tea shop now we also use tea magically uh and and in spellcraft and things like that do you have any tea that you like to drink or any particular types of tea that uh kind of get you in a magical mood or magical space well I mean I am completely prosaic in that I love black tea I drink an English I agree I I drink an English brand called PG tips which is kind of just basic go to Tesco and buy a box of tea tea just plain old black tea yeah I'm a big black tea fan and I like all kinds of black tea so oh wait a minute there's some real Smokey thing that I don't like oh H lapsang I don't really like that it's too smoky for me I like the Colin Hay song where he talks about lapsang suang but I don't actually like the tea we had a shop here in town for years and years that was called high tea and they baked their own bread and they you know you they would make special blends of tea but you could just get a pot of Earl Gray and a small loaf with some butter and cheese and it would just the most civilized thing imaginable and it was also affordable this is back in the 70s so yeah we spent a lot of time there in college I do I use tea magically but I use tea more as um as a psychological tool so I will so the act of it's my own kind of tea ceremony I guess the act of sitting with another person and offering them this hot beverage and sitting with them and having a hot beverage together is a kind of communion that I think we often miss and it's I'm sure you can do the same thing with coffee and maybe we go to Starbucks together and we all order a coffee and we do that but there's something about tea and the kind of fussiness of tea like I I like black tea just black I don't need anything with it but man if I go to Britain I'm gonna want some cream and a little bit of sugar and that's going to be tea now you're speaking Shell's language yeah my British blend my sweet cream and a teasp spoon and a half of sugar I mean it's just the best it really it sets you up for the whole day and and you can have it all day long in fact I sto drinking caffeinated tea at six o'clock every evening or else I can't sleep so when I got in from work I had a really fast because I didn't get in until 5:30 I had a really fast cup of tea with a lot of almond milk in it to cool it down enough for me to drink it before 6 and then I got wine so that's how that work um I I think tea is remarkable and I remember a few years back one of our local uh organic grower school things did this thing called the eat Carolina Challenge and the challenge was that for two weeks you would only eat and drink things that could be that were grown in North or South Carolina oh very cool it was a lot of fun but but I had to make it hard on me harder on me by saying I'm going to only eat things and drink things that I could grow in my backyard and it didn't mean I had to be growing it it just meant that it had to it had to prosper here where I live which meant that I didn't drink tea but I have tons of herbs so I would drink mint tea and I would drink Sage Tea which is remarkably delicious with honey and I didn't eat any Wheat any Wheat based things because I can't grow wheat here well you can but it's really really hard so I ate only corn-based things so I ate corn pone and corn fritters and things that were just made of corn and it was for two weeks you had to be so very conscious about everything you put in your mouth and it was a wonderful exercise I would uh I would recommend that to to anybody that wanted to get kind of centered in what they're doing what they're ingesting for their body it's really helpful as well as getting you in tune with your quote unquote magic of place the magic of your home your area your surrounding that is so important to pay attention to the energies and the magic where you are like you were saying at the beginning you know even if you're in a skyscraper there are spirits and energies there that if you're paying attention you can connect with and and work with and talk to and it really doesn't matter where but just connect with where you're at and and I love the idea of eating local things to kind of get you in that place with yeah I want to thank you so much for being here but we want to give you a minute I know you have a new book that you have been working on feral church and we're very excited about that can you tell us about some of your upcoming projects I can um two big things that are coming up for me well I mean they feel big to me in June I'm finally going to go up to the Buckland Museum and do a class at the Buckland Museum we've been trying to do this since Co and I keep going no I can't H so finally I'm going to be up there in June and I'm trying to arrange maybe another a book signing maybe at Loganberry books and maybe another class somewhere and then I'll go directly from Cleveland down to Wisteria which is in Southern Ohio to do appalachin summer solstice which is one my favorite festivals of the whole year because it's very laidback the food is good the land is weria you probably don't know this Wisteria is on a uh an old strip mine it's reclaimed land they've been on the land for 30 years and you can stand on this land and you can feel it healing itself and it's remarkable and because it's healing itself it it comes rushing right up your body so you get that same healing energy and then you send that back down into the land and the land is like ah thanks for helping and send it back up so it's just wonderful kind of feedback loop then the big my big thing this year is that I'm leading a tour to Cornwall in July oh wow I think I saw that on your socials how exciting it I'm so excited about it I will be more excited after this week when I've gotten my Transportation straightened out because because it's a little crazy but I'm seeing two good friends who live in near Penzance um Cassandra leam Jones and Leticia leam Jones who are The Village witches of their Village St buan and they're we're gonna have them with us the whole day telling us all the secrets um and we're going to go to a lot of ancient monuments we're going to do a lot of Witchcraft a lot of magic we're going to go to L end where you stand at the very edge of the Sea and the next thing is north America I mean it's going to be a lot of fun and it's 10 days no eight days and it's pricey is the only thing we don't have a huge group going because it's $44,000 but everything's inclusive except for your airfare so that's the big thing but it sounds like it's worth every penny though worth every pen yeah yeah I think so what a magical trip yeah yeah and then after that you know I've got I've got more things coming up lots stuff in October September doing two herb conferences one in Alabama and one down in Wilmington um I used to do herb conferences a lot and i' had kind of fallen out of that but I've already done one this year and then I'll do two more so I love doing those I love now tell us about this forthcoming book I'm curious it is called a feral church and this book God this sounds so crazy but it's okay you know me you know I'm crazy we love crazy that's our favorite that I was at Wisteria oddly enough when I heard that Carol Christ had died and she her work had I never met her but her work had always been important to me as a as a goddess devote and as soon as I heard it I was weeping and a friend came over and we were drinking coffee with whiskey in it and oh what are we gonna do oh it's so terrible it's so terrible and later that day I this book was kind of laid on me as the Baptist will say it was laid on my heart to write uh a goddess theology book and so that's what this is it's a it's a book of how we find goddess in the wilderness and sometimes the Wilderness is inside us it's not going out onto the land it's going and looking at your personal baggage and history and Trauma and that'll be coming out uh we think January of next year but when it drops I I hate to use that for a book when the when the book finally is available with it will come website and a series of white papers about how you in fact begin a feral Church oh wow wow love it's going to be a national and I hope International uh process of tearing people away from organized religion and putting religion back into their own hands yes and we need that we need that so much right now everyone needs to kind of take that power back you know take our own power and speak that power right you know we need to speak that into the world right now the world really needs this I think so I'm very excited about that me too well thank you so much for being with us Byron this has been wonderful but we would love to have you back again sometime because you absolutely so fun to talk to and I would even love just having a zoom without it being the show so you just chat yes I would love that too yes that is wonderful as well and hopefully we'll see you some more conferences we'll hang out there we'll we'll compare a schedule and see what happens absolutely and I really want to encourage you all to do more of that yes thank you yes thank you we're we're encouraging each other to do more good because we need that as communities we need that so I I definitely feel like that it is kind of a witch's call to action and it's it's spread the knowledge you have and help the folks take that step up and and get on that Journey just like we all needed a little help on that journey and let's continue helping people who are either starting or Midway through their journey and just need a little extra information knowledge assistance whatever that may be and even inspiration you know we learn best by having things modeled for us so with people like you modeling for us how we do this then other people can step into that and go well I know some people that do that and if they can do it I can do it exactly yeah exactly yes and they can do it because we're not we're not that special we're just pretty normal people just like so we can it y'all can do it pretty special now that's a compliment I'll definitely take that thank you and on that note thank you so very much to Byron Ballard for joining us on today's back on the broomstick we had a wonderful conversation and are looking
