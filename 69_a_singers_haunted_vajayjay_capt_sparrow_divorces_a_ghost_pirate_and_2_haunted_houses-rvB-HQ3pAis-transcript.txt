the more I read this the more I lose faith in humanity okay hold that thought it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 69 nice of the Stone Witch is our on this podcast two best friends separated by way too many miles get together to tell each other spooky true Tales from across the US OFA while smoking copious amounts of the greenest crystallast stoniest weed that they can get their witchy little paw on I'm your co-host Lila I am your co-host shell and today we got some crazy [ __ ] for you episode 69 nice wow now I know we had promised our listeners that we were going to find some very juicy very titillating very scary ghost stories and I forgot forgot you did too yeah but I did find a couple interesting tidbits of ghost lore to share I got a weird funny one to share that just makes you say huh well let's start out with a little fact that I learned once I realized that the story I researched had nothing sexy and ghosty in common I I decided to look up I just typed in ghost sexy you would be amazed at what came up and the first thing I learned was something called spectrophilia and spectrophilia has two definitions one is the attraction between humans and ghosts the second is an attraction to objects seen in mirrors basically it means that there are some people who are attracted enough to ghosts that they want to have sex with them wow yeah it's so common they have a name for it hey you know ghost with Patrick S and Demi Moore I think that shaped a lot of people's Outlook in the 9s I mean I guess I wouldn't be opposed to it is that weird well no I guess it would depend on how sexy the ghost was right even Lucy Lou said that she had sex with a ghost nuh like like Charlie's Angels Lucy Lou the very same she also starred in one of my favorite shows called Elementary my dear friend Elementary but um in 1999 she did an interview with Us Weekly in it she said that she had a sexual encounter with a ghost while she was trying to take a nap she says quote it was sheer Bliss I felt everything I climaxed and then he floated away it was almost like what might have happened to Mary that's how it felt something came down and touched me and now it watches over me I have questions me too is that considered cheating and sign me up I guess that's a good question like is Ghost sex cheating if you're in a relationship probably I mean sex is sex right sex is outside of you unless it's the astral projection of your significant other it's probably cheating okay I don't know I just made that rule up I mean unless you have you know if you've talked up to your partner about having ghostly sexual encounters ahead of time cool how do you ask your lover boy hey hey so there's this ghost okay that is a different x-rated podcast there you go but for the most part I'm going to keep it G-rated because my actual story is in New York but it's not sexy at all so I have one more star that has had sex with a ghost who who who this one is a singer and we haven't heard from her in a little while but Kesha oh I love Kesha let's see Kesha says that uh she became a banger of ghosts in 2012 and she told Ryan CEST that her song supernatural was inspired by quote having sexy time with a ghost oh [ __ ] right she was on another show this time on with on Conan and she said during that interview that she went to quote the bone Zone with a ghost and then on Jimmy Kim alive a year later she said that her vagina was haunted what so yeah it's it's like a three for there with Kesha how how is your vagina haunted well I don't know she has enough sex with a ghost that she wrote a song about it you could probably say that it's haunted which I am gonna go listen to after this podcast by the way yeah so hey a haunted vagina I've heard of worse things they probably make a cream for that now much like you you know it's so funny because we don't even plan this you know this is what makes us awesome because we're like two pe's in a pod we really are and we've always been two PS in a pod I also forgot about the grand 69 nice and I also actually have a story from New York hey wait a minute how do you manage that and I also at the last minute remembered the 69 and went to Google but I Googled mared to ghost oh Lord first of all way too many ctions way too many people marrying ghosts hold up hold up I'm lawfully allowed to marry people I'm pretty sure it's in the handbook you don't you don't marry people to ghosts where is that legal like how can they do that did I miss something yeah I guess I did so who married a ghost I have a new business for you okay hey I can expand my client tell now right now we usually stick to stories in America but I could not pass this one up now what I've got for you this is nuts [ __ ] nuts I love it I am way too high for this oh I need to be more High woman who married a 300-year-old pirate ghost announces their marriage is over oh oh oh wait wait wait wait she's not announcing the marriage she's announcing their divorce uhhuh oh wow whole other uh lucrative business there how do you do that in court anyway her name how do you get them to show up do you have to bring like a a medium to court with you be like here this is the medium that's representing my husband's ghost oh you laugh but wait but wait you're not that far off oh okay you know I can't pronounce anything her name I believe is Amanda teu I could be saying that wrong she married a Haitian pirate named Jack wait a minute here is a thing with Amanda okay 45 years old so it's not like we're talking about a kid here her job she is a impersonator of Jack Sparrow in Northern Ireland okay I'm starting to sense a theme here right she is a Jack Sparrow impersonator who married a ghost named Jack who a pirate right yeah that's not that's not weird at all not at all she married him and now she's divorcing him probably the sensible thing to do he is her second husband and with her first husband she had five kids so okay I have kids I've been divorced if I went to my children and said mommy is going to marry a ghost my kids they probably slap me and I I would just sit there and let them yeah but any who we'd have to have a talk when she first told the Irish Mir which is a a newspaper in Northern Ireland when she first told him about the divorce she said I will explain all in due course but for now I want to say be very careful when dabbling in spirituality it's not something to mess with well no [ __ ] duh right this is how it was legal okay the couple wed in a private ceremony who is coming to that well I would go if any of our friends said they're marrying a ghost I am so there not performing that ceremony but I'll go private ceremony on a boat in Internet AAL Waters off the coast of Ireland so because they went on international waters that made it legal I see I see what made it legal Amanda hired a psychic medium for the ceremony that going through the psychic medium that's how Jack was able to say I do so she had a proxy a medium sand in as proxy uhhuh whoa because Jack couldn't put on a ring Amanda held a candle that the ring was placed on and the candle symbolized Jack all righty I know our listeners can't see I have to show you this I have to share my screen like look at this lady like she looks put together the two of them look like an adorable couple actually these two ladies should totally get married right but Jack is the red candle okay I mean if I was going to have my husband represented by a candle I would have gotten a bigger one just saying she doesn't look cray cray yeah well okay maybe a little yeah okay now their love story began listen to this 2014 after the ghost of a Haitian man visited her while she was lying in bed and she soon learned that he was Jack an 18th century pirate who had been left at the altar before he was executed for thievery that sounds like a shitty day right she interacted with the ghost over the course of a few months and began to develop feelings oh so this wasn't like a they just met each other and got married that same day there was an actual ghostly courtship she says there was about six months of communication she says they spent a lot of time together is that code even her herself was horrified to discover that she had romantic feelings for him having never heard of that before eventually the relationship turned sexual oh really how did she know well I guess Lucy Lou on the couch knew so she had to give him an ultimatum growing up in Ireland she was taught if a man beded you he had to Wed you so she when did she grow up the 18 [ __ ] hundreds right yeah no that was when he grew up H um so she researched spiritual marriage found out it was a thing and she asked him to marry her did he say no at first and make her prove her love because he'd been left at the altar before no no well it could have been a lifetime movie if he did and she told People magazine that she doesn't understand why people pick on her so she said the reason she's coming out about it and has been is because she wants to encourage others not to feel alone if they are in a spiritual relationship did she say why they're divorcing no yeah if they're so much in love and they have this marriage that others should emulate why are they getting divorced but she wants people to know not all ghosts are like in the horror films and some of them can be loving and caring Spirits she said you just need to know what you're doing what the holy hell what the holy hell like I'm a [ __ ] around of find out kind of girl but like I ain't marrying a ghost maybe she has the psychic come over as a standin it sounds like a porno right I mean how do you I I I have no words no me either that's strange I would have loved to have been invited to that wedding though to be honest I would totally watch that wedding does she hold hands with the medium does she caress the candle does she get upset when he doesn't show up you know does she mistake random cold spots in the house for him I mean really how does this work I have questions she admitted that she pays all the bills really does anybody get spousal support here and how do they get paid if so I mean I know I'm high but I'm stumped on people right now that's just wild you know hey as long as she's have well no apparently they're not happy they got divorced so I feel bad maybe the sex wasn't as good as it used to be well hey she didn't say if if I got good beded then I get wetted she just said if I get beded good or bad I guess now that we've we've done our last minute 69 stories we're g to go back to how we usually start the fun here we're both obviously Rip Roar and high talk to me woman what you smoking tonight oh wow I went to someplace new o always fun I went to Moon Walkers ooh another delivery place and I got two new kinds of weed we got some Citrus diesel o for 125 an ounce you know I love Diesel and you know I love anything Citrus right and I love anything cheap right and then then we got some powdered runs that are super extra expensive I believe it was 45 e oh wow honestly I love the packaging check this [ __ ] out I am holding up an old school baggie oh my God that's so OG thank you thank you they did not package it in a huge super heavyduty gorgeously nice gift bag that they've written all over so you can't even reuse the [ __ ] and then packed in glass jar after glass jar and then fluffy paper insert decorative things and a stack of stickers I'm so over the [ __ ] stickers people dispensaries put it on the counter if I want one I'll take it thank you and if you're doing a delivery the first time you deliver to me fine wrap it up like a present woohoo great looks awesome otherwise save that money [ __ ] free pre-roll yeah give me the weed in a baggy and a brown paper bag right the more recyclable and the smaller the better I do not want your glass jars with your fancy labeling on it I do not want five of your stickers every [ __ ] time I get a delivery and I do not want all the packaging keep it [ __ ] simple I have a really quick funny story about about the good because I'm about to get on a rant and I don't want to so go for it you are gonna this is like the best recycle ever okay you know how we have talked about Happy Valley the big fat glass jars and they're so envir mentally [ __ ] even though we love Happy Valley but they're packaging [ __ ] blows most places packaging [ __ ] blows you might not be aware of this but within the last week here in the Grand Old Land of the outskirts of Boston we had either two days in a row or three days in a row of Taylor Swift concerts lucky Boston first of all there was a dad who paid $21,000 for a ticket for his daughter different podcast but Jesus I need to live that life holy Jesus I wish I had the money to I can't even I can't I got medical bills people 21,000 on a ticket damn you know what I told people at my my day job I looked at them I go listen I don't love my kids that much and my kids at least one of my kids listens to our podcast so to my lovely son I love you so much but I will never spend $21,000 on you for a concert ticket never don't ask ask me we have had like a drought in Massachusetts for like a year and a half Friday and Saturday the sky opened and it was like Niagara goddamn Falls okay blessings because Taylor was in the area Gill stadium is outdoors oh wow God bless her she just kept on going and let herself get soaked do you know there's [ __ ] out there right now they took Happy Valley jars filled them with Rainwater and are selling them on the Internet for $250 if you want to buy rainwater from Gillette Stadium in the Taylor Swift concert that's some entrepreneurship right there impressive why aren't you filling some of your jars and selling them right there's a tap right there I mean I am appalled a that someone did it B that people will actually buy it and C that you threw away your jars and aren't doing it yourself right true but I thought you would appreciate it because even someone online commented on the posting and they were like hey those are Happy Valley jars that's fantastic that's a good recycle for you so for me I am on my last eth of this midnight oh you said that tasted good and it had a good Stone right right but too much of it and you might as well call it a night you're done this is the I don't want to say it's like the counter weed but this is what you want to smoke when you're gearing up for bedtime right this is not a clean the house have fun this is like relax weed nice you know what I mean real good but it doesn't make you super chatty or you know that Upp it's more of a Downy I could tell your stone but you kind of have this very quiet Zen Mama energy but here's the thing I've been doing doing a lot of walking the last two or three weeks and my back has like flared like a mofo as much as it makes you tired this strain is like Miracle medicine I mean I'm not saying my back doesn't hurt but not like it did earlier in the day before I smoked so like you're saying the midnight has not only like a a help you go to sleep effect but it also is a good analgesic it's good for your back lower back pain that you've had since an accident since you were a teenager but you know what's funny what's that it has cbca 30 but under CBD it says zero but yet I am telling you with my own words it is making me feel better when I got home from my day job today I could barely stand up straight and was having a hard time walking and you know I smoked a few okay I smoked a bunch I am able to get up and walk around and do what I got to do but according to the label it has no CBD the Leafly page on it says that midnight is a sativa dominant strain that's high in CBD and it controls pain inflammation and indigestion it's known to be for pain so you're telling me not to trust my label I don't know again I'm saying what Leafly has as the information for midnight could very well be an entirely different strain from what you have the only correlation is the name and that the Leafly strain says that it's good for pain so that seems to be the only correlation what I'm thinking might be going on with yours is the tpin because there are tpin that help with inflammation and with pain I thought the tpine was the flavor they are tpin are little chemicals and they not only affect flavor but they can also um affect you it can make the stone stonier it can help with inflammation they have a huge part to do with the overall effects of the Cannabis and the tpin for pain and inflammation there's six of them that are good for it the four popular ones are merine pining linol and lemine and I know you love lemine and linol oh hell yeah so the pining and the mercing are the ones that you tend to want to stay away from because they have more of that um piny taste that you don't like right I mean I know different people have different physical ailments but for me and my personal back issue I would rather be very chill and kind of ready for bed at any time and and have it take that pain away then be uppity and happy and not able to walk out into my kitchen right so if you're taking it for pain relief CBDs definitely help but it's not the only thing look for those tpin the mercing pining lolu and lemon there's also caropine and hene and as you know probably our listeners don't but you know this I am not a traditional medicine taker although if I'm really sick you might catch me taking some Nyquil but that's about it I don't even take Tylenol aspirin no so I don't take any sort of pain pills for my back all I do is smoke big catties right and it's been working for me yeah why chains what works right and when you find a cultivar that works you got to you know you got to stick with it you know you always hear about these people who the doctors get them addicted to Codine or the doctors get them addicted to perks no I'd rather soothe my pain with a fat bowl my silicone bowl with a to I love your Silicone Bowl hey they're saying all over the country that the places where they they legalize or make it legal for medical they're seeing a lot less demand for things like pain medications and alcohol and you know so it's it's making things better in a lot of areas but so while we enjoy our weed and this uh powdered runs is living up to its name it's all so crystally it's almost white I got to show you some of this oh and it smells so flipping good it's super my God I won't lick it right it's so light and crystally it's gorgeous I love that weed that you just wish you could lick because it's pry and crystally yep but while I smoke on this I want to tell you a little bit about where I'm at so I'm in Troy New York where New York are you today for your spooky story I am actually in a favorite place of mine um I love the Thousand Islands region it Owns My Heart and we are going to the Thousand Islands region and most specifically Mexico New York and yes if you didn't know there was a Mexico in New York there is now you do yeah okay well I'm going to a house a particular haunted house in Troy New York that is called the enin house and it is haunted by no less than nine Spirits o and and it has a portal a portal to wear hell they're not exactly sure it's more of like it's one of those portals that seems to allow spirits to come in and out so not really a portal to hell but more of a a portal to the other side and the worst part about how you just explained that is going back to my whole [ __ ] around and find out personality I want to go and step in the portal where are we going we going to the Fairy Land are we going to Avalon where the hell are we going if we're going to hell at least I'll be serving martinis and it'll be warm and you don't like it to be cold I hate the cold get this shell not only can you stay here because it's currently an Airbnb it's for sale oh [ __ ] can we need to pull our money woman all right how do we get how do we get a patreon going so that we can we can buy this right we need to buy this and then have all sorts of haunted experiences there and seances and Tarot parties oh it would be absolutely glorious but it was originally for sale for 4 $ 44,4 44 okay tell me why because obviously there's a reason for that it's an angel number and I believe it has something to do with success but we're four people of course it's success it's my birth number right both of us have the birth number of four and it was $444,500 in Troy New York so if you want to look it up on Zillow I'll put a link in the uh show notes to make it easy for you and Troy fun fact is on the edge of the ader deck mountains yes it is very very near to Massachusetts and beautiful if you like trees beautiful oh it's gorgeous the historic Troy I guess is is a very pretty small town and it's also very near to where the headless horsemen rooms now what year was the house built I've seen two different things one I've seen it was built in 1890 and I've also seen that it was built in 1919 so I'm not exactly sure what does Zillow say one second they have to tell you the truth on Zillow 1890 Zillow says 1890 the current owner her family has owned it since 1919 when her grandfather purchased the building and renovated it and they had come from Bavaria I wish my family bought some badass house and passed it down through 90 generations and then I was like the 91st generation to live with all my ancestral ghosts right so her grandfather Fredrick fail purchased the building in 1919 and he was very wealthy in the area and he frequently had supper club meetings so he would have I guess kind of like fancy upscale bar and dinner ah I gotcha rich people stuff rich people stuff at the time he even hosted an Infamous Bootlegger a mobster of the Hudson Valley named Legs Diamond and in that era he probably did seanes and had Ouija boards more than likely it was pretty popular at that time and Legs Diamond was again A notorious mobster who also died in the capital region which is right in the same area while awaiting to go on trial in Troy New York so he was often in the house and it said that his ghost is seen there frequently she says there's about nine ghosts in the house three men in the basement her grandfather and her son who unfortunately passed away at 18 of cancer is she related to all of them or the three people in the basement just randos there are a lot of randos she's related to several people in the house but not all of them well you can't be spooked by that they're just your relatives she does say that none of the ghosts in the house are malicious even the gangster that comes through is pretty tame however all right so let me tell the whole story so it's owned by a woman named Michelle Bell and it was her grandfather that came in in 1919 and and redid the whole house and moved his family in that's the grandfather she says is still there Michelle says that there was a woman named Shirley living on the second floor at the time when Michelle's mother was living on the first floor and her health was failing for some reason Shirley came home from work on a Friday night and instead of going to her second floor apartment for some reason she went to the basement door that's located on the first floor and for whatever reason she was either pushed or fell and died at the bottom of the steps in the basement I bet you pushed that's what the family thinks and they don't know why she was there there was absolutely no reason for her to go in the basement so they're not really sure why she was even on the first floor or trying to get into the basement and they've actually had seances in the house and have tried to speak to Shirley to find out what happened they've had a couple films that were done there in the basement and the attic and had paranormal investigations through the whole house so they see quite a few different things including the woman Shirley uh in the basement a paranormal group called unrefined out of Albany New York came to the ensin house this year actually and went through the whole thing with Michelle uhhuh what they find they went down into the basement and tried to talk to Shirley they used a Spirit Box to try and get answers from her and they actually caught quite a few EVPs they were in the basement and one of the first questions they asked was if Shirley was present with them and you can hear a female voice say you betcha oh wow and then then uh one of the other EVPs they got was when they asked her what her last name was and she replied Russell I don't know if that was confirmed or Not by Michelle they asked Shirley who pushed her and she said steps maybe she tripped down the steps that's kind of how I thought of it too but several people several other psychics that have been there they do feel that she was pushed and one psychic even said she felt that Shirley was pulled which I don't know kind of L to me again that she fell but they did get quite a few EVPs from a woman's voice in the basement and she's a commonly seen ghost there the basement is so haunted and people get such an eerie feeling when they go down into it that Michelle keeps it locked and doesn't usually allow anyone in there oh wow it's an Airbnb so you can stay there and one guest that stayed there said that he woke up in the middle of the night and um next to him in the bed was an indentation as if someone was sleeping there and it was warm oh weird that's weird and of course there's the usual Poltergeist activity of items moving around the house people will leave something on a table and it'll show up in a different room Michelle says that there is a portal in the basement and it's the basement itself is filled with ghosts people that live in the house often can't leave including again her son who unfortunately passed away Nikki her grandfather her mother she says that when her mother was passing in the house an orb came through the room like shot through the bedroom and then came to Michelle and like hovered over her heart and she knew that it was her son's Spirit coming to help Usher her mother to the other side oh wow I mean to me that would be super cool but to a normal person I am not normal we've established that like 68 episodes ago that could be freaky but but I had kind of a almost similar experience and it kind of made it easier you know obviously you've been there through everything I don't know if you remember when my aunt died might have been around 2004 and I had to make a trip to Washington DC and myself my father and my stepmother were in a hotel room you know I'm a I'm a bad girl I'm a little on the smokey Smokey and you know even though I was an adult I was still with my dad like I ain't G to smoke I don't even smoke cigarettes in front of my dad okay right no and he's scary and I'm starting to get [ __ ] from freaking AARP and I still won't smoke in front of my dad I would be like oh you know I'm gonna go out in the parking lot and call and check on the kids I mean I did don't get me wrong I did call and check on my kids while smoking a cigarette haa and some weed ha I remember I was sitting at this hotel they had like a swing bench and it was right next to a little creek and you know my aunt died unexpectedly uh she was not ill she just out of the blue actually had a brain aneurysm so it was kind of tragic and unexpected and I just remember crying on that Bunch there was a moment where I felt like and we've talked about my grandpa he is the reason I can't sleep with my feet uncovered thanks yeah his ghost likes to sit next to you or on you right in bed come on don't be so creepy but I felt like as I was on this bench next to the creek I felt like my grandpa sat down on one side of me and my aunt sat down on the other side as you are aware I've had multiple interactions with my grandfather over the years um who passed away when I was 10 actually I think you've seen my grandpa and him being there when her spirit sat on that bench when I was down for her funeral I kind of felt like okay you're with Grandpa now and I've had a lot of interaction with Grandpa in the Years since he's died so it almost seemed more okay yeah and I almost felt like they both were telling me it's okay I love when they come back and do that I mean obviously because of the type of spiritual [ __ ] I'm into I am prone to have those interactions so you know I almost half expected my aunt but I didn't expect my grandpa and it kind of was a like a hug like a ghosty hug yeah kind of like don't cry guy we know you're upset but it's okay and I'll never forget being on that bench just swinging and it felt like he sat down on one side and her on the other side that's a beautiful memory it is and I think most of the memories here for Michelle are beautiful as well except for the odd ghost in the basement and whatever it was that caused Shirley to fall to her death and part of the reason she used fours all fours is she said it's the Angelic number for protection so that's why she made the selling price off fours and she had originally said she wasn't going to change the price what is it now now it's 350,000 we can do it we could do that feel free to donate to Lea and shell buying a haunted house in Upstate New York and then you could come visit us for tarot readings and ghost hunts right hey we might even let you put up a tent in the backyard right but she says that um in the basement there's this portal she says it's like a portal or a doorway to another dimension and she feels that it's it's thought to provide access for entities to enter our world and that it could be spirits of people who have lived there before or they could be something else Al together and she says that some researchers believe they could be otherworldly beings From Another Dimension she's had ghosts photographed there orbs photographed there people see shadow people in the house and in the yard and she says although most of the ghosts are friendly she says they do react strongly to people that they don't like if they don't don't like you as you go through the house people will feel pushed or shoved and sometimes even like pinched and she did have an offer for that $444,500 [Applause] accepted and were about to buy the house and clothes on it when this happened and because of the haunting they backed out and did you know shell that in New York state if you buy a house that's haunted they have to tell you oh yeah oh yeah I do know that full disclosure I did know that there was a court case in 1991 stambovsky versus akley also called the Ghostbuster ruling because there was a house in nyak that was up for sale a person from New York City was going to buy it but they didn't know that there were Poltergeist on the property once they found out they wanted to resend the offer they were told they had to legally go through with buying the house so they took them to court and said they shouldn't have to buy the house because it was haunted with Poltergeist and they won so there is the Ghostbusters ruling if you ever try to buy a house in New York and that's how they backed out so the husband I guess was the ghosts were not not fond of him and they pushed him off the stairs so he backed out of the house under the Ghostbusters ruling in New York state I just got to put in here that on the list of [ __ ] things about New York State this has to go on the only in your state New York I think other states have something like you said a lot of times they do have to disclose if a house is haunted I have bought I have bought and sold a house um in in in New York and yeah like when I bought my house oh by the way we just want to let you know there's no spiritual activity here and I'm like damn and by the way I'd also like to point out they lied I wasn't the only person living in my house just saying when I sold my house I had to sign an affidavit and I put that it was awesome yeah because you had experienced it so you might as well tell the truth my my children um my adult children now will even uh back me up on the fact that there are some early 1900 children and a kind of angry lady in the kitchen with long dark hair wow it sounds like Michelle had kind of grew up in this house and she experienced Spirits her whole life in this house yeah but even her parents grew up there and her grandparents exactly great grandparents apparently with some of this access to spirits and and with being with her mother who passed and her son unfortunately who also passed she has become a um a death Shaman a death Warrior or a death Doula oh wow how cool so she helps people through that process which is an absolutely amazing thing I mean and can be a blessing for people it can be she is also a playright she's written a play a screenplay called a son's gift that won quite a few Awards and she actually is having um an event at the house oh my God back to two peas in a pod my haunted house is opening for the first time since before the Rona tonight so may 26th and 27th she's having Laura sheldrick an emotion code expert come and speak at the house so they're going to talk about energy healing and emotional Wellness uh but she also does you know tarot events and paranormal events at the house she had the ha sisters there wow and several other so if she lives there you can't you can't do like an overnight no she's not there now and the house is still available as an Airbnb oh hell yeah but while her mother was living in the house um they had caregivers come in but she says they had 13 caregivers because after a while the Poltergeist activity and the ghost activity that they would experience they couldn't stay in particular usually on the first night that they had to stay over they would get so spooked by the different things that would happen that they would have to leave 13 Shores down to the power number four just [Laughter] saying I didn't even think of that right but um the attic is also creepy there's orbs everywhere there's three men that are unaccounted for that are usually in the basement but people have also reported seeing uh Shadows of three men in the backyard so I'm not sure who they are but maybe they're related to the gangster Legs Diamond right so I don't know but again nine Spirits in this house and the activity is everywhere I want to go to the portal want to check out the basement as well so you can stay there it is on Airbnb you can do ghost hunts there she does have quite a few different events there as well that she advertises on the Facebook page and we should stay there sh it's not too far from you now a spiritual tip for all of our listeners who are into the witchy Wilderness stuff if you encounter a portal and you want to walk through it I'm all for [ __ ] around and find out but make sure you tie yourself to the real world don't forget that piece don't forget that I I would do that and walk through the portal [ __ ] around and find out but I would not do it without tying myself to this reality there you go there's my witchy tip for the day so what kind of story have you got for me because I about to get into this uh powdered runs and I know I'm not going to be able to maintain a storyline couple things with my story actually weird first of all I got intrigued by this by a Facebook post interesting interesting people still go on Facebook people our age do you don't but other people I am on even though I'm not living in New York at the time I still follow I think it's like haunted history Trails of New York is the page they do cool haunted stuff all over New York do you know Facebook posts blah blah blah I came across this and I first of all was intrigued because you know I am a sucker for a castle absolutely a haunted one bring it even better I have spent my whole childhood every summer well into my adulthood and I'm actually going there in July in the Thousand Islands region it's like happy place it is my happy place and this is from Mexico New York which is considered in the Thousand Islands region um Mexico New York is on the shores of Lake Ontario I would basically say it's pretty much near Watertown New York to give you a frame reference okay this place is called Casey's Cottage oh okay so a cottage a little one but it's not really like a cottage per se it's like it almost you'd think it was like a shack now a lot of these houses we talk about are like the grand old Mansions big houses most of these haunted places tend to be bigger houses you're tell me this is a Shack oh okay that's no Shack that's big but still like a like log cabin like yeah very Rustic Log Cabin looking Shack looking but it's very large well done oh wow carvings on the wood on the inside walls weird stained glass they even have a freaking suit suit of armor from the outside you're kind of like huh things that make you go huh yeah it's very eclectic looking almost like church looking Windows the suit of armor in the front entryway but like half barn and half hunting lodge yeah outdoor fireplace outdoor weird carved statues no it's a carved statue of a one-handed boxer okay I don't know how I feel about that but okay here we are and then they have a a carving of a very Dow looking maid with a serving tray and an apron looks pissed yeah she looks like a grandma she looks so fed up right very weird you can see I know our listeners can't see but Google it it's very interesting I love those little bed Nooks with the curtains and like you close the curtains in your little beds like your own private little area I love that from some angles it almost has that Towery looking look to it yeah it's quite large you know it's like three stories on one side what's with the medieval influence okay I'm going to get to that in a second this place was Orville hung hungerford's elegant Mexico Point Clubhouse built in 1906 okay you know Lush Lawns yeah like a really rustic Boys Club sure I could see that all I can think of is like a sleepover golf country club yeah kind of looks that way like a rustic medieval cabin Club place now it wasn't like really medievally then in 1906 that didn't come about until later on so we'll get to that in a minute guests were met at the train station in Mexico which is funny because my father as a kid used to take the train from my hometown New Mexico but they were picked up at the train station and brought to the the clubhouse by hor drawn carriage you know no cars back then what they did was after cars were invented they took the carriage house because obviously with hor drawn carriages they need a place to store the horses and the carriages when they're not you know once automobiles came not necessary for that they turned the carriage house into a medieval manor house known as Casey's Cottage so Dr William Casey and his close friend severan Bishoff decided that they were going to do this conversion to a medieval manor house they say it was a work of love it was like a place of beauty friendship um companionship good conversation oh so they turned the carriage house into a clubhouse no they took their little click from the clubhouse and made like a click Clubhouse in the Carriage House so there's still the big Clubhouse but now there's like a more Elite Clubhouse in this Cottage that used to be the carriage house they were too cool for the bigger group and created an offshoot smaller tit for their little private clubhouse right that not all kids right the cooler kids so they would do like parties and and like they would have um back then they would do they still had some Vaudeville entertainers they would bring in like Vaudeville entertainers and stuff so they kind of made it like a like a friend hangout for a small group of friends well then it became property of the Mexico Point State Park so actually it is and I believe it is still now yeah it is under the ownership of New York State at this point part of the state park right probably means you can't stay there now well they do do stuff you can rent it we should rent it we should rent it you know they say that they'll rent it out to businesses clubs organizations that want meetings rehearsal dinners for weddings small weddings showers family gatherings I want to go rent it for the day just for the sake of yeah like for real but they do do some spooky tours because let's get to the spooky part of this we talked about early 1900s when we when it was built and we talked about present day where it is owned by New York state parks uhuh the in between the good stuff the meat and potatoes here what happened so it gets renovated that that place gets renovated to the mid Med eval style Manner and this guy Dr William Casey was obsessed with 11th century England why the 11th who knows that's where Cod of armor oh that's where all the decor comes from was his 11th century Obsession right because he was trying to like convert it into like an 11th century half wood half Stone Castle okay kind of got that looked down him and his sovereign friend I don't know I'm not judging but probably back in the day they were probably romantically involved but Society wasn't down with that so they were best friends I hear you they lived there would hold these parties like lovers do unfortunately Mr Casey Dr Casey died in 1978 a a lot of these parties were like in the mid to late late 60s and then early to mid 70s so imagine that type of party atmosphere in this kind of like an 11th century and that is quite a large building they could have had a lot of people there for the parties I mean was Alton John there like Freddy Mercury that's what I thinking Hugh Hefner right so he dies and I don't know what ever happened to severon but the cottage stood abandoned for many years after 1978 when he died New York State took it over and that's when it was renovated and opened to the public but unfortunately during the time it was abandoned you know how people are they would break into it be bad people but then people would go in there because they were hearing rumors that when the people that would go in and vandalize things would move they'd hear things oh apparent someone they wouldn't say who they are because they were a douchebag Vandal they were going in to spray paint the inside of the house and they claim that the couch was moved from one side of the room to the other oh no [ __ ] in this person insisted that they were the only person there and alone damn that would be scary word on the street you know Upstate New York everybody knows everybody and if you know it everybody knows it so word on the street started that this abandoned house is haunted so then people were going into it for the sake of I'm going to go break into the abandoned house and see what I see well at least they're not vandalizing anymore right they experience cold spots a feeling uneasy feeling of being watched now my opinion is there are two feelings of being watched one is like hey somebody's looking at you in one like ghosty stalker what the [ __ ] yeah they were probably the most common but some have heard faint sounds of organ music because you know probably in the late 60s early 70s that's like when those Electronic Organs keyboard things were coming oh yeah sure probably pretty popular I'm sure there was all sorts of Music being played there Rowdy 70s party now your favorite thing in all the world orbs orbs hell yes now they say that in the main area that they see white and light blue orbs but when they go down into a very deep dark corner of the basement that the orbs are more red and orange interesting I don't know enough about orbs I thought they were all white I'm wondering if there's like a an emotional tinge to this you know like the lighter colors like white and blue indicate more of a peaceful energy and red is angry yeah red and orange is angry or stronger energy I'm not sure you know the whole disembodied voice is heard um people report feelings as though someone was physically touching them they have seen apparitions of a young woman not only have they seen her but they have heard her crying for help she is allegedly uh the spirit of a lady that was buried under a tree like I said this is right on lake onario so she was buried under a tree near the lake which is technically on the prop property of this place oh wow I don't get this they talked about fast moving apparitions what are there slow ones medium ones and fast ones I didn't realize there was fast moving ones they explain it as they've seen some apparitions darting across the cottage like I said furniture moving on its own and then I don't know there's got to be some Fay activity because things like keys and stuff like that just like will mysteriously be gone and then will turn up in places that those people know 110% there's no way I could have put it there I've stayed in houses that have very similar activity so yeah but it's really weird when it happens they say this would this would freak me out because in my mind it's it's a a physical danger they have had cases where candles just jump off the shelf oh wow now that is not cool no no um they have had sightings of a young girl um they're not sure if she was someone who was on the property around the time it was built because it seems like the people who owned it were single men who like to party you know what I mean yeah sounds like it was definitely a party house I never could find the story about the woman buried under the tree or the girl buried under the tree I don't know where she came from or who she was think that the fact that there's a couple women on the property but yet only men have lived there that's weird I don't know the thing about this house is they've done ghost hunts here they've had a medium come in all of the ghosts don't want people there every one of them had the get out now no way I'm sorry but if a ghost clearly says get out now unless I was sent there specifically to cleanse the house I'm probably going to get the [ __ ] out they had hired a medium this medium had come from Watertown which is the closest big city and through the medium they basically said this is our house you are not welcome here and you need to leave damn the medium had expressed that the reason the house had stayed abandoned all that time is because that's what they wanted the ghost didn't want anyone there they don't even want visitors apparently this is our house close business so still are people still getting that kind of message yeah oh wow so I told you that you can rent it out for wedding small wedding you know rehearsal dinners blah blah blah yeah we're GNA rent it and go check it out right they do ghost hunts and guided tours but it is limited to six people a group and it is available by reservation and appointment only the bummer is their website will not tell how much you have to basically call to inquire I see but they're not going to charge you $1,000 to walk through and hear their stories but you know it could be 40 50 bucks who knows no overnight though and that is where I'm kind of almost half disappointed and that's why you win this week because your place you can do overnight yeah the enland house has overnights you can rent it or buy it and I just want to point out if you're going to a haunted place where the ghosts don't want you there if you're getting married there first as soon as you're done getting married hire a divorce lawyer and then second don't complain when I say I told you so exactly yeah so I definitely win because you can stay there and have a lot of fun disappointed yeah I'm disappointed you can't stay overnight I mean those little bed Nooks look fun and we all know that the witching hour is when all this stuff comes out I mean come on this [ __ ] ain't happening at two in the afternoon right it's 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. when you're going to get your really good Paranormal Activity and I want to know which is why I want to be there overnight why don't they want anybody there whose ghost is it that's like get the [ __ ] out everybody that's the thing it's like I never found any like trauma stories here was a thought I had though IID watched a YouTube video on the place because a lot of the New York state parks that have um historic buildings and stuff New York state has like a caretaker person so I had found a YouTube video about this place and they interviewed like the caretaker lady she just thinks that this is all whoy what the caretaker doesn't believe any of it she you know how there's people that even when they see it they don't believe it oh yeah I'm not trying to make assumptions here and I'm not judging if I had to guess and put money on what maybe religious persuasion she is I would definitely not put her as a spiritual spiritually inclined person okay yeah some people are so close-minded that they will have a logical explanation even when there is no logical explanation to be had I did read a review online where they felt like when they paid for the guided tour that she was begrudgingly almost reading from a script oh no and if she's going to be the one that takes us on the ghost tour I wouldn't want to do it because that kind of negative energy in some places can be enough to completely throw things off make it worse yeah but the thought I had going back to the thought I had I didn't find any you know nobody got shot you know nobody jumped out of the second floor window you know there was like no trauma stories nobody's asked them who they are nobody's gotten you know it sounds like they've gotten some pretty good connection with the spirit there enough to be like told forcefully get out and we don't want you here did they get any kind of name or any feeling or indication of of who they could be here's the [ __ ] of it you know when you are dealing with an owner or a caretaker or you know the main person you're dealing with and they think it's crack of [ __ ] to begin with you can only do so much because you're like fighting the current you're fighting the current you know what I mean so maybe they're just like yeah it's haunted blah blah blah okay got to go you [ __ ] I wonder if there was a different employee there if and here's the other thing maybe they don't like her maybe the spirits don't like her so they don't want anybody there yeah maybe they don't like the caretaker maybe it's not the visitors maybe it's it's just the caretaker they don't like I'm wondering if New York State hired a new individual for that particular post if maybe some of the experiences would be different I imagine you know if you had somebody there that was more in tune with those energies and was more receptive to that you know it very well could have a you know a beneficial effect for the ghost hunting tours they go through hey I got a great idea I got a son in his mid 20s who would be down with that New York State hire my kid and he will be the caretaker of Casey's Cottage you know I'd almost be tempted to go and be like you know hey we want to hire it for a reception for the day and then just go in and do our own investigation without having a guided tour you know right so I am disappointed because I feel like there could be potentially a lot more positive ghosty activity at this location but they're being repressed by the human that is running the place very well could be interesting well too very interesting how is today in New York state you there's so many haunted places all across the area I still can't believe that we both picked New York and didn't even know it because if if if people have forgotten like Lila and I do not tell each other what we're gonna do ahead of time you know we just we just get on Zoom and off we go we're like oh I'm doing this oh I'm doing that so like we don't plan this and it works out cosmically and this enland house did not come from my list actually uh this popped up as I was kind of searching around looking for something to do for this week you know I got intrigued by the different stories that were here people who have stayed there all having Eerie experiences and and so I started looking into it I didn't have any clue that it was a New York state when I first started looking it's just kind of fun mine came from late night Facebook scrolling but what caught my eye was how it looked and the fact that it was a haunted New York State Park yeah and it's right near one of your favorite favorite places so how could you go wrong there which I'm going there soon and I was like hey maybe I could stop by you know our haunted tour of America is getting pretty long sh we should really get that RV or that schoolie and start our trip now we talked about some sexy ghosts some weird I really think everybody out there do yourself a favor if you need a good laugh if you're sad if you're depressed if you're down in the dumps go to Google and Google Google married a ghost you will not be disappointed because the story I told you was only one of many oh my we had our we forgot the 6969 stories nice and we did our haunted tour of New York so I think I need to smoke a little bit more lay in bed and melt into my pillow and start dreaming of what I'm going to do for 70 oh my God 70 so
