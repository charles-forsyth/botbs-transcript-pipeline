episode 19 you say wow wow we're like almost to 20 we've done good we've done good so Roberson Museum I I I wanted to tell you some stuff I found out and some personal stuff that that happened to me um at this location okay before you do that let's do a quick introduction I forgot about that I know that's okay it's witchcraft [Laughter] [Music] hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends shell on the east coast and Leila on the west coast tell each other spooky Tales of True Crime and ghostly hauntings each week and smoke weed while we do it I'm Leila went really really high really really high I am really really high I'm Lea and I am really really high yeah and I'm really really high today and I'm sh hi sh well you know we're recording on a Monday right after a weekend and I think we both really needed to get high we did we did like this was a weekend that you needed a Monday off to get high on kind of oh my goodness yes so much let me tell you it is like warm on the East Coast I know that your idea of warm out there is different and nobody cares nobody likes California to but here in the east coast today it is like 70 degrees it is like the beginning of May 70 degrees this is like the most delightful day I bet it's gorgeous and you had mentioned that you're back in our old stomping grounds you're in central New York I am I am I am actually in our old Meetup town it's the Southern Tier silly we're in the southern right that's Central Southern Tier I apologize New York has so many different distinct sections we have so many tiers all we know is we are not New York City that's all we know so I'm recording today from upstate New York W woo and and my story today is from my hometown and I'm going to talk about a place that I am literally like five miles from and I'm excited I cannot wait to hear it because I know that this is a place that I heard about I met you in this town and when I first moved here I heard about this haunted Roberson Museum and when I met you you had had experiences there and I knew so many of our friends that had experiences there this is one of those places that's definitely a HomeTown Hot Spot absolutely you know even if you look up haunted places in Upstate New York it is one of the uh one of the hot spot listed places it just happens to be in our hometown or in my hometown that's all I love it though I love our friendship's hometown the hometown of our friendship our OG location the OG location oh I love that and there were so many places around there there was the mafia house there was the Asylum there there's the cemeteries the Native American girls Cemetery there's so many places in that area we already talked about Devil's elbow in a weo y y you know really I think the deal with Upstate New York is because there was so many Native American tribes and then some of the earliest Americans um that came that or the earliest folks that came to America um came to portions of New York State um so there there's just a lot of history and history creates hauntings in my opinion it really does seem to yeah it really does history creates hauntings and that's why I always say that the east coast is the best coast just because there's more history here and the more history the more hauntings I think maybe that's why I've run into more True Crime out here not that there aren't as many hauntings because they are around but a lot of the more famous ones do seem to be on the East Coast or maybe I'm just not as good at looking for them but but they're they all seem to be tied to places whether on the East Coast or out here on the western half of the US you know there's the wh house there's the the Remington Mansion it's it's the different places that seem to record and hold on to these events and feelings so the more the more events that a place has the more chance it has to be haunted or have some type of some type of ghostly recording well and I also think that um when you when you dive into some more oddly paranormal Hollywood Legends some of that's going to be associated with the more things that happen at a location the more active that location becomes because some freaky decky stuff has happened in Hollywood over the years let's face it that's very true and I'm sorry I'm very high and I have to pause and because I was packing my bong while you were talking and remember I told you this it's so pretty shell I have to share I love you it is though I love you too but look how pretty sh can you see those little dark spots that's like the purple it's so beautiful yeah like you break into this light green and I mean some of the purple shows through on the outside but it really comes through when you break into it and you can really see how I hate to say it but I would have probably stuffed that whole nugget in my pipe as it but it's so resiny if you stuff a nug in there they are and if you don't break it up it doesn't light very well and I don't I don't like it so I like to break it up kind of like uh Lisa an our past guest was talking about her baklava layered pack yep yep y I am nowhere near that artistic so I guess I'm between you on the one end of just shoving it in and her being very artistic and perfect on the other end I'm somewhere in the middle I do like to break it up and make it fluffy and then I kind of pack it in lightly so it burns really nicely it just gives me a better smoke and it lasts longer I just can't get it to burn well if I just shove the whole Nug in there I go back and forth on the grinder thing sometimes I'll use the grinder consistently like if I'm using my Chillum obviously I have to use grinder because you can't really pack a Chillum with anything other than right ground up cuz like today I'm smoking back out of my silicone pipe that I love I love this thing like it can't get clogged I see those more and more I cannot wait to get one and try I want to try a silicone bong you know how bad I am at clogging pipes you're so bad you were going to tell us how it cleaned have you cleaned it yet I haven't had to that's how awesome it is by the way no way I mean I've probably had this what like a month month and a half and it you haven't had to clean it yet no wow that's impressive that was totally worth $9.99 I'm just saying nice I'm liking the new silicone stuff but uh yeah so sorry about the tangent I just think the problem is is that we both got good weed today it's just we both got good weed on the opposite spectrums I normally get your kind of weed I nor get your kind of weed where I'm kind of like oh mellow and hey today I just got that like zoomi Zoom weed where you just want to chat and clean you know what's funny what is that there are people out in the world that are getting a kick out of listening to you and I hang out and smoke weed to all of our listeners out there if as you've known throughout some of these episodes I'm the instigator of good Adventures trouble so I got a fiveyear plan they always say Make A Five-Year Plan you follow us for the whole five years and damn it we're going to have like a Leila shell Festival we always wanted to do a festival that would be amazing like the Lela shell paranormal Festival some place really cool yeah okay oh paranormal weed festival oh yeah that would be excellent what we could do is we could go to your biggest like scary place in the world will take you to an asylum for the weekend because you hate them I do hate those we will bring a [ __ ] ton of weed with us and we will just Ghost Hunt and get high and broadcast live and like bring a group of like 20 friends with us okay that is a good way to get me to go to an asylum bring a lot of weed bring some ghost hunting equipment so I can get as many orb photos as I want and some of our crazy listeners and some crazy listeners how fun would that be oh my gosh just get high in an asylum all weekend and hope we all make it out Al we would have to take a roll call at the beginning at the end and be like all right what happened to Joe where did Joe go but what happens if we take a roll call at the end and we end up with more people than we started with and they come with us the [ __ ] like I'm sorry the weed's all gone just stay here we don't have anymore because we are definitely not [ __ ] around and find out type of people we would not be taking Ouija boards with us no no Ouija boards to the to the haunted Asylum I'm pretty sure we established that as a cold hard rule right from episode one we we know much better than that our listeners not so much because we've asked for some stories from our listeners and we have again gotten a great response so if you wouldd like to be included in our your Stories episode please send us in your personal experiences but I've read a couple of them that involve Ouija boards and man they are [ __ ] around and find out people because some of them should listen to you shell they should know better and they don't they don't well you know the problem is is they sell them at Target that's the problem yes when you get your Target brand we Bo you're gonna get a Walmart brand demon is that what you're saying here I am saying that like if you if you want to get the Crum D crumb of ghosty [ __ ] don't be buying it at Target like I love Target like I am not bash and Target as a corporation I swear I'm there like three times a week it's an obsession but not for like Ouija boards come on people you live in the world of Amazon I love how you're like don't do Target Amazon is where it's [Laughter] at but no there's Etsy there's local shops buy yourself a buy a good one is what you're saying bu bu not a mass-produced spiritual divination item not a produced and and if you are blessed enough to be in the Northeast unlike yourself because the east coast is the the best coast obviously if you are blessed enough to be in the Northeast there are places in downtown Salem Massachusetts that make these like handcarved hand painted these are like awesome not to mention there's also a um Ouija board Museum in Salem which definitely a good stop to make we will have to do an episode all on Ouija boards and people's experiences with Ouija boards because those are some interesting stories for sure all the way from handcrafted to Parker Brothers right but definitely go to your local shop if you want to get a Ouija board or any type of tool for your magical adventures or your ghost hunting Adventures go to a local shop find something handmade find something local at least it's going to have a better story or you know if you're all craft you could make your own you could don't they do that in some of the um the Ouija like the horror movies with the Ouija boards they have the glass and the cutout letters that always struck me as a bad idea actually I saw I I was watching a movie not too long ago because from our time with We All pod down here I I've been starting to explore some off the toop shelf scary movies they inspired me they definitely have some good choices if you're someone who likes horror movies and you're and you're not sure exactly what to watch or you want something different than the mainstream horror movie check out we all pod down here their podcast they have some great horror movies that they've reviewed you can certainly find something you like there absolutely but I I saw in one of these movies someone took a paper towel and a Sharpie marker and used the donut a donut a donut yeah as the planet yeah it's the planette they wrote all the letters yes no on a paper towel the Sharpie marker and then used a donut as a planet proof that where there's a will there's a way that reminds me of as a baby Stoner using an apple to make myself a pipe I mean Ingenuity right all I can think of is like go kitchen witches you just making mountains out of M Hills here people mountains out of mle Hills or demons out of bounty I don't know the quicker demon picker uper so what are you smoking today because you just keep hitting that bong like it's just a bong full of happiness and I want to know what's in it is a bong full of happiness I have reached for the top shelf oh you don't always do that I don't I'm a little too Frugal and I do like my homegrown a little bit too much you know it's nice just to have a nice stash here and smoke on that but every once in a while you want something different so I I did go for the top shelf and it's called bakio gelao oh I'm not sure how to pronounce that it looks Italian gelato is Italian right I'm assuming it's some sort of play on gelato probably is it gelato or gelao I don't know how no gelato just gelato bakio gelato it's delicious taste like gelato it does it tastes like heaven in a little nug it is sweet it has a really sweet rich flavor and these buds are so cute they're like green and crystally on the outside but when you break it open it's like deep purple on the inside oh so good oh how beautiful they are gorgeous they're resiny they're gorgeous and The Taste is delicious and the high is just fantastic is this like uh you got [ __ ] to do kind of high or nappy time high this is definitely nappy time high so if I forget what I'm talking about today it's it's the gelato fault for sure I probably should not be podcasting and smoking this weed because this is this is lay in the couch do nothing just hang out it said it's a it's an indicia dominant hybrid and even though I still think those are outdated classifications you can you can certainly feel that that strong indicia IND couches you know I would just like to talk about that for a second now you say that that's becoming outdated here's the problem when you are a pot snob such as yourself yes you like these terms it's like changing so quickly and I think legalization is making that change so quick old Stoners Like Me can't keep up with the change man just as we start getting like for any of these listeners who have listened to us since episode one they're G to be like shell has come Leaps and Bounds with using different words I know what sures are you know what a cultivar is I do but like just as I'm starting to barely get used to that IND sativa is outdated slow down people people slow down break that train a little bit I smoke too much weed for this much change I agree and I also completely disagree I'm not saying that what it's always been is right but it's just a lot of change real quick it is a lot and that's exactly what I agree with is that we do need to find some way to easily bring people to new classif to a more correct classification system especially because you and I talk about smoking to get high smoking to hang out with friends smoking to do housework smoking to be in the couch smoking for pain relief there are as many different people as there are there are different reasons to smoke there are legitimately different cultivars that will help you on your journey to whichever one of those results you would like and just saying hybrid or Inda or sativa not only isn't scientifically correct it doesn't really help you that much it's easy and it's simple and we need to start from there for sure so that we can carry people along without losing them you know there are classifications and I'll put one out there it's a little much to go into on the air but the emerald cup has come up with a cannabis classification system that's amazing and they have six different classifications Jackson Hayes tropical and floral OG's and gas sweets and dreams dessert and Exotics and they break it down really well on their website and and six is definitely more than three but I can get there post that link you go post that link on this episode right definitely I definitely will so people can take a look at that but what are you smoking on today I'm actually Smoking Dog Patch and I tried something I tried something that you told me you know once in a while I'll listen to you what' you try a lower TC oh wow shell what made you reach for a lower THC um ice let's be real yes wallets we we've talked about and and and everybody's heard of our suffrage is here about the whole $60 e business so this it was a Cinco de Mayo sale nice always hitting the sales gota get you so they had this one day Cinco de Mayo sale and I hit it up I was able to get e for 36 nice but only of certain cultivars nice nicely done nicely done I see what you did there using the words so I mean I did get a couple higher ones I mean let's not fool ourselves sure you are who you are I am who I am but this dog patch I got 28s of it and it's only 17.1 and I gotta say I almost feel like I'm literally just as high as the other stuff that's great I think you might have been on to something there on the old Switcheroo back and forth yeah there really is something to the Tarpin and how you know how everything works together so that's why I think we need to have a little bit better of a classification system and and a little bit better way to present it to people because there are people sh that just like to reach for that top shelf and I don't blame you it tastes great smokes great feels great why would you reach for something else except maybe when you need to save a little bit of money and then you need to talk to somebody who knows what they've got and can and can talk you into that 177% THC that you normally would have ignored exactly exactly and it's like even if you're just trying just more of the I just want to get high well you get kind of immune to that 34% if that's all you're smoking you know what I'm saying right right you have it up a lot it's like if you take too much of any type of medicine you take too much and then it just starts to not work as much so you got to maybe switch medicine or switch brand or switch dosage or a tolerance break or a tolerance break so maybe you might be on to something about you don't always have to reach for top shelf 100% of the time yep yep thank you thank you I'll take the win on this one thank you that's a good one no I'm really glad that I just like to point out that's a Leila win that is not a West Coast win well you know my stories have been racking up the winds lately so have to say keep dreaming and I you know this episode too episode 19 I have to say my story this week is also probably going to win it's very much a West Coast Southwestern story o interesting it has interestingly enough it kind of has ties to some other stories we've done the lady in white ghost story out of Texas and your Devil's elbow lady in white ghost story this is another similar type of lady in white this one is out of Mexico and her name is Laona o yes interesting she's very scary have you ever heard of her at all I have not I have not I just like the name I do too I first heard of her when I came out here uh from some people I had met here some of my Latina friends mentioned her to me because they know I'm into spooky kind of things and recently when I started researching it um I asked my kids to ask their friends if they have heard of it and some had and some hadn't so it's not super pervasive but it is something that that's pretty well known that's definitely a local Legend on some level exactly and it has and it has connections and roots to European Legends to goddesses to Ghost Stories all over the country has a lot of these do so what are you talking about this week sh well I actually am gonna take it back to uh the old Hometown today I am actually doing our show today from New York State I am I am still in the northe but not back in the old stomping grounds back in the old stomping grounds I am actually going to do a local story and we are going to talk about the Roberson Museum in downtown bingamon New York you have always loved the Roberson I have I have now haven't you had your own ghostly experiences in the Roberson I have I have so that was also part of the reason why I wanted to talk about Roberson today because it's also a partial personal experience so like I this Dog Patch stuff this dog patch stuff first of all it is a function smoke okay like you do stuff smoke you are get up like I I could clean a house right now and be good and keep smoking like this is not that's my favorite kind you you almost feel like you drank like some of those five hour energies nice I love gives me energy now what is it classified as Dog Patch um hold sure no wait that's not hold music that's like game show music I don't know hold music um okay let's see what it says hybrid oh okay see that's everything's a hybrid nowadays especially because we all want both we want the the body buzz and the mental High we all want the hybrid we just need a better system better classif classification system so we know for sure so like I don't even know what this is to be honest with you because it says hybrid but like what do like you say like what does that mean yeah is it a sativa dominant an indicia dominant what does that even mean what are the what are the flavors does it have a flavor hopefully it doesn't taste like dog you know this is the one time I would think you would hope that the weed doesn't taste like like its name right right but like what is dog pad see that's where I wonder like I could be the person coming up with these names just let me get really high on this [ __ ] and I give me 20 minutes and I will have a kickass name for you like who came up with Dog Patch like what is why Dog Patch I don't know I don't even know the origins of it you know maybe sometime uh when we talk about weed instead of focusing on what we're smoking on an episode what we should do is talk about the origin of what we're smoking where did it come from oh there you go well leafly.com is a good website to go to and I just looked up dog patch on Leafly and they don't know much about it either they said it's a hybrid and its flavor and Aroma is Woody yeah I'd say that yeah it's top effect they say is talkative and it did get a 4.3 out of five star rating and they said it's much more on the energizing they have a calming to energizing ratio and it's on the more energizing effect just like you said I totally agree with that totally like this this is like you got [ __ ] to do weed exactly and and Leafly says that their users report that the strain effects for Dog Patch are talkative energetic and happy yeah I'd go with that yeah they say the flavors are Woody apricot and Menthol does that sound about right um I do not I would Woody yes apricot and monal N not in what I'm smoking not so much no like not that I've ever smoked an apricot but I don't I'm not getting a fruity flavor like an apricot would suggest and I unfortunately as a cigarette smoker Please Don't Judge Me we don't on emails about my bad habits I do not smoke months and I do not like them and if there were definitely a monthall taste in I would pick it out in a second and I do not the the Woody yes but I'm only I'd only agree with the Woody flavor but that could just be batch to batch you know depending on when or where who grew it you might get slightly different results which is why I love places like leafly.com I just looked up my bakio gelato uhuh what is it mine is way more the calming to energizing scale mine is almost all the way down on the calming end and I was gonna say are you bottoming out over there yes definitely bottoming out this says that it's good for a late night session or a lazy day with minimal plans and that's exactly what I had said because it it does it it gives you your brain and your body both just very melty and and mellow and happy this has a 4.8 out of five rating on Leafly and the users say their feelings are aroused sleepy and euphoric for the strain effects oo I agree with that the strain flavors the top three were vanilla Berry and mint and I would agree with the vanilla I think all three of them because it does have that thick Rich vanilla flavor right just just hints of maybe the berry and and a little tiny bit of an a aftertaste of mint it's delicious I love this it's it's quite good that actually sounds delightful right something else that we should be able to swap back and forth yeah yeah absolutely I wish like we we need we need to definitely be scanning the news for some of these government updates because it'll probably go on the DL you know well with so much going on right now I'm hopeful that it doesn't get pushed to the back burner I think you know we should be able to focus on more than one thing at a time and they should just legalize this and and get it out of the way yeah all right so record scratch let's go back to the Roberson and tell me more about this America's or what what did you say somebody's top haunted place it is on the upstate New York haunted places in Upstate New York it's it's a website I don't know they come up with these I think every state has a website to be honest with you so Roberson Museum this is uh located in downtown Binghamton New York we love Binghamton we're glad we don't live there anymore but we still love to visit yeah it's a great place to visit there's a lot there um home of Rod Sterling by the way just want to put that out there oh yeah if you love The Twilight Zone I was born in the Twilight Zone I'm just saying so in Binghamton there's a Confluence of Two Rivers uh the Shenango River and the susuan and the Roberson museum is pretty much right at that Confluence and first and foremost separate from anything else I'm going to say I feel that there are energies it confluences like that um they're kind of like places where energy gathered if you want to just give it a witchy perspective for a second because this is like two big rivers in the region coming together merging the one River into the other bigger one there there is is an energy pull um I feel in those types of of locations I agree we've heard that before in other places that there's often running water nearby we've even talked to people who've mentioned different theories uh like the stone tape Theory and and different theories with different types of of stone running water that can create some sort of field or like you were said maybe a Confluence of energies there and the sasana river has its own history and its own I don't know yeah its own energy so that that's pretty powerful River in and of itself this is located pretty much where these two rivers come together and become one River and make the larger Susana River so there's that energy field going on to begin with this is a house that was built I want to say let's see let me see if I can get an exact date here I don't want to mislead any super Roberson fan because I think it was like 1901 Alonzo Roberson Jr acquired the land in 1904 and at the time of purchase he had already begun construction so he basically began construction on it so he started building the house first and bought the land pretty much you know that's how we do in New York I guess so try to do that now you know you just go to be like hey this plot of land looks nice I'll start building my house here and then I'll see if I can buy it I'm just gonna take it yeah so this is like a red and white brick building I don't know the easiest way to describe it to folks it looks like a mini white house but made out of brick okay that's a good description of It kind of that Colonial look yeah has columns yeah in the front it's got the the pillar things so there was this guy his name was Alonzo Roberson Jr and uh him and his wife acquired the land and built the house he was a carpenter and she was a school teacher this house Believe It or Not uh has 26 rooms in it okay hold on hold on this is starting to sound like an episode of House Hunters you know he was a carpenter she was a school teacher and their budget is 3.2 million what the hell they built a house 26 room rooms back in the early 1900s on a carpenter and a school teacher salary had 11 fireplaces 11 fire did he come from money like where did he get the money to do this I think that what it was um I I want to say his father had money and he got the money from his father oh so it's like family money so he came from money then yeah yeah but I mean because this had the raw Iron Gate and like the ra fences so it's got that like raw iron fence all around the whole thing I mean it's pretty impressive to look at obviously nowadays they've built a planetarium alongside it but when you look at the actual Mansion itself it's actually pretty damn impressive it's quite impressive and and particularly for the time I imagine it was huge it was probably considered one of the the best houses in the area they actually hired some like big wig Italian Renaissance style designer architect person to come and create it looks like it was totally finished in 1907 and like this place is like it is still right now today it pretty much looks exactly like it did in 1907 yeah barely changed it yeah it it's pretty impressive remember back in the day when you used to come and hang out at my house every night like think of me as like the Roberson's but I did not have as cool of a location I'm sorry your apartment over the garage was very very cool very cool it was but it was not the Roberson it was not the Roberson Museum but like these these folks did not have children um they were at that point unable to have children thus far the it was just the two of them why did two people need 26 first of all you gotta keep up with the Joneses I guess now there was actually a theater um built it is like as part of it I want to say it was like a 100 seat theater maybe the house they had the theater in the W house so they had one here in the Roberson 2o they did they did the pool of the early 1900s apparently so there's this like I don't know 150 uh seat theater next to the the house portion of it so fast forward Alonzo dies in 1934 he had wanted the house to become an education center for the community upon his death so he dies in 1934 in the house we'll start there because you know back then people pretty much died at home unless it was like war or you know things of that nature but like you didn't go to a hospital and die you died in your bed or on your couch kind of thing yeah there were no convalescent homes really you pretty much stayed home and were taken care of hopefully by family right so he dies in The Home 1934 and Mrs Roberson continued to live in the Mansion for almost 20 more years she didn't die until 1953 just her all alone in this huge 11 fireplace Mansion 26 rooms yeah wow um I never was able to find out if she died in the house or not but I'm gonna get to a personal story in a second which leads me to believe that I think she did but it could go either way it could just be an emotional attachment I've seen Mrs Roberson we'll get there but I am not able to find any documentation on one way or another her location of death it is alleged that Mr Rober person is still there and before I kind of get into some of the the other internet out there stories other people's stories I'm gonna go I'm G to start with my story on why I think these folks are there tell us a personal ghost story shell back in my younger days right around the time I had gotten pregnant for my first child actually a little bit before I met you if that tells you how long ago this was that was a little while ago so I was like 18 you know when you don't have kids you have these weird aspirations in life and I wanted to be an FBI investigator I stumbled upon this job I mean I was going to college but I was going to get a job that was going to lead me down that path so I found a job 18 years old third shift security guard at Roberson Museum sure if you want to be an FBI agent that's a good place to start while you're in college you know I just started college for criminal Justice I wanted to be basically what it was is I wanted to be clar E from Silence of the Lambs that was like my life goal so I want to be clar e I'm going to school that's kind of frightening show I know right that's scary so getting a job in security is an 18-year-old was going to be like my first step in a law enforcement lifelong journey I get this third shift security and I'm like who what how hard can this be being a security guard at a museum third shift it's closed what is going to be going on in this closed Place nothing easy job sounds like a great job to get high just walk around and look at all the cool stuff and I was 18 years old and I'm not gonna lie and say that that had never happened but not the topic of this story so you know I thought as a 18-year-old local I thought the worst thing I was going to have to deal with was maybe some of the homeless folks that live on the riverbank um right nearby uh wandering into the property and stuff and I I thought that would be my biggest issue and boy was I wrong because I I only ended up there for about a year and in the year that I worked there I encountered some things that I was too young and scared to encounter um you know the place generally uh because there is a theater like I said there's a theater attached to the house mansion portion might not have been originally but now it's kind of all one structure there' be times I'd work like 11 to 7 and they are the local theater company I can't recall the name of it at the moment but one of the local theater companies utilizes that for their their performances um their shows so there'd be times where I would go into work and there' still be some lingering people from the theater production and you know I'd have to get them out usually no later than midnight all lights off shut everything down and then kind of make grounds and you'd have to go around make sure doors are locked lights are off blah blah blah BL blah you know I lived in that town my whole life at that point 18 years and at 18 years old I knew everything everything you knew it all so you know you hear rumbling is and it was just more of a oh Roberson's haunted because it's old and I heard that when first move there and I I'll get into a couple of the specific uh haunting stories that are a little more recent than the original owners in a minute but these are things that people are just aware about it's not a big deal you know you don't hear of these outlandish ghost stories it's just kind of like oh yeah that place is haunted kind of thing so at 18 nothing's scaring me I'm gonna be an FBI agent you can't scare me you're Invincible right I mean I had a flash for God's sakes I was powerful I had a flashlight and a badge man that's all you really need a flashlight and a badge seriously uh my Talisman man I would go into the theater and and you know the theater company would be be walking out and they'd be like are you all right here and I'm like what do you mean am I all right here they're like okay well we're leaving how about we leave all the lights on while you w I'm like I'm good and like I wasn't understanding and one night the whole front row there's like two seats the way the room is set up that stand out is basically the two Center seats of the row and I noticed I'm like for the last couple nights There Was Roses sitting in those seats so me being the good security guard that I was I'm like oh why do they keep leaving these here and forgetting them so i' pick them up and throw them in the garbage uh oh uh oh sh I have oh no those were some sort of offering right I feel like those are offering tell me things why don't you tell me things like if I'm the security guard and there's a reason tell me so two three nights in a row I throw them away fourth night in a row I go you know they're still doing their production because I can't remember if it was like a week long or a two week long production but like they were there every night for x amount of time they're leaving but I I was doing other things and like after they locked up and and and shut everything down then I went to the theater the roses are there again same two seats I'm like what the hell is why are they leaving them here oh no because you know they're fresh roses it's obviously not something they're using for the production because it would be dead like like I basically I I'm ruling out that it's a prop and that somebody is mysteriously leaving these here and they need to be thrown out so I was tasked that every every hour I was supposed to do rounds and make sure everything was locked every hour which at 18 years old I didn't always do because I'm like nobody's been in here in an hour and there's motion detectors and none of them went off so obviously the doors are all still locked and I had some cameras and I'm like nobody's been on camera and none of the alarms went off and I'm the only one here and I know that door is still locked from 58 minutes ago so sometimes I wouldn't go every hour sometimes I go every three hours just because I was bored and to keep myself awake it's hard when you are alone and it's 400 a.m. and you still got a long haul till 7: a.m. this before there were cameras in every single room watching what you did you could probably take a nap at your desk and no one would notice but this was also before cell phones where I couldn't sit on my little cell phone the whole time right every every couple hours I would get up and walk around so my first set of rounds I threw the rose this is the fourth night now first set of rounds I throw the roses in the garbage then I go whatever two three hours later because I was not going on the hour I go two three hours l later now here's the problem I had smoked at work I was 18 I was dumb I do not promote people doing that but at 18 years old I didn't know any better so I go do my rounds a couple hours later and I'm like wait a second I could have swore I threw those Roses away a couple hours ago and I'm like well you know I got high at work and I shouldn't have done that and I probably think I did because that was yesterday and I didn't thre them away and I got super paranoid and didn't smoke another drop at work I freaked myself out it was a walk pretty much from where my security office was to the theater and like I felt like I was being followed back followed back I went back a second time and they were there again no [ __ ] even though I knew I threw them away the first time holy F so so what do I do stupid me throw them away again I mean one time maybe one time I'd be like wow maybe I'm so high I just thought I threw them away maybe I was thinking that was going to and I just didn't but I was getting scared several times you can't blame that on the weed anymore that's weird I was getting scared and I and I felt like I was getting followed then I stopped making rounds [ __ ] so then the fifth night I go to work and the theater people are still there did you ask about the Roses I'm like what is going I'm like I had the craziest are you guys sleeping flower they're like you're touching those I'm like well yeah throw them away every night and I said last night I think I was having a problem and they're like you don't touch those and I'm like why apparently nobody tells the new security girl Mr and Mrs Roberson had that Theater built because they loved theater performances that was a big thing back then and those were their seats and no one ever sat in those seats and after they died no one was ever allowed to this day no one is allowed to sit in those two seats and every performance a rose is left in each seat for Mr and Mrs Roberson they do not sell those seats and those two seats are not in the ticket count could you fill somebody in they could have told you you wouldn't have thrown away the Roses sounds like they got pissed by the fourth night basically I was pissing them off so then of course I never entered the theater again I would just as long as I knew that they had shut all the lights off and locked the door I never went in the theater again after that the whole time I worked there I figured you know what nobody's breaking in the problem was a couple weeks later I was starting to get camera movement what do you mean camera movement in an empty house exactly you know back back in the early 90s you know like closed circuit television like yeah security camera but they're all black and white there ain't no color to that [ __ ] back then so I had cameras that like I could see different parts of the museum for my office it would look like a person floating by but like a cloudy person like obviously it was not an actual human being who broke into the museum but it was definitely a person in what room any of them any of them this was a about a month after the Roses incident it would they would just start appearing in different rooms so what did they get comfortable with you at that point and then they just start they're like oh she's cool now and they started walking around I don't know I'm going to fast forward to a a more recent story story than the Roberson's so like I said Mrs Roberson died in like 53 it was getting turned into uh what the Roberson originally wanted they wanted it to be donated as a community center there's this gorgeous staircase it's one of those Wide Oak staircases that it goes up and then at the top it splits to the left and to the right I think I've seen pictures at the masquerade ball people getting their pictures taken on that staircase when they go there for like the New Year's Eve ball actually I had I have pictures of posted of me and my children at Christmas time in that stairwell oh very cool unfortunately a young boy fell over the railing at the top oh no essentially fell straight down and was a couple stories unfortunately did not make it oh no and he is also in that house oh that's sad here I am I won't go in the theater anymore because I pissed off Mr and Mrs Roberson apparently so so at this point I would only do my rounds in the actual house portion in the planetarium I loved going to the Planetarium probably the only part of that place that isn't haunted so I I stopped going to the theater and and and confined myself to the mansion piece I would hear that little boy giggling and running and I'd go up to the top of the stair and every time I'd get to the top of the stairs I would just be so sad so sad oh like you could feel the emotion still there yeah and if you were at the bottom of the stairs where he fell to all I can describe it as is like maybe like a two three foot in diameter circle that like the minute you even even the wood floor because you got to remember you know early 1900s this is all wood floors and everything um even the wood floor it goes from like normal to like ice Co like ice ice cold oh wow like that like that spot of impact is like so chilly so cold and it's almost like the little boy can't leave the area of the stairwell is my impression I was in that house as recently as last Christmas or was it two Christmases ago might have been two Christmases ago Co time is weird I know right what the museum does is every winter like a Christmas trees from around the world and they have a Christmas tree decorated from every country and so I have gone even though my kids are adults now we we've we hit that up sometimes on occasion I bet it's beautiful it is it actually is and it's a good time and and you know there's a a small entrance fee and that goes to keep the museum going it's all a good cause so me and the kids went we had a good time and I even went to that spot I'm like I wonder if it's still the same sure as [ __ ] man icicles wow I don't like that spot at the bottom but what it is is it's a all you can feel is the feeling of a tragic accident like the emotions were so strong you can still feel them that's so sad that is what really dominates I feel in my personal opinion it's it's the little boy plunging down the stair that that dominates the Mansion portion but the Roberson got that theater on lock man that's their space at least when I was there maybe it's because I pissed them off um but these these people you know there was some redecoration um going on because they they do different exhibits I mean there was still uh a sighting that I found online as recently as 2019 like I said I was there with the kids what happened in 2019 they were getting ready to do another exhibit change exhibits um where they kind of redecorate of sorts so there were people there doing things like after hours you know things always happen at night do ghosts not realize that daytime is when we're awake and alert and can really have better conversations and interactions I wonder does it have something to do with like the veil being thinner at night or something is it I don't know why so at night time there's people there night when normally there aren't right right usually this is kind of a not not open at that time of thing so this these people are there kind of changing the exhibits around after hours and all they keep hearing is a man on the second floor clearing his throat at this point there were no there were no visitors in the museum oh wow really right it was just like a group of like four people doing some stuff these four people were like all together in the same room so it's not like one of them like maybe went off and was like coughing down the hall or something there was only four people there and they were all together and they could hear a man clearing his throat on the second floor all of a sudden one of them was pointing so you know they have it kind of decorated originally they have it back to exactly how the um Roberson had it right down to their personal property um so there's a picture of Alonzo on the wall one of the one of the four people that were there pointed to the picture and kind of started laughing and said that that the guy in the picture was talking to him and trying to make funny faces really dang all of a sudden doors started opening and closing creepy there has been instances uh believe it or not where someone was actually told all they could hear was someone whispering in their ear telling they're being too loud were they in the theater it's almost like the the Roberson have rules and if you're not following them they're going to tell you even to this day so even after they were dead they still want their rules they still want things done their way and their rules followed oh wow there was a sighting um as recently as 2015 of someone saying they saw Alonso standing in the front door basically they described it as watching the world go by like these are people that aren't necessarily from Binghamton people who have been kind of tourists so to say why would a tourist go to Bingington New York but tourists so to say that don't know anything about this place other than it's a museum have said that they have seen sightings of a man that was wearing a West Point uniform wandering the Halls did Alonzo go to West Point that's what I haven't been able to find out because there's also been reports of a Native American mother singing to her child and there's been there's been reports of being able to hear children playing within the rooms I wonder if because of the location some of those some of those hauntings may be from another time they may be location related and not house related because remember back at the beginning the Confluence so if you are a Native American back back in the God knows what times that Confluence you're getting your water you're getting your fish your crops are going to grow right by the water like like those two rivers coming together was important to the natives and oh yeah there's a lot of settlements in that area you know it was a very rich area I think that some of it could definitely be location related but I do think the Roberson are there but I do believe that there is other things there that are land related structure related yeah I've heard Tales When I first moved there I was told that the Roberson was haunted by Mr and Mrs Roberson I I didn't know the Roses story until you told me that but I did know that they were they were frequent visitors to the theater and also that people that came to visit the museum would would usually see Mr Roberson walking into a room or something and there would be no one there or casual sightings of them like that they seem to be very active ghosts and people have multiple different different different ways of seeing them or or different things that happen while they're there you know it's not just oh I saw the ghost walk up and down the stairs and and that's the same thing everyone sees these are people are told different things or or they'll see U Mr or Mrs Roberson in a different place or they'll hear him clearing his throat or you know so it's it's different they seem to be very active and and do very different types of things but it seems like a lot of what people hear boils down to you're not following their rules and they're piss right you're not supposed to be here so you know you get that that feeling or he'll show up and there's been reports of people being told like I said you're too loud there's been reports of people being told shut the door so it's like they hear they walk through a doorway and then it's like almost hearing your mom nagging in your ear shut the door behind you it's almost like some of some of the voice things are like if you're mom were telling you what to do you know turn the lights off shut the door things like that follow the rules you're in my house shut the damn door behind you are you raised in a barn I know that the Southern Tier has quite a few um ghost hunting groups Paranormal Investigator groups has any of them done any type of Investigations at the robers in when I went through and was looking through trying to get some other people's point of views in other people's stories I was not getting um anything really from an actual paranormal group per se I'm surprised because it's such a hot bed of of activity yeah no I I I wasn't really able to find anything necessarily I think there's one called Southern Tier paranormal group I think there's like the greater broom county paranormal group but I didn't find anything from those folks to be honest with you I wonder if they just don't allow it so much might be against the rules you know um people knock it PBS Public Broadcasting System everybody has one in their state and town PBS had a couple of really good they're not very long they're like five minute Clips but but PBS had a couple of of really good Clips where they talk about it briefly oh very cool which I thought was kind of interesting yeah the website real hunts.com they have a uh nice little article about it as well so there's a lot of information out there about it and a lot of people's personal accounts as a museum you know people think that when you walk through a museum that has everything kind of left as is people think that oh well you know there there's a bedroom there's going to be a spirit oh you know there's the living room there's going to be a spirit well something about you know people's energies attaching to objects as well as to place but I feel that from my own personal experience and a lot of the experience expences other people had that I was reading about online from some of the local websites is that the majority of the experiences tend to happen in the theater at the either at the top or the bottom of of that that big humongo staircase and sometimes in some of the Halls there's like these long thin hallways I don't know the activity is just it it's it's confined to specific parts of the house it's not everywhere the house they do seem to be very active in the places that they kind of haunt you know they they'll say things or say different things or you know they'll react to something like someone leaving a door open as opposed to just being like a static haunt right right but again I just also feel that there's stuff oozing through the walls of that house that is that is more related like like the Native American mother singing to her child you know all the children laughing and playing and stuff I mean we know that the Roberson did not have children obviously if they didn't have children those children must have been been there prior you know what I'm saying right where did those hauntings come from and they actually believe it or not and we'll have to do this sometime because I've actually never really done one of these officially obviously having worked there uh when I was younger but they do official uh Haunted Tours where they go into a lot of ghost stories and staff experiences that would be an adventure to go to yeah that that would be cool and they talk a lot about the the Roberson themselves and about some of the history and what they know about the natives that were on that property prior so it I I I think it would be neat there it is a big house because of some of the AL call them land ghosts you just have this ever ever feel of Something's there something there feel it when you go into a house with that much history yeah I mean my daughter got married last year and we had her bridal shower up in the ballroom which was on the top floor of the Mansion so you know I'm in there during the day and even during the day you're not alone you are very clearly not alone when you were at that place day or night it you you have that sense of you are very clearly not alone you could feel that presence even during the daylight hours absolutely absolutely you know and that was just last year literally almost exactly actually almost to the weekend exactly a year ago and you just feel it you just know there's other people there and you're just kind of a visitor oh wow you know local Legends like that are kind of fascinating most places have them you know there's the haunted house or that that you're not supposed to go to or the haunted Street or everyone knows knows of the the woods or the creek or whatever that has the the local story or or a Cryptid that roams nearby you know some are more famous than others the only the only one this is NE never anything I personally saw myself um but I have read some stories but I can't find any origin is the person in the West Point uniform multiple people over multiple decades um have seen someone in a West Point uniform I don't know the tie-in to the property if anybody happens to know that tie-in shoot us an email because I'd be curious interesting that reminds me of like the cowboy at the um at the Overlook Hotel um where The Shining yeah book takes place nobody knows where that cowboy came from or who he is but so many people have seen him in the same room that he's definitely a ghost there but they just don't know where he came from no we can account for the Roberson we can account for for the Native American woman we can account for the children but this guy in the West Point uniform I don't to tell you oh I wonder if any of our listeners any of our wonder you guys are so wonderful if you guys have any information on this person in the West Point uniform at the Roberson Museum please give us an email the stone at gmail.com I'd be curious because you know being being born and raised in Binghamton who knows maybe it was a long lost relative of mine I don't know maybe it could have been oh my goodness so local Legends seems to be kind of a topic that we're doing because today I am talking about Laona which is a local Legend here in the southwestern USA what's that I've never heard of that now is this what is this is this is this Spanish what what start with the name is this Spanish Laona Laona La what does that mean what's that translate to you love your lady in white stories I do well they're so ubiquitous I guess it translates to the weeping woman or the whaler Laona means you know the the woman who cries I'm already sad and I don't even know the story I'm just sad by the name even though the name sounds beautiful it does Laona sounds very beautiful and the woman who cries or the Wailing woman is is a beautiful name but her story is anything but beautiful it's quite tragic so I'm going to start by telling a story so grab your cute little silicone pipe get some of your your Good Dog Patch there sh pack her right up up I'm going to tell you a story okay I'm puffing all right lay on me way back in the day in Mexico I believe it was the 14 and the 1500s is roughly when they think this story took place oh wow so this is an oldie one this is a very old old story and and it has some even older Roots but we'll get into that so they just say long ago so long ago in Mexico there was a beautiful woman and her name was probably Maria some don't say any name name but so there was a woman named Maria long ago in Mexico long so let's see if I can get higher and say that like a sixth time long ago in Mexico beautiful woman named Maria she lived she lived with her siblings and her widowed father and by all account she was a hardworking beloved girl she took care of her family she was well known in town and everyone loved her and of course she was stunningly beautiful very po they always are they always are they're all pretty and they all play with Ouija boards she did not in her defense no Ouija board here however stunningly beautiful girl and as beautiful girls as any girls sometimes are want to do she likeed to go hang out and go dancing at night so she'd do her chores during the day and at night she would go dancing dance the night away and flirt with all the boys in town how ever sounds reasonable yeah of course why not she gets her stuff done she can go party what the [ __ ] she's allowed anyway party like it's 14.99 man that's right so party girl does not want anything to do with the local Village boys they're much too common she's common too she's just a commoner but she has her sight more she's she's more Uncommon that's right she's looking she has loftier goals and so she has has her sights set on uh a gentleman of a higher standing she finds this man and she Woos him and he's entranced by her beauty and marries her and they have some children and everything seems good but this upper class man is a little resentful that she's just a commoner and he's busy he's working all the time loves his children dots on his children but he's kind of bored of his common wife he married down he married down and and he takes great pleasure in letting her know this and so he's gone longer and longer on business and she's more and more frustrated and one day she's down by the river and her children are playing nearby and she's washing clothes and she sees him ride by with a beautiful young woman sitting on his lap and they are more than intimate oh yeah so Maria sees red and is livid and completely loses her mind and grabs her children in a rage and throws them into the river oh my God the poor children drown and seconds after their little heads go underwater she realizes what she has done and wailing and crying completely beside herself with grief and she drowns herself in the river after them however she then gets to heaven and is told that she cannot enter until she finds The Souls of her children that she murdered they sent her back to Earth and you'll see her gaunt and sad and crying dressed all in white her hair and tatters her once beautiful face all gaunt with sadness and she just walks along these waterways crying I miss ehos which means oh my children and they hear her cry this and if you see her it's dangerous because it's said that she looks for children she's trying to find her children and so if she sees children by the water she'll take any children she'll grab them and take them and when she sees that they're not the souls of her children she kills them and so she keeps looking and this tale is often told like a boogeyman tale it's very often told as a tale to young children you know like a lot of Boogeyman Tales they'll hear it in you know in elementary school stay away from the river the Weeping Lady will come get you right come home before dark or Laona will get you don't don't go down by the water exactly or Laona will get you and so this is a story that's that's very often told and depending on the region where it's told it will take on a little bit of the local flavor you know it'll be this particular lake or that particular River or the woman will have two children or sometimes she'll have three children you know the story will change a little bit depending on who's telling it and where they're from or where they're telling it about because it kind of changes with the region to kind of fit where you're at much like other woman in white ghost stories and this one particular hit home for me because it it touches on so many different things you know there's that there's a woman who is is looking for something better right and she finds it only to realize it's not really what she wanted or it didn't work and and it also fits with some of these tales that you hear you know of of postpartum depression or or women who are in impossible situations you know it kind of the story parallels mental illness domestic abuse it also parallels some of the stories of Mexico itself with the people themselves being disregarded by The colonizers Who came in and treating them you know badly and it's just interesting how many of these stories kind of weave together that is like heartbreaking oh my gosh it is one of the saddest stories I was hoping you were going to tell me that she went up and murdered her husband right and and interestingly enough the story itself probably did start with her murdering her husband because the original story was most likely about an Aztec goddess and I'm going to try and say this correctly seakat so the Aztec goddess seakat is the serpent W woman the goddess of motherhood midwives and fertility uh she was also in charge of so like women who died in childbirth their Spirits supposedly became part of uh sewaka wats posi I guess like her group and they were called the SEO I believe SEO and they haunted Crossroads much like the goddess hiate being in charge of the crossroads and the afterlife and these women of the afterlife who had died in childbirth also haunted Crossroads and would seek victims and would sometimes kill Unfaithful men they've also been known to seduce men so they have kind of a a good and a bad connotation but you take this powerful goddess and then you bring in the Christian influence of like Spanish conquistadors and the and the Spanish colonizers and they brought with them that same idea of of Shame and and women being lesser so they took this it's possible that one of the origins of Larona was a a cautionary tale you know women should be good and stay at home you should you shouldn't try to rise above your station you know you shouldn't you know you should be kind when your husband works long hours and because they use her as kind of a a scapegoat kind of they hold her up as the poster woman for be obedient you know and don't or or you'll you'll be just as evil as she is see what happens when you try to reach too high when you get too vain basically women still we were at a point where you needed to know your place that's right and they see this goddess this of motherhood and of fertility and it went against everything they were preaching right exactly and so a lot of these old Tales would get kind of twisted and and the fun part if there is a fun part I guess of laurona is is in the you know kids tell these stories to each other there's the Candyman there's the the Bloody Mary there's all these different stories that little kids tell each other to scare each other I asked my kids friends if they had heard this story and they had heard it and it was usually in the the sense of be careful or Laona will get you so it's kind of like don't stay out after dark because the boogeyman is out there and so being careful with that and and so it's more of a cute childhood story but it's wrapped in this story that's also meant for grown-ups too know your place and be careful you know or these you'll turn into this monster I think it's very interesting that to this day so you said in the beginning that this is from like the 1400 something to this day kids are being told mind your ass or she's coming for you right right yeah and that makes you think you know how can something be literally hundreds of years pass out and and not have truth to it yeah the story is so powerful and it resonates so strongly with people that that it it does like you said it's been hundreds of years I mean there there's Domino Renee Perez is an author who wrote a book there was a woman LA yarona from folklore to popular culture and he mentions he talks about elements from 15 29 so it's definitely like you said hundreds and hundreds of years old so it's something about it is so Universal it touches on something that people keep telling it and it's same as the other lady in white stories they are often decades if not hundreds of years old in the different places where they come from so just a scary scary thing you know don't go out after dark or Laona will get you oh when I was doing my research I came across a podcast uh by these two women Christina and MJ and they're two Latina women and they have a podcast called es spooky tales and it's uh their description says Latin American folklore myths Legends haunted places and spooky quento Delano here the stories you grew up with like laurona as well as true stories from listeners and guests Christina and MJ are wonderful I listen they have two episodes about Laona and they're both very very good and they go into some of the history and some of the different tales as I was saying before there's different versions of the story and when I was listen listening to isuki laurona tale uh MJ told of her version that she had heard where Lerona isn't a bad mom she's not uh reging above her station woman she's just a woman who lived on the outskirts of town she was widowed and she had her CH she had three children she was taking the long walk into town one day to get supplies and when she got into town she saw that the town had been ransacked you know in Mexico's history there's a there's a lot of War there's a lot of strife but so this woman goes into town and she sees that soldiers have come in and killed everybody so she immediately turns around and runs back to her children to try and protect them but she's too late when she gets back to her home her children have been killed and were thrown in the lake next to her house and in her grief she drowns herself in the lake next to them because she couldn't save them oh my God in that version of the story La yorona again wanders around this Lake looking for her children but she's not the she's not the evil woman of some of the other stories she's more of a sympathetic character in this one so it kind of depends on what area you're getting the legend from whether she was good or evil correct you know who's telling the tale and and what like you said what area are you coming from what their twist basically what's their twist and and some of them most of them are she was a woman reaching above her station and blind jealous rage she murdered her children and then either starved herself to death or drowned herself right afterwards in her grief gotcha but it just really depends I I just want to know have children literally legitimately disappeared like will she come take you there are people who have seen her and have heard her they say if you hear iOS and a woman sobbing near a body of water get away now because she's coming for you and there are some places online that you can see people people have taken pictures of ghostly figures in white uh near rivers and people everybody a lot of people have stories of their own of seeing or hearing her in different places even there are some Modern you know within the last couple decades um murders that were committed by women who said that Larona that they were Laona or that Larona made them do it so it's not just a legend being passed down there are people who are still saying they're having a paranormal experience involving her yes there are people who do they search for her and do say that they have seen her uh there are people who definitely have stories of seeing her so it's it's one of those things that um you know the story changes a little bit but it still has that kernel and it probably goes back to a goddess but whether it was the the Catholics or the Christians that changed the story or whether it was changed by people to to help turn it into more of a cautionary tale and teach their morals and values it's still a sad spooky tale yikes it is it is it's very sad and you know unfortunately that is like one of those Restless spirits that will never their their spirit will be restless pretty much for all eternity that's the sad part it's almost like she doesn't get to really die no she doesn't ever get to rest and and all the stories do agree on that that for whatever reason she was cursed to stay on the earth until she could find The Souls of her children and be reunited with them and until that happens she's doomed to stay here and I think that might be another reason why this story has such longevity is because it it touches something in in every person who a child in every child and everyone who was ever a child and in mothers you know that that sense of loss and what could drive someone to do something so horrible and of course she's going to be tormented for eternity by what she had done you know that's that's horrific and it's something that's that's super scary and and I I think that kind of gives it staying power because it just touches on such a a primeval part of people well that and the fact that there's still sightings and and and things of that nature that that's definitely contributing to the staying power now where where in Mexico is this roughly give or take see that's the thing is it's everywhere you can find this story um all over meso America and even up into Southern California New Mexico Texas I mean the story has kind of yeah it's kind of traveled all over and so again and so even though Sasquatch of the South right so exactly it's kind of everywhere this story pops up in all sorts of different places in that area all through mesro America all through even the Aztecs had some stories with the Goddess that seem to be similar but she's kind of everywhere so yeah scary scary story and and kind of beautiful and sad and you know there's a lot to it and and it's a beautiful tragic story some of these things are you know heartbreaking heartbreaking and I think that's one thing that people forget about paranormal stories and ghost stories and all of that I think the thing that people forget is that generally they all start from some tragic sad story murder death Doom sick every good ghost story starts with sadness yeah with someone else's personal tragedy that's true it's just sad it is sad it is sad and it this one you know when you think about it from a child perspective it's just fun it's it's the Bloody Mary in the mirror ghost story and then when you grow up and you look at it you're like damn that's [ __ ] up the basis of the story is pretty [ __ ] even though as a kid it might be a a fun Bloody Mary type story or you know Freddy's coming for you if you go to sleep kind of thing but but the root of it is is heartbreak and sadness yeah thank you all to all of our wonderful listeners you
