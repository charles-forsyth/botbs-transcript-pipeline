it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi and welcome to the solarium the sundrenched herb filled magical space where we set our brooms down shell puts away her cursing finger and we relax with sippable and smokable magical herbal blend today we're talking classic Pagan books from before 1995 who said I put my hexing finger away first of all good point that's a very good point I should not have assumed that but you know we do try to keep it peaceful here in the solarium hanging out today I'm Leila and I'm shell and the hexing finger has been put away oh thank goodness and today I'm relaxed it's nice and it's book reading season I feel like Thanksgiving is the threshold for book reading season is that a thing or am I just a weirdo it must be because the stack of books on my desk and next to my bed have gotten to dizzying Heights you know actually my stack of books is like surpassing almost my lamp so I I need to hunker down but today we're gonna talk about Classics and there's something to be said about Classics now speaking of Classics I see you are in your bathrobe I have been wearing my bathrobe almost all day it's that kind of day and so I I am sitting here with a classic tea blend of chamomile and mint now I know the name of my tea but I think it has like a Blackberry and raspberry tint to it amongst other things we'll go with that for now the fun part about this tea is that we got them at the same shop you introduced me when I was out there visiting you in Salo Massachusetts to a shop called the black cat curiosity shop love them oh my goodness did I fall in love hard and the tea oh so so good I'd like to point out that we are not affiliated with these people we just love the tea yeah and the funny thing is is actually they're a new business they are a curiosity shop so I went in there one day on my lunch break from mundane work you know why because I was curious and I was like o new store and then I saw it was like like the clouds parted the sunrays Shone down and they have like a te- wall they the whole shop is really cool when you think curiosity shop it's a curiosity shop it really is but like when I saw that they had like handcrafted tea I was like oh Lord Jesus here we are these are all handcrafted hand Blended beautiful when I look at this tea it is literal whole chamomile flowers and crushed mint and it's pretty it's very pretty not only does it taste good here people like it's pretty it's pretty and they're named after cats that belong to people in the shop like the one I have has a it's called Egyptian cat and it's named after the very first cat of the shop Ramsay and it has a picture of of beautiful Ramsay right on the label now the tea I have currently actually have have five of them I ain't lying here folks but the one I am currently consuming is called ocean cat and it is very fruity and lovely but the cat on it looks like my kitty it's an orange cat don't know the story behind the ocean cat my my bad but this is good stuff black cat curiosity shop fantastic tea really cool shop now before we started recording I had an interesting question for you because you had made a statement and I had misheard you or maybe you misspoke I don't even remember but I thought you were smoking your tea and you said well I could so elaborate my friend I will indeed so I while I am not smoking this tea tonight I realize that the herbs in here it's just chamomile flowers and mint and these are smokable grayed herbs you want to make sure that you know there's no pesticides that it's organic and that's all the same here so this is something that I could put right in my grinder grind Up and Smoke along with my cannabis I have smoked chamomile and mint before I like it in the morning it's kind of a nice pickme up in the morning so yeah I think I I might smoke some of that tea possibly during this episode and I'll let you know how it tastes no should right now I'm smoking a little bit of cherries which is a new cultivar that we got today uh something I haven't had before it's a hybrid like most of them are and this I'm mixing with a little bit of Mullen because I always put a little bit of that in there skull cap blue lotus and Damiana so very pretty to look at but I'm going for kind of a relaxing Vibe of you know sometimes you need to just chill and relax from a long day and this uh combination of tea and smokables will probably put me right into a very mellow relaxing state of mind so that's good I found something that I have not found in Massachusetts up until now and you are going to be so jealous that I can't even wait to tell you what is it what is it what is it blueberry gelato boom Oh you know how I love a gelato oh the first thing I said I'm like I have to get this because Leia loves it the Turpin oh my goodness they usually taste so good does it taste good all right it really it really does it really does and you know same thing going for that relaxing mellow Vibe I don't know you know we just had a holiday here in America Thanksgiving it was just the full moon it was just the full moon and you know as much as it was lovely it was crazy life has been crazy and like mundane work has been crazy and if you follow us on Instagram I have been crazy and my posting has been so erratic over the holiday it's crazy I'm sorry sorry folks it's like chill and relax is the vibe that needed that's right yeah we're just hanging out we're just chilling we have these books and the two books that I read to review for this episode were drawing down the Moon by Margot Adler and the spiral Dance by Starhawk I haven't read them in a very long time and I was a little nervous to dive back into them but they were fantastic and it was really nice to have time to just set aside and read for a while you know I was actually kind of I don't want to say taken back but a little bit when you told me your choices because it has to have been a good 25 years since I've read drawn down the moon like to the point where I feel like I forgot about the book until you mentioned it and that led me to something we'll talk about in a minute such great great great books that shouldn't be forgotten because they still to this day have great value and great information in them oh my gosh just the other day I was on Facebook and I saw someone recommend the spiral dance and I think I saw in a Reddit thread too just last week so people are still recommending these books I read the 1979 version of both of them but I do know that they have undergone a couple different updates so what did you read what have you got over there now I picked two books that not only are are Classics but these are books that were kind of foundations for me first book I ever read the first book that kind of was that aha moment for me of course power of the witch Lori cabbat and then as you know I've spent many many years doing the herb thing you know the incense and and and all the Herby things I've done Scott Cunningham he's a Hot Topic nowadays but people are forgetting that Encyclopedia of herbs and let me tell you classic if you have any interest in herbs on any level whether it be for tea or for smokables or for incense or for spell jars whatever the hell your purpose is he's got a recipe for everything it is like a Bible it is it is your herb Bible don't get me on my soap box but it is an herb Bible and I think that with so much new content and the fact that this was published in 1985 I think that sometimes it gets forgotten when it is like the greatest treasure for any herb witch oh it's fantastic the the amount of recipes in there magical correspondences oils incenses for every occasion it really is like you said it's a it's a Bible it's something to pull out even today it's one of the first books in my library back in the day and it's something right there with rosemary glad star if you are a you know if you're an herbal Witch of any kind that's certainly a book that you're going to want on your shelves for sure well in my early days of being an herb witch you know I would kind of follow the recipes get the gist of of what his Concepts were with them and that kind of evolved to me just using the correspondence part of the 4,000 different magical herbs that led me down the path to doing it myself making my own recipes doing my own herbal spells remember when I used to make everybody their own individual incense for Ule every year yes or bath bomb you guys loved that it got to the point where you guys like waited for Ule CU you wanted to see what incense I'd make for y'all you would make individualized one for each person that like smelled like them or something well hell yeah and you used to make us bath salts and bath fizzies before they were a thing and I loved them the scents were always unique and always delicious but that was like my go-to and like I I've talked almost all of our episodes about my treasured books of Shadows going all the way back you know 30 years everything I have about herbs and their magical correspondences or the astrological correspondences or whatever the hell you want to talk about with herbs every reference that has been documented in my books of Shadows all lead back to Cunningham's encyclopedia so I don't know like I said I could get on soapbox with this book all day that if you have any interest in magical herbs on any level you need to get it it's on Amazon get it it's worth it I agree five brooms five brooms up five brooms up I have a lot of memories of us with that book cracking it open and looking at a recipe and then completely redoing it and making it our own for whatever spell or ritual you know or whatever the need happened to be but it was always there always a centerpiece so yeah highly recommend very good book I literally carried that book around with me the only way it would be better is if it had like a smokable appendix right right but you know at this stage of the game we could easily use it for that for that purpose as well sure absolutely but you know Lori cabitt power of the witch you know the the very first line of this book this has been ingrained in me literally since I read it for the very first time in 1994 certain things are Everlasting and Magic is one of them what do you say to that well she was the official Witch of Salem for a reason she still is right she still is she's the official Witch of Salem for a reason right right and that book and how she laid things out and related it to her personal experiences she made you feel like you could do it too you know what I mean I don't want to call it a guide book per se but it was like kind of like a guide book almost to lead you down a path that was just awesome and she just I don't know maybe I just resonated with her writing style I don't know but like that book that was it man that was like that was it I still I still have my damn original copy from 90s um I think the book was officially published for the first time in 1990 if I had lost the current copy I had I would go out and buy it just to make sure I had it I've read that book probably a hundred times and I guarantee you I will read it a hundred more and I have to say the spiral dance was probably the power of the witch for me because it it has the same kind of thing it tells you all about the different rituals and rights and seasons and and the whole reason behind being a witch but I do have to say that Lori cabbits celebrate the Earth that came out in '94 M that was one of the first books I bought that I didn't read in a library or borrow this one is the wheel of the year it's all about every holiday and it has a little bit of historical information and it still pretty much holds up today I still refer to it I mean I've been going back to this book for a very long time and it is a little Wiccan based you know and it's a little outdated but solid I mean good stuff absolutely and you know I would still to this day if a newbie witch came up to me and said what is the first book I should read you always say power of the witch power of the witch and that has nothing to do with the fact that I'm currently located in Salem either I mean no even before you went there I've had this book literally since I was 18 years old and there's there's something about the way that she presents it that just dug into my soul you know and she's Fabulous by the way absolutely in a in a Pioneer for for witches and pagans and wiccans across the land what she's done for our community not just here in Massachusetts but I mean the the wider Pagan Community is just can't be beat man no she was one of the very first out there public witches that I ever heard about I mean I know that you know like Starhawk that I'm going to talk about she's been you know out and active for a longer time but I guess maybe the the campiness of her being from Salem was what helped mainstream be interested enough to you know put that image around I'm not sure but for whatever reason she was more accessible I think in the early 90s you know in in the I don't know when the hell did we work together at that horrible place so mid90s or maybe was late 90s 90s when when we worked together at a horrible Place having read power of the witch you know we were in some Podunk Upstate New York town you know which we love dearly we're not we're not bashing it I'm bashing it I'm kind of bashing it but um the way that book made me feel gave me the confidence I guess is the right word to go to work every day and wear a pentacle and not give a what anybody at work said to tell people that I was Pagan and not give a what their opinion was like you and I were out and proud and we didn't care and there was not a lot of that going on in Upstate New York in the 90s believe you me and and we pissed a lot of people off because we were out and proud power the witch I don't know maybe it's because she told her story about kind of not giving a about being out here and it made me realize I have a constitutional right to practice whatever religion I want leave me alone and if you don't like it kiss my ass and you know we almost lost a job both of us almost lost that job because we were weird we didn't in the end but I think that you and I were kind of Trailblazers of Our Own in our small little Podunk town and honestly Lori cabitt did the same thing for me when I first discovered Witchcraft and decided to go out to Salem Massachusetts in like 1991 that was the first time I ever saw other witches and they were everywhere and Lori cabitt and her coven led a public ritual that I got to be part of and then had Lori cabbits witch's ball afterwards and no one in Salem was quiet about being a witch I must have blown your damn mind from being from New York it did no one hid their Pentacle or their cloak or their witch hat everyone was proud of being a witch and so I decided from then on that I would not hide being a witch and I was thankfully privileged enough and lucky enough to not ever have that be an issue but yeah we were loud about it and we had to talk some people down about firing us we stood our ground and we never were fake about who we were I understand don't get me wrong there are people that have to be in the broom closet and there's many good reasons that they have to be and I respect that sadly yeah I didn't feel that I needed to be therefore I didn't want want to be and I wasn't going to let anybody in my personal life or my work life tell me otherwise because well you know I'm just that Gemini exactly and if we can we should for the people who can't you know some of us have to be loud so that the people who can't be loud can you know so that we can make things safer for everyone and I know that at the time we kind of had different perspectives on it but I had really small kids you know how people get especially with religion you know going to try to take my kids away and Lorie cabat in that book just you know they kind of gave me the no one's taking your damn kids away because of your religion which luckily you know my ex-husband was was on board with with me on that so I didn't have that fight to deal with I definitely took some risks that I know other people can't take and Lori kabitz in her book gave me kind of the the confidence to do that and before the '90s when Lorie cett was big it was difficult to find some of these people there was Phyllis kurat there was Selena Fox there was Starhawk there was Margot Adler the books I'm talking about are drawing down the moon which I absolutely love still love it was written in 1979 and Margo Adler is a journalist and she's also a pagan a witch and so this book is really her attempt to kind of do a journalistic deep dive on witchcraft and paganism and I think in that aspect she very much succeeds this book as a historical Tome as a foundational Tome this is one I would definitely recommend everyone spiral dance drawing down the moon you should definitely read to understand our history I always felt like drawing down the moon was like like if you went in like 11th grade and grabbed your history book and I'm not knocking it I love it I I I love that book but it definitely had a more textbook feel oh it does I'm not saying that's bad but it's definitely something you should know going into it absolutely 100% And and I definitely want to touch on that because it's something I like more now than I did the first time I read it it does have a textbook feel and some of the negative comments people will make about it is that feels too much like a textbook this one doesn't have spells in it it doesn't have rituals in it per se although there are people that will talk about it it's very well- written very engaging but it has a lot of history and who the knew that in 1979 there were this many witches and pagans and groups all over the country she talks about all of them she talks about alexandrian wiah she talks about Garian she talks about hanging out with some of these people and and it's pretty amazing do you remember the Church of all worlds I do as a matter of fact water shared is life shared yeah may you never thirst that's from so long ago right she talks about the Church of all worlds in here and that's a religion that was actually came out of um Stranger in a Strange Land the book Stranger in a Strange Land which I had read and loved and had no idea that there was a religion founded kind of a Pagan religion that used a lot of those ideas you know shell and I at one time had a seasonal campsite out at a pagan place where we rubbed shoulders with some pretty interesting people and some of them followed this yep there was an entire group called The Church of all World CA that were there all the time and I can remember being in the hot tub naked with a bunch of people and someone would cup fresh water in their hands and share it with the person next to them and say water shared is life shared may you never thirst yep and they would go around the whole hot tub and so I I would do it too because I'm not going to be the one that doesn't do it but yeah that was kind of cool now be honest here with folks not to give away any secrets but we actually adopted that in our old coven if you remember correctly I do remember not that we did it all the time but there were occasions where we plugged that into certain certain rituals it's a fantastic saying it's it's a beautiful idea and the hook is fabulous anyway so sheal this is a good guide back in the day this is basically what um magora Maga is now and um you talk about it you love it witch Vox this is like what witch Vox before the computer this was your guide there's how to get in touch with these groups and and all sorts of information like that lot of resources obviously out of date but it has been updated it was say when didn't you say it was updated and do you know the last time it was by chance yes and yes uh it was updated the first time in 1986 1996 and then recently in 2006 2006 was not as recent as we'd like it to be by I know I know but Adler did comment um both of these authors actually when they did their updates did comment about how things have changed I mean they're very female Centric spiral dance more than drawing down the Moon I mean they're very empowering for me I am a white heterosexual middle class female and so for me these were like super empowering because women were not part of religion you know sexuality was not a thing to be enjoyed or revered and so these were revelatory to me and I thought they were absolutely phenomenal but times and thoughts have changed a little bit and so they have been updated to be more inclusive and be more aligned with with modern thinking and the authors both were really good about acknowledging where they had gone wrong or what they could have done better so I think that's really cool talk to me and the people a little bit more about the spiral dance specifically ah the spiral Dance all right with classic by the way if you a historical tone that tells you about Witchcraft and Magic but also gives you exercises and rituals and spells than the spiral Dance is for you I love a good book that's like half reading and half workbook type stuff engage me that's what I love about these books engage me so whereas drawing down the Moon is very much a historical tone and still fabulous has a lot of theory and ideas and just really good magic in it the spiral dance is a little easy easier to read and has a lot more meat to it I guess of things to do if that's what you're interested in a lot of Tri it very much a lot of triats yes I know that we're not talking about it today obviously but I I compare spiral dance and um you know kind of a little bit the uh Power of the witch kind of like buckland's blue Big Blue Book because with buckland's book you're you're doing half information and then half like I want to call them exercises that's like the wrong word like trots you know that was what got me like in spiral dance way back in the day was that you read a little bit and then why don't you give this a go read a little bit more and try this I kind of like that give me a Hands-On portion as I go yes oh yeah and and while it is kind of academic it's very Hands-On and okay side note I am a little high but uh so side note so Starhawk had trouble publishing this book nobody wanted to touch it well it was 1979 it was 1979 and so when she did actually get it published to celebrate she and her friends staged a public celebration on sa and they did a whole spiral dance oh I wish cool I would have done it with them and the cool part about that is that whole group that did that became the beginnings of the reclaiming Collective which is the um you know the ecological group and that Starhawk is part of and they do um a spiral dance ritual now every year which is very cool and that got me thinking one of the last times that I L a ritual in community you made us do a spiral dance most of the time in community when we would do a spiral dance how would it end in chaos because people like me have two left feet and be tripping over my damn self exactly so when we decided that we were going to do a spiral dance as part of the ritual I knew I had to freaking do it perfectly so doing it for a small group like our coven was easy yeah do it for 100 people that's real easy not do it for 100 150 people very much not easy so our community would always spiral in pretty well and have a lot of fun but spiraling out was the hard part it's like her and cats man her and Cat it really is so I was super super proud I spiraled everyone in and spiraled everyone right back out and it felt really awesome it was great I was so proud of myself it had not fallen into chaos you are the dungeon master what can I say yeah hide Piper ilila getting everyone going around in a spiral hey ilila guess what guess what what I got a secret what's your secret shell now you can't tell anybody okay I'll keep my lips shut everybody who's out there listening com in close be quiet don't tell anybody but we have an event coming up tell them about it Lea tell them tell them well shell and I are very excited to announce that we have been accepted as presenters to next year's Sacred Space conference happening in towns in Maryland and damn I am super excited about this I am loving all the other presenters I'm loving the workshops I cannot wait to go you know I just want to point out here that I feel like this is a full circle moment way back about 25 years ago one of the first places we ever ever presented at was at a pagan conference down in the Washington DC area called meet me and blessed be in DC swap that Blessed Be and meet me in DC yeah that and because we're basically going down to the same area I I I feel so full circle moment I love it Laura Tempest zacho is one of the presenters I mean Jason Mankey there are so many the list is is phenomenal and you can can find out the list of all the presenters including us including us all the information at Sacred Space foundation.org and this will be at the end of March in 2024 and oh my God Leila I'm really looking forward to the festival season next year both the ones that we'll be presenting at the ones that we'll be attending I know we haven't gotten into a lot of festivals in this in this particular episode but I will link a couple in the show notes and we will for sure talk about more coming up so registration is currently open for the Sacred Space conference and I will put a link in the show notes but if that's something that you want to go to this is an indoor conference I do highly recommend them whether it's indoor or camping conference just the variety of workshops that you get to go to the handson rituals and meditations Unforgettable experiences that's the only thing I can say check your local area for events and workshops and things like that and and like I said we will talk about and review a few more in the solarium just so you can know what to look for or if you have gone to events in in festivals and want to point them out to us shoot us an email I'm always up for learning about new events and new festivals going on that I can potentially put on my calendar if you're hosting an event or a festival whether virtual or in person let us know about it we'll check it out reach out back on the broomstick gmail.com but anyway I just want to touch a little bit about the importance some of these Classics I love a lot of these new books coming out and and we've talked about a few and we will talk about a few more but I love some of these Classics and I I definitely think that if you are looking to immerse yourself and information on paganism in witchcraft or wiah don't negate some of these older books because they're gold mines of knowledge gold mines be a little careful because in the spiral dance in the very beginning while she's talking about the history and the Mythos of goddess religions she does have some not so great facts I'm just saying every book you read no matter who it's from and I'm not down in anybody every single thing take with a grain of salt first of all yes and that's the case with any of these books as well but that should be the case with any information you know but I am saying that even though these books especially the early editions do have their issues they're phenomenal they have so much information so much solid good information that really formed the foundation and the basis for what witchcraft is today they still hold up now techno Lea is going to make sure that there's those links in the show notes but I absolutely wholeheartedly recommend each of these four books you know like I said Lori cabitt power of the Witch uh Scott Cunningham Encyclopedia of of herbs Margot Adler drawing down the moon Starhawk spiral dance these need to be in your collection that is just my opinion but I guarantee you there's a whole bunch of people who would agree with me and if you want to send us something to review in the solarium whether it's tea or smokables books incense whatever we do have a PO Box check out the show notes send us anything that you'd like us to review on the show and don't forget Emil
