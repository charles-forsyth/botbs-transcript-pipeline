back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to this special meditation episode of back on the broomstick I'm Layla and today we're exploring one of the most dynamic dangerous and divine forces in the witches toolbox the element of fire out of all of the elements fire is the one that we must all with intent it's the only classical elements that doesn't simply exists around us like air water or Earth fire must be created it must be invited and respected and when we constantly connect to Assassin's like through meditation we are able to awaken that Primal fire that potent energy within ourselves in myth and magic fire has always been sacred fire is both creation and destruction it is the Catalyst of great change in your magic in your rituals whenever you want to add passion power drive or creativity to your working fire energy is what you want to reach for so what does it mean to connect that sacred fire within ourselves  fire energy lives in your belly in your blood in your brain and in your heart it's the butterflies with dance in your stomach when your about to do something Brave or bold or terrifying it's that racing Restless energy that makes you Pace when you're full of ideas but you don't know where to put them it's the heat that rises to your face when you feel desire Fury or conviction fire in your body is transformation that sheet in your belly is your own personal Forge when we meditate with the intention of connecting to Elemental fire you are doing more than imagining a flame you're tapping into the fires of your own life of your own energy by using breathwork and visualization you're able to awaken that inner spark a week in the Inner Fire and feed it with your intention every inhale is are for the fire and every exhale is a release and the more you breathe with that flame the more it grows the more powerful it gets and the more  you'll begin to feel those qualities of fire rise up within you know courage passion creativity will confidence so this fire meditation is one of activation is to help you tap into all of those energies within yourself Ever Needed motivation to finish the project hello I do all the time or the energy to start one with boldness to speak your truth or to enforce boundaries fire is your ally sitting in Stillness in meditation with the Salomon allows you to commune with it safely to ask it for guidance and to raise that infernal heat so that you can turn it into action through that flame you can gain momentum and you can burn through stagnation just like a lantern with a flame inside of it you can light the path forward one of the beautiful and yet also difficult lessons about fire is that transformation doesn't require you to be perfect  don't require you to be the best it just requires Fuel and that fuel can be your desire your grief your raid Your Love fire will accept all of that it will transform the energy that you give it so that you can direct it in the way that you want to go direct it to your desire your will so I'm going to do this meditation to help you connect with that inner fire to help you raise that energy so that the next time you need a little boost or passion for inspiration or for the strength to stand up and be bold that you can let that fire speak to you that you'll have that relationship with fire so you can call on it you can raise it within you so that when needed that fire can fill you with strength and energy and remind you that you are powerful you're wild and radiant that you control that fire that you are the flame  I guess meditation as usual find a comfortable spot take a moment to set up your space decorate the area with items that remind you of fire maybe some red or orange Fabric and if you can do so safely you could light a candle or two and also I recommend having some food and water on hand for after the meditation something to help ground you and bring you back to the physical space to find a comfortable position either sitting or laying down and let your body relax as you sink into your spot and prepare for the meditation once you're ready if you feel comfortable doing so close your eyes  let your
