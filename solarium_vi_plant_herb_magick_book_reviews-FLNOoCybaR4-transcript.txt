for very long famously known only to be able to keep alive kids and cats kids and cats you know I don't know how many episodes I've said that since our our Inception but I only have the capability of kids and cats and I just want to say our first book we're going to talk about today is house plant hor to Culture by you why did you emphasize the whr part instead of the occult part because I was trying to emphasize the occult part but St about that that Genex or in me just somehow emphasize the horror part sorry there you go sorry Devon but the book is fantastic I absolutely love as a lover of house plants I was super excited to dive into this book it's very new by Devon Hunter and I one comment that I need to start this off with so you know going back to the whole can only keep kids and cats alive I start reading this book and I don't know there was a comment in here somewhere and it said something about um even if you like weren't a plant person he would teach you how to grow plants and keep them alive is this Devin Hunter looking me in the face and saying hold my beer I'm going to make her make it live he is he's challenging you now the other books that we'll be going over are Herbal Magic by Gina Dunwich the magical herb compendium by Aurora and black Thorns Botanical magic which is Fabulous by none other than Amy Blackthorne I'm just excited for today these are excellent books one of them I wasn't too thrilled with but still had a lot of information we'll get there we'll get there cuz unfortunately I agree with you so let's just say we've got four reviews for you folks today and we got three broom worthy books for you today absolutely and before we dive into the books how about let's go with the herbs that you and I are both enjoying at the moment what a smoking shell okay so this is me complaining about the weed stores again planet of the grapes doesn't taste like grapes folks it smells like it though I'll give at that this batch actually smells like it but definitely not grape tasting they're fooling me again see now I'm smoking some cherry gato as you know I love the gelato does it taste like Cherry it does it does it has a delicious Aroma it has a very nice cherry flavor it's kind of a like little reddish purple it's delicious okay I need you to do me a huge favor here what's that okay so I'm coming to your house in a couple weeks and I need you to take a big butt of that put it in a glass jar seal it up and save it till I get there I will do my best but you know how I am with gelato damn you I know but we'll see we'll see what we can do I'll try for you shell I'll put it where even I won't remember where it is perfect shoot me an email on its location and then delete your scent folder okay well you know me I'll probably forget it as soon as I send it to you so no problem that'll work what are you drinking today well today I have made myself some sun tea pretty simple just some green tea in the sun in water and and I am enjoying it with a little bit of honey and lemon it's very good push push so I'm doing the same exact thing today but see I don't like green tea don't don't don't email me about how that's horrible people I just don't it's black tea black tea all the way I love caffeine I also love black tea but today I was feeling like a green tea kind of day I've been outside the sun is finally out here in Northern Pennsylvania and everything is really really freaking green and alive and I'm loving it you're right but the problem with everything being wonderful and green and alive right now is so isn't my allergy freak out so I sound like a duck because I can only breathe out of one nostril today folks yeah I did notice that almost everything in my backyard is coated in yellow yeah yellow powder everything it's like on everything and as soon as water touches it it like becomes this sticky mess it's oh you know you first think oh if it rains my car won't look yellow oh no it's worse it's definitely worse and and so aren't my nasal passages just for the record so you're drinking a little tea for medicinal purposes today I am because I need to breathe you know yeah well while you struggle to breathe over there let's talk about this first book house plant horiculture by Devin Hunter this guy kills me because throughout the whole book he tried to convince me that I'm not going to kill these things he hasn't met me yes but I have to say that while we were reading this book you did text me and I am now cultivating some clones of a couple of my plants at your request you're right but you also have to be fair and tell the people that they are a plant that pretty much is the hardest damn thing to kill on the planet that's true I have a poos plant that I have had forever my mother gave me this plant when I moved to California forever ago and she sent me this nice little housewarming gift and it had this teeny tiny posos in it that plant you've seen it it is now like 15 different plants around my house I have one here in my office that's a good 4 feet long that's the original and poos like to be abused they're okay if you let they actually prefer it if you like ignore them and let them dry out plant the one that likes there you go but I have to say house plant Horticulture didn't just convince you to get a plant it's a freaking gorgeous book oh my God I just can I just say for future me if I get a book if I okay let me rephrase this when I write a book I want it to be packaged just like this I love the cover I love the feel I love the colors I just love this book it is a hard cover book it is a very good size it's about Journal sized I would say almost Square the pages are rounded the edges are rounded I love that I love that they're glossy they're thick it's full color there are beautiful watercolor pictures throughout this book the titles are in color it's it's just a stunningly goodlook book it really is it really is it's just a pretty book I guess part of me was like okay well you're pretty but you know what have you got inside when I started is the meat worth it and it delivers it is this this book is every damn thing that you want it to be okay people if you don't believe me I literally asked Leila to get me spider plant clones okay she did and she hates she does not do Indo I wouldn't say hate but she does not do indoor house plants but for in my defense back I don't know how long ago this was a long time ago I did have a spider plant that I kept for five years before I murdered it and I murdered it partially due to a move so I know that I can keep a spider plant at least for a chunk of time so we're gonna give it a go so Devon Hunter you win you win we'll just see how long it lives we'll see we'll put pictures up on socials once she gets these uh Spider plant and poos we'll start the countdown then oh my God I'm GNA document it just like I do my grandson here we go and the countdown begin to how long it lives but this book has information it's well written and interesting to read it does not read just like an almanac Devon's a captivating writer and a very personable writer and just for the record this is all for like indoor plants this is not about your garden and stuff like that this is all like indoor plant related right this isn't your traditional garden plants like you know Mint or chamomile or lavender these are your indoor house plants and are house plants and how to use that energy in your magical practices and what the correspondences are of your house plant I was GNA say you know what I loved about it because like half the book is like awesome correspondent information here has a tarot card for each plant how cool is that so that's that's where he kind of now you speak of my language you know what I mean he he kind of gives you some associations you know elements planets Zodiacs minerals I like that for me personally I like a book that is part information part resource and this book spoton I feel like the first half of the book was the information in the second half was the resource and I love that I love those kind of books and this was definitely five out of five Broms for me I learned some new types of Divination in this book he talks about varom mancy that had never heard of before we won't even go into the new stuff I learned that's divination using brand new leaves as they come out of the plant judging by the the way it's striped or the way it looks that sounds like one of those things that you're going to like totally pick up and run with and the next time I come to your house you're gonna be throwing damn leaves at me doing probably yeah more than likely I also really liked he talks about finding your green name like a magical name but specifically for plants and I thought that was really you know me too and mine's death I think you should pick a different one for this new phase you know sometimes you need to take on a new name to kind of help you embody those new qualities so maybe you need like green Gaia or something as your new name to embrace your house plant having self we're going to see Devon challenge accepted if you have any tips Devon please email us it back on the broomstick at gmail.com shell needs them as a green witch I do have plants in my home and especially in my magical space I have plants all around and it it does help me feel connected even when I'm inside I feel much more grounded I feel closer to Magic I can feel the energy of living things and and as you know I've talked before about growing cannabis helped kind of make me a green animist witch because that plant is so alive you can feel that and Devon talks about that too in the book that you can feel the spirits of these plants and connect with them now I don't want to jump ahead to different books but uh one of the books that that we're reviewing today they actually talked about in the introduction their first time speaking to an aloe plant and that kind of goes right along with what what you're saying right now and they are their own being which is why I feel guilty killing them the irony was not lost on me though that I am not a good plant person but yet I'm an herb witch so that was part of the reason I decided to give it another go cuz he kind of made me feel a little guilty I can do it I can do it right yeah absolutely I know you can that's why I'm G to give you a couple of my babies all good so definitely five brooms now I I do have one itsy bitsy teeny weeny criticism for the nonplant smart person like myself he was using more scientific names instead of tell me what I'm going to find it listed under when I go to Trader Joe's or to Home Depot or to Lowe's you know like some of them are the more scientific names yeah I found in the lists he definitely listed them by their scientific name and in the body he would talk more about the right the name name so it would be nice if in the list that was there too that's a good point yeah so that you did you know if you like if I want to read up on a spider plant I can just jump to spider plant instead of having to kind of decipher through a bunch of different ones you know I just I just he should have the scientific name and then the common name next to it my only iny teeny weeny criticism otherwise I love the standbook okay so the next book that we have on our list is Herbal Magic a guide to herbal enchantments folklore and divination by Gina Dunwich this is another book that I love the look of it and I love the feel of it um another small hard cover um got some beautiful Greenery on it but I've got to say this was not my favorite book I I was kind of confused with some of the folklore some of it it didn't all add up to me but I did like the divination piece um that there's a section on divination but this was not my favorite book I'm not going to lie so this book was written in 2002 and the copy that I had was republished in 2019 so you would think at that time that they would have known better but in this book she has a whole chapter dedicated to ramany spells but she doesn't call them ramany or traveler she uses a word sometimes called the gesler really people don't say that word for Romany or traveler people any longer so the whole chapter should change and some of the the spell names as well and I was kind of sad because there's a ton of good information in here I I found that the herb section was a little lacking I mean she just lists the herbs in some very superficial correspondences like the planetary ruler and the elementary ruler folklore and stuff was really good but I'm going to need to look into it just a little bit more before I make a a full decision I mean there is there is some like I said I I did kind of like the Divination piece but like there's also I mean she gives kind of the plant type the planetary ruler the elemental ruler you know and that's valuable information but the book is a whole I don't like but there are pieces to it I like when I first started reading it my notes here even say so much info because at first I was impressed with how much folklore and some I was like wow this is all brand new I have never heard of this this is amazing folklore info right so I I don't know I I'm not entirely sure about this book it's just there there was a few issues as I read through it you know there was the outdated term for romeny people that was used repeatedly there's references to hoodoo work and I don't know if she is a hoodoo practitioner or not and just a couple other small things it's very heteronormative you know all the references are to women finding their husbands and it's a little Christian leaning so just a couple small complaints but overall it was an okay book but is it from valid source yes that's that's the problem like I said I I like the the the tables and the correspondence Parts but I I like I like some of the Divination ideas but I I'm not sold on the folklore yeah and she even says in the beginning in the forward that when she began publishing they would ask her where the sources of certain information was and she says quote well my personal experience written down in my big book of herbal stuff with pressed examples of plants in it how do you want me to attribute that and on the one hand I appreciate that greatly you know this is your personal experience and information and I think information like that should be presented as such and is definitely good information but I would also like to see other sources particularly for the folklore uh to back it up or title the book differently you know what I'm saying like if this was a my personal interactions with herb magic then totally get it 110% but that I can't get past that folklore word yeah I did like she also had two different types of divination using herbs in here that I had never heard of she had I'm G to I'm totally going to mangle this CMO mancy which is a divination using the ashes from burning herbs which I thought would be very cool to use especially with cannabis that would be fun yeah if you have rolled a joint as a spell and are smoking that is part of your your ritual or your spellwork reading the ashes as it falls from that ritual joint would be a very cool thing to do I think I just made me think of how many times I forget to Ash my cigarette and it DS on me so I'm apparently doing divination all the time when I'm smoking a cigarette and honestly I have seen witches before and have been asked by witchlings when the stick incense sometimes it'll burn weird it'll curl or or the the Ash will fall or your loose incense might burn in an interesting way what does that mean yeah that's Cosmo mancy so yeah like those pieces of this I love because of course you and I going back to we are divination we love every form of divination and and that's that is the one thing that pulled me into this book yes one more type of divination I wanted to mention since I'm puffing on my cherry gelato here capnomancy which is finding Omens in patterns of smoke so again as you're smoking your ritual herb or you're drinking your ritual tea the smoke patterns as it comes up from that you can uh find Omens in that if you go into it with a mindset that you are going to do divination with the smoke and the ash then that'll work better for you I think rather than just randomly being like Oh that smoke looks like a flower I'm going to get flowers today divinations like this set setting an intention are usually very important beforehand oh my god when we get together can we do a smoke and Ash divination Tria episode oh hell yeah does that mean we get to smoke a lot of herbs and cannabis and then I have a specific Herb in mind all right yes it's a date we can definitely do that we will do some cosmoman and some capnomancy why can't we just call this ash divination why does everything have to have a omy we're not good at pronunciations I don't know that's a good question so I don't I'm not entirely sure about this Kina done Witch Book I'm going to go out of five brooms so I'm GNA go two and a half I'm GNA go two and a half I'm going to say pending future research because I don't don't know it's accurate enough I don't know if some of this is accurate enough that I don't want to go and be telling people to go Rush right out and buy it exactly so I'm going to say a cautious 2.5 because it is interesting there is some interesting information but there is some that yeah if any of you guys do Ash divination or whatever the fancy word smoke divination we pictures send us pictures CU we want to see this or post it in our Facebook group we have like 300 people in there now I know I can't believe it thank you guys there's a wonderful group of people lots of good questions information discussions so for sure post your pictures there hop on over and we even stop in every once in a while and we post Andor comment we do I'm super shy guys so just to let you know I respond to people on the regular I know you're awesome I'm so glad you do because I am like Wicked shy but thank you all so much you guys are great I love that group so so this next book this book whoa the magical herb compendium correspondences spells and meditations by Aurora first of all this book cover is gorgeous can we just start with that it is I love the art it's very nice reminds me of the sun card in Tarot it really does this book I I really th this spoke to my heart I liked this book I don't know if it's how she wrote it the information in here but I really liked this book um and I like how she goes into the history of magical herbalism because you don't find that in a lot of books I'll be it brief I wished that if she was going to go into a a full history of the magical herbalism that this book was like 6 in thick but she did a great job with that and I like how she goes through the herb use by different civilizations as well the samarians Egyptians Indians Chinese Greek I loved that because different cultures used different things in different ways does that make sense it does different a lot I really loved this book it okay I'm gonna say admittedly to my mind it was not as personably written as say Devon Hunter's book or Amy black Thorn's book it was more written like a an almanac I loved it don't get me wrong I'm just saying it it was less fun quote unquote to read but damn it was packed full of information I very much loved it but I just didn't think it was quite as personable to read as the I get you I get you it's almost like Devon wrote that book to me personally he was like dear shell this is how you're going to do this it's such a fun book and so filled with his personality and easy and fun to read kind of I don't want to it's more like textbook it is it's it's presenting information not trying to have a conversation via book right and but at the same time it is still interesting yes tons of information and still entertaining and still filled with practical anecdotes and and good things like that so I'm not saying anything bad about this book just that it's written more like a well-written textbook and less like a personal conversation between you and Devin I did did also like um she did a section on wildcrafting your herbs yes I I liked that as well because that's kind of where people generally seem to first start with their herbal journey is going and picking out in their yard or out in their neighborhood or in their General vicinity and going from there so how do you store that how do you dry it how do you take care of it it's all in here you know do you put all this in Ziploc bags and hope for the best you know I I kind of like how she how she talked about collection she calls it you know wildcrafting plants um and herbs I I just I like that that was added in because I did feel that there's not a lot of information about that out there you know people kind of present their information with a picking up from now that you've got it this is what you do with it you already have it dried and packaged now here's how you put it in a spell and this starts from I'm walking into a field and I'm picking things and plucking things now what I also really loved when she talks about something called the doctrine of signatures and you and I talk about this in a different way we call it like for like magic the doctrine of signatures is basically the idea that how a plant looks gives you an idea of what it does what its medicinal and magical properties are and we talk a lot about things being like for like like say you know you would put honey or sugar in something to sweeten it to to bring nice things or you'll put lavender in because it's very soothing and calming if that's the type of thing that you want so the doctrine of signatures is that what a thing is like in the mundane world is what it's like in the magical world as well and so I I very much related to that so I liked how she she presented the information in here and I must say I had never heard of this author before Aurora but fan freaking tastic fantastic great book I'm definitely gonna give this book five Broms I will definitely be going back to over and over again it has excellent correspondences like I said my only complaint is I wish it was about six inches thicker I love how she has a spiritual anecdote for each herb for everyone yeah like I said it's not as personably written but there's still personal information what' she go over like 92 different herbs I think it was yeah it's a lot cannabis is not in here I'm just going to put that out there right now it's my personal pet peeve cannabis is not in any of these I looked please file your complain at that's right I'll be I'll be sending a notice to the director of lellan and uh no I won't because they all have their own cannabis books I'm just saying I have a beef with herbalist not putting it in there it's a magical herb man come on well you know you can't have it all I'm trying to have it all it's not working so let's move on to our final fabulous book here I have to say this one tied for my favorite I know right we've got blackthorns Botanical magic the green witch's guide to essential oils for spellcraft ritual and healing by the freaking fabulous Amy black Amy Blackthorne we love her she's so great this book took me back for a minute and that was my own fault and it has nothing to do with the book it's just me not reading clearly what happened I have never as much as I do the herb thing and have been an herb witch forever in a day I've never really been an oil person an essential oil person usually because it makes me itch to be honest I don't know why but I really loved this yes she got some freaking good info she goes through some fact checked lore here like this is Rock Solid good lore oh this stuff is great the recipes are fantastic I just wanted to try all of them every single one I looked at I was like oh yeah that looks potent oh yeah that's going to work it was written in a very right now today kind of way which I liked because you know how some books make it sound like you're reading some tomb from the 1600s this was very modern and very I don't know very today and I liked it I I do have oils I have some sitting right here because I've just been making Spider and and wasp spray to like spray around my house to keep them all away I'll put a recipe for that if you guys want to know it it's mostly like geranium lemongrass and rosemary so I'll put a recipe up there but yeah so I've been using a lot of essential oils lately mostly to keep bugs out of my house so I was very happy to look through this and see all sorts of other uses for the oils that I have in my magical cupboard now again she's got a lot of great correspondences in here just like the other books where a lot of these plants and herbs their origin country and one thing I just also want to mention and this just dawned on me we are not promoting any of these books as a medical whatever don't drink consume shove up or rub any of this stuff without consulting your personal medical professional because Lila and I there's a lot of things we are but we are not doctors I did want to mention that because especially when we're talking about an essential oils book make sure that you are not allergic your pets aren't allergic you know the PSA we're great witches not doctors right keep that in mind or veterinarians not veterinarians either this book is chock full I mean we're talking what the hell is this like 300 pages of goodness that's the only way I can describe this book 300 pages of goodness and it starts out you know as you're reading it it feels like you're talking to Amy Amy's voice I think comes through this pretty well and she talks about breath work I like that you know and she's a martial artist so she knows about breath work you know and how important that can be to your magical practice right right she does talk about smoke cleansing your home and that smoke cleansing a home or using some type of cleansing in your space helps you to change the energy there and one of the things that does is it makes negative energy harder to find you because if you've cleaned everything out and you have it all fresh and new that bad whatever that somebody sent after you is going to have a hard time finding you think of like you ever see one of those movies shell where somebody's like running away from the law and they've got dogs after them oh yeah yeah right so they like run through the water or they do something to like get the scent away from the trail so the dogs can't find them stop telling people what I did in high school think about that same thing like think of the dogs as the magical you know hex or you know evil eye that somebody sent at you and the water is the purifier essential oil right is whatever you're using to cleanse your space so now it can't find you as well you know and so using oils in all sorts of different ways I just loved all the different things she had in here now I got a quick spoil alert that I'm gonna have to ask about so the spoil alert is we're gonna have Amy on here yay I'm gonna have to ask her like because I did make I did do some essential oils for for a while and just making them like my hands would start and it wasn't just any particular scent it was different ones like my hands would get itchy and stuff and I'm going to have to ask her if maybe it's a maybe I was allergic to the base I was using maybe it was the carrier oil maybe you need something different that could have been but whenever I was even just making them working with them I like my hands would break out I like to use hemp seed oil obviously I'm a weed witch but I I do also like uh coconut I've been using coconut oil a lot because it just seem it's so nice and usually people don't have a reaction to coconut oil yeah see I was using grape seed oil I think we'll have to ask Amy I am not I mean I'm kind of like you I do a lot of herbal things but I am definitely not the biggest tincture SL oil slash yeah tinctures and oils not necessarily my forte you want something you can burn smoke or do whatever I got you out of we're there but dinkers and oils will have to defer to Amy but gorgeous book this is the biggest one sizewise and thickness wise I think too it feels Hefty it's knowledgeable it has herbal information it has recipes it has spells it has B it is literally the A to Z of essential oils and it's good to read it's fun to read it does not read like a textbook this one very much reads like someone's personal brim War yeah like you're like you're having a conversation yeah with a super intelligent herb witch damn right good stuff and of course my favorite Rosemary is in here but magical correspondences all sorts of stuff that you would put you know it looks like something you would put in your book of shadows has a little sketch of the plant you know all the different correspondences that you might want to know about it and then a recipe using it it's just a good good solid book she does go over if it's not something that that you have been doing and you're looking to get into um she does go into things like you know how to purchase how to blend your own and basically safe use which maybe that's where I went wrong you know sometimes people are like well I don't know what to buy she tells you read the book in conclusion Devon Hunters house plant Horticulture oh wait wait wait before we in conclusion how many room sticks you give in it oh oh five I love it five and as usual everyone please keep in mind that the broomstick rating system means nothing has absolutely no value in the real world and is subject to change at any given time we just like it and sometimes their broom rating is between one and five and sometimes it's one and 10 subject to change without notice house rules house rules that's right house rules overall three out of four kickass books one good info but I don't want to vouch for it but the rest of them great books I mean I love having all of these here the magical herb compendium by Aurora fantastic textbook lots of good information blackthorn's Botanical magic she's just cool there's so much there so many recipes so much good stuff Devon Hunter I mean I wish I knew this guy I'd love to be his friend yeah he's gonna see me post updates here on this damn spider he's gonna be like yep I give up I'm done hopefully you can but yeah I was
