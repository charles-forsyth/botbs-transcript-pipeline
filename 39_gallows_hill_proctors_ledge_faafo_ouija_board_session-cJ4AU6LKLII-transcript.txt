I think it's a good idea it's a very good idea sh it might not be a good idea it's probably a really bad idea I really want to find out though yeah me too okay we're going to do this yeah we're going to do it it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends on opposite coast of the country get together to tell each other truish Tales of horrifying hauntings and ghoulish ghosts but this week we're together still we're still together in Salem Massachusetts talking about all things and spooky wooky that's right well your host who's hi and can't remember what she's talking about I'm Leila this is shell and I'm hi and I'm witchy and I'm glad to be here wow how much of that uh endgame have we smoken smoked this evening well I did a trick on you what's that I switched the weed and didn't tell you what are we smoking now is this one of your like crazy high THC weeds it no what it is is you know this is what makes me laugh I thought it looked different this new generation they make me laugh so apparently call me in old Stoner I don't know maybe I'm the crazy one you know how people like to get their whole eighth in like one bud we do I mean that's fun if it happens that's pretty Millennial people not us oh yeah nice big chunky sure okay so I go to the store and I I will point out that the other thing about this weed I didn't tell you about and I secretly sliced snuck in for you this ain't Happy Valley weed you cheated on Happy Valley well you feel dirty I do feel dirty but in the same respect it's also a distant family member who owns this particular store so I cheated on yeah I cheated on Happy Valley but you know cousins are cousins cousins so I'm laughing because they have a bud bar there love a bud bar everybody apparently likes to get like their APS and like one or two buds so what they do is you know how like pieces break like if you had a big old bag of buds you know how like break it break off pieces that we is our age smokers would call like pocorn yeah do they sell like the shake bags and the popcorn nug bags they don't even sell the shake they sell the popcorn nugs you can get four grams for $40 now remember an eighth cost you 60 four grams for $40 because it's popcorn bud and it's not pretty wow I'm like dude but it's so dense you got to grind it so if you grind up the one bud or grind up the little popcorn buds what's the difference and he laughed at me he goes you know how people are they like what they like and I'm like people are stupid I don't know call us oldfashioned Stoners but yeah I don't mind there is a difference sometimes I'll notice when I'm growing you know the nice big dense buds at the top of the plant tend to be really rich and trcom coated and sometimes the smaller popcorn nuggets can be slightly less slightly less THC Rich why just because they broke off no usually they they get less light penet ation if they're down at the the small no these are like these are like if you had one of those big buds and it like broke in half or broke up into pieces oh so they just don't like it because it's not pretty correct this is all about this is all about visual Aesthetics this isn't about quality it's about it's not pretty enough it all looks the same when I Ash it onto my tray but this stuff is called you tricked me you grounded up and I just thought it was more of your end game well that's the trick um La Kush cake baker's eth popcorn nugs that's what they call it Baker's eth because it's four grams very nice I like it so la Kush cake never heard of it but you obviously like it because we couldn't even remember our intro I don't even know what I'm talking about today well no that's not true I know we're talking about Gallows Hill in Salem Massachusetts once thought to be the site where people were hung hence the name Gallows also another theory myth we're going to go with myth at the moment um is that gu's Corey was pressed to death up on Gallows Hill which we'll get into some of the options of that as we as we go the other place we're going to talk about is a place called Proctor's ledge which was newly Minted as a memorial site in 2017 after some researchers got a hold of information they they realized that the top of gallows Hill Not only was an impractical site to have hangings but it didn't historically fit from their records and so they use some old records and people's sayings and we'll get into all of that to determine the actual real spot where these unfortunate people 19 people were hung and then their bodies thrown into a ravine to be later picked up by their relatives um and now that there is a beautiful Memorial at that site for those who are not familiar with the area um also to kind of give you like a geographical visual um Proctor's ledge is at the bottom of gallows Hill so picture Gallows Hill a hill big enough to have a couple neighborhoods on it so it ain't like just some small little Hill um a hill big enough to have a couple neighborhoods on it and Proctor's ledge is at the bottom of this hill yep so still pretty close to Gallow Hill and we'll also at the end of the episode tell you a little bit about one of our midnight Moonlight episodes out to Gallows Hill where what you're what you really mean is we're gonna tell everybody how we [ __ ] around and found out [ __ ] around and found found out that's exactly what we should call this episode for real H how's that weed treating you really good really good let's keep passing this bong I didn't tell you the THC but it's 29.1 love it I am loving it but it's gonna you know so if we get a little off track and a little sidetracked it should all because Baker bud it's because the baker's bud so you want to H where did you go what's the name of this place actually place is called CNA and they have we went to their store in ambery they also have a store in um I call it hah Hill okay folks if you're from Massachusetts it is ha Hill that's how it's spelled um you can how is it how do the Massachusetts in Massachusetts ends I think they call it hail they call it havil but to see it in writing it's hah Hill but anyway CNA it's in hah Hill and Berry nice very nice and actually they're veteran owned veteran run um and they do donate money to Veterans organizations as well as they do fundraisers for veterans organizations so they are like a total let's go veterans kind of store so definitely a place worth supporting [ __ ] yeah I love that place with a purpose got to and look it is not your typical you know you hate that you hate that big old glass package I do this is just a little tiny package I love it it I mean it's still plastic it's still killing the environment but it isn't like that 40 pound glass container either please I promise I won't go into a rant but please please please please packaging people use hemp Plastics use recyclable packaging I know you have to wrap it in 10 different layers but can we make it all recyclable please thank you I'm warning you Mr Weed Manufacturing container creators Lea knows how to use Reddit and she's not afraid to do it that's she's not afraid to use Reddit I will gather the entwives and the witches against the patriarchy and all the recyclable people and we will drown you in hate ma but we'll still buy your weed we just we just want it to be either biodegradable or reusable or something yes please vote with our dollars what I real quick before we start talking stuff I just want you to Quick tell people how are you like in Salem I absolutely love it the chaos it is crazy and it's just getting crazier as the month goes on it's absolutely phenomenal the witchy Heart of the City beats strongly and I absolutely adore it it's wonderful and also the pop culture witchy thing beat strongly here which I also quasi love as well yeah sure all aspects of the the the historical thing which is a different kind of witchy but that part I love I love the wiccan you know Mecca part of it the whole witch culture of USA coming there I love that but I still love the btch statue as well and I love the pop culture cough to get off cough to get off for sure I love seeing the movie sites I love seeing talking about huie Halloween I love seeing all the people in costume every different aspect whatever you come to the witch City for there's something here for you and it it's just so much fun so I think our witchy count of Sanderson sisters I was up to about 27 our last episode and I know I've seen at least a dozen more since then how about you how many would you guess you have seen oh my God I would say in the last week I have at least seen 75 Sanderson sisters and I'm telling you people I've watched both movies and I swear three there was only three but you know you come to Salem there's more than three I love them oh there's so much fun uh so you beat me you've definitely got me beat at this point I would have to say your total far outweighs mine for Sanders and sisters but I've since seen the movie and you just said you've seen the movie what did you think um I have disappointment on two different levels I have disappointment in the movie as a whole and I have disappointment because not anything was filmed in Salem none of that's Salem and you're portraying it to Salem and it's not Salem you filmed it in Rhode Island people so I was disappointed as a whole and I was disappointed with the location what didn't you like about the movie what disappointed you it felt like the craft all over again it felt like the craft with B Midler and way too way too musical I felt there was like five times as many songs that were so irrelevant the first movie there were songs but they were relevant and there was songs here that weren't relevant I felt like it was like grease Meats The Craft with a quasy rocky horror twist I loved it I went into it knowing it hoping it was going to be campy and Goofy and fun and it was all of those things and I cried it was emotional and cute I have to say I I wait where' you cry I need to know this people we need to know where Lea okay spoiler alert if you have not seen Hocus Pocus 2 skip ahead like a minute we'll tell you when it's safe to come back so in Hocus Pocus 2 when Winfred decides to do that spell to get all the power she's going to get all the magic and she skips past the warning and she gets all the power but then she has to pay the price and her sisters all go up in Sparkles and they say goodbye and bye-bye and it was and and then she was sad and she had done the whole thing just to be with her sisters and when she she was told that the spell to reunite them was actually going to have her go to them she was cool with it because she just wanted to be back with her sisters I legit cried did didn't you feel a little bit of The Craft be honest a little just but you know the three girls and the high school friends and they had some sort of falling out that was very crafty we're gonna make her do the witch stuff with us whether she likes it or not like a little there I don't feel like there was anything where no one wanted to do it though I just I don't know and like what you didn't feel like it was too musically I fully knew the first movie is not the greatest movie in the world it just isn't I adore Hocus Pocus for what it is but movie genius it is not and no and so I F and so I fully expected going into the second one I didn't expect that it was going to be by some miracle atic Masterpiece exactly exactly I I wanted it to kind of match the tone of the first one I wanted it to be campy and Goofy and childlike and and it really met all of those expectations and I just adored it and the goofiness you know the slapping Mary to make her smile go to the other side of her face I have a little factoid for that actually oh do tell in the movie Kathy and a jimy who plays Mary she does this little crooked thing with her mouth yeah and in the first movie it's always on the right side I believe but she was having a hard time when they came back to this movie doing her mouth the same way she couldn't do it on that side she could very easily do it on the on the left side uhhuh so in the beginning of the movie winred slaps Mary by accident during one of the the music scenes that and her crooked mouth goes to the other side because of the slap and it just kind of stays that way the rest of the movie I do want to say Sarah Jessica Parker is [ __ ] gorgeous oh my gosh they all looked fabulous I thought she was great and I died and I still love the part she was riding a Swiffer the Swiffer was great with the bubbles coming out the back and the two broom uh broomies the two broomies oh what are they called I can't think of what they're really called roombas yeah Roomba Roomba we have a Roomba and we got like a sticker to put on the top because they do have personalities I swear we talk to it like it's a pet don't let it eat your salt Circle so I just thought it was super funny when they said that it they had little Personalities in the movie that was great but they all looked fabulous but the part where they're they go into the one house to look for the daughter of the mayor the daughter yeah and Winfred says spread out and so Sarah starts like doing a split like spreading her arms wide and doing a split and the other two sisters just stare at her I love that part I I because I live in Salem now I'm butt hurt that none of it was filmed in Salem that seems a little silly I mean it's right there why not and I mean we all know why not they built sets across the border right down the road in Rhode Island where as I'm sure we can guess we're both from New York State we know the drill it's cheaper it's cheaper taxes and Licensing so I would imagine I am no Pro here but my my educated guess is it was probably cheaper for them to film it in Rhode Island and not here I wonder if it was also Poss safer due to not being such a public and and well-traveled location they would have had to shut down quite a few streets they did that for Hubie Halloween without an issue yeah I don't know I think it was down I honestly I think it it it has to be a cost thing oh absolutely absolutely you know I'm a little I'm a little hurt over that like at least in the first one maybe it wasn't all filmed here but like the house on Ocean Avenue and you know ropes mansion you know you could be like these in the film whereas in the second movie there is no location in Salem where you can go that was in that film zero a bummer they could have at least done some of the commons you know filmed some parts in the Commons right right and that's what I'm saying you know the first one the whole movie wasn't here but things were here and in this one there's no things here yeah that's and I find that to be a bummer well you know I guess we'll just have to be on opposite sides maybe our listeners can vote on if you have seen Hocus Pocus 2 what did you think did you love it did you hate it were you you know mixed feelings what were your favorite parts do you agree with shell or do you agree with Lila let's that's right let's just cut to the chase here does it get a thumbs up or a thumbs down Lila gives it a strong thumbs up I give it 3.5 witch hats out of five I give it no witch hats out of five oh I'm gonna change mine to four witch hats out of five then all right people we need your votes back me up here to kind of Circle back yes what do we want to tell these folks about first what we what what our experiences and some stuff about Proctor's ledge or some experiences and some history of gallows Hill where are we taking this friend well let's start with the history of gallows Hill why is it called Gallows Hill what is Gallows Hill do you wanna real quick tell people what a Gallows is first of all oh sure Gallows is another way of saying a a Hanging Place a thing that you can hang people on basically it's a us either a tree or a scaffolding that's built that you can hang a rope from and underneath it would either be like a wagon or a ladder or an actual platform that would be built for people to stand on and they would take that rope that was then hung over a tree and put it around the accused neck and they would either then kick the ladder away from their feet or drive the wagon away from their feet or they would open a door in the platform and they would fall through and that would cause them to hang to their death one thing geographically about Gallows Hill is um in modern day because as we've talked about in the past Salem of old and Salem of modern day are not the same um back in 1692 Salem encompassed parts of what's modern day peid and Danvers but modern day Salem Gallows Hill is I'd pretty much say probably the highest point in the city proper in Old Time Salem 325 some odd years ago 330 is years ago you're good at Ma something Gallows Hill was close enough to town to be seen and there was a main road that went by it either Essex Street or Boston street I'm not sure but there was a main road that went past it Boston Street Boston Street and it could be seen from the town but it wasn't so close that um you know that there were houses or anything right up next to it so Gallows Hill is very steep on one side and hard to kind of get to the top but that was for a long time thought to be the place where people had been hung and in in Massachusetts they did believe they believe they hung them from trees that were there and did not build any typee of uh longstanding Gallows it was just a rope over a tree and a ladder from the the history that I could find now one of the things I I showed you when we were up there that I just wanted to mention to people remember that I don't know what it was like maybe 8 n foot long by like six foot wide those two rocks one on top of each other yes people say that that is the site where Guile's Corey was pressed to death and you may think that that's true because there's these two big huge slabs one on top of each other and you would think to yourself oh yeah they could have put a body in between them let's be real folks there's like what did we count Lea like six different sites where they claim that gu was pressed to death Lea and I are not historians here folks we are not archaeologists and we don't know legit where he was actually pressed to death because there's so many theories but Gallows Hill is one of the rumored sites but I am almost thinking nowadays I don't maybe like when I first came to Salem I might have believed it and I did kind of think that that was it but now that I've been here a while and I've heard about some of the other sites and I've seen geographically where some of the other sites are I actually think that he was pressed to death at a different location which I will mention in our next episode when we talk about some of our final random locations we visited yeah I I agree and and we'll talk about it again more a little bit later but I also think that that Cory was pressed to death somewhere in the vicinity of the town he's your dude too man you love this guy do I do we'll talk about him later but I think it just made more sense that probably somewhere in the vicinity of the sheriff's house or the courthouse or something because he refused to put in a plea and that's why they did it so I don't think they would cart him all the way outside of town to to do the pressing they wanted him to change his mind and put in a plea so it makes more sense we'll talk about that in next episode other than Giles Corey who was prent somewhere in the vicinity of the Town most likely which is one of you know five or six different locations right Gallows Hill was long thought to be the location although someone in 1921 actually had a theory that it was somewhere else that it was at the bottom of that Hill actually now why did they have that theory is my question because with a name like Gallows Hill it kind of self-explanatory so where did this person come up with this Theory and why a couple different reasons one of the biggest ones is again getting to the top of gallows Hill would have been very difficult and they know from written accounts that the accused were taken from the jail put into like an ox cart right and then they traveled in that cart to the place where they were hung at the time there would have been no practical way to get an ox cart easily up that hill right and so just the GE geography of it didn't make any sense also they had written letters from people and written testimony of one of the accused who talked about seeing people who were hung there as they came into town and also people who talked about being in their homes who could see the hangings taking place from their house and so what they did was they recreated the cities they looked at Old historical documents uh I even saw an old postcard that showed Gallows Hill and they used this evidence to kind of determine where that spot was now I do have I do have something I want to mention and it's part of the reason why people thought that and maybe still do think that remember how when I remember I took you up to the park where the top Park which we'll talk about what we did up there in a few and then about halfway down we saw those baseball fields and then Proctor's ledge was at the bottom so remember those baseball fields about halfway down when they were making those fields I don't know when it was I want to say it was back in like the 60s um they actually found bone fragments in the area all around there that would suggest that people it kind of went with the whole Gallows Hill thing you know right because one of the things with Gallows Hill is after they hung these people they weren't allow they said it was um it was evil to touch them that their bodies Proper Burial and they weren't allowed so it's in the records it said that they were just dropped into a ditch at the at the bottom of the Gallows and their bodies were left there so that would kind of fit with what you're saying and it would because before that obviously before that ballpark that was just kind of a side Hill and I could see him just tossing them over the side so there is that but what could technically counter that story even more is that this is Massachusetts folks we are not the first people that were here and for all we know that actually could have been an Indian burial ground or something of that nature a few hundred years ago and that's could be what the bone fragments are but there are skeletal findings um halfway up Gallows Hill I know that there's no skeletal findings around Proctor's ledge and the reason for that is the dirt there is only about 3T deep which wouldn't have been deep enough to permit any burials right and also there are written records of people who talked about um particularly Rebecca nurse's um son or nephew uh there is a written account of him taking his boat rode his boat up the river to right near where her body was um which is another account that placed the location at Proctor's ledge because there's a Waterway within about 100 yards that's exactly right and it wouldn't have been accessible at the top of gallows Hill but there are several accounts where the families talked about most likely these people their bodies were recovered by the families undercover of night they would go in and take the bodies away um and there are several accounts where people spoke of doing that and theyve probably buried in unmarked Graves familial property would be my guest because they weren't allowed a cemetery burial so my guest would be familial property exactly yeah none of the accused are buried in any that we know of none of the accused have marked graves in any of the local old cemeteries so when we talk about burying Point um in our a couple episodes ago you know the big draw there is some of the judges are there the sheriff things of that nature but none of the actual accused witches are there because they were not allowed so yeah my guess is familial lands lovely thank you for this lovely hit by the way of what was this called again uh I gotta look at it again La Kush cake thank you since I was getting Tongue Tied I figured I'd get even more high and see if that fixes it yeah it will I promise take a few more hits it'll work like a charm one of the other quotes was um eyewitness testimony from uh some of the court records actually in 1692 a woman named Rebecca em who was one of the accused had been being taken to the court in a wagon and she was traveling along Boston Road which ran just by the execution site and while she was in court for her examination they asked her if she had witnessed the execution that had happened earlier that morning and she said that she was at the house below the hill and that she saw some folks at the execution now they determined that the house below the hill that she's referring to was probably the macter house which stood at 19 Boston street from looking at the old records they could deter determined that she would not have been able to see the top of gallows Hill from there but she would have had a very clear view of Proctor's ledge right and that would make sense because I mean we were just on Boston Street a half hour ago right you know I mean that would make sense because Boston street is about what was it a 100 yards from the practor ledge Memorial now this Memorial is is much like the memorial that we saw earlier this all bearing Point similar very similar it is another about waist high rock wall it has a tree in the center it's about it's a crescent shaped and it has the names in order of all the people that were killed uh during the salb witch hysteria and I didn't get the most fabulous pictures on the planet people but I will post a couple on Instagram we did go at night it's a very hard to get to spot it's right next to a Walgreens or across the street the problem it's behind greens but the problem is is that it's a one-way Street and you can't go up it from Boston street so you got to loop around Gallows Hill and come down it or park at Walgreens and walk over definitely worth it I loved being able to see both memorials and this one was nice because it was Private it was just us there um and it was really nice to kind of be there and to it's not downtown no and honestly stepping into that Crescent shape I know it's a new Memorial but there's more of a vibe there than what you get at the one at Old burying point in my opinion it is either right on the spot or right near the Spot close to it yeah and and there's there's the ditch there I mean all the the signs point to this so they're really sure that they've got the correct location but the nice thing is you sound like you're getting sad but I I do want to I did want to just kind of mention like you said in 2017 was when the memorial was created the City of Salem um through the community preservation act Grant spent 174,000 to create that Memorial that was kind of an an initiative by the then mayor we're not putting out any political politicians names we're just going to say the mayor at the time you know they they got this community preservation act Grant specifically to do this the mayor was quoted at the time saying that they wanted to do this because Salem is constantly looking to the lessons of its past whether it's through formation of our no place for hate committee or our landmarks uh with non-discrimination ordinances or through the Salem award Foundation the lessons we learn from our history directly inform the actions we make today so that was kind of her thought process don't forget what's happened in the past because we make the same freaking mistakes over and over history is one big circle of the same [ __ ] different day yeah quickly I want to just say that the plans for the site were developed by landscape architect Martha lion and that not just that Grant not just that $174,000 Grant but there was a lot of small donations just from local people and local organizations because everyone really felt that this was something that should happen and there's a single oak tree they said that the the tree the the young tree that we saw that was planted there is a it's an oak tree and they planted it there as a symbol of endurance and dignity oh nice we did talk about this a couple episodes back while maybe like 10 or 15 episodes back but I also wanted to point out that in the last year the uh last witch was exonerated so they have now basically said that none of the witches were guilty but it did take over 300 years for this very last one to get her pardon basically that did happen which was spearheaded by a group of eighth graders by the way wow yeah I remember we talked about that in one of our previous episodes that it's wonderful that it happened but sad that it took so long I know that right after they canceled the court of OA and terminer people started putting in pleas to Pardon these people and and some were granted early and some obviously took a very long time it depended on if you had family to fight for you to be honest and that was what happened with this person that was recently parted in the last year as there was nobody to fight for her so nobody did until this eighth grade class came along and made it a project that makes a lot of sense it makes total sense now both of these sites are rumored to be the sites of numerous hauntings I'm going to give you a quote this is a good one from Nathaniel Hawthorne Alice Don's appeal in 1835 he wrote this was the field where Superstition won her darkest Triumph the high place where our fathers set up their shame to the mournful gaze of generations far remote the dust of Martyrs was beneath our feet we stood on Gallows Hill wow right that's pretty intense right go Nathaniel hawth it's it's no wonder he's a best-selling author even still right Tim Maguire he owns the Salem night tour uhuh he says that Gallows Hill has been the site of multiple suicides and also sightings of Shadow People orbs people that go there say that they hear Eerie sounds people talk about feeling ghostly fingers go up their spine one thing I've heard from some of the people I've met in the time I've lived here uh neighborhood wise and and from my sweet darling love as well that's lived here his whole life on Gallows Hill is that that's also sometimes in the summertime in the woods around there homeless folks will live in the woods so aside from suicides unfortunately there's um like ODS and things of that nature and like I said for all we know prior to Salem being settled there could be Native American Spirits chilling around here as well sure there there were other people that lived here before for sure and I guess this could be explained by we'd have to say that some of this could definitely be explained if there are homeless people living in the area some of this could be you know because they talk about uh shrieks or thumping sometimes knocking that they'll hear and people do say they see fullbody ghosts but also I also will say you know as you've seen it's a very densely populated location Salem is very densely populated but that backside of gallows Hill as you saw is very wooded and currently right now in the year 2022 we have this weird coyote issue around here a lot of the coyotes are in those woods and they're in the woods behind the Witchcraft Elementary School and I've been outside at night partaking in a cigarette I'm bad I know everybody hates nicotine here we are and you can actually hear them in those woods so some of that could have been explained they might have thought they heard shrieking and it was really coyotes yeah so I couldn't find a lot of ghost stories or anything mostly stuff that could probably be explained a few other ways but definitely people say that they it's undeniable that they feel something when they go to that area now I want to tell you just briefly about a couple of of things I have felt when I've gone there and then and then you and I are going to talk about what what we have thought okay I've been up there multiple times I I usually try to go after dark or at dusk it's just my way you know my my boyfriend would tell me stories about how he used to sled down the hill so I'm like oh go show me the hill let's wait till it gets dark Remember Have you ever your boyfriend used to sled down Gallows Hill yeah in a tobogan that sounds awfully morbid I don't know what to tell you it was a thing it's actually a steep hill it's it is from what I saw it looks like a great Hill to go sledding down but if you get off the trail you hit a tree and pull a Sonny Bono and it's no good I don't feel alone up there ever but you have you ever been in the woods and and potentially on a hill I don't know if you've experienced this and and I wasn't I mean I smoke weed folks we know this but like I was not like tripping or anything have you ever seen the ground Bree when I was tripping no I was Stone Cold dead ass sober and I'm telling you [ __ ] ground breathes on Gallows Hill when you're walking down that steep slope the Tagan Hill the ground I I Lea I am I'm telling you I'm tell that sounds scary he saw it too he saw it too it wasn't just me like like have you seen ever seen that on TV like that [ __ ] happens up there in real life and I didn't see anything but I I I was being not necessarily in a bad way but I was being watched I was not alone you're not alone up there that's a common that's a common feeling even when people area the 19 whether they're the 19 people or not I can't tell you but I want you're not alone up there man yeah I agree I definitely felt that way in the past when I've been there and then just recently right near that full moon when you and I went up there at midnight because we're idiots [ __ ] around and find out but I swear to God that's the only time in my life I've ever with my own eyes other than on TV seen the ground breathe and let me tell you you know how I am I always want to [ __ ] around but then I'm so scared when I find out true it is that threw me that threw me because I had never seen that in person before and I've never I mean in Upstate New York how there's Woods freaking damn everywhere I've never seen that until Gallows Hill wow that's kind of trippy that's really trippy I don't think that would have anything to do with with the 19 people but I'm just saying there's something up with that land whether it has to do with those 19 people or not I think that's the common consensus is that area that whole hill the whole entire thing Proctor's ledge included Gallows Hill all of it has a Vibe it definitely has a spooky eerie there's something here Vibe maybe that's why they chose that spot they may have thought they chose it because it was just outside of town but I think something in that Hill drew them to there and that's why they decided to kill those innocent people there I think that Hill is spooky especially when you look at the old maps of Salem and how it did Encompass parts of pey and danas Salem was a huge ass place back then why out of all places are they coming up here on the top of that hill right exactly exactly because we drove up the road and that was Steep and that's a modern day Road that's paved can you imagine either walking up that or doing a horse and carriage up that on a dirt road right right which is even getting to Proctor's ledge going on Boston Street would have been a little difficult but you know I guess if and a hike so if they if they had wanted to make it a a spectacle to the place that would not have been the place to make it a spectacle I don't think well I guess you know people driving by as they drove their Carri by it you know you'd have to drive right by it to get into to get into town kind of I don't know but I do feel that something about that Hill is off agreed I just don't think gu's Corey was pressed at the top that's all I agree I completely agree it's a it's a silly place to kind of drag somebody to to press them to death there's closer places I'm sure especially thinking you're gonna hopefully drag him back to jail didn't happen or take him to court so after we did our little tours and we walked around in the daylight we tell them what we did tell them what we did tell them what we did we decided because we're very high witches that we needed to make a Ouija board not not go not use one that we had or that I had here yeah no we make one that's how we do yeah you got cardboard you got a Sharpie here we are we're making one and don't worry folks I'm going to put a picture of the one we made up on Instagram and then we proceeded to bind the everliving magic out of it I don't think I protected something so much in the last 10 years to be honest yeah me either I kind of knew as we were putting on like the black salt and the sea salt and the sage from your garden and it was pretty sure we might be going a little overboard but you know I I kind of felt like considering where we were going to go with it maybe we needed it and we knew full well that we probably were opening a Pandora's box but we were like let's just make our own Ouija board and go to Gallows Hill isn't that what people do so that's exactly what we did we made ourselves a Ouija board we made a beautiful little planet and we saged and smudged and salted that [ __ ] and then we waited till midnight off we went and off we went to Gallows Hill to a nice little spot right in the Moonlight and we set up our Ouija board we set up some recording devices to catch some emps there'll be pictures on Instagram people you need to check it out St hour Instagram go look at the pictures because they're good now we set up in the Moonlight we get our EVP recordings going and we place our fingers on the planchet and I immediately started feeling tingles we didn't get a lot of movement it almost felt like reluctant sludy sludgy yeah that's exactly right it was it was like they were trying to come through from a long way away or or fogy or something like if there was like a heavy magnet yeah feel sludgy is the only word I can think of sludgy is an excellent way to put it so we tried a little bit there and it was really sludgy so then we kind of packed up we moved to a different spot and things started to come through a little clear still kind of sludgy but where we moved to where we started off we were kind of hidden between trees and where we move move to like the full moon was shining right on the Ouija board like what did we expect here people we're in a circle of Moonlight and this young man starts coming through and it's it's sludgy still but we're starting to get some answers and get some you know get some movement out of this playing chat and I don't know about you but every once in a while I was getting like chills right up the hand that was touching that planet and I I remember there was a well right in the beginning we both kind of lifted off the planet at the same time and it still moved to the next letter and neither of us just saying nobody was touching the planet and I'm like uh did we just [ __ ] up bad and we both put our hands like right back on it but it did feel like though after I don't know what what would you say maybe five minutes or so it felt like we lost them but then it almost felt like something someone I shouldn't say something that's rude someone El came there was after it was was like a sudden disconnect not when we took our hands off and put them back but shortly after that it was almost like a sudden disconnect like someone hung up the phone on you exactly and like mids sentence it felt like and then there was like a a blank space for a little bit like nothing much was happening the sludgy feeling was gone and then I felt like someone else started to come through and I don't know what it just felt different almost like I don't want to say it kind of nudged the first one out but kind of nudged the first one out like hey I'm the one who wants to do the talking here move along here pal Move Along right right it felt definitely more powerful stronger I'm not sure but uh it felt like the first one it felt like the first one was more like a I don't know how to say it but quote unquote like a younger Spirit and the second one felt like more like a older spirit I agree I agree I felt like we made contact with three distinct Spirits the first was a woman and the second was like a younger man and the third I think was an older man woman I thought that I thought the other one was an older man absolutely yeah I thought it was an older man but I wasn't 100% sure so that yeah I would I would definitely go with that because the vibe was kind of like grumpy pissed off old man was kind of the vibe I got but he's the one that almost made the energy before him end it felt like he ended that energy like he's the one that hung up the phone GED himself yeah you're done here move along yeah oh yeah oh absolutely thought he was almost like cranky that we had Disturbed him or that we were there with us yeah he was mad at us for being there or almost like if you call somebody late at night he was mad that he was mad we called his house and the phone rang kind of you know was kind of like that like the kid answered the phone in the beginning and wanted to chat and then Dad got woken up and was like what the [ __ ] are you calling us at this time of night kind of annoyance yeah because I very much felt an annoy like you could tell this was an annoyed spirit I agree yeah absolutely and then you know that one too went away and I and I could only feel sludging after that I kind of have to think that maybe that sludgy my fault my fault the effect of a couple witches throwing one too many protective things now basically wrapped that Ouija board in magical wool and then expected spirits to get through I suppose it's better to have done too much than not enough think of it that way but I think we did more than what we would have wanted because we really we were looking for some hardcore and we protected ourselves too much agreed I agree and I think maybe that site being not I mean there's there's something there for sure and we definitely felt it but I think it we could have gone to some different spots and maybe that were're a little more or maybe we could have been a little less paranoid but also folks we do want to just make note that the park at Gallows Hill is closed at dusk do not listen to us please do not trespass after dusk us doing a Ouija board uh work related investig work related there you go we had a work rated pass officer I swear I mean if we were there during the daytime we could have bounced around all over but you know we don't want to be all like trespassing and stuff yeah we only did a little of that maybe some minor rule breaking we bent the rules we didn't break them just bent them that's magic it's bending [ __ ] but it was a lot of fun and we still have the Ouija board and maybe we'll have to like encase it in something and ship it off to uh the witchboard guy yeah the witb museum I definitely just wanted you know I know people get all all weirded out about Ouija boards and stuff and and I do want to absolutely point out to folks that yes we do feel like we connected with a couple of spirits but no we do not feel like they had any connection to the Salem Witch Trials whatsoever no none whatsoever one of them felt like it was probably very old could have been couple hundred years old possibly but I I don't feel any witchiness no connection no none whatsoever nobody would rather come back to you folks and tell you that it was all that we just connected with all the witches more than Lea and I would that's I wanted to speak to Giles man you wanted to know where he was really pressed right come on Corey you could have come back and told me something but unfortunately the reality is we just weren't pulling anybody related to The Witch Trials here and and honestly in your time here I think that's been a constant we've never really felt any of those we've felt stuff but not necessarily stuff related to Wi and pieces here and there you know bits and pieces they're definitely there The Echoes are there very much so but I think the hauntings all around Salem aren't necessarily witch related and there's hauntings folks do not get me wrong and they're everywhere up and down every street but are they all witch trial related that's yet to be seen folks I do have to say when we left one of the things we made sure to do was to close our Circle we had been reading that we had been using the Ouija board in and kind of thanked the land and and let go and I have to say I had turned off the recording I must have turned it back on again but I have a snippet as we're leaving where I turned around and kind of did that severing spell and oh interestingly enough it cut off don't tell me that oh my God I'm gonna be freaked out creepy cool creepy cool it's just like a it's just like a really short clip 22 seconds and I don't remember having turned on the recording I don't remember turning off the recording recording but it recorded just before that and it kind of cut off when I said all ties are severed severed is severed wow fun but yeah so we did we made sure to close the circle made sure to cut all ties with any entities that came in we highly recommend doing that if you ever get a chance to do your own [ __ ] around and find out with find out at least cast a circle and do [ __ ] proper yeah yeah that works so but it was a lot of fun I mean going up to Gallows Hill in the Moonlight and putting our homemade Ouija board down and being able to do Circle and and kind of look for Spirits with you again was so much fun we had a blast I mean every single thing we've done in Salem so far has been Rock Solid awesome and there's so much more I want to do it's I don't have enough time I'm gonna have to come back we are gonna do one more episode where we're gonna talk about some random places that we visited maybe not as high-profile but some really cool other places that we visited and that is what we're going to wrap up our Salem visit with you in our month in October and in our our awesome Halloween October special

right now I have a suggestion for Leila and all of our listeners will agree if anybody has watched the new Netflix series The Watcher OMG Leila you got to do the Watcher tell us tell real story I already had the Watcher in the works yes but then they scooped me man everybody's seen that every the do got tell us the real story you're going to have to tell us the real story of of the watch it's pretty creepy I'll definitely get on that and also the dmer yeah uh that guy was nuts I didn't realize how crazy he was yeah that's a sad one I I haven't gotten into that one because that one makes they all make me sad but that one there was so many opportunities where they could have caught him and they just didn't listen to these kids but anyway a lot of cool net you know Netflix and other channels have especially this time of year if you're into ghoulish tales and creepy crimes this is a good time of year for all of that you can kind of binge it to your heart's content I will admit I haven't watched dmer and I don't know if I can well and I have to admit not a fan of Hocus Focus too folks thumbs up it was awesome I loved it loved it all right let's let we need to let these people get back to their lives for today yeah and I gotta maybe I need some more weed or something I'm I'm pretty hot my my eyes are all closing over here yeah anyway all right so we need to we need to pack a couple more bongs folks so we got to get out of here we will see you next week for episode 40 be there because say why not we're here we'll see you next week for episode 40 stay high stay happy do you really think that two seasoned witches should be making a homemade Ouija board off cardboard and going to Gallows Hill with it tonight on a full moon well here we are and we're going to do it and we're going to see but as you can see got the sea salt sea salt got some fresh plucked Sage fresh plucked Sage got our quartz crystal on there so I don't know let's see what happens it's a good idea sh I think it's a good idea it's a very good idea sh it might not be a good idea it's probably a really bad idea I really want to find out though yeah me too okay we're going to do this yeah we're going to do it so tonight we're going to Gallows Hill which is what like less than a mile from where we're sitting right now oh absolutely about a quarter of a mile away a quarter of a mile okay quarter of a mile from where we're sitting right now you know what it seems like a good idea to have a Ouija boards so how this kind of came about was I have a really beautiful one here and we don't really want to get it dirty or yucky or trpes to the neighborhood with it and somehow that led to making a handmade Ouija board [Laughter] that's a good idea out of a piece of cardboard and a Sharpie marker and it is beautiful and we will post a picture of it because it's precious we should keep it for a very long time if we make it through the night yes we should it should have an honored place on your altar it's going to have to resin we could do it in resin and like keep it forever that would actually be super cool that actually would be super cool if we get anything on it tonight we're incasing that [ __ ] in resin now here's here's the thing okay okay right ining it in resin if we get anything from it now this we don't recommend this for the faint of heart or to the newly witch person this is not for a baby witch like actually we don't recommend this for for anybody we usually highly recommend against this on our podcast and several times in the process of coming up with this idea we've talked about how this is a bad idea a very bad idea as we still move forward as we continue to do it but this is what happens when you get sh and Lea in the same location we are in the same location we are in the same location and that's why we're [ __ ] around and finding out out yeah yeah there's going to be a lot of that going on tonight so some of our preparations are we have some fresh stage from Shell's Garden we do we have beautiful sea salt that was procured by Shell's glorious love yeah that is also gracing our board and a beautiful Crystal from back in our coven days yes and we also do have some uh black salt on there because well you never can be too cautious that's right that's right shell was talking in one of our most recent podcasts about making salt this isn't one that she made but it is pretty easy to make and making colored salts can really enhance your spell work so then we you know we were talking about some different stuff and I was getting scared I was scaring Myself and I think we might we don't want to overprotect this so that we get nothing so I think we're going to go with what we've got just our little sage and salt and quartz crystal Vibe going on and then I think if [ __ ] gets real I have faith in our magical abilities that we can handle it without any other stuff I do as well it it might be the full moon we might be in Salem we might be going to Gallows hill with a homemade Ouija board but we've got each other yeah yeah I I have faith I have faith so we're actually going to post some videos of this um at some point so absolutely we will probably post some Snippets here [Music] soon okay beginning recording for EVP session for Gallows Hill on the full moon shell and I in Salem so I'm going to set this phone down we're going to record if anybody's here you can talk into this microphone say anything you want answer our questions let us know what's going on okay you ready I'm ready [Music]
