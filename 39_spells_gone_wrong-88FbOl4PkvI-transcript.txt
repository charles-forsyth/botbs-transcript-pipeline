awesome so stuff about like how to tell if your spell went wrong and what to do to make sure your spell doesn't go wrong yeah it doesn't work that's how you know you know and it nothing happens right welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and I'd like to just let you all know that apparently tonight's going to be a silly night and guess what we're talking about tonight we are talking about about spells gone wrong I feel like this should be like a an insert to a girls gone wild episode any gen xers out there that's immediately what they're going to think of because that's where my brain went absolutely how do you think I came up with the title of this episode so yes this evening we're going to talk about spells that shell and I have done that have gone wrong in my case it exploded spectacularly so I knew immediately it had gone wrong I like to draw out my disappointment I like to just wait and wait and wait and wait and just realize  nothing's happening yeah that's another way to tell it went wrong so yeah one a fiery explosion one a long drawn out painful bummer so we'll get to those a little later in the episode but first we're going to talk a little bit about spellcraft and what possibly might make your spells go wrong now I'm going to start with the obvious I love being Captain Obvious you know it it suits me motivation and that's where I sometimes go wrong you know sometimes you're doing this half-ass stuff and I've got a great example for you recently as you are aware I tried to do a freezer spell yes you did in my freezer actually I I did use your freezer actually I did two freezer spells because I I still have one sitting in your freezer and I've got one sitting in my freezer now you're gonna ask yourself he why did shell do two for the same intent question why is she still lingering on this I'm gonna tell you why folks because I did that  half ass I was busy and I was like oh you know I know what I'm doing I got this I'm just gonna like throw this all together and then I got to do yeah and here I sit needing to do my third damn freezer spell on the same person and I'm like huh I wonder what went wrong um I'm half fast so lesson learned need to get it together need to regroup need to do this in a actual real Spell workking manner no half-ass and put the actual time and intent into it that is needed for it to actually work yes and that's the very first two things that I would point out is if your spell doesn't work you should check what your intent was was it specific enough did you ask for something too broad did you ask for too much and did you put any energy into it the art of magic is manipulating energy right it's it's changing energy to your will and if you don't put any energy into that the Universe has nothing to work with so Shell's spell sometimes will work if she half-asses it if she's got enough maybe emotional energy or power energy behind it but unless she intentionally raises energy and pushes it into that spell there's no power to it and didn't and I know I didn't and I about it later you know yeah here we are sometimes life gets in the way but yeah if you're waiting and waiting that might be why maybe you didn't raise enough power to do that spell so give me an example of some other than intention or motivation something else that could make it go wrong so to say or not work or fizzle out into the Starry Sky well just like we were talking about needing to raise energy to push that into the spell you also kind of have to meet the universe or your gods or your Spirit guides halfway when you ask them for something like a good example I read on the internet I apologize I saw it from a bunch of people so I'm not going to name you all but a few people said that doing a spell without trying to also do the mundane things along with it is like saying I did a spell for fertility in order to have a baby and nothing's working and then your friend says well how often are you having sex and you say sex what's that exactly it's not going to work no matter how strong your spell is how good your intent how much energy you raise if you don't meet the universe halfway and do the mundane things along with that spell it's not GNA work prob you gen xers just revert back to Kenny Loggins Meet Me Halfway I don't think I even know that song are you kidding me no oh whoa uh oh so you know one thing that I have had um a couple people ask me that have had spells not work spells go wrong is did I not use the right tools or the right ingredients to that I say really because you don't need I mean I I love tools I love I love things I love sparkly things I'm one of those people are they necessary absolutely not no and do we love them anyway absolutely absolutely but if you used a butter knife instead of an aame so what or if you use cinnamon instead of sage quer sah it's about your intention more than anything so when people ask what if I didn't use the right tool or ingredient to that I say has no bearing on your outcome I agree 100% of all the things that could cause your spell to go wrong using the wrong herb or the wrong color candle or the wrong tools is the absolute last thing you should look at are there some crystals and some herbs that are very strong and could influence things a little bit sure but for the most part no ition intention overrides all that I think absolutely especially if you have written your intention to be specific let's talk about that a little bit actually um making sure your intention is something that the Universe can work with magical energy flows through the path of least resistance if magic runs into obstacle after obstacle it's just not going to work for you say for example you are asking the universe for $110,000 that's very specific that's a very big ask in order for something like that to happen a lot what are you put what are you putting in place to make that $10,000 manifest because that ain't coming out of in air exactly exactly to have the magic work for that there's a lot of obstacles it might not work that way so that could cause a spell to fizzle but if you say something more to the effect of I am receiving enough abundance to take care of myself and my bills and my family I am open to abundance and prosperity from the universe that gives the universe a lot of leeway to fix that for you or to give you that wish that spell so you really need to be kind of specific but not too specific now I just want to bounce to a different a different subject matter same same concept but all over the internet all you ever see is love spells my love spell didn't work I'm more I did this spell and he still doesn't like me so I want to address why things of that nature don't work that's a good one first and foremost your intentions so we just said your intention means everything I I still stand by that but you can also not change the will of others yeah their intention means everything too if it is not their will and intention to be open to said love spell ain't G to work anyway you can't you can't make people feel or want a certain way and have that have that work out for you and if you did pull enough energy to make someone feel feel a certain way that's a big no no to a lot of different practices it's not a good thing and again it kind of follows the idea that magic takes energy and to have enough energy to overpower someone's will that's a lot I mean think what it would take to wrestle that person to the ground physically and that's kind of what you're talking about magically you're going to try and wrestle their will to the ground so you have to raise a lot of energy to do that it's not easy so bouncing back to some personal experiences and bad choices remember that time when I did such a thing and kind of ended up in a relationship that was toxic at best oh yes oh yes I got what I wished for and man did I regret it what was I think why would I have done I knew better why didn't you stop what the hell come on where did you go wrong in the spell what do you think you did that caused it to go bad I directed it it wasn't it wasn't the idea of what I wanted it was that I was directing it at a specific person and the ship had kind of sailed with that specific person and I at that point and I was trying to push an issue and you got what you wanted yeah and 10 years later I paid the price for it yeah so yeah in the moment I was like haha that spell worked and then I was like what the flipping crap did I do why did I put myself in that situation sometimes you have to be very careful what you ask for because you just might get it oh lesson learned on that one and that was probably what 20 years ago now I will never in my life ever do a love spell for anybody me friend family stranger no can do sister ain't happening because that is it never works out and just because you have enough power or energy to manipulate do it exactly exactly doesn't mean it's GNA work out for you or them you you wiped the tears you know yeah it was not a fun time not a fun time so for love spells what can you do to make sure that they don't go wrong now this is where I I love Practical Magic great movie it is a great movie you know and and that's a perfect example of a love spell that that I would not shun oh yeah that one scared me when I saw it but it wasn't it wasn't to a specific person it was to the concept of I want this type of relationship and this type of love and this type of Oh I thought you were talking about the woman who came to the back door and the Ants were like I'll get the pigeon I'll get the oh je no and that woman and she said I want him to love me so much he can't stand it or something to that effect and my heart just chilled I got chills now thinking about it that's that's scary that's a scary level of love that's not really what someone wants you need therapy kind of scary right that sounds like a a recipe for a stalker or someone who's obsessed with you in an unhealthy unfun way no no I was talking about the Sandra Bullock love spell you know oh I want a man who who has a Talisman that's a star and blue eye and green yeah like that kind of you know you're not trying to manipulate a person's will you are trying to bring a healthy relationship and love and emotional fulfillment and whatever the hell you define as happiness to you and not I want that person to feel this way about me well it's funny you say that because the spell that I did that went spectacularly wrong was also love spell but it was that kind of love spell so I'm going to tell you what I did so this particular spell I decided I was going to write all the qualities down that I wanted in a lover all right Sandra Bullock right mine wasn't as cool as hers at this time in my life I was huge into writing things on candles I would love to take a candle and using the fuark runes I would spell out my intention and carve it into the candle and so I did that you know that I was looking for love and then I took my herbs I think it was um Canabis seeds and there was Dragon let's see cannabis seeds dragon's blood lavender rose sandalwood and some Puli oil and I grounded all up in my mortar and pestle and I coated it on the candle and I had some left over so then what I did was I took a piece of paper a square piece of paper and on it I wrote all the qualities just like Sandra Bullock that I wanted in this lover then I folded it up in an origami water balloon and I'll put instructions on how to do that so basically it makes like a box with a little tiny hole in the top like a balloon out of paper like how we used to make little box notes in the late 80s early 90s yeah I follow you puffs up like a box yeah yeah yeah cool okay so I poured the rest of the herbs inside this box that had all these qualities that I wanted in it and while I'm doing my chanting and the candle is burning I put this rocks on top of my incense charcoal and starts smoldering and the smoke is going and I'm like yeah this is awesome this is great and things are going awesome until a few seconds later and it starts popping and exploding and there's burning paper going all over my room and it sounds like there's some sort of firefight going on in my cast iron cauldron pot seeds they're popping of course I had picked pot seies I liked the idea of a seed as a new beginning something starting you know I wanted a chill kind of hippie guy and so I thought like popcorn yeah even though I ground them up apparently I did not grind them enough and they started exploding everywhere thankfully nothing caught on fire much everybody was safe I put it out and I figured that was the end of that spell it definitely did not feel like it worked that was not a good sign until well it wasn't I wasn't ready at the time I did the spell and as pissed off as I was at the time it took like a month or two for me to realize what went wrong and it wasn't just that I didn't grind up the pot seeds it was that I wasn't really ready I I had a lot of healing to do I had some Shadow work on relationships and to do before I was ready I I think that people tend to turn to love Magic first because it's kind of a universal thing but it is definitely probably the type of magic I would be the most cautious with because if anything is going to backfire it's G to be love magic yeah yeah maybe because we just do so much of it I don't know but thankfully mine let me know that I had other things to work on first old relationship baggage and I needed to deal with first before I started looking for that guy now let's switch from from spells to rituals gone wrong sure you have an example of an actual ritual ual gone wrong you mean like the ones where we'd get out to the ritual space for community and the entire group that said they were sponsoring that ritual just never showed up and we'd have to whip something out of our butts last minute well you know in in our defense they were sometimes the greatest greatest rituals ever that's true we did have a lot of fun with those sometimes spontan is not a bad thing there's nothing wrong with just some spontaneous magic making wasn't the intention you know you you get an invite to go to a ritual you kind of expect there to be a ritual but you know hey life happens that's right yeah like you said they were often very very fun I don't want to say one that went wrong but I do recall a ritual and and it was it was definitely a a more private ritual so I won't go into detail but somehow it ended up in giggle fits and um what do they call stick fight in the woods oh okay yeah I remember that one well yeah okay that's a good point what if you're doing a ritual a super serious ritual and things get silly and things get silly somebody forgets their lines somebody starts laughing what do you do go with it you just keep going yeah I mean honestly if that's where the Energy's at that's where the energy is at and that should be if you're Advanced enough to be doing a ritual with a group of people or even if you've just gathered a bunch of newbies and friends together and have decided to do rituals someone's going to need to kind of step into that high priestess role whether that's your actual title or not someone needs to watch the energy of the circle and and kind of see where everybody's Vibe is at see where everybody's energy is flowing and keep it going in the direction where the circle goes I mean that's kind of the benefit I guess of having a a high priestess or a group of people that you can work with because then that person has worked with that type of energy and usually obviously we've had our moments where it didn't work but usually can direct that energy into a productive Direction and kind of in a where you think a ritual might have gone wrong would be you know Leila and I are planners like nobody's business do not get me wrong we may sound we may sound all foot loose and fancy free but when we want to plan something we are the most organized individuals known to man sometimes you have a rock Sol ID plan and this is what we're going to do and this is how it's going to flow and This is Our intention and that's all well and good but then when you get the group together the intention in the energy that you plan for isn't the intention in the energy of the moment and you might think your ritual went wrong but really all you're doing is redirecting and kind of accommodating for the mood and the energy to still stick with your base in ition so it's not necessarily that things go wrong but I think flexibility is is definitely something that if you're not flexible you're going to think that you fail more often than you really do I love that too for outcomes because a lot of times you'll do a spell or a ritual and the outcome will look very differently than you think it should yeah maybe you asked for money and what you got instead was a new job sometimes what you ask for and what your intention is you don't get it in the ways that you expect oh yeah for example um I know someone who had had this car shitty car tons of problems they were constantly hanging up uh little charms and things to make sure that the car worked great well you know One Summer Night car gets totaled at first they were like why didn't my protection spells stop me from getting hit by this drunk driver and then they realized that what they did get was an insurance check for a surprisingly large amount that allowed them to buy a way better much safer more reliable car not only did they get in a head-on collision and walked away with just a couple bruises but they were also able to get a completely new much safer car so I mean I know that's an extreme example but sometimes things will look differently than you think it's supposed to interesting right think that I think that that's one thing that that people don't realize and again another reason why people think that their their spell is failing because they are getting the result but not in the form in which they expected wanted hoped for whatever you know you may do a love spell and put it out to the general universe and end up adopting a puppy three weeks later exactly you ask for the love of your life it's not my fault it's a German Shepherd you know or or maybe you know a family member or someone that you haven't spoken to in a while will contact you and and will heal an old wound and rekindle that familial love you know it might not be exactly what you ask for and you know actually funny story I had done a lot of intentional work when I had first moved to Salem um about getting back on the broomstick ironically enough and what ended up happening was you and I got this together as opposed to what I expected you know what I'm saying it was outcome yeah and and okay say here's an example of a spell that I did when I I needed some cash and so I did a quick spell and I just asked I just need a little money to get me through and I think I found a quarter outside the grocery store but the fun part is I found a quarter on the ground every day for like a week and it almost felt like the universe was  with me at that point well then there's aspect of ritual and spellwork sometimes it's just not time you know and sometimes the universe will kind of put the brakes on what you're doing because you're not ready you're not in the right position you're not in the right spot you're not mentally prepared whatever the case may be sometimes the universe is like whoa whoa whoa you could be doing all the spell workk you want but it ain't your time yet and there's nothing you can do yeah sometimes you're working with your deity and you're asking for okay let's say the love of of your life and your spell blows up because you're not ready for the love of your life you're not in the right head space or the right emotional space for that so they're going to make that spell not work and not to kind of harp on love spells but I had known someone who was in a a very stressful relationship and did a spell to kind of alleviate that and the result was divorce that alleviated the stress it did but that was not that person's intention right they thought that it was more of a kiss and makeup well yeah as far as lawyers in court go yeah right so I do recommend when you're doing a spell to be kind of specific in in how you word it and and you might hear a lot of people say word it like you already have it if you're asking for something not only word the spell as if you already have this I have graduated from college with full honors and I'm calm and relaxed and happy about my achievements you know visualize that you have it and use positive words because your brain will latch on to those words so if you say I am not stressed your brain hears stressed so you want to say something more like I am calm I have Serenity in my life I have abundance you know don't say I need money to pay my bills because I'm broke because your brain hears bills broke now positive words you just gave away all the secrets of how I get through the stress of my mundane work day you know I thought it was large amounts of tea and coffee I chugged down the tea at work but you know you just give that I am going to be happy and smile no matter what you throw at me because if I start acting like then all I'm going to attract is that's a good point and as much as intention is everything so isn't your attitude you know if you have a bad attitude these things aren't going to work out or they're going to work out in a negative way and if you have a positive attitude like for like you know like attracts like if if you just let the fall off and you just stay positive and and and keep that smile on your face you're gonna just eventually attract good things Universe ain't gonna fight you for too long so you when you write your spell to make sure to give it the best odds to work you want to make sure that you have a clear intent that's not too outrageous and not too vague you know if you're asking for a million dollars a lot of things have to move move in the world for you to get a million dollars so that's not very likely to happen but if you ask for enough money that you live comfortably that gives the universe a lot of leeway to work for things you're G to want to meet the universe halfway you have to put energy into it as I keep learning over and over you get out what you put in if you put nothing in you get nothing out so you have to raise that energy and put that energy into it yep and you have to raise a big part of it magically magical energy obviously is part of your spell and the the rest of it you have to do in the mundane world and when you're raising that energy keep in mind that if you just throw that freezer spell in the freezer toss it in a baggie and pop it in the freezer without much energy behind it sh I did it twice I know you're only giving a tiny bit of energy to the universe to work with in my defense I was rushed for time both times good point very good point but you have to put enough energy into it to get it to work right did you visualize the outcome did you embody it are you feeling it are you using language that says that you have this type of thing while you're putting out that energy and I've I've actually done spells where I've put a little sticky note on the mirror um is a reminder of the outcome that I am looking to see you know the outcome I'm seeking because that daily visual reminder I don't want to say sets it in stone with the universe but that was my mindset yeah oh I love those I mean spell jars as touchstones candles that you burn every day or a certain time little touchstones like that can help keep that energy fresh in your and your deity's minds absolutely absolutely so you know put the time in put the energy in put the intention in and know that you need to be as flexible as the universe and sometimes the universe is mysterious and works in very strange ways so be prepared for that too if you'd like to tell us about any of your spells gone wrong we would be super interested so we know we're not the only weirdos out there email us at back onthe broomstick
