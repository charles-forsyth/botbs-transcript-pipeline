welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to episode 50 of back on the broomstick I'm Lea wow 50 and I am sh and I am shocked at the number 50 right can you believe it I am I'm very impressed with us we've lasted over a year you know I'm not really that surprise and let me tell you real quick why because I love you and you love me and this is really just us hanging out so how would it not be great that's very true you did push for this from the very beginning and I was just like who's going to want to H hang out with us while we just talk and reminisce about witchy  just do it just do it so we did and we found our people and I'm loving it well to all of our listeners out there thank you thank you and I appreciate you helping me prove Lea wrong and thank you all for the birthday wishes that was really cool I loved seeing all of those you're amazing and to all my birthday twins happy birthday to us and happy birthday to all you February aquarians out there I was actually jealous I was like man I wish it was my birthday everybody's wishing Lea happy birthday and here I am so I can't wait till it's my birthday damn it well it kind of almost was your birthday just before our oneyear anniversary because I surprised us both with beautiful custommade sister brooms from The Hags Monica and hesper over at three Moon brooms who make gorgeous gorgeous bason now guys I have a funny story for you here real quick so if if you're a regular listener and if you're not go back to the last few episodes because this was a running story Leila tortured me for weeks weeks weeks it was glorious oh I got a present I'm not g to tell you what it is haa loved every second of it that made me sit all day the day it got delivered gets delivered at 10 in the morning she makes me wait till like 5: in the afternoon before I'm allowed to open it is I'm staring at this thing all day just so I could get a video of her opening it and she's she's like laughing having a good time with it I get my broom guess whose broom doesn't show up Leila's so yeah I kept ripping her and saying oh this is your karmic retribution you want to pick on me you ain't getting your broom and I kind of put some out there inadvertently so be careful what you say out loud folks a week and a half went by and Lea still didn't have a broom and I really started to actually see tears come from her eyes I was sad now folks I had named this broom I had seen these babies from reception I worked with The Hags over at three Moon brooms to design these down to the last tiny little detail they were created as a pair specifically for shell and I to my exacting specifications when I saw the first pictures of these brooms and knew which one was mine I knew immediately we were soulmates her name was hagatha and we were meant to be together until the United States Postal Service got involved yeah I had watched Shell's relig ly making sure it got there on time just fully expecting mine would get here too and when it didn't that day of course I check the tracking numbers and poured over everything and The Hags assured me they had never lost a broom so I got angry a few times with the postal service because they would say they were looking for it they were testing that theory they were testing Theory and testing my last nerve for sure but they were persistent and unfortunately I got an email from them saying despite their best efforts they were unable to locate hagatha she had disappeared but on the same day Lea got this email I happened to pay Ila a visit in person the witch is hanging it had been a week and a half I was starting to feel bad because here I have this glorious broom that that was gifted to me and she's over here crying a tear because she never got hers I literally we were sitting down together and I literally had to put out there I'm like release Leila from her karmic debt we jokingly were like you have to let it go shell you have to let let this go so I can get her back I put so much for the time before on this is your karma this is your karma ha well apparently I I I did some bad stuff to you and I had to release your karmic debt you did I leave the next day guess what so despite the fact that they sent me a letter saying that hagatha was lost to the postal universe and that I should just apply for the insurance payment I tried to tell them this is a one of a kind item made as part of a set there's no possible way you can replace it with money they don't give a they didn't care but the very next morning hagatha showed up on my doorstep you know what I think it is I think that hagatha the broom decided I lifted your karmic debt she saw how pissed off why am I calling it a she she saw how she is she she got pissed off at that point at the postal service and she flew her damn self to your house she did she knew she was meant to be mine and she knew she had to be here and so despite everything she made it thank you hags Monica thank you hags thank you Lea like I can't even tell you guys I'm gonna post pictures of of both Leila and my room you're gonna be blown away they're gorgeous and all of you that sent energy to have hagatha come home thank you I appreciate it it worked it did and they are worth it it was worth it I don't know where she went but apparently she needed to go on a trip before she got to me but she's home now Lea what's what is the the lesson we've learned here don't torture me man oh no it'll probably still happen again I mean I'm fully prepared for the consequences man it was way too much fun all right all right all right so now that we've got our brooms squared away magical beautiful wonderful brooms I also want to talk about something that I brought up briefly in our last episode where we talked about tarot and journaling I had made a comment just quickly in that episode about QR codes on your Tarot deck and that if you buy a Tarot deck that has a QR code and does not come with a booklet there's a very good chance that it's a counterfeit deck there is nothing worse in all the world um you know I know people like to go straight to the you know the creator of the deck misses out on on their cut of the profit for fakes and all that I get that part but from a witchy spiritual aspect it pisses me off because they are taking something that people hold sacred and special and look at as a magical tool and they're making it I don't want to say they're making it  but kind of yeah and and they're definitely abusing someone's magic and hard work to make a book yeah and I I don't love that I don't love that at all so we got a message from a gentleman named David who mentioned that he had purchased the uncommon Tarot by Shaheen Meo at a local metaphysical shop and he had heard on the podcast that if it had a QR code to download the book that it might be a counterfeit and unfortunately his had come with a QR code now I know that that deck is put out by wiser and it actually does come with a book it should come with a book by Teresa Reed who I believe did the tarot Journal that you and I are both loving yeah so unfortunately not only did he miss out on a book he missed out on a fabulous this book by Teresa Reed and the deck itself probably is not as glorious as the one by artist Shaheen Meo now I want to point something out for folks It Isn't So Much QR code equals bad because I have been seeing there are some that are coming out like the some of the low Scarboro ones are coming out with tarot with uh QR codes but you are looking for an ISBN number if it has an ISBN number you know it's legit and if it does not and that's right on the Bo and you can look that up online and check and see if it is the correct ISBN for the deck that you purchased and and like shell said sometimes you'll get a deck that's maybe an indie deck or maybe it's a self- printed deck and it might not have an ISBN or a booklet maybe they decided to save paper or save a little money and use a QR code so that's just your first clue you then need to look for the ISBN and then look online you can look and see someone doing an unboxing I mean hell ask us Shell's got almost 80 decks she very well might have it and can compare it to something in her collection and let you know what to look for but the QR code that's your first clue and unfortunately David purchased this from a metaphysical shop you know at first I I wanted to my first reaction was I wanted to put them on blast but you know I took a moment and had an adult thought about it and you know this may happen to other people don't jump to conclusions and think that your local metaphysical shop is purposely trying to screw you because they might have been duped too you know they might have seen a good deal online for some wholesale stuff from you know a website that we won't mention that begins with a T and they might not know give them the benefit of the doubt let them know what happened if it happens again by all means flip your you know email me I'll give you some tips on how to freak out on people but your initial reaction the first time should be let them know and give them the benefit of the doubt yes I absolutely agree and if it's a if it's an online shop if it's if it's Etsy or Amazon wherever it happens to be don't buy from someone if they say there's no booklet it's just a QR code right and it's something that you know damn well comes with a book don't buy from that shop but I'm sorry that you got screwed David I hope that uh it works out and you're able to get the correct deck and the book the uncomment tarot is very beautiful the book's fantastic so I hope that works out for you and thank you for letting us know so that we can help other people be on the lookout for counterfeit tarot decks and David also let the shop know see how it goes you know and if it happens again and they don't seem to care let us know because we'll put them out on blast at that point I I I I'm a grudge holder true it's a Gemini see the previous conversation we had about my broom yeah yeah yeah so that's what witchy stuff is going on this week the topic this week we're going to get into is grounding and centering and how some people kind of get the two conflated and what it means and how to do it well and and I'm glad you started out with that sometimes confusion because I think sometimes people think it's the same thing and that you have to do both I've done one I've done the other and not necessarily together they are two separate things they are and I think sometimes when people describe grounding what they're really describing is centering right that's I think where a lot of the confusion comes in so what we're referring to is probably what most witches anyone who works with energy any type of energy worker and witches certainly qualify should learn how to handle your energy first how do you Center yourself how do you ground yourself how do you deal with the energies that you're working for a spell or a ritual you know how I equate it remember back in the day when we used to work at the same company in a call center and we were doing like these eight n hour shifts doing like tech support the minute we left that job what was the first thing we did stepped outside smoked a joint took a deep breath and felt the Earth under our feet you know we had to kind of grounded cleansed pull ourselves together from that chaos you know and if you're an empath it's even more important because you are literally almost soaking in other people's energy and O and G all day so a definitely a cleansing and then a nice grounding and centering is needed let's kind of Define each of them separately so why don't we talk about about grounding first I always felt like grounding the first thing I think of is my feet on the ground in the dirt planting Roots like a damn tree yep that's definitely the common visualization that a lot of people have for that type of thing like I also kind of look at it like dumping all the energy of the day or the week or whatever just kind of dumping it into the Earth yes grounding is actually two things there's grounding that you do as you're centering and then there's grounding that you do at the end of a spell or ritual and what we mean is just what shell said is seated or with your feet on the earth literally feeling like you're connect in yourself to Mother Earth if you can't be outside don't freak out and panic you can do it in your living room on the rug exactly the idea is to visualize that you feel stable connected centered and grounded the popular idea of grounded is someone who is calm collected stable emotions that they can't be knocked over when things go crazy and that's the kind of feeling you're looking for when you're trying to be quote unquote grounded magically that's really what you're trying to do is you're trying to connect yourself to something more stable than you are so that you can feel secure and safe and centered and ready to do your working the second type of grounding is what happens after a spell or ritual and that's how shell and I coming up in Magic learned the term for us grounding always means the second part during a ritual or a spell the idea is to raise energy to pull that energy in from yourself from the items and tools you're using from the earth from the universe and direct that energy out for your intent to work your will at the end of a ritual you're going to have all this residue of energy that you have just been channeling and pushing and moving around you it's something like that yeah it's gonna be sparking off your fingers you're going to feel jazzed and upbeat and one good way to let go of that energy en is to ground it by pushing it back into the Earth thanking the Earth for that energy and saying take the extra leave me with what I need leave me cleansed and refreshed but here's all this extra energy for you to transmute and to put back into the world and I can give you kind of an example of post spell post ritual why is definitely a necessity and something that if you're not currently practicing you're going to want to infiltrate into your practice you know a week or so ago I had a coven ritual I went and did ritual with with my awesome Cen folk and I wasn't feeling well that night and normally afterwards we have a like a dinner you know we'll talk in a minute on using food and such as a grounding mechanism but our method is we usually have dinner afterwards I wasn't feeling great and I knew I was going to wake up in the morning and drive to my BFF Lea so I forent the dinner and I'm like you know I don't feel good I don't want anything I'm just going to have my drink of tea and I'm laying in bed I can't sleep I'm looking at my Katon game thinking I need to bring Ila her Katan piece but yet didn't get out and get get the piece like tossing and turning and once I got to sleep I couldn't stay asleep and at first I was like oh I'm just excited cuz I'm going to Lila in the morning and then in retrospect I was like son of a I just did a full-on ritual with my coven bypass the eating part of it and really never grounded afterwards and I know better yeah right right a lot of folks like to consume something after a spell or a ritual almost like you know how sometimes if you go out drinking then you need to eat some food to kind of soak it up so you're not hung over like literally the same concept after you've raised all this energy and done all this magic you know eat some food soak it up so that you don't have that magic hangover in the morning exactly and it does feel like a hangover just like shell said you might not be able to sleep you'll be bouncing from thing to thing you'll be too jazzed up it it it's not a comfortable feeling and eating something can be a great way to get you back into your body to really feel be present in your body and in space breathing exercises can help some people and the the tree meditation that we mentioned that can help you be centered is also a way that you can be grounded because it's the same type of thing you connect your feet like Roots you visualize your feet going into the Earth your arms reaching up like a tree or visualize sitting on a stone or against a tree it's the same concept you feel connected to everything present in your body and like you you can't be knocked over and like the energy is flowing cleanly and fluidly through you without building up without excess just clean clear calm energy so that's where you want to start with being centered and that's where you want to end with being grounded and you know centering I kind of always looked at centering as like pre- ritual and grounding is like post- ritual yeah me too you know it kind of like the intro and the outro you know they're easy to forget but oh so important and the other thing was centering is and the reason I always liked doing it in the beginning you know we all have our day-to-day our mundane our and that kind of for me is almost a trigger for that mind shift okay I'm flipping the switch from my mundane work kids complaining to we're making magic now right and especially when I think of centering I think of gathering my my energy in my Center you know Gathering my chi Gathering my magical energy Gathering my breath in my center and that helps me to feel connected to things and so if I'm sitting with my root chakra on the ground with my feet underneath me and I visualize that you I'm growing Roots into the Earth that I can feel one with everything around me and gather that energy with each breath into just underneath my chest just above my stomach with each inhal Gathering that energy and centering it in a circle right there this is when I actually do like what I what like doctors like to call this is when I do my diaphragm breathing you know what I'm saying like normally we all live our life almost like kind of shallow breathing and this is kind of the time to do like that diaphragm breathing that nice deep breath the deep breathing I love breath work for centering because it really helps me to be present in my body but in this part of quote unquote centering and grounding I am connecting to the ground and to the Earth but it's more in a gathering phase I'm gathering this energy and I'm spreading my legs shoulder width apart I'm in a secure stance and ready to pull in as much energy as I can to push it out for my spell so I need to be centered much like a marshall artist finds that Center so that when someone strikes at you or when you push with power you're not knocking yourself over you need to be connected to the Earth and Center that energy so that you can push and pull these forces to work your will without knocking over and without losing control of the spell well I could see how people kind of think they're they're the same and kind of rolled into one because when I do that centering I don't know we'll call it exercise for lack of a better word like I said how grounding is like a like you're kind of doing that magical energy dump to get yourself back into that mundane space I kind of look at centering while I am doing all of the all of the things you just said but almost like as a precursor dumping my mundane energy you know oh yeah dumping dumping my my week worth of work  you know dumping my household  forgetting about what I have to clean and mop when I get back home you know almost like I'm dumping the mundane yesing in the world magic and then dumping the excess energy 100% yes it's very much a give and take it's a it's a shedding of the old and the mundane and what isn't serving you right now and it's pulling up that clean clear magical Earth Universe energy and cycling that through until you're really into the flow of things and you really have that energy center moving in a beautiful way and and then you're really in magical space and then at the end of the ritual after you've pushed all that energy you then need to ground again you need to connect to the ground to tap into that so that you can push all that energy back down and again do that energy exchange but to come back down and come into yourself and come back to just you it basically is like the required exercises so to say to get you in and back out of magical space absolutely this was part of magic working 101 back when we taught classes before even we taught people how to raise energy because if you don't know properly how to hold it in your Center and direct it and then release it back to the Earth and let go of it if you don't know how to do those things I can't trust you yet to raise energy enough to do even a simple spell then it's all a bunch of chaos magic at that point well yeah that too but there's actually kind of like a there really is a third prong to this the centering goes hand in hand with the grounding and the third prong of that is actually cleansing and I I know that we didn't initially say anything about talking about cleansing tonight but really those those three things go hand inand because generally we cleanse ourselves how however you do it we've done it with incense we've done it with water we've done it with baz fire whatever but we've cleansed ourselves going into space and we've also cleansed ourselves coming out of space I think that cleansing is kind of that third prong of those things and you can definitely cleanse like shell said with with the elements you can use one or all of them to cleanse yourself or you can cleanse yourself energetically as you're doing the act of centering and pulling that energy into your Center and then also as you're grounding at the end part of the intention should always be to cleanse yourself of the excess energy and visual visualiz being clean and pure and good and just being left with what you need and what is beneficial for you and the rest of it is released to the Earth to be recycled and reused that's why I was saying that you know part of centering can really be like that mundane energy dump getting you into that magical space and it's really no different I guess than cleansing you're either cleansing the away to get into space or you're grounding out the energy and centering out the energy to get into space so I guess that's why I feel that cleansing is the third prong of that and that yeah grounding and centering are really almost similar if not the same but I've always looked at one as a pre- ritual and one as a post ritual I think the the differences are so subtle I mean cleansing your energy you're probably still centering in grounding while you're cleansing that energy you know it becomes very easy to conflate all of these together particularly grounding because everybody as soon as you say grounding everyone's like oh yeah visualize your feet going like Roots into the Earth or visualize a waterfall just cleansing all the energy and going back into the Earth grounding can be taking a shower here you know it can be yeah absolutely but we all have this idea that grounding just means connecting to the Earth and that's just part of it you know grounding is connecting to the Earth but it's connecting to the Earth for different reasons it's connecting to the Earth and the energies around you to Center yourself and then it's grounding at the end again the term I guess a lot of old school witches use the term grounding to mean letting that energy go back to the ground you know and it's something in our old Community we used to have an actual portion of each ritual was set aside for grounding every single ritual had that listed as one of the very last things that we would do was literally touch the ground we would have people get down on hands and knees lay down on their bellies on their backs literally on the ground and we would talk through a short meditation of letting that energy go all the energy that we had just raised and released to work our will or to honor the holiday we now let go all of the excess and then we would have a feast cakes and Ale afterwards to help continue that grounding process well and I can't recall an outdoor ritual where either of us wear shoes so no that's another good way to do it so do you have to walk Barefoot in the grass in order to ground no like shelle said you can do that inside in your apartment on your floors on your carpet whatever it's more of a visualization sitting up against a tree or walking through the woods until you see a tree that wants a hug and hugging that tree and feeling that closeness is awesome but it's not necessary you can certainly do it energetically and intentionally in your house in your room in your car and you know it's the same exact thing with cleansing you can use any or all of the elements to do that you know water like I said easy one take a shower in the summertime jump in a lake jump in the river jump in the Ocean Air a lot of people like to Fan the incense got a PSA on that I'll get to in a second fire some people will cleanse by like sitting and meditating in a circle of of lit candles traditionally just walking through two small lit fires or two lit candles is one way to cleanse with fire or jumping over a candle I can't do that partially because then I get like the whole ADHD giraffe thing and start scrying into the the Flames um any who you know and again there's the Earth element but you know when we talk about air and fire my my little PSA for everybody is please be careful there was a point in our lives where I had this gorgeous waist long hair I I kind of miss my hair some days but it was a real hassle especially when it came to Cleansing and we had a thing uh in our community and in our coven where we would cleanse each other with the bundles of sage you know kind of wipe your aura head to toe in the front toe to head in the back kind of thing sometimes in a pinch we would do it ourselves and I don't know I was taught you do the front and back so even when I did it myself I did the front and back so imagine waist long hair burn and Sage bundle I actually did light a little bit of my hair on fire one time uh luckily obviously I was able to get it handled before there was any serious visual damage but be careful people Fire Burns and I didn't want to cleanse myself of hair just of bad juju so PSA be careful when using flame there you go yeah so if you're gonna be passing through candles you know tie up your hair well how many times have we almost lit our cloaks on fire or or our ritual Garb like we need to be careful folks only you can prevent Circle fires only you I love that I love that so yes so definitely be careful with fire but there's lots of different ways to cleanse yourself you could even just sit in the middle of your living room and just imagine that you are in a your favorite place Outdoors that you can feel the grass under your feet or you're at Joshua Tree sitting on your favorite stone with the sun in your face and you can sit there and ground yourself that way and cleanse and connect yourself and be centered you know what I even did one time when I lived in a less than desirable visual location I went to the dollar store which by the way they're like a buck 25 store now dollar store is such a lie they need to change it to the buck 25 store and got one of those like really pretty calendars and you know I I happen to be an oceany type lover so I got a calendar that had 12 different like beachy scenes and I would each month used the picture of that calendar to kind of put me in a place at the time I didn't live anywhere near a damn tropical beach not that I do now it ain't tropical here in Massachusetts by any stretch but I use that cheap ass Dollar Store calendar and you know if if you're looking for a visual because you don't live near the woods or the water or whatever pulls to your soul buy a dollar store calendar that'll take you there I love that you said it that it put you in like a certain place because that's an important part of centering and I know that there's someone out there that's like this is all great but what the does centering feel like what do you mean Center so I just want to take a quick minute and talk a little bit about what centering feels like because it's pretty simple actually if you've ever done any type of meditation or if you've ever had to take a few deep breaths to relax before something that made you nervous you were centering yourself you were grounding yourself you're trying to use breath work and relaxation techniques to reach a moment of Stillness of quiet where you at least feel like like shell said you can let most of your mundane cares and worries Flow Away at least for this moment and just visualize a place where you're happy a place where you're comfortable visualize yourself as someone who is comfortable and happy and just take those deep breaths to really feel calm and at peace and centered and that's kind of what you're looking for I kind of like a a more short version I kind of look at it as getting my mind to a calm place where I'm not you know that when you're not thinking about anything yes that place when nothing is overriding your brain other than being there in the moment when I get to the point where I'm thinking about nothing other than either my breathing or the water or the ground or the candle flame whatever the case may be when I get to the point point where that's the only thing in my thoughts then I know I'm there yes and and that's why this was the first lesson that we would teach people because it it's not always easy to get centered to get grounded and centered to a place where you're ready to do magic being centered and Gathering that energy is not something that comes naturally to all of us so we kind of have to work at it and practice the pulling in of the energy from that calm and centered place and then the pushing out and releasing of that energy whether to work the spell or to ground it well and I I think that for those of you that aren't practicing either or both you know this is definitely something to look into back in our day 800 years ago we were literally unless you did it on your own obviously but we were literally not taught anything about Magic by anyone until we knew how to handle the energy bring it in raise it and then get rid of it this was step one one and then Magic and spellwork was step two and you did not miss that step you know you had to know how to ground and center before you were even allowed to know how to raise the energy yep because it's very important I guess it's kind of like learning to drive a car right you want to learn how to drive on slower roads I guess before you're going 100 miles an hour on a racetrack learn where the brake pedal is before you learn where the gases there you go but yeah so learning how to do that there's a lot of different meditations out there grounding and centering but the basic premise is that you want to feel as if mentally you can't be knocked over you want to feel calm collected and like you are in control of your emotions and that you are clear and present in the moment you know I just thought of another way if you are a music person and you're really in in music is like a part of your soul I feel like if I didn't have music I'd die and I have a couple of songs that I've listened to for several years and those songs can almost get me into that centered place that clear mind where nothing else matters I'm going to do a Shameless plug here for all you genxers who love Billy Joel he has a little known song from 1972 called nocturn now this song has no words it is just this like piano riff that the minute I hear the song I am on like this grounded and centered magical wave I don't I don't know how to explain it so for some people you might have that that one song like Lorena McKenna songs kind of always get me there for some strange reason bag pipes do too but just because something works for you and I it might not work for others but they can still find a viable way that works and there's a ton of stuff online lots of different meditations and ways to get you grounded and centered and then afterwards when you're done with your working when you're done working that energy just laying on the ground sitting on the ground or your floor put your hands Palm down on the floor and visualize all of that energy flowing out of you into the Earth and then just leaving you refreshed and energized but not not power drunk not too much in your head more just ready calm and refreshed food is good talking to friends walking around going for a hike can be good leaning up against a tree smoking the devil's lettuce can help some people and not others some people it's strictly an energy raising thing other people it really helps them to get grounded you'll have to figure out which type of person you are if that's something that you choose to use Stones regular Stones can help ground you it doesn't have to be fancy crystals potted plants if you're a plant witch and you have plants in your house go water your plants and push some of the energy into them to help you release that and ground it or you can even just place like your fingertips or what have you in the dirt around your plant base and and even if you don't have like ground per se you can use the dirt in that pot is like your quote unquote ground there was a witchy couple in our community that had out in front of their front door those you know those ginormous plant pots that some people have like trees and in on their front porch theirs was just dirt so that you could stick your hands in it to ground yourself either before or after after ritual but it it doesn't have to be anything fancy it can be your favorite worry stone or piece of pottery it could be like I said just going for a walk a cup of tea it could be sitting down with a mug of tea and just letting all that excess energy drain out now you want to take care in your visualization that you're not completely draining yourself at this point that's part of the practice and taking care of energy work at the end you want to ground yourself so that you're left refreshed and happy and cleansed not wiped out right right so I think the moral of the story is these two witches here recommend grounding centering and cleansing whenever you're doing spell workor or magic and it's just not a bad practice every day and you're going to hear people refer to grounding at the beginning and grounding at the end and they're kind of the same but kind of not yeah kind of not they're both connecting to the Earth they're both connecting to everything all of the elements but one of them is to raise energy and to be prepared to do spellwork and one of them is to release the energy and to complete your spellwork same word two slightly different things tomato tomato there you go and centering can be gathering energy or it can also be helping you to slow down so we hope we're able to give you a good idea of our views and opinions on grounding and centering if you have any other weird wacky ways shoot us an email we would love to hear about how you ground and Center don't forget this is super important you don't see a lot about this in some of the stuff online but just remember this is an important piece to that magical puzzle so everybody get grounded everybody get centered and thank you so much for listening check us out
