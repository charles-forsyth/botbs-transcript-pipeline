welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick and there is certainly some going down I'm Leila and I'm shell and what the holy hell is going on right now this was going to be an episode about gratitude magic but we are also in America and like the curse says we live in interesting times yeah we do actually there was some listeners that reached out and were seeking some advice so we kind of Switched gears we decided to change our topic for tonight and yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of pain and grief going on right now you know it's November it's the dark half of the year and normally November in America is like we're worried about how to buy enough groceries in order to get a cheap turkey we're worried about when is it acceptable to put up my holiday lights and when I go to Thanksgiving dinner how do I avoid hugs from that Uncle that's normally what we're worried about on Thanksgiving and I'm also worried about what time I should stop eating on Wednesday so that I can eat myself fat as you don't even know how fat on Thursday yeah but as we all know family squabbles are not the only thing to be grieving this time of year there's a lot of reasons why people might be sad and might be feeling kind of uh not happy kind of upset this is a particularly Downer November and and we're going to leave it at that I do want to put a couple things out there before we continue one Lea and I try to stay away from the political spectrum and we're going to continue to do that and two we are not psychologists we are not social workers we are just two best friends chatting so this is not any sort of I don't know what you want to say it professional advice professional opinions this is just us guys so take it for what it's worth please right now people aren't feeling particularly grateful feels like there's of foot you might be feeling despondent you might be feeling kind of murdery you might be feeling both which is totally unaligned with freaking Thanksgiving and turkey day I know people like to go right from Halloween to Christmas I feel you I love decorations I love ornaments but we can't skip over the time of being thankful and we're far from that this year I think people are feeling grief and they're going to have a hard time maybe getting together you know to celebrate joy and Thanksgiving if if you're not feeling that or again same thing with Ule Christmas Hanukkah whatever your family sucks you into you know that's right on the heels and we've we've got a lot of family stuff coming yeah and in our culture American culture does not deal well with grief we don't deal well with death with grief with big emotions we basically tell people to shove it aside ignore it get back to work stop crying my mother used to have a saying and it sums up what exactly you're saying and it's suck it up buttercup and you know sometimes it just hurts too much to suck it up yeah sometimes that's something um Irene glass is one of our favorite Heathen she's we love her absolutely love and she she's a heathen she's a pagan and she's been a you Minister for like decades when she talks about grief and things like that that she has to deal with as a member of the clergy she says that one of the things you should not do is called spiritual bypassing and basically that's when you're confronted with like a big emotion like grief is it's one of the biggest you know saying something like suck it up buttercup or just get over it or everything happens for a reason is that right it's basically trying to just tell you to get over it and bypass the hard work by giving you some sort of Catchphrase or you know like spiritual pum or whatever and screw that that's not what you need or what you want to hear but in the same respect you know the reason we work is because we are sometimes vastly different and you I describe you to other people as sweetness and happiness and love do you really I do and you know I'm kind of the backhanded get your ass gear kind of person and you know I I feel that it is a very difficult time right now and there is a lot of reason to feel that sorrow the dumpster fire has only begun but this isn't the time to curl up in your bed and you know cry for days on end and and not shower because you're so depressed I get it I get it but my mentality is more like the warrior woman you know like I have never been one to stand by and shut up I am a arguer a bitcher a fighter whatever you want to call it but it it's time for warrior mode I feel like don't give in to the sadness use it to fuel yourself to I don't want to use the C catchphrase create the change you want to make but sitting back idly is not the way to go in my opinion it's it's it's time to stand up and I know we've talked in the past about Byron Ballard's Tower times Theory and if there isn't more of a tower time right now there never will be and it's it's it's time to be strong and be that Warrior I think that that's the best way to go at least for me and my personality psychologically speaking there's five stages of grief right there's anger denial bargaining depression acceptance you go through those different stages at some point and I think think I went through every single one of them like I was speedrunning my personal trauma at about 3:00 a.m. the other day right when we all got that wonderful news and I think what you're saying is you have come to a place of acceptance you know you've gone through all of that and you're ready to start the fight a new wherever you're at in that process you kind of have to honor it because when it comes to Big emotions whatever is triggering your grief whatever is triggering these feelings you have to feel them there's no shortcut here the only way out is through you have to go through all of these stages I think the most important thing about that though is that there ain't no time clock on this either right I just process things a little faster than than a lot of people and I go from the anger stage for you is one that's really easy you know I can do that in like a hot second and you know I I think that remembering that just because it took me a few days to get to time to  up kind of stage doesn't mean mean you might still be in that first stage or that second stage and and you could be there for a while and that's okay and you know this isn't just applicable to what's going on right now you know you could say this about divorce you could say this about a death of a loved one there's lots of reasons to grief there's just a collective grief going on right now and once you get through those stages of grief wherever you land on that that's when you have to kind of decide where do I want to go from here for Shell she's decided she's rising up she's being that Warrior goddess for me it it looks a little bit different because I am nice I'm the laid-back friend who smokes copious amounts of weed with you in the sunny kitchen while beaking cookies and discussing what kind of hex will most  up your shitty ex yeah I'm the Aunty who dry your tears about the state of the world read your tarot cards and then we make sign put on our riot gear and go protest the  patriarchy absolutely I am nice but I am not is afraid or complacent and what I have is my voice my ability to speak up for those who can't or for those who are too afraid you and I have never backed down from saying we are witches and I'm not about to start now come what may so I'm not going to back down I am no longer going to be silent I am going to be the loud out active witch that I am even more so now because I think some people won't be able to this this was reminiscent and obviously to a lesser scale but without naming the evil empire remember that place we used to work together about 25 years ago and remember when we were suggested to not wear our Pentacles yes and we were like you what exactly you know I was remed of that this week and I was like you know first of all to have to go back to that is just some  and second of all I didn't sit and be quiet then so I don't see me sit quiet now now exactly and I think that those of us that have that privilege I am a white middle-aged middle class lady I am going to be as loud and obnoxious as I possibly can as a shield for those that can't right but what I'm saying is like you're taking up a sword I'm taking up a shield we're both going to be loud and obnoxious because that's who we are other people might work in different ways some people might need to go back in the broom closet some people might need to go back in the closet you know there's all different ways that people are going to need to protect themselves and protect are you trying to Circle me back to the rage stage again I know I know I know but yeah I mean whether we're talking about the political climate or whether we're talking about other forms of grief whether it's for really bad news the death of a loved one the loss of a pet a big move stress whatever is causing you grief you kind of have to go through these processes and Magic being a witch can help you work through these things you know we we transform energy we transform emotion you can take these raw emotions your grief your anger your rage your fear and channel that into your magic make it more powerful and help you work through those at the same time now I hear you might have a suggestion maybe a little spell or two or a ritual to maybe lead people down this path so why don't we why don't we give people a mental break for a second let's talk about that so okay what's the spell you got going on all right well I do have a spell and particularly because we are in the dark half of the year and you know we're in the dark crisis of the Soul at the moment it feels like L it's getting freaking dark at like 4:30 what the heck I know I hate it so much I know you say shell I know you say you like the fall back so you get that hour of sleep but damn this dark is killing me I want the sleep with the daylight there you go I want I want 25 hours in a day and I want it to be light until about 8:00 pm thank you well I figured since we're all getting what we want you know we might as well ask for these too what the hell all right so my spell involves candl light because what what better in the dark half of the year than candle light probably the one time I use candles the most exactly it also magically signifies the growing of light the growing of Hope emerging from that Darkness so candles are very magical for a lot of different reasons but they particularly help in this spell for that so take one or preferably one for every room or several for every room candles like the big pillar kind are the best but please please you need to perform fire safety while doing this I have to put that in there that's right please be safe our fire bug is telling you to be safe I am my father's child that's right so what I want you to do is to take all these candles and create an oil a protection oil it's protect my peace oil oh I love oils right me too so you can take like a hoba oil hemp oil or just take a little olive oil out of your kitchen it doesn't really matter you know what I really like is I like grape seed oil and you can get it at any grocery store and it's really not much more than olive oil but it's it's different I think that's why I like it it's a nice consistency and it doesn't really have a very heavy smell I like it for those re it's good for that so the base oil is for grounding and protection right no matter what oil you take oil itself is going to have that earthy grounding prote does it matter how much you use I wouldn't use too much I mean if you're going to have a lot of candles you're going to want to maybe use a quarter of a cup if you're just using like one candle maybe a teaspoon it doesn't have to be a lot it just depends on you just want enough to wipe each candle a little bit I gotcha so we'll say you're using like three candles so maybe just like a tablespoon of oil and a few drops or just a pinch of lavender and that's for peace and Harmony frankincense for Spiritual strength and for justice Rosemary for clarity and courage a little bit of cinnamon for strength and protection and again these can be the herbs or oil whichever you prefer and then I like to take a bay leaf and crumble it up and add that to it and maybe a little bit of clove the bay leaf is for protection and wisdom and the clove is also for protection and for banishing negativity so you're going to add these herbs or oils to your carrier oil and you're going to think of the intention of creating a safe place for your grief you're creating a safe place for you and you're creating a safe place to feel all your emotions to be able to work through all of those stages of grief so you're basically trying to create a sanctuary for yourself and you're going to anoint each of your candles with this oil and you're going to anoint it from the wick to the base because you're drawing in that protection to your space you can even write on each candle if you want to write a couple words or if you want to carve a Sigil for protection or safety in your home then you're going to place them around your house and take either like a little bit of bark like shell and I have talked about a little bit of bir birch bark or a bay leaf or a small piece of paper and on them take one for each candle and on them you're going to write words or phrases or sigils that you've created depending on what your purpose is if if you're trying to work through grief because of loss of a loved one you're going to write things like remembrance peace connection uh memories memories Serenity things like that if it's because of the current political climate here in the US it could be Justice it could be safety it could be security yeah things like that and then Place those underneath each candle and then every day once a day preferably around the same time doesn't have to be light each candle and when you light those candles picture the glow of that light pulling in all those good feelings all that protection that safety that Serenity whatever it is that you put under each candle you can say an affirmation or repeat an intention make it the same thing every day something like I am part of a powerful Community I am healing with Grace and with Serenity I am strong I am safe I am secure whatever your affirmation is you know write it down so you don't forget and then say the same thing each time you light a candle and by repeating that that helps to fix that phrase that spell in your subconscious in your magical brain to help the spell work to help the magic move and work and that's going to make your home make your space a sanctuary it's going to make it uh a place where you can freely feel those emotions and work through them and invite Justice and protection into your space okay so I got a Twist on that perfect I love it it's lovely I love your twists let me have it you know I'm a bath person I love a good bath who doesn't love a good freaking bath I would like the idea as well on top of that to take those candles and set them up in my bathroom fill myself a sweet ass hot bath and then put some of that oil in the bath water be careful if you use cinnamon oil putting that in the bath just use a very tiny amount oh gez that would burn yeah and there sensitive bits that goes in the bath okay so lay off on the cinnamon itty bits if you're going to use it for a bath but kind of bringing that that safety protection Serenity blah blah blah blah blah into yourself because right now let's face it we need that on our person I need safety and protection on my person not just in my home but on you know I need to protect my body damn it yes and I love the bath idea for that so I like I like the whole protecting the house thing but I also like a bath element to that and you know how you said write the things down on the paper and put it under the candle you could also write them on bay leaves and put it in the bath with you oh yes and you know speaking of having things on your body I'm a huge fan of jewelry and jewelry charms you could take your jewelry say your rings or a necklace or something something specific and place that on the rim of the bath or place that next to the candle while you're doing your spell and let that spell charge that jewelry you know maybe you're doing it throughout your house you could designate one of those candles somewhere in your home where you put your jewelry every day to recharge that so that your jewelry now becomes a a sanctuary you can carry with you a safe energy that you can carry with you and that could be Sanctuary for you or for like me I'm going to speak up and be loud and have my jewelry be charged to give me the courage to speak out when I see injustices to to be louder and to be more obnoxious when people do shitty things you know that's super funny that you said that because at one point earlier in the last few days sometimes I do the oil thing I like oils I like them on me I like the smell blah blah blah blah blah so I'm sitting here reminising in the show that we live in and I was putting on some oil um I was going out and just got out of the bath and for some reason I kept tracing I have a triple Moon Goddess tattoo and I just kept tracing that and kind of you know in that whole bringing that goddess power into me because it's again for me it's Warrior goddess time I know some of our siblings our witchy siblings out there are going to need to be quieter so maybe underneath your jewelry you can take the oil that you have created in ritual space and just you know wear it as a perfume take a pen charge that pen with your intention of protection or your intention of Justice or Serenity and write that word or write a Sigil or write runes on your skin and then put your bracelet on over top of it so no one can see it and now you're protected make a triple Moon make a pentacle and do that before you go to work you know write it somewhere that'll be covered by your clothing that can definitely be a good way to do protection as well you know I this week has prompted me to want to do and you know I never do an alter rehash I just add to it if I could have a whole room as an alter trust me I got enough for it seriously but this week I decided to do an alter rehash is kind of a protection you know keeping my space and myself and and and all of that in a better place and you know we've talked in the past about how I have been a a a devotee of at Forever in a day but I've never taken that plunge to actually go out and buy a hkat statue you've never found one that seemed perfect for you I don't think well no because you know a lot of people portray her as like that old Crone version and that's never been my jam but so this week I went out around town and I found by the way for super cheap a hkat statue bone finish love it and I'll post a picture of it and I feel like I needed that you know and I kind of joked with with my sweet love and I was like you know it took me 30 years to get a hcat statue no time like the present to have a A visual representation of her you know I always have the keys you know I always have things that are are a part of my altar to represent her but I've never taken the plunge and actually gotten a statue and for some damn reason this was the time I don't know what made me think of it I just happened to look online saw a local store it was under $50 and I was like hell yeah you know maybe that's also a good idea to kind of bring some of that peace and serenity is do an alter rehash an excellent idea and hkat is a good goddess for now especially in her form of the torch Bearer guiding us through the dark times guiding us out of the crossroads guiding us through Lial spaces and you know it's funny that you got a statue I got a ring I love seeing the rings that are like on the first joint like they're not all the way down on your finger they're like on the first joint well I have a ring that I like on the middle finger of my right hand and I found another ring specifically to go on the first joint of the middle finger of my right hand and I have Charmed them both to be the you Rings doesn't that feel weird though not really you get used to it pretty quickly but I like having them on my middle finger because it's a good reminder that I don't have to put up with no more being nice to get along I don't have to put up with anything so by having these Rings charged magically and on my finger like you said maybe I can feel it a little bit differently it's a good reminder because I'm not used to wearing a ring there so it's a good reminder to flip people off if they need it so that has been my big thing bought a ring to go there to specifically remind me to flip people off if they deserve it you know I think we're all going to find our own things that'll bring us some sort of peace and Solace for the time being but you know it's just ironic that this is the dark time of the year kind of the go within figure out what you're going to do you know we really need to figure out what we're going to do as a people yeah it is the dark time of year for the Northern Hemisphere for America but whatever the dark is to you whatever the coming dark is to you whatever that depression this is the time of year when it's good for self-care to go within take care of yourself Build That Base take stock you have a little bit of time before January before spring Now's the Time to prepare and I think that was part of my alter rehash because I had a a brief moment of panic about what if I can't buy this after January like but what if what we do is not as tolerated as it's been and what if these types of things are harder to get and that kind of sparked a little shopping spree on my end understandable I am trying to spend as little as possible we are so opposite yeah well no I am stocking up I am preparing I am defin itely trying to make sure that we are safe that we are prepared I'm looking into places to donate my time places that I can go and help my mother started going to the uyu church again in her community because she feels so disappointed and so called to be with other people that she can help that she can work with that they can go into the community and affect change when that was happening in the South with the floods the pagans you mentioned Byron Ballard and the the mother grow of Temple and all the different pagans and witches that stepped up to help and are still helping because those people are still you know they're having such a hard time and people are still helping and that's what we have to do and if you can't give time maybe you can give money if you can't give money maybe you can amplify them on social media maybe you can tell people about them talk about them get them you know traffic there's something that we can all do to feel like we're in some way and you know speaking of social media we're all on Facebook groups let's face it here we're all seeing all the posts and we're seeing all all of the sadness if you can't do anything else you know listen to someone reach out talk them through it you know make a friend let's just make friends now is the time for solidarity we need to be there for each other and people like shell and I that can be loud that can be out in the open need to do so need to remain so we need to fight for the people who can't fight for themselves exactly this is the dark half of the year we only have so much time so we need to take care of each other take care of ourselves and magically we need to keep pushing forward we need to keep trying to transform that energy whether it's grief rage sadness acceptance wherever you're at we're witches we transform and that's what we need to push that towards is the idea of coming out of the dark times we will always be the phoenixes rising from the fire I certainly hope so and in the meantime I also have a ritual for you shell a dark moon this is to be done on every dark moon now are you just talking just right now or could we do this 12 months a year you could do this 12 months a year this is cumulative this is for anyone who's experiencing negative emotions of any kind this is to help you Channel those energies towards your better good towards Justice towards healing from grief whether you're feeling political Fallout whether you're feeling grief or a loss of a relationship a loved one a job whatever this is something that can help you transform that energy I like it already all right so dark moon do you remember Circle omat we used to uh meet on the Dark Moon we did that was our thing and and I always I always was more partial to the Dark Moon because of hiate and Dark Moon is a transformative time it's an introspective time and we met on the Dark Moon because it was all about that inner time that inner knowledge self-reflection and this ritual kind of calls upon that as well the idea is to reflect and sit with that emotion whatever it is and to call upon a deity that will help you work through that emotion because if you don't work through it you're not going to get past it exactly so basically Dark Moon and that can be anytime the day before day of day after of the Dark Moon let's be honest if the Dark Moon is on a Tuesday or Wednesday we're still doing that on a Saturday night not gonna lie quite possible yeah so the idea is to think of it as a time of reflection that that final clearing of the Slate before you start to um build up your manifestation your goals so take a candle and a reflective surface like a black mirror or a a shallow dark plate that maybe has water in it you need a paper and a pen and you're going to cast your circle get into Sacred Space however you choose to do that and light your candle so that it reflects on the water sit there feel your emotions you're going to allow yourself to really amplify those emotions as you look at the reflection in the Dark Water the dark goddess is looking back at you basically is the idea so sit with that for a little while call upon a deity I have three suggestions here three goddesses for three different purposes o first one is sash hat an Egyptian goddess and I've talked about her before in my workshop about smokable spells because she is the Egyptian goddess of among other things cannabis but also of funeral rights of writing and of paper and so she is someone who can help you work through grief if you're dealing with grief you could also call upon Hestia who's a Greek goddess of family and political Community if you want to work through needing to call Community to you or wanting to help heal a broken community and then my favorite is another Greek goddess and this is Nemesis Nemesis is the goddess of Retribution of balancing the scales of Justice Nemesis punishes those who are guilty of too much pride in the face of the Gods people who are guilty of arrogance and vanity and I'll link to a place that talks some great things about Nemesis but they say quote she is the goddess of indignation against and retribution for evil deeds and undeserved good fortune she is the personification of the resentment caused by those who committed crimes with impunity doesn't that kind of Encompass Karma yeah the Western idea of karma sure yes she meets out Justice for those who are too arrogant and who have gotten away with things that they shouldn't get away with are we really going to all become Nemesis followers I certainly  hope so so call Nemesis if you need that but call upon these deities and you can chant their name three times or nine times you can just say that you call upon them you ask their presence I usually summon in land spirits and Elementals and I request deities right well yeah so call them in ask them to be with you in you're right and basically just ask that they help you through these emotions and then sit with that and then when you feel moved to do so start writing whether you're writing your feelings your emotions whether you're automatic writing whether you're just writing the name of the deity over and over again whether you're just writing you over and over again or I'm hurt or whatever it is write it down give yourself a good three to seven minutes to just write and then when you're done keep the paper put out the candle and let that energy go and let that go to the goddess let that out to the goddess and let her take that and transform it to take your energy to the universe and help you through those emotions and to use that energy to help you find Justice healing or balance I love that I love that yeah and repeat that every dark moon do it on all three days of the Dark Moon if you want to the important thing to remember is to make it a regular practice and really just give yourself permission to write anything anything that comes up and that could be that could be useful in a lot of different situations and basically it's the idea of calling deity to you sitting with the deity and with that emotion giving them that emotion but through the power of writing that emotion out you're basically giving it to the deity and asking them to help transform that for the good of yourself and for the good of your community or your family or whoever needs it whoever is the focus of your spell right oh another magical thing we've talked about shower spells before I still really like a shower spell I have a couple different soaps that I like to use before I use my good luxurious you know silky soaps one is like a it has peppermint in it it's a cleansing soap and I got it from witch's Moon which is a subscription box company and I Absol freaking lutely love them so I have this soap in my shower and I use that before I take my regular shower to magically cleanse myself in the shower you ever do that I have maybe not exactly the same way but and I've started taking other types you know you can get all those funky flavored soaps right I love Bath and Body Works not gonna lie right I like going to the farmers market and getting like the handmade ones that have like the big chunky herbs and in them oh my God oh my God I love that right I love those so I will look for ones that have herbs that match with my spell intentions so I have a couple different types of fancy soaps my husband is going to kill me I swear he thinks they're ugly but so I have a couple different kinds and I'll use them for different things and lately I've been using soap that has like s uh what is this one sage and rosemary in it and it it basically is very good for protection and so sometimes I feel like lately I need a little bit of an extra shield because you know I'm out there being less quiet now so I'll use that in my shower and a shower time with a fancy soap is a really easy fast way to do a cleansing a protection a quick little spell and your shower before you start your day and you know sometimes doing a little something like that to start your day sets the mood and if you go into the day feeling a little bit better it kind of helps I agree I found I've been smoking a lot more weed to be honest well yeah me too me too so I've been you trying to use it intentionally I'll throw in a little Mullen for grounding I'll put in a little bit of um clove I like clove lot not only does it smell great and taste great when you smoke it but it's really good for banishing negativity and I'm pretty much in my middle finger era I guess so so I feel sometimes like smoking uh smoking a bowl with a little bit of Mullen and a little bit of clove and and a little bit of cannabis is almost like my you to The Establishment while also sending out that protection and that grounding um and the Cannabis helps with you know mood regulation and calming so you know if I'm getting a little cranky I'll smoke that a little bit and focus on feeling a little more grounded feeling a little more secure in my space yeah I definitely need my mood a little lessened this week right don't we oh so counseling is definitely helpful but writing journaling through your emotions writing through it can help you to regulate them and then it's proven that volunteering finding some form of action can also help you you work through feelings of grief and helplessness of feeling isolated feeling scared these are all things that that can help you feel less worried and also move forward and and help to find a solution to It Whatever the cause of your worry your fear or your grief is these are things that can help you like Lila and I stated we are not Mental Health Providers or anything of the like but a couple things I do want to put out there the National Suicide Prevention Hotline if you need that is 1 800273 talk um you can text it 741741 there's also the Trevor Project there's trans Lifeline 8775658860 if you need someone to talk to reach out to these folks reach out to whoever it is you want to reach out to Leila and I

are amazing and whatever you're going through right now there are people out there that can help shelle gave you the numbers we're here friends family youu you you know we're all in this together you are not alone and we're going to continue to be loud no matter what happens hey it could it could be could be great things are think I don't I'm not going to go with that toxic positivity is also a problem so let's not try and say that it's going to be better when we don't know for sure so we're not even gonna go We're not gonna do that either so you know everybody we wanna we wna wrap up and say thank you for joining us uh tonight and stay strong fight the good fight and if you can't that's okay we got your back we'll we'll be loud and proud for you if you can't and to our friends that are outside of America I'm sorry we're dumb that's all I can say I'm sorry don't pick on us too much I don't know maybe we need a good swift kick in the ass it's more than a little sad anyway yeah you know I think it's a good time to go take an oil bath for protection what do you think there you go actually I'm going to go uh smoke a you joint to The Establishment and uh charge some Jewel rfe so that I can not be a cranky  I don't know for calming and relaxing in the face of all this mounting you know I do have one thing I want to announce to our listeners that is not Debbie Downer news Leila
