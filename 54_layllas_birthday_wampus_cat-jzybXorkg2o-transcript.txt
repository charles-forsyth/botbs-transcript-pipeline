best friends on opposite coast of the USA get together to tell each other truish Tales of spine tingling Terror paranormal ghosties and don't forget my Cryptids always always the queen of Cryptids on the East Coast my co-host shell and today bringing you the finest THC Crystal coated ganja I'm Lea and I am shell who's still smoking up broken up pre-rolls oh the Thrifty sa shell today I I'm being Thrifty I'm being Thrifty but I got I've got this good weed I've got a good crypted story today yay we're on fire today so we're gonna start with the smoked yes we'll start with the smoking fire that we've got today I'm gonna go first just because I'm kind of doing a repeat so I had gotten a bag from a friend you know that kind of thing don't know what it is can those are the good kinds of friends to have right so that was doing really really good and everything was was all hunky dory and happy and chipper with that but then I was like oh we're going to record today so why don't I break open one of these last couple of pre-rolls I have nice because you know that's what shell does Shell doesn't smoke a pre-roll she breaks it open and packs a pipe with it so I did that right before and I'm just I'm there I've been I've been smoking my friend stuff all morning I just smoked a big old fat pipe of my [ __ ] I can't even think of the name of it I always smoke I want to say ever clear but that's liquor game end game lovely delicious end game and it's got me super chatty so I'm ready to talk I'm ready to get ghosty and spooky and scary but I need to know what are you smoking this week well you know I think this must be the week of friendg weed because I'm actually smoking some homegrown that originated from a gelato cross that I was given as clones so I was given these photo period gelato cross clones not really sure what their actual parentage is I just know they're purple and very tasty and so a fellow grower knew of my Affinity for geladas and said that he had this beautiful mut that he had bred and uh had a few too many clones and I don't mind a mut as long as that's what you tell me it is that you don't know you know because they're clones we knew how they were going to turn out they're all going to be very uniform just like the parent that they came from so I knew these were going to be purple and delicious and grow pretty quickly and and they did indeed so anyway I'm smoking some homegrown freshly cured very delicious gelato of unknown parentage purple thank goodness still have higher expectations out of your friends than I do and hey buddy how much for how much don't ask any other questions because we all know that you don't know I don't know we don't know just how much for how much let's just cut to the chase here folks and when I resort to that I'm never done wrong I'm never done dirty it's always really good but don't ever ever ask me what it is cu I have no clue but it's tasty I will say though you know how sometimes you get that weed that almost has that like gassy smell oh yeah it tastes almost exactly like gasoline smells and it's it's sharp it's pungent despite the name gas it's almost like a clean taste yeah it's kind of a cross between it smells a little gassy and it smells like the dankest danky dank oh I love those you know when you get that gas and that green dank smell you know you are in for a very very good ride and other thing I want to point out about buying from a friend down the road is that you go back to your original packaging that is not as horrific to the environment I see that packaging you have the tried and true the OG sandwich bag bagl the kind that you have to lick it to seal it oh back to my roots back to my roots the pile of Sandwich baggies is always going to be much smaller than the glass and the plastic that you get from the dispensary bring back oldfashioned packaging and you know me I'm always that sucker who's trying to reuse that freaking bag like 96 times until it's so saturated with like not even resin per say but just like residue that you can't even see through the bag anymore because it's like a shade of green that's when I knew people that would take now maybe not those really thin sandwich baggies but the ones that are a little bit thicker I knew people that would take a razor blade to the inside of that just to scrape off all the KE and the crystals that were there that's back when weed wasn't yeah those were the days when weed was not as easy to come by but speaking of going on a a pretty good trip I actually want to read an email for you shelle that we got and you know we occasionally get emails from our listeners good stories bad stories this is kind of a bad story and I feel a little bad for this person so I thought I'd read this email and maybe you and I have some ideas for this person sh oh boy okay bring it on lay it on me all right they say hi my name is Kay and I'm currently binging the podcast so I have two weed stories to share both are firsttime experiences so I used to date a huge Stoner like never not high Stoner hey people anyway I was new to smoking and had no tolerance he decided to get some edibles that his friend had made there's your first problem bad boyfri I'm already I'm already saying bad boyriend and I haven't even heard the rest of the story just you know damn well that if your friend made those Edibles they're probably either not potent at all or potent as [ __ ] all get out or you might as well get on a rocket and go to moon right now because you're be flying just you know right off 12 to 20 hours and uh call it a day and then don't eat the edible and it's about the same thing so she says unbeknownst to me he didn't really know how to make edibles the brownie batter he had made wasn't stirred well enough so some were weak and some were super potent oh geez guess who got a [ __ ] potent one okay I'm so sorry I'm jealous but I feel bad for like half an hour I didn't feel anything then the high truck hit me hard I love that the high truck got hit by the high truck unfortunately this one ran her over and didn't pick her up and give her a lift she says I didn't know what my name was anymore or where the [ __ ] I was my ex thought it would be a good idea to take me home well yeah once I was there I started getting sick like puking until I couldn't breathe anymore that poor thing hey you poor thing this went on for what felt like forever till I finally passed out I woke up 10 hours later because my dad woke me up I was more confused than I had ever been I texted my ex asking where he was his response was that I had completely passed out and I was in God's hands now okay bad boyfriend dump his ass wow wow who says that like you don't yeah that's bad Stoner code I still can't do brownie Edibles to this day so first of all Edibles rules always know who made it and secondly just take a very small bite especially if you don't know what your tolerance is and definitely if you don't know what the potency of the edible is just take a very small bite the greener it tastes odds are the more potent it's going to be or just the shittier it is because they didn't strain it proper but always start with a small bite shell has a two-prong opinion here first of all if you're gonna eat Edibles just go to the store just go to the store you're better off you know what you're getting yeah your first experience should never never be with one that your friend made yeah and then second of all I know that Lea likes Edibles she's made edibles but me I have no interest Edibles don't do [ __ ] for me I don't like them they kind of more give me a belly ache than I don't get high at all from them and I've had it enough times from enough different multiple sources including a store that I can tell you they just don't do [ __ ] for me so I just avoid them I'm going to add something to that pretty quickly uh there are two different types of people when it comes to Edibles eating Edibles processes THC differently it goes through your liver and there's an enzyme that breaks down the THC to make it psychoactive in your blood blood that's why it takes a little longer and it stays longer however not everyone has the chemical or enough of the chemical to properly break down the THC in their liver and so they will weiro no that means you're pretty common it's pretty common oh I don't want to be common either it's pretty normal I don't know I'd have to look it up and see if I could find the exact percentage it is relatively common that people will not have the body chemistry to allow their body to break down the THC in an edible and so they won't get high or as high from an edible and Sh is an example of that so could someone like so if I don't have that could someone have an overabundance of it that just makes some go off the rails when they have it absolutely and some especially in the beginning the first time you eat it it's going to hit you like a weed truck what did she say like a t the high truck it's going to hit you like the high truck and you're not going to have a good experience you're going to have what's called Greening out and that is not fun for anybody CBDs didn't sound fun in her email no it doesn't sound fun at all CBDs whether smoked eaten sublingual under your tongue can help a great deal keep eating them uh black pepper if you can sniff some black pepper sometimes that can help you come down a little bit but for the most part it's sleep and time stay comfortable eat something move around have someone with you who's not going to leave you alone and say it's in God's hands now the other thing is drink fluids always drink fluids keep yourself hydrated regardless especially if you're throwing up you need to replace that liquid man y so unfortunately this was not Kay's last bad experience oh [ __ ] really really yeah so the second story was her first time doing dabs the same ex I'm so thankful can I just thank all the god I am glad that she is saying that it's her ex because this dude is a [ __ ] [ __ ] not our people there you go not our people maybe a stoner not our people not our people so the same ex invited her over to smoke with him and his brother and offered her a dab and she didn't know what she was doing so the ex gave her a dab the size that he would normally do oh my God Lord have mercy and of course she didn't know because she's new and we've already established the ex's and once you put your mouth on it you just suck until your lungs are full so how would she have known she's not gonna know and she's not gonna know the potency of that you know a small dab is very very potent and you wouldn't know if you people confus you know I just like to interject something real quick here people confuse the potency of a dab they equate it to a bong doing a doing a dab and smoking a bong not not the same apples and oranges man you know you might have a dab RG that looks like a bong that does not equate it to smoking a bong folks very often you'll hear shell and I talk about smoking THC that is 28 to 34% which is extremely high most people smoke THC is around 18 to 20% is considered high but we're smoking flour that's flour now dabs is a concentrate which is just the THC and very often it'll be 90% or higher THC so one hit one lung full from flow is very very different it could be as much as four or five times different from a dab rck even even me who smoked for 30 years I could do a I could take one hit off a dab and I'm a one hit wonder man I love dabs anyway so unfortunately our friend Kay did not have a kind and nice and educational introduction to the wonderful world of dabs the ex gave her a big huge dab and of course she started coughing a ton and felt like she was dying when she was done coughing she says I was in [ __ ] space I believe it cuz that was a cough to get off like not even in a good way yeah so after that his mom came home whom she had not yet met the mother of the boyfriend that she hasn't even met yet comes home while she's in outer space from dab hits we're officially calling this guy that's his new name and I hope he's a listener and knows that we're talking about him so the mom comes home with pizza and this poor girl had to be shown how to sit in a chair and then once she started eating the pizza she says it was the best she was moaning like a weirdo to the point where her ex asked her if she was okay no no I'm not okay right her response was I just really love pizza she probably did in that moment she probably loved Pizza more than she loved anything on the planet I bet and of course that was his mother's first impression of her thanks X she says dabs are still not my thing and I still love pizza so at least something came out of it now my question is is does Kay still smoke anything I'm not sure I'm going to follow up with Kay and find out so okay take a look in your inbox you should have an email from the stone witch's hour in response to your terrible terrible time we feel awful that you had such a terrible time smoking if you ever want to do Edibles or dabs with us we will take you in take you under our wing and help make sure that you do it in a responsible and safe and fun way and you know what kay I've got a special surprise for you I'm appalled at this that you gave him your love and heart too and he just

Kay did leave us with one positive thing she says she knows about an asylum called Ashmore Estates in Illinois I'm gonna write this down she says it's very Ghostly and Ghost Adventures did an episode on it which is perfectly timely K because my story today is just outside of Chicago Illinois oh what's your story so first I want to say thank you Kay so much for writing in I'm so sorry you had a terrible experience and we love that you are a new witch and binging our episodes we'll send you some good spells if not make your ex have an itchy [ __ ] will at least help you to uh find a better partner in the future okay you're the best you rock and you reach out I got you Shell's got your back so we're not going to Kay's place of Ashmore Estates in Illinois in this particular episode but my story is in Illinois it's in a place called emden which is about 25 miles outside of Chicago Illinois and it's a haunted cemetery shell oh I love those now can you just quick I saw this thing the other day and I feel like I'm dumb this is appalling to me what's the difference between a cemetery and a graveyard cuz apparently I don't know so a cemetery means sleeping place and it and it literally is a place where people are laid to rest and it commonly refers to it originally referred to like the Roman catacombs so it basically just meant any place where people dead people were laid to rest whereas a graveyard more specifically refers to um a cemetery within a churchyard so it's more specifically to a church I got you okay makes more sense continue on go so we're going to be going to a haunted cemetery and get this shell guess what what it is the most haunted cemetery in the United States World okay okay I didn't know if they were going big on this one of the whole world they do say possibly the whole world the real question is do they say they have a Gates of Hell there no but they say there's a crypted oh really oh yes this place is so so haunted sh I cannot wait to tell you all the many and varied stories there is a crypted in the pond nearby there's rumored Satanic rituals that happen there and I started here because of a lady in white story you and your damn lady of white stories they're everywhere they're everywhere sh I love them I I practically collect them like playing cards I don't know which you get more of a kick out of Lady in White stories or orbs oh there's orbs here too and there's fun orbs I love this place we have to go here but what are you talking about today shelle so you know I I I've kind of geared off course lately I did some true crime which for me is just crazy yeah you normally stay away from that it's a little too sensitive you like to stay with the ghosties and the Cryptids the true crime is is definitely a you thing but I'm taking it back to what I love the absolute most and that's crypted that's my crypted queen oh my God I would laugh my ass off if my crypted is the one from your story is it in Illinois it comes from like any of the Appalachian area and that's quite a large area does it have two heads and does it come out of a body of water no then not mine it might purr a little bit what a purr en crypted hold on yeah it's called a Wampus cat a Wampus cat a Wampus cat that sounds awesome it is awesome and actually one of the cool Parts about this story and we'll get into it but you're going to go first but is that they originally the Cherokee said that it was once beautiful Cherokee woman that turned into this thing so that sounds like an interesting backstory but a kitty I love kitty kitties I how could you not love kitty cats I want a tiger as a pet me too why is that bad anyway so take me to the cemetery oh my goodness this is like the biggest story I had to stop shell because there are hundreds of people's experiences and local Legends and stories regarding this most haunted cemetery is this like so this is like a big deal in Illinois it seems to be very well known it has been covered by several famous ghost Explorer people you can find videos on History Channel Travel Channel and of course on YouTube because there are orbs everywhere and the stories are just so wild and the things people see when they go there amazing interesting all right so let's start at the beginning so first of all again this is place it's uh located in a forest preserve in the district of Cook County so it's surrounded by dense Woods it's not in the middle of town or anything it's kind of out there in the middle of nowhere aren't they always the good ones are the good ones are do you know when the cemetery I don't want to say opened that's weird but do you know when the cemetery like opened the exact date is not known however they do know that it's one of the first in the area and that it predates most of the settlements and the laws and things the requirements in that area the first documentation of it is from a family called the everan family and it was originally a large farm that had been settled by this family when they sold it to the Schmidt Family in 1865 that's the first known reference to it as a cemetery and in the deed it was written that the farm was sold to the Schmidt family except for a 1acre plot that was to be used as a cemetery now this Cemetery the name of it is called Bachelor's Grove and the reason it's called Bachelor's Grove is because uh local history says that prior to these Farms being there the land had orig Al been settled by people that were moving West and settled in Illinois apparently it was pretty common for large groups of Bachelors to go out and settle land together and would actually form these groups it happened so often that they called it keeping bachelor's Hall and basically it described an area where these men would go settle and then they would build houses and stuff and some of them like a group that supposedly had originally settled in this area in Illinois they would take vows where they would never marry and they were going to stay bachelor's forever and so on the site where this Bachelor's Grove Cemetery was was originally a settlement that had these men there now most of them broke that vow and did leave and marry the ones that didn't were the ones that had died young and were buried on that land usually with like a wooden Cross or some other temporary form of marker so it was colloquially called Bachelor's Grove because of that reason then it became the farm and traded hands and the first recorded burial was Eliza Scott who was buried there in 1844 so it's been a cemetery for as long as anyone can remember originally going way back to when the first settlers were there so far that the first Graves were just wooden and no longer exist it's even rumored to have originally been a Native American burial site however that's a pretty common myth for a lot of things up and down the east coast and there's no proof there's no proof that that ever was but there's no proof that it wasn't either because there were such dense Native American populations really all across America not even just the East Coast now a lot of places that were sacred to the native people that were here you know you can feel the energy in some of these places that were used as um sacred spaces or as burial grounds and this is one of those places where people that are sensitive anybody pretty much when they get to this area can describe kind of a strange feeling like in a negative way or just in a I feel Energy Way both mostly in a negative way but people kind of feel like an electricity in the air some type of energy in the air when they kind of walk into the area oh and it's very small it's about an acre in size and there's a pond next to it and for the most part it was pretty quiet there aren't a lot of ghostly sightings or anything until the 60s and 70s why do everything happen in the freaking 70s man well this has a specific reason why basically after you know it was used as a cemetery for a short period of time and then in the early I believe it's the early 1900s was the last known burial I think it was like 19 44 is there's about 82 Graves there give or take in the late 60s early '70s it became a teenage spot where they would go there and literally dig up Graves knock over the headstones and throw the headstones into the nearby Pond and some of these headstones have even been found in nearby towns some of them were sold don't ask us why you're cursed and that's exactly why the graveyard started to be haunted shortly after these desecrations happened is when people started reported seeing a house that would kind of like look shimmery in the distance and they would most people describe it as like a White House you know looked almost like a heat Shimmer like a heat vision had one small light in a window and people all describe it very very similarly but as you got closer to it it would fade away oh it always looked the same whether it was Daytime Nighttime no matter what the weather was it was always described as an old white two-story Farmhouse with the wraparound wooden porch and a p swing and one light on next to the door in the window that's so weird right and it didn't happen until after the vandalism started so some people they feel that the the house itself is also tied to another ghost called the caretaker that also appears and he seems to be an older man that doesn't talk but looks very disapproving and points the way out of the cemetery and very often uh you know people will describe seeing him when they're lost in the cemetery and he just looks very disapproving and like points the way out and then if they turn around and look back he's always gone so they think that the house might be related to The Ghost of the caretaker but it's the house is so common that it's been described in newspaper articles and there's also a couple books about the area that detail people's experiences seeing this house in the distance that just disappears as they get close to it now the story that brought me to this Cemetery was a lady in white story that's very often called the Madonna of Bachelor's Grove the Madonna I I I'm sorry Madonna is starting a tour and she's coming to Boston and all I can think of is Madonna she'd probably love a good Cemetery but right this poor lady is rumored to be a woman whose little girl also died as an infant and she's rumored to wander the cemetery looking for her and her ghost will very often be seen particularly on Full Moon nights walking through the cemetery dressed all in white searching she looks very sad and as if she's searching for something and if you follow her through the cemetery she disappears over top of the same grave every time and it's a very small Stone and it's only marked infant daughter oh this ghost has actually been photographed and is the most famous ghost of the cemetery in um believe it was in 1991 she was photographed by a woman who did ghost hunting went there and was taking some photographs of course didn't see it at the time until she got home and developed the pictures and you can very clearly see a woman sitting on one of the gravestones it's probably the most clear picture of a ghost that I have ever seen in my life and if you look very closely it looks like she might beholding a Child In Her Arms people say that they'll see this woman dressed in white either sitting on a gravestone or standing by the trees or walking through the cemetery always dressed in white and she's often described looking very peaceful but very sad they say that she you know you can see her kind of glowing as she goes through the cemetery and is sometimes accompanied by orbs so there's a lot of different confusion and different theories about who she might be she's not considered malevolent at all people find her very comforting some people even report feeling like a sense of Peace after they have seen her even though her story is pretty sad the locals refer to her as Mrs Rogers and I think that's because in lot 15 which is very very close to where that infant daughter headstone is a woman named Luella Rogers is buried there and so some people think that maybe Luella Rogers is the mother of the infant daughter but there's no there's no proof of that oh 1991 this picture of the ghost ran in the Chicago Sun Times newspaper they are the ones that called it the Madonna of Bachelor's Grove but you know she's a a common white lady ghost that's seen going through there and and again similar to white lady story she's searching for a lost child and she's very sad uh local officers in 1998 were quoted in in an interview saying that they had seen a woman dressed Allin white walking through the cemetery holding a baby in her arms and she disappeared and she was seen by all three officers that had gone there to investigate a disturbance but they didn't report it because they figured they'd be laughed at by their colleagues so they were willing to talk about it to the reporter but they said they never reported it officially CU they didn't want to get laughed at but all three of them saw the ghost there's also another common thing that people now I said there's a pond right next to the cemetery right and you said there was a crypted there is a crypted we'll get to that guy in just a second but this Pond has some really weird things about it the first one is a ghost people will see a ghostly horse come up out of the pond dragging behind it a plow that's held by a farmer ghost that then walks off into the distance apparently it was first seen by two Cook County forest rangers in the late 70s and they actually did report it and other people have come forward with seeing a ghostly horse and a ghostly farmer the origins of that Legend is that in the 1870s back when it was Farmland a local farmer had gotten entangled in his plow and was pulled into the pond and drowned oh so they're saying that that's the origins of that Legend but how often do you see a horse ghost I mean other than the headless horsemen really if someone says it's weird I said a horse and come out of that pond then you know they probably saw it because if they don't know about it seeing a horse ghost isn't something that's very common well not really no so the pond also has a very dark history because local Legend says that that cemetery and pond was used back in the 20s and 30s as a killing ground by the mob oh local Legend says that you know the Mobsters in Chicago would take people out to that Cemetery kill them and throw them into the pond during the prohibition area I guess it was a pretty well-known Dumping Ground uh used by Shady people so nowadays one of the other ghosts that people will very often see is an old timey mobster style car flying down these dirt roads really fast and taking the corner is way too fast to be safe and of bodies and as it goes out of sight around the corner people report hearing it crash and then when they get there to try and help there's nothing there there's even a police report of a young couple that had gone out there to kind of make out and they said that they had gotten into an accident with a an old-fashioned 19 you know 30s looking car that had come around crashed into them oh no [ __ ] and they said they passed out when they came to they were just pulled over on the side of the road and there was nothing but they had heard the crashing metal the breaking glass but there was no other car there was no damage to their car and they were just sitting there on the side of the road that' kind of [ __ ] with my head a little bit not going to lie so seeing that car is is pretty common now there's no proof that that was a body Dumping Ground of the Mobsters but it is a pretty prevalent local Legend so the only thing I could find about the crypted of the pond was a very very old uh kind of like a Fluff piece probably from the 1980s you know how sometimes like daytime television around Halloween will take people out to a local haunted spot yeah it seemed kind of like an interview like that and in that interview the caretaker of the cemetery at the time says that there's a local crypted Legend where a two-headed monster lives in that pond and on the Dark of the Moon climbs up out of the pond and crosses the main road that's right there to go across into the fields and go hunting but I couldn't find very much else about it that was the only reference I saw of it interesting interesting there's more there's a black dog ghost that's rumored to be around there does he hang out with a horse ghost I don't think so but the the first uh known sightings of this black dog ghost are from the 1980s a couple young men that were out there ghost hunting saw some flickering lights and then saw a really large black dog in the bushes and then when they went to try and go find it there was nothing there and no markings to show that any dog had been there at all there's always sightings that looks like a very large black dog some people say it's a doberman or a Rottweiler um I imagine it depends on what the popular scary dog is of the time right right and I'm surprised I'm surprised it's not a wolf everyone describes a very large black dog that's oddly silent that comes up out of nowhere and then disappears just the same way and people who go there to walk their dogs will often report that their dog will refuse to go they just won't go in the cemetery they'll just sit down and not go I want to go now there's also orbs blue orbs Orange orbs and also a very unusual orb that's been described by multiple people as a red light like a Red Orb that kind of streaks down the road that goes to the cemetery I've never really heard a lot about red orbs what the [ __ ] is that usually it's like green or blue or yellow or white I've never heard of a Red Orb do tell now a lot of people describe it as a red as a Red Orb with a streak almost like somebody shooting like a rocket like a comet going across the sky or something but more in orb form and lower right but almost more like those fireworks that you can shoot that's like a sparkly ball yeah and that's what some people said it probably is is is kids playing tricks with fireworks except for the fact that these orbs will streak down the road turn and come back and I'm pretty sure fireworks can't do that you know it could be aliens I'm just saying there is an alien story there's even alien abductions that happen here I'm pretty sure this really is the most haunted cemetery in the USA okay so maybe these people really got what it takes to be on we've got the most of the most in the world there are so many orb stories I can't even tell you all of them I'm going to tell you a UFO story this was by a gentleman named Randy and he says in 1982 at the cemetery at the cemetery oh no [ __ ] so he and his friends were driving out to the cemetery he says when suddenly a fog came up out of nowhere that was so thick they could barely see the road in front of them then out of the fog came a really bright light like almost like a truck with really bright lights was coming straight at them but they were on a dirt road out in the middle of nowhere and they didn't expect any other traffic at all but so this bright light's coming straight at them and that's the last thing they all remember he says the next thing they remember they're coming out of the fog and realize they're a good 200 yards further than they thought they were going to be and 20 minutes has passed by it reminds me of Close Encounters of the Third Kind all of them say the only thing they remember is the fog coming up Suddenly and then this bright light and they all described it strangely as um they all thought it was a really weird bright gas station sign that's weird that is weird and he says afterwards he started experiencing severe PTSD and he wasn't sure why and he's been through a lot of therapy he's pretty sure at this point after having read some other people's encounters that what he experienced was a UFO Abduction he was probed wasn't he quite possibly he says he still has PTSD from it but people describe seeing um this another woman named Mary said that she and her brother were there in 2001 and they saw the woman in white they were outside of the cemetery and they saw her inside the fence dressed in white they said she was blonde hair long white gown and she was walking along the path stopped and looked at them and disappeared can we go I want to go Ila I want to too these other people this gentleman named Len Novak who eventually became the director of the Illinois ghost society which is in Chicago Ridge Illinois he says that in 2005 he and a few other friends went out to bachor Grove Cemetery to do a little you know ghost hunting as they were walking out to the cemetery on the dirt road going to it they saw a woman and a a young girl and he said they were dressed a little oddly but it was close to Halloween so everyone just assumed it was kind of a costume but it was after 10:00 at night and this is in the middle of nowhere and the kid was really little like six or seven so they thought it was a little weird that she was taking her kid to a cemetery that late at night when they got up to her judge people don't judge who hasn't taken their young child dressed in a Halloween costume out to a cemetery late at night I mean really done there done there so when they get up to the woman she asks them how far the cemetery was and if they knew what direction and they said yes and pointed the direction of the cemetery and she walked past them down the path they started talking amongst themselves and all of them came to the conclusion that it was really weird looked up to you know kind of look at the woman and she's gone it was just a couple seconds had passed and the woman and child walking down the path there was nowhere for them to have gone the path was wide and long they just disappeared and that was when they realized as they were walking down the path the fall leaves were making a ton of noise and the woman and the child had made none as they walked by oh [ __ ] right so he says after that is when he and his best friend founded the Illinois ghost Society but yeah so there's experiences everywhere including maybe they are the most haunted in America maybe they are I guess the town has gone into the pond with divers and pulled out a lot of these headstones to try and preserve them and try and take care of it but the because of all the the vandalism that happened there I think these Spirits are pretty restless pretty pissed off pretty pissed off there's even reports of people going home with ghosts I read one experience a woman named Becky wrote she said that when she and her friends went there nothing happened not a thing they were quite disappointed but as soon as she got home different story different story she says as soon as she got home that night things would move across the table the door handles would were jiggling on the house she says uh stuff would fall off the table in the other room where no one was oh wow she says that they could also hear what sounded like her young daughter running and laughing upstairs in the house but it would happen when her daughter either wasn't home or was right there beside her downstairs things kind of continued like this for a little while weird stuff falling off the shelves in other rooms things moving around and being missing but they decided to to do something about it when one day her daughter had gotten up from a nap and had a snack and gone upstairs to play when she started to hear what sounded like running and laughing but by two children not just one oh [ __ ] so she goes running upstairs into her daughter's room to see her daughter sitting at a table playing tea party with some dolls and she starts to think maybe she's overreacting she ask her daughter what she's doing and she says she's playing dolls with her new friend the woman thinks everything's okay until she notices the doll on the opposite side of the table start to move and slide off the chair but it didn't just fall off the chair like it was sitting on the edge it slid slowly like a very controlled fall all the way to the floor she says she could barely take her eyes off the doll because it was creeping her out so badly but then her daughter started talking in a really strange voice she said her name is Sally and then immediately went rigid like stock still stiff and her eyes rolled back into her head and she just stopped moving completely oh wow this woman says she practically teleported the few feet from the door to the center of the room where her daughter was and as soon as she touched her daughter she immediately relaxed yawned and stretched like nothing had happened and acted like she had just gotten up from her nap and didn't remember anything from the time she'd gotten up from her nap a little over an hour before until now so they decided that was when you know maybe they should do an exorcism and get rid of the ghost why do we always jump right to exorcisms here I don't know but maybe they were just a little scared because it was with their kid not sure but yeah so that's when they decided they maybe they brought something back from the cemetery and needed to do something about it same thing we've experienced when we've gone to some of these places you know people whose car batteries wouldn't start more reports of batteries dying and electronics not working in that area that I can even count and orb photos to satisfy my little orb loving heart so yeah we should go there we need to set up our equipment and catch all of these ghosts and hopefully get more information on this mysterious supposed Cryptid so that's it that's my the most haunted cemetery in America story America yeah [ __ ] they've got like one of every popular Ghost Story I mean they've got the ghost do the lady in white they've got the UFOs UFOs teenagers yeah supposedly the the teenagers that did all those that damage did like fake Satanic ritual the only thing they're missing is Jason Vorhees in the pond right and that caretaker ghost is almost kind of like Jason Vorhees I guess he just points the way out instead of murdering you now I am very intrigued and I would love to go to this place this is like this is like my ultimate [ __ ] I and find out cuz if I'm not getting abducted and I'm getting spooked or I'm getting pulled into the gates of hell right either way it's going to be a fun night no matter how this rolls fun it's a party I feel like my story is a little more frightening okay do tell do tell so I've got the Wampus cat here I love it how can a Wampus cat be frightening come on he's a kitty kitty all I gotta say is I love these crypted names I really do I don't even know who comes up with them but I love them this is one of those things where I actually kind of got annoyed researching the Wampus cat how so there's a lot of different the stories aren't all meshing together what is consistent let me start with what's consistent this is some sort of Creature from the Appalachian Mountains so anywhere pretty much in Appalachia you can he stories of the Wampus cat anywhere from Tennessee to all the way up into Ohio Ohio Valley most stories describe it as what it sounds like a cat but I did find a story where they described it as half cat half dog half human which by the way half you can't divide half that's three half sh the math not math in here I'm just telling you what the story said and I'm criticizing their bad math so sounded like it was actually broken up into thirds a a woman a cat and a dog I love kitty cats so I like to stick with the cat version so you know conflicting stories from the beginning right down to the description Back stories conflicting current stories conflicting but the one things that are definitely all the same is there is some sort of creature in Appalachia that is like a cat-like creature that you really don't want to encounter isn't that area pretty heavily wooded oh oh absolutely denwoods the Appalachian Trail runs through there it's very mountainous very wooded um you've got a lot of like Federal Forest land in there a lot of State Forest land so lots of places for a half woman half dog half cat to hide to hide correct as one of the stories go and this is kind of a predominant story you see this one the most is that this is from where the Cherokee are from so one of the stories and like I said this is kind of the predominant story that you'll find is that back when the Cherokee tribes were occupying that land when that was their Homeland they would the men would hunt the women were kind of more the stay back you know take care of the Hearth and Home and the men were kind of the hunter gatherers so the men had rituals involved in hunting they would would thank the animals for their sacrifice before killing them for food things of that nature the way the story can go mostly is that the Wampus cat was actually once a beautiful Cherokee Woman and her deal was is that her husband would often leave the village and go out with the other men and go hunting to bring back food and she knew that the men would Gather in the woods you know they'd ask forgiveness for the lives of the animals um and they would seek Supernatural help in their tasks okay the women were forbidden from ever seeing these sacred rights so guess what this chick was like yeah no I want to know I'm nosy nosy Rosy so she got an idea she wanted to see what the secret was because she would always torment them and be like what are you guys doing you know what are these sacred rituals and he'd be like na mind your business this isn't anything you're allowed to know and it bugged her so she was consumed by her curiosity she knew that they were having these these secret magic rights and she wanted to know so what she did one night was she wrapped herself in a cougar skin Oh no I can see where this is going right so she wraps herself in a cougar skin one night you know the men set out into the forest to go hunting and do their their hunting ritual she wraps herself in a cougar skin quietly creeps through the woods and and kind of follows behind the men had all gathered in a clearing in the forest so she hides behind a rock and is kind of watching seeing the secrets that she wanted to see and she kept creeping closer and closer and closer oh no well you know nobody's good at hiding to an extent She Get Closer Closer Closer she got so close they call it Sorcerer And I don't know why they called it a sorcerer in these articles I read but they said that the the Cherokee sorcerer leading the rituals spotted her and immediately saw you know through the cougar skin disguise realized you know it was a woman so the men of the tribe grabbed her and dragged her into the middle of their ritual Circle oh no as punishment for breaking the taboo um because again it was taboo for women to be a part of this the sorcerer cast a spell on the woman and the cougar skin that she had wrapped around herself became her own skin oh no she should have stayed in the cheap seats and stayed back further and not gotten seen that's the thing she kept creeping closer and closer and closer and gave her damn self away so she became this like strange mix of a cougar and a woman and she was cursed to live forever um she was going to be immortal they cursed her to be immortal living alone forever in the the woods never again to enjoy human company oh that's sad that's kind of a harsh punishment so this Wampus cat is essentially supposed to be the beautiful Cherokee woman who was cursed into her cougar skin the true definition of a cougar the first cougar right so you know she has said to to Ram the appalachi mountains at night traveling up and down the hills and in and out of the valleys kind of wandering forever along in those mountains and Forest regions that's so sad so she steals animals ruins things from the farm and they say that she's acting out in anger the funny thing is basically this story kind of came to light in like the early 1900s so this particular story about the Cherokee Woman was not prevalent prior to the early 1900s this just kind of came out of nowhere but the folklore of this creature goes back beyond the story of the Cherokee Woman oh okay so so like the Cherokee Woman story is relatively recent and there's more history to it correct oh okay there is a word and you know how I am with words everybody knows how I am with words I'm probably saying it wrong it's called a campus and a campus is a word used to describe the idea of an unknown animal lurking in the woods and and something to blame any unusual event on somewhere maybe it was a TV show or something I've heard somebody say people going all catawampus and it just means like going crazy I think I've heard that phrase before like on a TV show or something yeah so apparently that word actually means an unknown animal lurking in the woods and that's originally what they would call this creature is a catalus and that was before the Cherokee story came out I see I see it actually a Kampus is like basically it's like some strange unknown creature that doesn't necessarily relate to a cat I guess okay yeah catawampus is a is a just a word it doesn't necessarily mean actual cat right right did they describe the catawampus there are depending on where you look at different articles online you can find pictures of it and it looks like a badass cat like a cougar woman who just wants to rip your throat out oh wow how big is it it is actually almost the size of a what are those Barrel dogs St Bernards like a St Bernard kind of dog oh my goodness it's large it's large it's probably a good six seven feet long that's a big dog those St Bernard not including the tail so a cat that size that's pretty huge a lot of the stories actually even though you can hear stories about it all up and down Appalachia it seems like a lot of them are centered um around North Carolina area even to this day people will hear growls and moans and cries and they say that it's the wpus cat crying missing that human companionship does it attack people it doesn't attack people but it attacks animals so you could have your little Old Farm in the middle of the woods out there and all of a sudden your shit's gone in the morning and there's nothing but a blood trail the authorities are going to blame it on a Wampus cat I Goa wow like I said found another story that then called it a a part dog part human part cat I don't know where the twist in that story is but what I did realize is that some of the stories are are a little different depending on where in Appalachia they're being told and I think there's just I think it might more be a general term I think there's a bunch of mysterious [ __ ] going on in Appalachia that we don't know and we're just all calling it a Wampus cat I think that place is riddled with Cryptids and they're just calling him a Wampus cat because I read another story that it almost sounded like a Bigfoot sighting and we have yet to do our Bigfoot story we're getting there but as you know there has been Bigfoot sightings as far down in the eastern United States as Appalachia North Carolina Tennesse area there has been some of these stories that I found where the physical description sounds like Bigfoot and they're calling it Aus cat it seems like it's a catchall term like I think so there might be a a cat looking creature that's one of the Cryptids that's in that kind of Wampus cat category but it sounds like it's a catchall for for mysterious things that they don't know what it is in those deep dense Woods in Appalachia because it sounds like in Arkansas and Missouri that's where they're kind of giving it more of the half dog half cat creature and I mean all of them make it sound like it can run erect or on all fours creepy just very creepy if a cat is running at me on two legs I'm flipping [ __ ] if a cat's as big as a St Bernard and it's running towards me in any way I'm definitely flipping [ __ ] because again it's it's described with like specifically like cougar like features like we aren't talking my little kitty cat sitting on my lap here so when we go camp off the epan trail you're saying we need to bring bear spray and catnip basically but they say a lot of the sightings are either just after dark or right before Dawn they call it a howling evil creature some say it has bright yellow eyes some say it has bright green eyes but it can supposedly pierce the hearts and souls of those who cross its path driving them to the edge of Sanity that sounds really creepy just looking at it is enough to make you crazy is what they're saying I guess so because there's another story that they call it the evil demon Ewa the Spirit of Madness that terrorizes all of Appalachia it's just a lap cat yeah right just a curious woman in a cat coat this story um also kind of is is very specific to the North Carolina region of Appalachia but they basically say that the Ewa feasts on the dreams of the Cherokee children um and like this is some badass evil demon yeah I was thinking maybe we could just go out there and bring some weeds some wine you know some chocolate some chick flicks and maybe things would be kosher but you know if they're feeding on the dreams of children that that doesn't sound like anything that's going to be fixed by a girl's night out it's definitely freaky yeah yeah very freaky we'd have to go camping and see if we can capture at least one of these many different Cryptids but there has been stories of this creature as recently as 1999 they called it the person who saw it they described it as a cat spirit mask I means I don't know what that me I don't know what that means either but okay but they thought that they saw it tear itself apart and kind of Reform again so there are stories that it can be kind of almost like shape Shifty like a shape shifter that would make sense with the whole woman in an animal skin gets turned into a creature that would make sense that it's some type of shape shifter there are shamans and War Chiefs that have described a story of a native woman called Running Deer the spirit talker and they think that the Wampus cap is her spirit um so there's just the origin stories are just really kind of all over the place with this one and I kind of like the more I looked the more I found that didn't relate to what I had just found previously it it really does sound like what you said earlier that wus yeah it's a catch all that it really has you know because they're so hard to find and so hard to see a lot of times in these areas they don't have enough information so everything's just kind of lumped together under one thing and the thing is is in you know Appalachia there are cougars there are mountain lions there are bears for God's sakes you know who's to say a lot of these things are more like okay let's say in like the 1930s 19 40s if you came across the cougar in the woods wouldn't you maybe describe it as trying to rip your soul out maybe because you were so scared and and fearful if you've ever heard a cougar scream Heck if you've ever heard a deer or a rabbit scream they can sound like women and they can sound like a person screaming and it can be a pretty Eerie scary sound but I'm just saying I think maybe that fright you're so scared that you feel like it's trying to pull your soul out of you I am sure that the cat ain't trying to pull your soul out of you people but you might be so scared feels that way yeah and if it's dusk or Dawn and you you see that cougar that scared you so much you hear that scream you know who knows where their minds might have gone so I don't know not enough evidence on this one but definitely a hunt I'd like to go on one last point I just wanted to make to you you want to know what they describe its tail like oh what a ball like formation that's covered with sharp quills or spikes that's terrible that's awful no no oh Kitty Kitty should have a nice big floofy tail not a spiky ball tail that's awful but do you see how it's like I went to five different sites saw five different stories it's like the more I looked into it the more I found about different I just think I I think Wampus cats a catch all I think it's a catchall that people think is one crypted and it's not I don't want to say I was disappointed but I feel like it is not one animal but it might be a way to describe undescribable animals in Appalachia yeah yeah there's so many different ones and and there's not enough information to kind of classify them by themselves so they just put it all into the one interesting anything catlike because of the mountain lions and because of the Cougars there are cat creatures in Appalachia and just because they I think just people are scared and they're trying to turn it into some Supernatural animal that might not be Supernatural right I think this is like the Amityville of krypted oh okay oh so a stamp of disapproval from Shell yeah I still want to go camp there oh I totally want to go camp there but I'm just I just think the Wampus cat is a catch all for something that goes bump in the Night in the Woods interesting I like it well definitely a very cool backstory on the Wampus cat but I'm not saying that it's not a beautiful Cherokee Woman I'm just saying that I don't you I don't I don't think it's beautiful Cherokee Woman maybe it's a handful of Cryptids that have yet to be found enough to uh get their own classification absolutely because like I said one of the stories I found I am almost sure as [ __ ] that what they were really describing was a Bigfoot sighting interesting very very cool well on our around the country tour shell we will go camping in these mountains and and see what we can get pictures of definitely go crypted hunting even though it's all of Appalachia it sounds like really the hot spot is the North Carolina portion of the Appalachian Mountains all right I'm putting that on our our little list right now AR Go list AR Go yes our across country paranormal crypted haunted tour with Lila and shell sponsored by Snack Factory pretzel Chris it's not really we wish it were that's why we I don't have any snack Factory pretzel crisp and I'm kind of hungry i've smoked all my weed and I have the munchies so I think I think we're about to this up yeah I think we should wrap this up yeah so we're going to go camping at your place and uh probably not be too spooked except we'll probably get so high we're going to jump at every little noise and every little stick cracking in the woods I want to take the Ouija board to your place and [ __ ] around and find out oh yeah I either want to get probed abducted taken into the gates of hell this place has it all maybe we'll see Al Capone caring around a corner and an old timey mobster car or I can see a crypted face to face yeah that crypted I really want to do some more research on because it was so elusive I kept seeing little tiny hints to it but other than that old newsreel I didn't really get any substantial information so I'm this Vision I have this vision of like a two-headed Lochness if anyone is from that area I'm curious about lay lines I'm curious about other energies in the area because for a place to have so many different archetypes you've got the black dog that's like the protector of places and you've got the lady in white you have the orbs you've got the orbs everywhere you've got the Native American backstory you've got the weird Farmer and the horse coming out of the pond there have been numerous deaths and things there the mobster story there's just so many stories that have that as a focal point yeah yeah and it's such a small area it's a 1 plot that has like 82 is Graves in it most of which unfortunately have been desecrated and damaged how could it have so many you know they haven't called it the gateway to Hell yet I'm just waiting for that it is the most haunted cemetery but it's just an interesting Nexus point of so many things I'm curious any listeners in the Illinois area do tell do tell we NOS let us know and K we're so glad you dumped that terrible a of yours hopefully any weed experiences going forward will be much more fun and thoughtful and uh for the rest of you join us next week on Wednesday at 4:20 a.m. as we tell two more ghosty paranormal
