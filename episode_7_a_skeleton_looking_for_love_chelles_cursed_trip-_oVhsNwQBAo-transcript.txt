you could give your love a marijuana bouquet from where there's a whole bunch of places that do it they vary from dried flowers and like eucalyptus and buds to gorgeous fresh flowers with roses and lilies and tulips whatever type of floral bouquet you can think of an amazing organic pot right in the bouquet they look stunning i'm gonna share my screen so you can see some of these bouquets because you're going to [ __ ] your pants and all i have to say is god bless america right who doesn't love that look at that oh my god i want that okay of flowers oops those are the sex cbd things hold on we'll get to those in a minute that's the next topic all right let's see so i have pot leaves and roses and pot and just all sorts of stuff that you can get delivered for valentine's day that is amazing if you can do legal delivery somebody can do this and if they're not doing it shall do it quick wow i love it aren't those great so yeah yeah so yeah for valentine's day find out if the florist near you delivers wheat bouquets because i mean that would definitely get you late i think yeah and they're gorgeous and smokeable and yeah i i'm pretty sure they'd probably get you laid how fun is that who needs chocolates when you can get a marijuana bouquet right yeah and then let's see where's that other website that i was showing you i have to say probably one of my absolute favorite things with legalization has been all the freaking science yeah so much science they've found that cannabis can help i mean not just people with pain and anxiety and things like that which that's wonderful i know it helps people with seizures and all sorts of stuff and i think that's fantastic it has also found that it can temper like period related pain i use it for fibroid pain science has also discovered that it increase your libido it can make it easier to orgasm it's amazing for people as far as sex goes who would have thought would have thought right they find out the most interesting [ __ ] is that not crazy or well okay so they've they found out that our body produces endocannabinoids naturally right you've heard that we have the whole endocannabinoid system in our brain and our nervous system and so smoking pot actually helps contribute to that and that's why it helps people with all sorts of different things there is an indication they found that cannabinoids like the ones that occur in the pot plant play a significant role in sex drive and in sex and human beings they've found that people who smoke pot have more sex than people who don't smoke pot how do you get into these surveys how do you go to harvard and say do you got any sex slash pot smoking stuff going on because i'm interested the best like i saw here was about smoking pot and driving and i lived too far away to participate in it but yeah who's doing these surveys who's the recruiter for these surveys that's what i want to know what's your pitch what's your pitch there was a study in 2017 and i have to look it back up and see who did it but they found that cannabis activated the part of our brains it's associated with sexual arousal so using cannabis can really help people you know it can help you relax it can help you get into the mood and and there are a ton of products because you know we love to sell things so there's like sensuality which is you know like drinkable um pot so you get like the thc you can you know drink a cup of tea before you get in the mood they've got um creams and lotions and oils it's just hey have the best valentine's day yet just use a little

things like that well they had no creams for back pain and my husband has back pain and not a lot helps it so we got a couple samples for that well they also had samples for a little intimate thc oil so we got a sample of each and let me tell ya they both worked wonders they were amazing so you know i'm saying he didn't have back pain that was just a segway to get into the intimacy oils the intimacy oil no actually he really does have back pain and the cream really did help i miss festivals i miss going to festivals i miss festivals a lot and my fear is a we're too old to keep up with

tell them a ghost story and have i got a ghost story for you i actually have a ghost story about a romantic ghost shell a romantic ghost yes and kind of intriguing tell me tell me all right in the spirit of valentine's day i have got an amorous ghost for your shell ooh do you tell well maybe it's not really a ghost i guess more so a skeleton or bones i'm not sure you're gonna have to tell me what you think when after i tell you the story get a little creeped out already right okay so this is in colorado i'm gonna tell you the true story of a gentleman named jay dawson hitchpath from back east not sure where he came to a mining town in colorado called buckskin around 1863. and he went in buckskin yeah yeah well you know they weren't very creative in naming towns back then they were all like buckskin and baby doe and the gold rush or boulder boulder right right that's not very creative we love people in boulder by the way me too i lived in colorado for a little while which is kind of funny because a town that i lived in which is really obscure shows up in this story that freaked me out all right so jay dawson hitchpath came to buckskin mining town in colorado to try and become a prospector he's looking for silver and gold and in addition to trying to find gold hitch path was also looking for a wife and he was a hopeless romantic he was looking for a woman any woman to be his lady love this dude had no scruples either he hit on everyone in town and considering that being the wild west and during the gold rush time there weren't very many women to begin with in this town and he pursued every single one it didn't matter if they were married if they were children if they were school moms if they were dance hall girls he pursued them all he would write them poetry and bring them flowers are you sure this isn't about somebody i know what do you know that's in there a lot of guy i got a lot of guys like that you know a lot of guys have trouble taking no for an answer and jay dawson was no exception so these women he was refused over and over and over again and he would come back every time with more flowers and a more flamboyant poem and so he chased all these women in town and honestly it's surprised you'd think he would have been killed by someone by somebody's pissed off husband or overprotective papa but no you know what you know where he went wrong he wasn't sending the marijuana bouquets see now those are the flowers he should have been picking and you know it's legal in colorado i'm sure it was legal back in 1860 something probably exactly right yeah so if he'd done that along with some of those thc oils he would have been in but no there is apparently written record of a jay dawson hitch path getting arrested or um getting beaten up you know disturbing the peace more than likely by the pimp from the pimp of a woman he thought he was in love with or the husband of a woman that he flirted a little bit too much with so jay dawson did not die at the fifth's fists anyway jay dawson did not die at the fists of another man no he was killed in a kind of shitty accidental way on july 23 1865 hitch path fell to his death and depending on which version you believe he was either out on the mountain picking flowers for his latest lady love or he was working his mind but either way he fell off a cliff broke his neck and died another miner saw the body and they went and they got some townspeople to come up and try and find him and they discovered his distinctive hat he would wear this bowler hat that had like a um like a medallion on it so they found the hat and they knew it was jay dawson and then they found his kind of mangled body they took him back and buried him in the cemetery and you know maybe the ladies in town were a little relieved you know one less hopeless romantic kind of pining after all the poor beleaguered women in town right so jade dawson hitch path was not to be deterred by a no and in this case by death either so he remained a hopeless romantic even after dead even after being dead even after death whatever so he's still a hopeless romantic and the way we know this is because not more than a few days after he was buried a young married woman who had been one of the most recent women that jay dawson had been flirting with heard a knock at her door and as she opened the door a slip of paper flew underneath it and she looked up from watching the paper to see a skeleton standing against the posts of her porch holding a bouquet of flowers and she fainted dead away like the actual bones are an apparition no the actual skeleton wearing jay dawson hitch pat's hat holding a bouquet of flowers standing there as if to pay court to the young married lady that's [ __ ] up when the men got there after having heard her scream they found her fainted and the skeleton's still there she woke up babbling about bones and hitch path and they found the letter and it was a poem written to her from jay dawson oh wow so they carried his bones back to the cemetery to an empty grave where they've reburied his bones so they knew it had to offend him now yes yes that did not end his romantic escapades mr j dawson hitch path then started showing up on the porch and in the beds of women all over town so his bones were just creeping out of the dirt every night every few days he would show up like one young woman woke up to find him tucked into bed next to her holding a poem in his hand wearing his hat wouldn't you [ __ ] she did i'd die i'd totally die another lady who was kind of short-sighted he showed up in her kitchen and she thought they were soup bones and thankfully her son came in and fished them out of the pot before things got a little dicey oh my god as you would think the town's people were perplexed everyone was freaking out no one knew what was happening because every time they found his bones his grave was empty so they started to get creative with how they returned his bones back to this grave uh one time they even buried it under a big huge boulder thinking that that would stop him and it didn't he showed up on the porch of the daughter of the local minister holding a bouquet and a poem just like before and of course wearing his distinctive hat that's when you move away well the whole town moved the whole town moved uh buckskin was just a mining town and so actually after a couple years it dried up and people a lot of people went to the nearby town of alma and so did jay dawson hitch path he started showing up just like before on the porch and in the bed of local women in town each time with his hat finally after like a decade of this someone got absolutely fed up uh various reports say it was someone's husband it was the minister or it was the father to a young woman that he had frightened with his bones gathered up j dawson hitch path's boat hidge gathered up j dawson hitch paths bones his hat and his latest poem and took him over the mountain pass to a little town called leadville where i used to live a little town called leadville colorado and he found on the outskirts where some miners were there was an outhouse and he threw jay dawson's bones down into the outhouse saying no gentlemen and certainly no one looking for a wife would ever show up at a lady's house smelling like [ __ ] and sure enough jay dawson never appeared in anyone's home again however it's rumored that if you find just the right outhouse you might hear if you sit down coming from beneath you in his you know distinctive voice will you be my own if i heard that coming from below my ass i would i don't even know what i do i die i die can you imagine some like southeastern drawl coming up from this [ __ ] or being like will you be my own after i pee let me think about it [Laughter] supposedly the outhouse where his bones were has long been covered over or back in the 70s i guess it was covered over but there were reports supposedly of a ghost haunting the outhouse anytime a woman would go in see now i don't understand i would have gone all like witchcraft and stuff and i would have burned those bones well before that first 10 years well then you would have gotten burned as a witch back in that day probably maybe they thought the better course was just to faint dead away and let the men folk take care of it yeah right because otherwise you know if you try to do anything brave or you know do the right thing and take care of it you're a witch dang it you'll be hanging from a tree right so there you go there's the amorous ghost of j dawson j dawson hitchpath from buckskin colorado with a minor showing by leadville colorado my old stomping grounds it's the highest populated point in the us you know wow i feel like you got a lot of colorado stories lately is this like a haunted state that i'm unaware of well it is an old mining state so yeah i think there's a lot of things there like gold rush town kind of thing sure and i'm sure subconsciously maybe i'm drawn to colorado because that is one of the places i've lived and i really liked it there but leadville itself has a lot of ghosts i used to live on a street called baby doe drive and there's a lot of stories about her i have never been west of the mississippi at this particular moment in time in my life i am very unfamiliar with your territory all right so that was my story what do you what did you think what did you think about the amorous the amr is a ghost amorous ghost or amorous bones like the story is called the amorous ghost of jay dawson hitchpath but it's really like he's not a ghost like what do you call that it's not a zombie what's a what's an ambulatory skeleton like what's the term for that you're right it's not a zombie it's not a ghost it's not an apparition it is a like i don't even know not a zombie i don't know ambulatory skeleton is the best i can come up with so if anybody out there knows what that is what is it called when somebody's bones keep getting up and like haunting people what is that it's called some scary [ __ ] other than a very dedicated practical joke it's either like a super dedicated practical joke or you know just crazy horny bones super horny bones were those bones rubbing on the cbd thc oil you know hey who knows who knows what was growing up on that mountain back in the day so what are you snacking on today shall you got any snacks or any munchies going on over there so normally i am the salty snacker but tonight i kind of was very interested in the quaker chewy granola bars that have the chocolate chips in them so that is my current snack of choice chocolate chip granola bars it sounds delish i'm going with the uh tried and true california almonds and caramel corn caramel corn california almonds and caramel corn i love caramel corn silly festival food caramel corn do you know my first edible was a ganja goo ball was caramel corn and um it was like peanut butter and caramel and popcorn and and all sorts of stuff was can of butter you know that someone had created in their kitchen or whatever at a festival and they were going around and they had made these popcorn balls they called them ganja goo balls and uh man they got you really really high really stoned i think the first edibles i ever had were like the the traditional i call them traditional rice crispy treat and i was i was rock that very first rice krispie treat i was rocked i think um there are a grouping of people that do not like edibles and do not get that same high from them i was one of those people but only because i mistakenly took too much i mean at festivals honestly my experiences were all good i can say that you know the ganja goo balls and the brownies and the rice krispies treats that i got from festivals i never had a problem with that it was the it was my buddy i think who was trying to show off and who made these way too potent little muffins and those hurt and yeah kind of yeah they kind of put me off for a couple years and i think that happens to people you know you get something that you don't know the dosage of and you really should be careful one small bite and see wait an hour and see how it affects you right right there's always those jokes and the you know the memes that you see where people are like these edibles aren't [ __ ] and then you eat more and then they're on the floor like they've turned into a puddle of colors and they're nothing they're just goo on the floor there's nothing left of them yeah you're googling in the corner yeah so you gotta be careful take it slow take a bite or two at a time wait an hour maybe wait two hours before you try a little bit more but if you don't know the potency be careful oh and cbds keep cbd's handy if you ever do kind of have too much if you ever have too much of an edible if you smoke too much taking cbds can really help and interestingly enough if you have whole black peppers like peppercorns take two or three of those black peppercorns and you can chew them for a little relief if you feel too high like like only if you like black pepper though interesting tips and tricks there you go wow and that public service announcement was brought to you by leila the brewer [Laughter] so yeah i was going to tell you a story that was more of a personal experience story tonight oh that's awesome that's right you mentioned you were gonna tell us uh a place that you went sometime without me which i hate but i'm excited to hear a new story it's not necessarily valentine's day related that's okay but i i this is one of those things that kind of got me into wanting to experience scary things not just you like it you're interested in it this kind of was one of those things that got me into that i want to go seek things out i want to go get myself scared you wanted to get involved like get your hands dirty yeah and and you know you hear about all these experiences people have and you know they say they see things they say they hear things well that's all fine and good but you don't really get it until you've experienced it yourself and then you're like holy [ __ ] that's it that's very true so i uh wanted to talk about a place in pennsylvania fallbrook cemetery in tioga county pennsylvania this town was actually it was a town back in the 1860s and it was a coal mining town a coal production town oh so we both are talking about mining towns how interesting yes because in case you are not aware a lot of pennsylvania was coal mining back in yeah yeah back in the 1800s this is about i don't know it's it's closer to the new york border but this basically this was a a coal town and it was founded by a man named john mcgee and he had kind of discovered coal in that area what he also did was constructed a railroad to connect fallbrook with corning new york i know you're familiar with corning new york what is it tonight with towns that i've lived in leadville colorado corning new york what is this like layla visits old haunted home week or something like i said all right so he built a railroad to go to corning new york he did that is where the coal was then transported up the erie canal so it makes sense again we're talking about 1860. fall brook had a population of around 14 1500 people but as you can imagine at some point the coal ran out so the only reason this town really existed was because of the coal as you are personally familiar uh with that rural part of the the northeast not a whole lot going on no like so much of pennsylvania coal mining was like the only thing that they had for generations so there's not a lot going on so when the coal kind of ran out by the by by 1900 the town basically ceased to exist people had no choice but to go to other towns and cities because there was no jobs yeah because there was nothing there right right interestingly enough the town of fallbrook california is named after this town hey google how far away is fallbrook california from here you are 31.5 miles away from fallbrook by car 31.5 miles oh wow okay yeah so this is haunted layla time go ahead whatever fine the ghosts are [ __ ] with me today i don't care i don't care wow this is kind of creepy i'm glad i met you tonight oh we should put it on a map and see leadville corning and fallbrook right [Music] all right anyways keep all right go ahead shall keep on with the story it kind of became a a quote-unquote ghost town because it was abandoned and as you can imagine you know 14 15 100 people lived there for about 40 some odd years so there were buildings there was a cemetery there you know there there was it had been a town for god's sakes during the time that this was actually a town another oddly tragic thing the plague went through huh weird here we are again oh no not another plague yeah smallpox went rampant through that area many children passed away oh that's really sad i hate all the stories where the kids you know like our dueling axe murders where all the kids die that always makes me sad this cemetery this particular cemetery that it was the cemetery for the town in the 40 years that it existed but the cemetery due to it being a mining town and due to smallpox going rampant through the town the cemetery was mostly filled with either miners or children so miners are miners miners are miners exactly so as you can imagine you know with with smallpox and it being a mining town that that cemetery had kind of filled up and became actually the most populated spot in the small town oh there were more dead people than a live people at one point most of them were kids um yeah yeah that had died that had died of of the sickness when you said this wasn't a valentine's story i didn't i didn't realize you're gonna like tell a total bummer of a story apparently but again with with coal being its one and only source of income the town fell into despair and was abandoned by 1900. even to this day only a few block foundations and the dilapidated cemetery remain so the cemetery it's still basically there but it's not one of those cemeteries that is kept up necessarily there has been in the last 10 years or so a couple of historic organizations that have tried to mow the grass every few years and things of that nature but essentially think of this as an abandoned cemetery in the middle of woods in freaking rural northern pa so if i can imagine basically this has been left to nature there's trees growing up through everything bushes grass weeds probably a mess correct like most rural places i'm sure there's the occasional fire pit broken beer bottles and a little bit of garbage here and there no really you'll you'll find out why as i continue that's surprising because there's one thing that rural new yorkers and pennsylvania kids know how to do and that's find a [ __ ] spot to party but you know what this is this is a spot that that people are legitimately afraid of and no [ __ ] enough that the teens stay away and uh don't go out there drinking and smoking i mean exactly about 25 27 years ago i had a friend who was going to college at mansfield university which was nearby to this as a part of his fraternity kind of hazing they would take people to the cemetery now if you go on if you google things like most haunted places in pennsylvania this does come up on the top of most lists in order to ascend to the heights of a fraternity hazing ritual it's got to have a reputation i mean it's gotta be known it's super scary right so so you know we have this i have this friend who would come across hey here's a cemetery everybody says it's haunted even the townspeople are kind of sketched out by it so of course you know at that point i was probably maybe 19 or 20 years old so i'm like let's do this [Laughter] somebody says it's the most haunted place and that is your first reaction shell's like oh yeah i'm going like the only question is when i was i was on board with that and so you figure this was probably roughly around 1995 and i had just gotten my first camcorder how big was it was it bigger than your head yeah don't judge me did it take like the full-size vhs tapes did it take the phone don't judge me that's awesome it was 1995. it was probably like cutting edge for the time i love that and the battery oh my god the battery pack was probably like as big as your freaking hand actually the i think the battery pack is bigger than my current cell phone how great is that all right so you had this amazing camcorder so i had just gotten this amazing camcorder and i had in my mind i am gonna videotape my experience going to the cemetery who wouldn't right well in my mind who wouldn't i i'm with a couple of friends and we load up and off we go we have now that was back when cell phones were like flip phones so i have my little flippy phone i have my camcorder and and off i go now this was kind of because like i said it's kind of a abandoned cemetery in the middle of the woods in rural pennsylvania not the easiest of accessible locations you get to a certain point that you can drive but then you've got to walk about half a mile into the woods we had taken the cell phone taken the camcorder and locked the car now that is key to down the road in the story the car was locked okay i've put it in my stoner brain right in the memory banks the car was locked okay i got it i'll remember and then take this maybe quarter mile half a mile hike into the woods to to what was supposed to be the entrance to the cemetery so it's one of those creepy like dirt old dirt road where like the forest goes right up to the edge of the road on both sides you know what atmosphere i'm talking about like like jason voorhees ex-murderer y'all gonna die tonight kind of environment like you're absolutely sure right around the next tree trunk there's going to absolutely be a serial killer right there ready to get you and your car is going to die because that's what happens in all the movies either that or bigfoot what are they all right so we're going down this path and there's three of us and you know i'm feeling pretty safe because if nothing else out of the three of us i was the only girl so as we get closer wait wait wait you were the only girl doesn't that mean in the in the if this was a scary movie you'd be the first one to die or no no wait no you'd be the only one to live okay everyone i guess you're the only one to live yeah you're right you'd be the only one to live okay scratch that all right so you're safe so you know you're safe all right so i feel like i'm relatively safe and you know because i'm from that general vicinity i pretty i i feel pretty confident and safe in my abilities to be in the woods at night so here i go down this path and i you approach an old wooden sign it almost just looks like a slab of wood that someone carved out with a knife and it just says fallbrook cemetery right from the get-go you know you're expecting some sort of professional signage and it's like some carved wood piece of wood and you're like all right right like some crazy old dude with a big long beard and a shack on the edge of the property carved it out with his like hunting knife you know and they just slapped it up there to scare everybody away basically yeah so you know and i'm all into it and i'm you know i got my camcorder and you know i'm i'm recording everything left and right you know i mean you're familiar with these old style camcorders it had a light on it which of course i found comforting as well because it had like this little like spot lady thing so we get to the entrance of this thing this cemetery all of a sudden everything went dead silent like the insects and all that you know it's night time it's night time in the in rural pennsylvania in backwoods of pennsylvania you know there's crickets there's all sorts of noise it was like all the sound got sucked from the air oh oh i've experienced that before that's eerie that's an eerie moment and being of a being of a witchy persuasion it it really that freaked me out because i'm like i knew that i was hearing the crickets and the bugs and you know the things you hear at night in the woods there was a very distinct point where there was definitely the crickets in the woodsy type noises and then there wasn't that was something that you picked right up on yeah yes you know when you grow up being in the woods at night so when you hear that dead silence that spooks you yeah it's noticeable it's almost loud it is it is it's like that deafening silence so you know we were in this foresty woodsy area the cemetery kind of opens up to like a circular clearing so i'm thinking here i am in a circular clearing all the sound has been sucked from the air i'm a witch and i'm going to die here tonight because something spooky is about to go down but i still got my camcorder still got my flip phone and i am right i died but you're gonna record every last [ __ ] moment i am there i am there to record some ghosty footage and damn it i wanted my ghost and you're gonna blare witch it if it's the last thing you do you know this was before blair witch but i was totally blair witch in it totally yeah yeah so you start here you know you so imagine this dead silence where it sounds like all the all the sound was sucked from the air but then all of a sudden you hear like footsteps you know crunching on the leaves footsteps yeah yeah but like still no crickets still no wind oh and that was the other thing no wind and it was windy walking down the path it was like the earth stopped in that round clearing area so you get down to the cemetery and not only is there no more wind you can't hear the wind no you don't hear any insects no you're not moving and then you're here in footsteps oh my god so you know all of a sudden i'm like all right shit's about to get real here we start walking around and start looking at some of the tombstones because also you know i like history and and that interests me and i was noticing there was a lot of tombstones that had like hand positions on it and you know different like hand symbols or like yeah like um asl signs yeah maybe i don't know if they were asl signs but like they looked like they could have been and then i saw there is actually a witch buried there oh and how do you know it was a witch because the tombstone told me so really yeah oh how cool what did it say i don't was it in a bad way or in a good way um or just neutral like hey here's a witch she's dead i don't think it was like in a salem witch trials kind of way but in a we found out you're a witch and we're gonna try to shame you in death by telling people i don't know i gotcha i had bent down and this is where this is where [ __ ] really starts getting nuts so so i had bent down because at that point i had just recently learned about gravestone rubbings you know you put the piece of paper and you rub it and stuff yeah you rub it like with a pencil or with charcoal or something so you can make an impression yeah right so i'm trying to like pull some of the the grass and the moss off of this so i could read the the lettering very clearly to record it on the camcorder because i wanted to record basically the words on this because it was kind of neat and it had a pentacle on it super cool well i don't know what prompted me to stand up at that particular moment but i stood up and i went to turn and i tripped and the two the two people that were with me you know kind of helped me up you know and i was like what the [ __ ] and as soon as i tripped the camcorder went dead it is i'm trying so like just shut off or like battery died or shut off i had brought three fully charged batteries with me it shuts off and my first reaction is wow i probably just plowed through my first battery but as i'm trying to kind of get my bearings and stand up and get my footing i tried to open my little flip phone is kind of like a little bit of light because you know we're in the forest in the middle of the freaking night phone doesn't work off no battery nothing zip zero and i'm like oh no here we go oh wow so none of your electronics are working at this point so i pull out the another battery for the camcorder it's a bust nothing same one with the third and i brand new full batteries didn't work and they were not working and i'm starting to panic now because i'm like all right maybe i i got more than i bargained for okay there's ghosts here i want out you know like it's like when you're halfway up a roller coaster and you want to get off but like yeah yeah when your electronics start failing i start getting nervous then i started hearing screaming but not not like screaming like by the two people who are with me but like that faint off in the distance screaming being carried by the wind like like that's like in the same direction where like the footsteps had come from earlier well remember like i said when when the clearing opened up for the cemetery it was circular so everything sounded like it was coming from every direction oh wow oh wow oh that makes it even creepier so i finally get up without any of these electronics working you want to know why i fell why did you fall this is so creepy like i wanted to shower just for this one fact oh no oh my god shel why did you fall i fell because this cemetery is so old and uncapped and decrepit that the caskets are essentially like growing out of the ground no way no you tripped over a [ __ ] casket i tripped over the corner of a gasket you tripped over the corner of a casket of a witch laila i was ready to have a heart attack okay oh my goodness oh wow so then you know as we kind of start to like look around because you know oh you're cursed you're cursed you're just cursed i'm surprised you're still here you know how when you've been in the woods long enough in the dark you kind of start to acclimate and almost be able to like see a little bit again like you get that night vision thing going on and get your whole little night vision thing going on yeah so so that's kind of where we're at because we've got nothing that works at this point i'm like okay i'm tripping over this you know everything's not working why don't we just maybe it's time to go at that point you know maybe we should go casual like let's just uh kind of i will admit that it was my idea but i've had enough of this right so we can't get our way out can't find our way out like i said this place is a circular place so now you're lost and you've kind of lost how you came in still in the cemetery but it's almost like the entrance went away and that's oh that thing where you like walk around to where you know the entrance is and it's not there yeah but you know what that didn't even really tweak me out that much because the witchy side of me was like this is an illusion and i'm being tricked and i will be able to eventually figure my way out of here so you know they were [ __ ] with you right so i think having that background knowledge kept me calm because i was like this is this is witchcraft you know um you know you're speaking my language and i can i can totally see where this is going and i can get myself out so i wasn't tweaking at that point but then every few minutes the screaming the screaming and it sounded like a woman screaming like that eerie now was it that like rabbit scream or you know how sometimes deer will even scream was it that no it was definitely a human wow this was not anything alive in in in like an earthly scream even creepier okay that's why you're gonna tell me it was like all foggy that's why i said oh yeah that was a given it actually was all foggy but um the the weird thing is is like i said it was one of those screams that you felt was like carried by the wind from the other side carried by oh wow like someone's screaming from the other side like i don't know exactly i know what you're saying i loved how you said that you know i i'm spooked at this point so after a while i would say all in all we were probably um we thought and this is where it's also a little weird we thought we had been there for maybe about an hour hour and a half we showed up at probably about 10 o'clock at night was when we got there and we felt that we had been there about an hour hour and a half and when there did come a point where like i suspected we were able to find our way out find the path out and we started heading back to the car i'm just curious was there anything that you noticed or remembered that kind of helped release you from that cycle of wandering no no it just kind of happened no no it didn't just happen i'm not gonna i am not done yet well sorry okay sorry so you go okay sorry so you find the end you finally find the entrance like you know you would find the entrance so you know this is after tripping over a grave tripping over a casket you know it it's this this casket's 100 years old and i'm spooked i'm tripping over this you know i'm waiting to see bones between that and everything going dead silent and the wind stopping the footsteps the screaming like i've had it i would have been done long before that i mean i'm really impressed with how well you you kind of like held out for all of this it's quite impressive and like i said we felt like we were there for like an hour hour and a half and part of that was because we could not find our way out in a very small circular area where you should very easily be able to find the path in um because this was like a road like a dirt road like the size of a car path we're not talking like some tiny little walking path in the woods like as wide as a car path and it disappeared so we find the path anyway as as we're walking out of the circle i almost felt like i was walking through a bubble where i almost had to like push myself through and then i felt like i was being watched the woods i i felt like the woods were watching me oh wow like once you got through that barrier you felt like after that you felt like you're being watched because remember from the beginning like i said it was about a quarter mile to a half a mile walk down this path this dirt road so we got the same amount of walk back that whole walk back it was that feeling of being watched and then it was like giggling like little girls giggling like imagine little girls playing outside and just giggling and that's you know and that's when you start to kind of pick up your pace a little bit oh yeah i'd be thoroughly creeped out at that point so we approach the vehicle all four doors of the vehicle are wide open what now remember at the beginning when i told you it was locked all four doors of the vehicle were wide open no shell my stoner brain remembers you told me to remember this and i said i would remember and i remember the doors were locked not when we got back they were they were wide open no way no way holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] what did you do that's a little worse no no no that's there's no worse than that that's no that's no now this was not my vehicle and i was not the driver so naturally when you are approaching a car that you're attempting to get into you're not gonna go right for the driver's side you're gonna go for the passenger side because you're not the driver right right so so i you know and we're like uh and you know it again it's near a college town you know frats hazing blah blah blah so your first instinct is someone's [ __ ] with you okay well you're like you know oh maybe one of the frat brothers had got the spare key or something came and was playing a dirty trick you know or or that was back in the day where you could still use a coat hanger and unlock a door and you know just [ __ ] with people that's right we know that that's the first rule of ghost hunting as soon as something weird happens you look for the most likely plausible explanation so of course we're assuming we were being [ __ ] with but still that's so [ __ ] up i'd be so scared you would be so scared but after what you just experienced you still want nothing more than to get into that car hell yeah i mean after checking the trunk and the backs and under every seat and the back seat checking the whole thing well as my friend that was the driver of the vehicle the owner of the vehicle approaches the driver's side in the driver's side door that was open there was a child's hat on the driver's seat what that was that was made out of lace and looked like it was from the 1800s time period what sitting on the [ __ ] driver's seat of the clock what did you just say no wait a minute like a bonnet like a lacing bonnet yeah no [ __ ] way on the car seat this was something yes and this was something that a was not in this car prior first of all did you have your daughter yet um my she never wore daughter lacy bonnet as far as i can tell my daughter might have been a year or two old but this was definitely the only way i can describe it is you know how in the 1800s they had like that hard starchy cotton yeah yeah it was like that with lace wow oh my gosh old fashioned lacy baby bonnet dirty lacy baby bonnet oh that's so freaking creepy let me tell you i have that that's probably one of the most scared ever in my lifetimes i was scared like i was scared shitless because you know i'm in the middle of the woods i'm in pennsylvania i'm an hour from home like i don't even know what could happen to me at this point like i'm thinking like axe murder coming out of the woods we're all going to die like i would too i'm like did you keep the bonnet or did you throw it out no we we threw it out of the car and jumped in the car and took off and i will tell you i don't think i'll be spinning your tires and throwing dirt the entire way and the first thing we did on the drive back i do not condone this as an adult remember i was in my early 20s the whole way back we just had to smoke bowl after bowl after bowl because we were so scared we had to get that's the best way to you know cleanse the cars the the cleansing smoke of cannabis will help to get rid of it'll get rid of any negative spirits i felt like i had to cleanse my spirit after that like yeah there was something there that night that i was not mentally prepared to encounter even though i thought i was you know i was trying to be all billy badass but when push came to shove and i actually had the experiences i was scared it's like the spirits saw these you know 20-somethings they're like okay let's see what we can do with these people and the footsteps and the screams and the getting lost and the doors oh my freaking gods shell well i also wanted to point out that we are not the only ones like i said if you if you look up uh most haunted places in pennsylvania this does meet the list people have heard they've seen shadow figures lurking inside the cemetery as well as behind trees around in the woods they've heard screaming at going around just like i heard interesting like a common thing that people have heard now i did some research on other people's experiences and actually this is an interesting fact there are actually people who think that the screaming is a banshee oh a banshee in new york why would there be a banshee in new york if you are not familiar with what a banshee is it's from irish folklore and it's basically like women of the fairy mound a female spirit who heralds the death of a family member usually by wailing or or shrieking and that that kind of describes like i call it you heard a banshee that means someone you love is going to die so did any of you did any of the three of you someone that you know die shortly after you went there oh lord oh geez because i mean literally if it's a banshee they herald death i you know like i said we're talking 25 27 years ago i don't think anybody no one related to me had passed away so maybe for you guys it was some sort of spirit but that's not to say that people haven't heard of banshee in that area i'm just saying that maybe it wasn't a banshee when you guys were there right right um so but but there have been reports that people think it is a banshee that you hear screaming i know i heard screaming um i don't recall anyone in my personal circle of life i'm having passed away shortly after that but i definitely heard the screaming and and like i said i'm so scary some of these reports of people think that it is is a banshee that's screaming yeah yeah and this is not an easy cemetery to reach like i said it's in secluded in the middle of nowhere you said there's like a quarter mile hike or something half mile hike to get out to it yeah after like after you drive through these old roads then you still have a hike to get to it right and they do say that if you drive your car up too far too close to the cemetery um that your car battery will die luckily we didn't drive that far up that night but the person who took us there that was familiar with it did say we cannot for any reason drive any further we have to stop here and walk well you guys experienced your electronics dying so i would put a lot of credence to that for whatever reason you know your cell phone died your camera died i mean the electronics definitely had issues right and there there's actually been people who feel that they have witnessed the banshee people uh locally actually tell they advise you not to go there but this is this is definitely a spooky place that sounds like a really scary scary place very creepy and you know again because of all the children the bonnet that was left in the car um kind of makes sense that the children laughing as we're walking down the path you know it was that vibe that the kids were playing tricks on us by leaving this hat in the car like it was a game right like they wanted to see what they could do to the living people you know you don't want to leave a memento or something like when you have a visitor at your house and the kids want to play with the visitor kind of oh and they want to give you gifts they always want to give you something of theirs that's true good point oh wow that makes it even creepier it does do you think you offended them by throwing the bonnet out i don't know i mean you should have kept up on it i was too scared oh my gosh too scared to care right you're like i don't care if it's a gift take it back take it back i don't know i really i really did feel like it was coming at me from every different angle like the kids seemed harmless and they just wanted to play but there was something that i felt was watching us in the woods so like not everything was harmless like maybe the kids were harmless but maybe there was something else there that wasn't so innocent right right there was okay stuff coming at you but sketchy stuff coming at you from like a like a vibe like magical point of view there was a lot of good and a lot of bad there but like i said some of the cemetery was coal miners and some of it was children who died from the plague so either way you got a whole bunch of people who might not realize they're dead right and might be very unhappy with the way that they died and then think of it this way you know the town gets abandoned everybody leaves it's almost like they feel like they were left behind too yeah i don't know i'd be pleased yeah because now there's nobody there to care for it anymore there's no one to to make sure that they're remembered but they're um most recently there was a paranormal u.s group that went there if this this is this is the real deal man if you are in northern pennsylvania like this is the real deal this place is scary because you know if you if you do look it up you know you'll you'll see a lot of similar stories from all kinds of folks that have been there but tonight i just kind of wanted to focus on my personal story but i do want to point out that a lot of the things i experienced are similar things that other people have experienced as well the screaming the feeling of being watched hearing small children those kinds of things this place is spooky i definitely give it 10 stars on a spooktacular scale i'm curious to see to look up some other people's experiences because it sounds like wait what you saw and heard was just i mean out of this world unsettling right very unsettling it was all very highly unsettling and it's just intriguing to me you know kind of what happened and what may have caused it and just that other people kind of experience similar things you know just is very very interesting and i i can't wait to see what other people have kind of seen too and honestly if anyone out there any listeners of you have experienced if you have any scary stories send them on in you know you've got personal ghost stories you know ghoulish crime send it in we're curious i'd like to hear your personal stories what have you experienced you know what are the ghost stories of of your town or or your area i just told you what me what made me the most scared tell me what makes you the most scared or have you ever seen a nice ghost have you ever had a ghost that was you know maybe not as amorous as uh mr hitchpath but you know somebody who said whispered sweet nothings instead of get out who knows spirits can love you spirits can want to drive you away that's true and in the case of some of them they they really just want someone to say that they'll be theirs to the end of time even in the afterlife isn't that all we want someone to just love us always it really is and i think that that kind of loops back to some of the paranormal at fallbrook is that i i do think that especially with the children they feel forgotten like they were abandoned when people abandoned the town they abandoned these people and like it's like their spirit can't get over that that they were abandoned it will deteriorate into nothing and the woods and the trees and in the forest will take it over 100 um eventually absolutely this is definitely one of those places getting eaten up by the forest well on that depressing note i gotta check and see if i've got something for next week do you know what you're gonna talk about next week my organized partner oh my god
