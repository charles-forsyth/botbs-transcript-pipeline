seasoned practitioner or just starting to embrace your inner witch Le and shell will guide you through the mystical world of casting circles and leaving mundane life behind so grab your favorite potion sit back and get ready for a cackling good time I'm shell and I'm Leila and we're back on the broomstick we are here today to talk about magical spaces and sacred spaces and do you need to go to that mushroom Circle in the woods in order to get to that magical place well that's fun maybe not necessary but you might have a good time sure and do you need to create a permanent space in your yard again a lot of fun but you don't have to so what is a secret space what is a magic circle and why would you cast one casting a magic circle it's the art the act of creating an energetic barrier an energy wall that separates your sacred ritual space from its mundane surroundings and that Circle will contain the energy the magical working that you do so the idea is to cleanse a space of any unwanted energies and then Circle it to protect and contain any energies you do want to bring into the space whether delineated by actual something like salt or visually by energy it's basically to to delineate a space that's being used for a magical working whether that's meditation a spell or ritual and to keep it safe from any outside energy and kind of contain your own energy in that space you know another way to think of it is like creating your bubble um your creating a circle you're creating that Sacred Space you're creating that bubble and I think one of the most important things people forget you want to cast a circle you want to create your space but you got to cleanse it too that's right don't forget to cleanse it and we'll get into that a little bit I know shell has had some issues with that in the past let's just let's just cast The Circle to lock everything in what the yeah let's let's not do that and so make sure to cleanse your space and then late it and you can do that either uh like shell said by putting something around in a circle of physical object crystals candles walking it with incense or just in your mind visualizing that Circle and creating that Sacred Space intentionally it can just be a place though where you just take a minute you know where you kind of recharge your batteries kind of thing it doesn't even have to be like quote unquote decorated there's a misconception that for it to be Sacred Space there has to be like stuff material stuff crystals and salt in a circle not necessary not necessary Sacred Space can be a physical place and I do recommend that if you have an altar set up or if you go regularly meditate or do ritual in a certain space you should have that space set up to be a Sacred Space for you but it doesn't actually have to be a physical place it could just be a state of mind not everybody has that like property physical property you know not everybody has this beautiful fairy garden outside their bedroom window not feasible for for a lot of people so sometimes it is just in your space in your head right go visualize and I do recommend when you're creating Sacred Space is that it's something that you do start physically if you can simply as if you're on a beach you can draw a circle in the sand or you can use incense and walk in a circle when I was younger I liked to use salt and make a salt Circle what I was a teenager in high school and first discovering Witchcraft and decided that I was a witch and I was going to perform ritual I knew that I saw that people in high school did you no I did not I did although some of them probably needed it yeah outside my room was a window that went out to the roof of my porch and it was kind of hidden from view tucked in back so that you couldn't see that top of the roof and it was open to the second floor and you could get to it easily from the window just AC Ross the hallway from my bedroom so I kind of created that as my place to do ritual at night I would open that window up climb out onto the roof and I had a very clear view of the stars but because of the way that roof was situated I was pretty much hidden from anywhere on basically three sides so it was a great place for teenage me to do ritual so I decided to create Sacred Space there by literally drawing a circle in salt because that is one way to create a Sacred Space is to delineate the boundary of a circle with some something in this case I sprinkled salt in a circle as I would say sacred things to clear this space and it was great until one day I realized that by leaving the salt on a tar roof in the sunlight it had literally baked a white circle into the roof and you're like I don't know what's going on up there why is there like a ring of salt on the circle no I do you no I have no clue that's weird but yeah it can be doing something physic like that to create a space where you can basically clear all the energies in that space and have a space that is just your energy and what just what energies you invite in I had actually done something similar but to a much more dramatic grandio scale of course remember when I was 20 and I lived in that old church yes loved that apartment the haunted apartment you know it didn't help that my apartment was like where they Church altar would have been but whatever different podcast your different podcast when I lived there though I had made a salt circle around that whole building and around that front drive where the cars were parked so that even my car was in the circle SM and in my 20-year-old brain I felt that I needed to create that Circle because it was an old church that makes sense I mean putting a circle around your home is a great idea you didn't cleanse it did you it was still haunted like nobody Miss no I didn't I was 20 you just put a circle around an uncleansed haunted church and then remember we'd hear the church organs like I trapped everything in that circle inside yeah I didn't realize it though I didn't realize it though I thought I was I was doing good but you know that's where you kind of have to have that background knowledge before you just go willy-nilly doing stuff so what should you have done first I probably should have cleansed that space yeah a circle is literally a seiling in and creating a bubble and I very often picture it not just as a as a two-dimensional Circle but as a three-dimensional bubble all around that includes above and below I did as well but the whole thought of it didn't dawn on me to clean it out though before creating the bubble yeah when you create that space everything inside of it is basically trapped it's right there that apartment was so haunted because I just trapped everything inside of it absolutely I 100% agree so what you should do is clear the space first center yourself you know whether you visualize that as a centering or do a whole centering ritual and then use a broom use your incense use your hand use a feather and visualize pushing all the negative and uninvited energies out away from you in a circle and then cast your circle and then invite just what energies that you choose back in let me give you the lazy Witch Way of how you can do it sometimes though I love the lazy Witch Way remember down the Road a little bit I had that beautiful third floor apartment yes how I cleansed that space because by that time I had learned that you knew a little better but I was lazy you know I I was trying to move into to an apartment I had two little kids I turned fans on and then blew incense into the fans I love remember I just remember because you know how sometimes those Sage sticks that you have like once you light those suckers they don't go out for nothing especially if you got a fan blowing on them well that's what I did and I just pelled that Sage stick and remember like that whole apartment was just like one big long yeah like a shotgun pretty much so I stood at the back door with the fan held the sage stick and just let it blow through the whole place they like good and the whole time you do that you can visualize the incense going through everything gets into every crack every nook and cram perating permeates the entire place and pushes out with that wind from the fan anything negative so you visualize that just like cleansing and pushing out all negative things and then you cast your circle being an apartment though I also visualized it kind of just encompassing my apartment that's smart too not to be rude to my neighbors I just kind of visioned it like my space you know your my space is clearing out like I hav got the time and energy to clear out the whole neighborhood people and also without knowing what your neighbors want or don't want it's probably a better idea plus you don't know what's going on there if you try to Circle your or cleanse your entire apartment building you don't know what you're taking on no plus you don't have permission from them so stick with your own space so it it's like bubbling my own little unit kind of thing but yeah that was that was probably the most effective lazy man way to do it and that apartment was just designed perfectly for it where that Sage smoke just went you know like you said like a little down a barrel right out the front door and I actually did that not too long ago on the Chinese New Year oh that's smart new year is an excellent time to cleanse and New Beginnings are great time to do some type of cleansing like that and then resetting your circles and your Wards whether it's for your small Sacred Space or your whole home I put cinnamon powder on the floor oh good one and then took a broom and dusted it out the door nice very nice why cinnamon in particular just because that's kind of a clearing cleansing keep my stuff in the good keep everything settled I like it too because it also keeps ants out so it's practical I think of that part and honestly you know back back in our our earlier days salt was the go-to you know I'm gonna make a salt Circle I'm GNA you know do this with salt do that with salt I don't think we realize how destructive salt is on certain surfaces exactly especially if you're going to be outside in the woods or in your backyard the last thing you want to be doing is spreading a circle of salt where you're going to be trying to grow things actually cinnamon is a good alternative to doing things like that I've actually never really cast a circle with cinnamon powder but I don't see why it would be any less effective to be honest you can cast a circle with anything it really is your intent if I was going to be doing especially if I was going to be doing some type of banishing spell or something that needed that fiery burn of cinnamon I might use that but you can also use sand you could use grass clippings you could use leaves in the fall you could use FL petal whatever you want really and that's that's what I don't think people get whatever you want it works it works and it works better if what you choose corresponds to your intent this is February Valentine's Day a lot of people think about love and romance this time of year they think about spraying we just had imul so maybe you want to use some flower petals maybe you know you want to buy those pink roses and cast your circle in rose petals when you're going to cast your I'm Looking For Love or romance strengthening or self-love ritual or maybe you want to set some crystals around you that correspond to the the health ritual that you're about to do I just had this vision of like a Prosperity ritual where you like cast a circle with dollar Bells I love it why not that would be a fabulous way to set a circle to do a Prosperity ritual that's brilliant I'm not saying that you know everybody's got tons of doll bills out there but and if you can't you could also write that down on paper you could write $100 bill BS on paper it does not have to actually be a $100 bill unless you're going to think that's funny if you can get into the mindset when you write it this is a real $100 bill print out a bank statement a fake one that has a million dollars in it but if you can get behind the idea that it's real and it represents a real thing you can cast your circle with those fake absolutely also something that I have done before is crystals and have used not necessarily color well sometimes I have used colorcoded crystals you know the yellow crystals for East the red or orange for South you know you can correspond crystals with the elements um and kind of use crystals in that way as well whatever works for you yeah make it fit with the season or with your spell to make it that much more powerful because intention is wonderful but when you can have an actual real physical thing to reinforce that intention it really helps to get you aligned with the energy and the magic of what you're trying to do I mean we've cast a circle with torches before we've cast circle with glow sticks before whatever works based on what your attention and what your what your end game is with that particular working the idea of the circle is to protect your space it's to literally create a barrier where no energy can get in or out unless it is by your choosing you the witch decide what gets in and out of that space and I used to do an exercise as a as a witchling in order to help me visualize and not only visualize but visualize a strong protective Circle earlier I called a circle more like a bubble you know like soap bubbles like you blow in the sumers Shell you you know you kind of blow those soap bubbles in the air and they they float around uh I like to Envision my circles like a soap bubble and I basically in my mind you know whether I'm sitting or standing I envision myself in the center of that bubble and I'll form a vision of that shimmery soap bubble all around me with the different colors and everything sliding off of it then while I'm in that space I imagine a hammer coming from outside and hitting that soap bubble when that bubble gets hit by the hammer it should stay strong if it pops I know I haven't built the circle strong enough and so I'll go back into the meditative State keep myself centered and envision that bubble going back again strong looks like a soap bubble but it's as powerful as diamonds and so again I would Envision a hammer hitting that bubble and once it stayed I knew that my circle was strong and safe enough for Magical working now I don't need to go through the whole process I can just Envision that bubble and I've done it enough times I know that it could withstand a nuclear blast it's it's a safe Circle you know and there's a there's a visual representation of that that probably a lot of people are familiar with it is actually a good visual for being a Hollywood movie scene got to go to Practical Magic love that movie dearly you know how Practical Magic and all the town ladies have their little brooms and make the circle and yes Nicole Kidman's in the center and she's getting possessed and stuff remember when she tries to leave that Circle she like runs up to it and it was like hitting a brick wall that didn't exist and falling flat back yes yeah like that's a good visualization of that that's exactly it they created that space because the idea was they needed a container so that they could keep her there and push the Spirit out of that space and that she would remain in the space safe while they pushed that negative energy out and that worked beautifully whatever you're creating your container for whether to keep you in or keep things out or whatever it's still a good representation of creating that container yes you're exactly right your intention of whether you're keeping something in or keeping something out should be part of your working when you're creating that space but very apprehensive about salt now I feel like I was killing environment and stuff back then I I feel like it was very responsible irresponsible creating salt circles I pretty much learned that lesson once I realized it was going to bake into the tar of a of a roof but yeah use sand use something else be a little environmentally responsible you could use bird seed I mean I know like for weddings instead of throwing rice now a lot of people will throw bird seed or something like that that's a fabulous way again depending on what your ritual is is very much going to dictate what you're going to want to use and could you just sit there and snap your fingers and cast a magical circle around yourself sure once you've gotten to that point again it takes practice just like anything but once you get there it's very easy to conjure up that space and you know depending on what you're doing or what your intentions are there can be multiple layers to Casting that Circle including quarter calls which we've always been very fond of but I do understand that there are some people who don't necessarily find that a part of what they want to do but that's just another layer and then yet another layer is invoking the god or goddess or both so there can be multiple layers to Casting your circle and creating your Sacred Space it doesn't necessarily have to just be creating that Circle and it doesn't necessarily have to be the whole kitten Kaboodle right once you cast that Sacred Space what you do from there is entirely up to you are you doing a full ritual where you then want to call in quarters or call in energies are you are you doing a spell are you doing a ritual are you are you meditating once you complete that purpose of being in that Sacred Space you can then release that Circle or if it's a space that you're working with in all the time you can leave a permeable Circle in space whatever your intent is and I think that you know people need to remember there's with different intentions you might have different options but in the end whatever your flavor do what works there's been times where we have done the most elaborate of elaborate Circle castings and there's been other times it was just like poof it's up exactly and sometimes especially once we were with a group where we were working and doing magic together all the time there were times where we would just all be in a room together and poof it was up just because we get together and that's what would happen and so you can get into a Groove like that with a space or with other people anytime you're going to do any magical workings I know in our other podcast we have talked about when you're doing a Ouija board or any type of div ation you should try to Circle yourself and you're working for sure ritual space dedicating an altar doing a spell casting a Sacred Space should be the first thing you do but you know there's also that aspect of don't forget either if you're not going to release it if you're going to make it a permanent thing you have to do upkeep just like you do upkeep on your car or upkeep on your furnace you have to do upkeep on your circle in your Sacred Space if you are creating like a forever space you don't want to call in the goddess and God or or call in the quarters and leave them permanently you call them in when you when you need to utilize that energies think of it as like calling a friend or calling your grandma you're not calling your grandma and telling her to come over a babysit and then never letting her leave again you know they've got other phone calls other witches to tend to but if you're going to leave up that Circle itself that Sacred Space area you got to do maintenance you know you can't cast that Circle this week and then two years now expect that same solidity you know you've got to do maintenance on that space you've got to rededicate it recast it you can create permanent space but you also have to do upkeep on it and I really like to use native stones from my backyard for this because Crystals and Stones hold on to Magic objects can hold on to that energy so when I initially cast my circle I will usually have made some type of witch ball or witch bottle four of them typically that I've done a spell for protection or for grounding or or success or you know whatever energies I feel that my home needs I I'll have made at least four different bottles and charge some stones at the same time I do my initial cleansing clearing dedicating and casting of the circle and I charge those items with that and set them around the outside of the home where I want the circle to be and then like shell said periodically you need to go through and recharge those items make sure they're not Disturbed make sure any sigils that you've put over doorways or windows are redrawn it requires maintenance it does you know that goes with kind of really anything upkeep upkeep upkeep you know like I said I had the greatest example you know you can't you can't expected to have the same strength today as it will in two years it's like changing the batteries in your home cameras you had to change the batteries in them or make sure that they're clear it's the same thing with your the circle that you're using to protect your home you have to recharge those batteries it's nice to do that with a a regular practice as well shell and I are trying to get back into daily practices this is kind of one of those maybe monthly practices maybe you know at every full moon you go around and recharge those or at the very least at every holiday you know you go through and periodically recharge and reset your circle around your your altar or your home your office wherever well and this is actually the perfect time of year for that at least I think so for me personally that time period between imbal orara is what our grandmas used to call spring cleaning the other day I dusted some crystals I had to dust some figurines but this this time between imul and ostara is a good time to kind of clean things out do that spring cleaning out with the old in with the new you know everything's been shut in and dormant it's almost time for Windows to be open and that fresh air and that Rejuvenation so now is kind of a good a good time to kind of regenerate your Sacred Space renew it clean it replenish it whatever the case may literally clean it in real life get out the cleaning solution you know your earth safe cleaning solution your reusable rags and wipe it all down dust it clean it clean from underneath it get the cat hairs that are in the corners you know get all of it cleaned and refreshed and renewed and in your home the spring cleaning that shell was talking about start from the center of your home and and clean the literal dust and cobwebs and dirt from the winter time out of your house while envisioning also negative energies and negative thoughts and feelings going out with that dirt but that's also recreating that Sacred Space reconsecration re cleansing and so it's also figuratively cleansing your Magical Home your heart your base your center it's a good time to literally do it too yeah exactly do it literally and the figurative follows right you know and once you're done and you look around at your clean space and you breathe in that fresh incense scented air and everything's put away you do feel it it feels better it feels good that energy is awesome so I'm going to end our podcast with a little story I did indeed find a coven to work with and they are a wonderful group of women and as shell knows I just recently celebrated inul with them and we talked about Practical Magic here and I think it's really really funny because in the ritual we did kind of a practical magicky thing that I adored it was so much fun great group of people wonderful ritual here's my broom oh I love it so in circle I love it too in circle we dedicated these brooms to like a magical purpose and basically honored the brooms as a tool and so now everyone in the group has a broom that was consecrated at imul that we can use to take home to magically clean your space with yeah literally and figuratively clean your space and that cleanses that space and makes it ready for you to Circle not like shell who did not cleanse the ghosts out of her space and then locked them all in with a really tight you know newbies are learn lesson learned less learned locked that place down with one powerful spell and kept it all right there they're probably still there probably is but you know I I think that the whole idea of them giving you this consecrated broom is actually super awesome and I'm jealous I just want to say that oh it was so great it was so it was such a Practical Magic Moment In the Middle we all locked the brooms together in a circle just like Practical Magic you know we were doing the magic enchanting and it was a really fun and yet also very magical moment and I really enjoyed it and now I absolutely adore this broom and it has great energy and I am going to use it as I literally clean my house with my regular tools I'm also going to use this magically consecrated broom to help figuratively magically cleanse my use the cinnamon try it yeah I love cinnamon I think you'll love it I think I'm going to be putting that around my doorways and around my my windows to kind of seal those and and also just a great smell who doesn't love that basically the biggest takeaway we want to give is even if it's only a visualization in your head you should create some sacred space if you have the ability to create some great outdoor space where you are even better the more beautiful and fabulous I love it but not necessary but definitely take the time to either create that space that you can visualize or literally create some space for yourself I wanted to read something really quick I had found um one of our original Circle castings uh when we first became quote unquote a group of witches together and I wanted to read this that's fun not only for the Nostalgia but also just for a little fun super ritualistic Circle casting for our listeners oh my gosh I love that so I have not heard this yet in however many years it has been since this I cannot wait this is dated 1996 oh wow yeah yeah go ahead and just out us there shell okay well you know whatever a lot of our listeners weren't even born yet one of my k kids wasn't born yet so this was actually a circle casting that was our original how we did it together and what we would say is we would we would visualize a wand creating a magic type light emanating from this wand in our hands and clockwise three times we would draw down a circle with light from this swand and what we would say is I cast this circle to protect us from all negative and positive forces and energies that may do us harm I charge this circle to draw in only the most perfect powerful correct and harmonious energies I cast this circle to serve as Sacred Space Between the worlds in a place of perfect love and perfect trust so mod it be and then I have in here that then we would call call and invoke the quarters and elements and then we would invoke the god and goddess so that's what we would cast The Circle back in the day oh my goodness that's one of our very first together Circle castings ever how fun man were we like a little superlative like a little extra with with we were a little extra but you know what we needed to be extra then and I think at the time being extra was perfect for us I agree it work we just don't need to be as extra now yeah and there's nothing wrong with being extra like that I loved it it worked it was beautiful it spoke to my witchy artsy soul and also we were trying to find something that was very hard to find and sometimes the theatrics and drama made it more realistic that's right and we didn't have anything there was nothing at our fingertips in 1996 I am treasuring the fact that I wrote all that stuff down in a book of shadows all those years ago because now I love being able to be like wow that was a long time ago and that would you know there's time and places for that there could be time and places where both of us are like you know what I want to go back to that Circle cast because I need that right now I need need that theatrics and that fluffy words thing right now so I love that I I still have all of this stuff of ours but I just thought that that would be a good little circle cast that was all of our own to share with our listeners perfect thank you so much for joining us I appreciate you we will see you next week for episode 4 well we get back on the broomstick you know I love this I'm glad we're doing this and I hope that everybody is able to find a little broomstick to hop back on themselves if
