the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode we'll be tackling a divisive Topic in Tarot specifically are the suit of Wands air or fire and is the suit of Swords fire or air I'm Leila and I'm excited to let out my inner tarot nerd for this episode and I'm shell and I have opinions shocking I have opinions on we're surprised we're all shocked and surprised on that one I know shell in your ginormous Tarot collection you have Decks that use the associations of fire for swords and also some that use the element of fire for Wes I have wored about a handful under 200 uh in my collection and I am all for a new deck I have obtained a couple that have wands listed as fire and swords listed is air I don't even think I realized that there was a question until maybe 10 years ago I just thought what I knew was it yeah it's definitely a question that's come up more often particularly now that I think that there's so many decks and so many readers out there right but before we get into our opinions let's rewind a little bit and talk more generally about tarot so a lot of you know that tarot started out as a card game in around 15 century Europe and it turned into a divination form you know maybe a hundred or so years later and now it has become almost an integral part of many people's meditation self-help as well as magical and divinatory practices it's so useful you know fun fact in my my mundane job I happened AC cross a resume recently and at the bottom of this person's resumee they had hobbies and interests listed and you know they were in theater did this that and the other and the very last thing said tarot reader nice I've put that on resumés in the past and actually had it be well-received I'm glad to see it's still kind of accepted but that's a different podcast now I wantan to I want to kind of take it back a a little further this goes a little back to even practice people's practice ritual practice um magical practice I have been a person person this is what I have always been taught what I learned fire swords why you might ask they're forged in fire make sense well that's definitely always been my belief as well that swords are forged in Fire and Wands come from trees which breathe literally breathe air I also feel that swords are action they're passion their their anger and emotion their physicality they very much fit for me with the element of fire it's a warrior the wood aspect of Wands is kind of taking your time thinking things through kind of that mental part when you think of Wands you think of wizards you think of magicians you think of Mages you think of the Court Mage who was the wise one who was you know they brought wisdom and intelligence to the court anyone who's going to study to be a mage has to read books and be involved with the mind so that very much says air to me and books come from trees exactly but to kind of circle back to your history you know I I think that especially between maybe 1500s and 1800s it was also kind of like the the regular playing cards where you had spades diamonds clubs I'm forgetting the other Hearts I think that maybe how they translated into you know cups pentacle swords and Wands has a little a little to do with it as well the suits have undergone quite a few different Transformations the wands were originally staves or arrows and they were considered to be like the arrows of the sun because a lot of these meanings come from when the Golden Dawn got their hands on these cards and started putting their beliefs and their High magic they used astrology they used numerology they used cabala they used humors they talk about the the elements of the world and the humors of the world and so they mapped those onto the cards actually have decks where they have the suit um labeled as staves and Pentacles was coins y cups I think have always been cups no I have a I have a deck where they're called bows modern day now especially you'll see all sorts of different names for the suits now the deck that most people are familiar with the Smith weight or the rider weight Smith deck came to be in 1910 and we talked about Pixie Pamela Coleman Smith who did the art and Arthur Edward weight who was the author of it he was part of the Golden Dawn so he went with a lot of their associations for elements they believed that the Rays of the Sun the wands the staves were fire and that swords were air because they talk about the sharp intellect a keen mind and swords cutting through cutting through disc course I guess now funny you say that because you know as we have talked about for the last year or so I I kind of reverted back to the I have the Centennial version of the what is it writer weight Coleman the Smith weight deck that one yeah I never knew that that was the interpretation I just you know swords fire wands air swords South you know wands East that made sense for you because didn't you start with the Aquarian tarot and the witches tarot I did and they are very aligned with that yes which also at the same time was when I was kind of embedding my Wiccan DNA that we like to call it and you know ritual wise magic wise that's what we were taught you know wands East air swords South Fire they went hand in you know that's what I was taught for for ritual that's what I was seeing in Tarot I never questioned it yeah and and while Ellen Canon reads the witches tarot and the Aquarian tarot are two of several decks there's there's a few dozen out there I think gazillion that have swords as fire and Wands as air the Smith weight deck does not and it's interesting that you still read them that way because I did too my very first deck was a rider weight Smith clone and some people say that the colors on the cards that you can tell that wands are fire and swords are air by the colors on the Smith weight deck and I don't think that's true because the colors are all pretty in most of these decks there's oranges and yellows and blues and purples and greens and I don't see I'm holding up here so shell can see I've got the Ace of Swords and the 10 of Wands and if you look at these cards they both have oranges and reds the swords has flames the sword although the hand is coming out of a cloud the sword literally has flames around it and the staves are growing they're green and growing and Alive like air so even though the traditional meanings of the rider weight Smith deck are wands fire swords Fair it's very easy to look at the pictures and interpret that using your own system even if it's flipped but I also have two I'm going to show you I have the the eight of Wands and the nine of Wands blue blue okay yeah light blue it looks like air then I have the Knight of Swords ironically also blue and I have the seven of Swords which is actually bright yellow right which I guess could be an air color our Point here is that no matter what the the cards that you're reading show whether the booklet says swords are air or swords are fire you can put your own interpretation and your own spin on the elements now there are reasons why these suits are corresponding with elements tell me Leila why the minor Arcana in a Tarot deck traditionally stands for like everyday life these are your this is the m this is getting down into the details this is the nitty-gritty right this is where we all live and the beforetime people I guess the people that came up with tarot uh and the Golden Dawn felt that elements were an important part of life and so they mapped these idea of of the humors of elements onto the cards four quarters four suits right exactly I am still blown away that this deck I am using was actually in intended for swords for air like and W like I am blown away I did not that isn't that great so they reduced everything to the humors and they felt that the sword could cut to the quick you know being sharp as attack cut straight to the truth or straight to the point you know there's a lot of phrases like that when it comes to what the swords mean that it means intellect and a lot of people will use those symbologies when they talk about why they think swords is air now the the arguments for for wands being fire is that it's a weapon some people talk about it because they can be the clubs or the staves of the arrows of the Sun so they talk about wands being passion and causing that type of energy bringing that type of energy I mean I can see wands being kind of an action thing but I feel like there's I don't want to say small action and big action but I guess that's what I'm saying I think to me wands is more like plotting out the action and swords is the the actual action does that make sense or am I yes absolutely I see it that way too I I feel that wands are air because that's intellect that's you that's the internal self your planning stage right and swords when you pick up a sword you're ready for action I had this argument with someone once they tried to tell me that swords literally equal words and my thought on that is no absolutely not I was raised by a hunter I was raised by a man who used guns and knives all the time and one of the biggest things I was taught is you never pick up a weapon unless you intend to use it use it exactly you do not pick up a sword when your intent is to talk right good point and like you said trees turn into books I mean it just makes so much more sense that way well I always have this vision of like this huge willow tree where the tree is kind of swaying with and a part of the wind oh exactly yes I love that imagery and I don't like it when people talk about an element in terms of what can destroy it or what can be destroyed by it wands are fire because they can be destroyed by fire and swords are air because they can cut through air that feels like opposites to me that doesn't feel like working with the element that feels like destruction to me so again that's another reason why I can't map those meanings on the cards I feel like that is almost an attempt to manipulate the element funny you should say manipulate because some people think there is a theory that says that uh AE weight actually put out misinformation in an attempt to basically be a gatekeeper and they say that because the Golden Dawn was so secretive and all this magic was supposed to be secretive it said that he switched swords and Wands so that only those with true knowledge would get it right I don't know if I entirely buy it it's an interesting Theory wait are you saying that I have true knowledge yes I'm always saying you have true knowledge shall you know this you know there's a lot of books about this and there's a quote that I really like uh Steven Skinner wrote a book called techniques of high magic and in that book he talks about how this is a blind that the swords being air and Wands being fire is what he called a blind that it was taught to beginners and then later as they worked their way up they were taught that it was the other way around which just seems like a mind to me in my opinion it would be like it'd be like if I showed up at your door one day and was like Hey Pentacles are emotions and cups our material stability You' be like what be like wait wait this isn't what we talked about right right and I guess the theory behind teaching them that way and then later being like surpris it's different was to help initiates know that things aren't set in stone that you need to be flexible and you need to always be open to learning and new knowledge which makes a little sense I I do believe that there is something behind the secrecy with the golden Dawn and kind of abely it to confuse people only because I know that secrecy is a real thing oh yeah and these people all wanted to keep the secrets they all wanted to keep their secrets right right and and I could see a lot of gatekeeping back in that that period where this wasn't I don't want to say as accepted as it is now but for lack of better words yeah yeah and you know of course you know all these groups we were there for like the witch Wares in the 90s we know right everybody had their secrets everybody liked to gatekeep all their so that would not surprise me at all you weren't a witch in the 90s if you weren't gatekeeping something right one of the things that I found as I've been a reader and that really stuck with me so I I'm big on swords or fire wands or air you're GNA pry that out of my cold dead fingers I'm not letting go but the nine of Swords what about it okay I'm gonna pull it up here I was gonna say you're gonna make me pull it up the nine of Swords imagery typically in this Smith weight deck and in in all Smith weight clones basically the nine of Swords is nine swords hanging over a woman who's sitting up in bed holding her head in her hands as if she's sobbing this card to me could sway me into thinking that swords are air because this card to me almost always says anxiety mental anguish internal pain it's the words that you use against yourself that's funny because I I feel like I have a different perspective which is more sword leaning I've always kind of looked at this is the you've reaped what you've sewn oh see okay yeah your actions from those nine swords are why you are sitting in your bed with your face in your hands having a meltdown yes it's guilt I've always kind of lean towards the you've reaped what you swed which is more in line with the whole swords fire thing and you know what I absolutely do have that meaning for it as well what it made me think of is that swords and Wands as two sides of the same coin two sides of the same weapon I could agree with that I think swords externally are that Brash the fighting the anger the strong Warrior the energy to move you forward the wands are the internal but I do think swords internally are air it's the it's the anxiety it's the words you use against yourself it's that mental anguish it can be instability or or bad mental health yeah but that but with the swords being fire it is those things being a part of your reality yeah those external actions can cause that internal strife so I see it as both whereas I see wands is the internal strife and the swords is that playing out in reality but I see wands more as internal education as more um knowledge knowledge seeking uh less mental anxiety so so more the positive side of that then how are you explaining that with the 10 the swords are the negative WS are the swords are that negative selft talk that internal anxiety that you know that that won't shut up when you're trying to go to sleep for real that's the air sword internal I just feel like they're both two sides of the same thing and I think the swords are the negative selft talk and Wands are the positive selft talk swords are the that energy that go- get them that doesn't necessarily have to be negative energy or negative action it's just powerful and strong fiery action whereas wands are more of a calculated uh steady knowledgeable action so you know they both have positive and negative sides but I really do feel like they can be read either way I agree with two sides of the same coin um but I kind of look at it more as the wands are the mental thinking it out thinking it through and the the swords are the these are your decisions in action but the nine of Swords even if that person is in anguish over their actions they're still in mental anguish it's still a card of mental anguish so that's why I feel that that's the the internal air sword causing that mental anguish but that mental anguish was caused by action exactly by that fire the action the external by th those nine swords made you feel that way right your actions you those nine fiery swords that negative fiery action is what gave you that internal guilt totally agree and then the 10 is kind of you know you done  up the T of Swords that's a person laying on the ground with 10 swords in their back and that traditionally is defeat painful endings betrayal and that I can't really ascribe air or fire to that I think I could do either one because if it's fire it hurts you were burned it could have been your actions it could have been your words it could have been anything that caused you to be in that position but you did it it's your fault that you're there although I will say there i' I've done readings for people where that has come up and they are reaping the of someone else's actions but bottom line is actions got you to that have consequences right right and you could read that either as a fire or an air element now why is this important is it important yes and no it depends on how much importance you want to put on it my vote is no it's not important because um my biggest thing with tarot is read all the books you want look at all the YouTube videos whatever but when you look at those cards what is it saying to you and if when when you are using your intuition and and your ability and whatever if you look at that n of swords and it's talking air to you roll with it I'm just telling you it doesn't to me it's talking fire but we all have we all look at things a little differently we all have our own kind of personal interpretation so I don't think either is wrong I just know what I do I a million times agree because there are so many decks out there some of them use elements as the as the suits some switch them up some use all sorts of weird as the suits and it's up to you to find which ones resonate with you I am of a mind with tarot I want you to learn the basics I want you to learn what are the archetypes what's the symbology and even what are the astrological symbolism if that speaks to you because it might not it's not on all decks does the cabala work for you does the elemental associations work for you because when you lay a card down next to another card in a spread they start to work together they start to weave together all of their symbology all their archetypes all their meaning together they tell a story exactly and so the nuances of one will change depending on what it's next to exactly and so sometimes those elements if you've got a reading that's almost entirely air and there's one water card you might want to know why that's there or if there's one Fire card you might want to know why that's there and if it's going to set off a bonfire so that can change how a reading is interpreted but I will tell you that astrology and cabala and even elements are probably like six seventh nothing on my list of where I consider them when I do a reading I guess but as it would relate to magical practice and ritual I think whatever you adopt in your tarot is how you're going to lean and ritual you're not going to have wands be fire in a tarot reading and then turn around and have wands be air in a ritual and I have worked and I know you have too we have both worked with people in the past that cast air or call air with swords and you know have a staff in the South for fire so I've seen it it doesn't resonate but I've seen it I mean that's fine but then if I forget they just can't be mad at me that's right future habit future habit but I I again think that neither way is wrong it's what the reader what their personal interpretation is because you're the one who is who is creating that connection with the cards and and forming that relationship and my relationship with my deck isn't going to be the same as your relationship with your deck and my quote unquote conversations with my readings aren't going to be the same as yours so I don't think either way is wrong but if I'm teaching if I'm teaching you tarot wands are air and and swords are fire yeah bottom line I really loved that earlier we were talking about how you were shocked that the Smith weight deck was actually WS fire swords air and I freaking love that because it's such a good point that it doesn't matter you weren't looking at the book I mean you probably haven't looked at a Smith weight book in a million years so you don't need it so it never would have occurred to you and the symbology on the cards is easy enough to interpret elementally any way you want to absolutely I mean I am still kind of shocked that I I didn't even realize that and it's exactly why I mean I I don't read the pamphlet books I I open up a deck I use it off we go I guess I just assumed and now I'm like looking at this deck and I'm like did I miss something in the message she was trying to put through with her artwork and as I look at these no I stand by my my way I don't think the suits are ever always one thing and especially with the proliferation of so many different types of decks to appeal to different magical brains I think you should just you know look for one that works for you and we tell stories with the cards even though I think that you should memorize the traditional meaning of the deck that you're using and you should look into the symbology you should look into these different pieces because once you know the the numerology you can start to look at why there's too many fours in that reading or what that means when there's a seven next to a nine and it adds a lot of depth but you shouldn't get hung up on it uh you shouldn't get hung up on the shoulds should do this or should do that especially if you're using it for your own personal use now when I when I realized that there was such a conversation happening like I said you know maybe 10 or so years ago I got into uh Rachel Pollock's book fabulous book 78 degrees of wisdom everyone should check it out love that book I was like wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what is she talking about and you know there were some things that I kind of had to flip in my head what she was talking about you know with swords and Wands I kind of had to okay in my mind she really means this about wands and right you have to do a little transposing I did but I also noted you know what is she saying about the four of swords versus the four of Wands and am I really flipping the meanings or the sentiment you know and and sometimes her meaning for the four Swords totally fit with the four of Wands like you know what I mean it's but but you have to Pi pick away in your head stick with it and then if you are reading other people's work information what have you you kind of have to do that flip in your head and I think that's why keeping a Personal Diary of your own meanings like when we talked about charmc casting and we talked about keeping a journal of what each charm means to you and how that changes as you do different throws we recommend that you do regular tarot pulls and you should start to keep a book of what those cards mean to you what different symbolism keeps coming up over and over again and as you study and Learn and Grow you can add to that rather than having to do the math in your head of switching four of Swords to four of Wands you'll have your own journal to go back to you where you can do that well and and I've done that over the last couple decades with a couple of different decks because you know maybe the symbolism I got out of Ellen Canon Reeds witches tarot is different than you know the DAR seed tarot which love love love remember so I've kind of journaled different decks and different cards I hate to say that I journaled and it kills me to admit that I love it but I will always agree when it comes to tarot but I I think the most productive thing you can do for yourself is every day pick a card I mean we're talking 78 cards 78 days you can spare two months of your life for a minute look at that card and write down like you said write down what it means to you create your own meaning book because what this card means to you or me or Rachel Pollock or Lori cabat or whoever you're talking about that's that's our interpretation our intuition our gut feelings my gut feeling and intuition isn't going to be yours or the next person's so you need to spend time with each of these cards and create your own meaning book because that little pamphlet book that comes in the box with it it's not enough I was going to say think of that as more like a guideline yeah place to start but but not a full meaning you need to take the time to find that full meaning now I'm a very visual person everything on the card means something to me the colors the symbols the shapes the composition all of it well they wouldn't have put it on the card if it didn't mean something exactly exactly and honestly I feel like I'm always finding something new when I'm doing my daily puls or tarot meditation and I'm looking at a card or studying a card it's always surprising to me the new thing that jumps out or the the Nuance that I'll notice what you might not have noticed that in the last 10 readings exactly but this reading this particular color is jumping out or the crown on the queen is jumping out at me and that's what I tell my students too is pay attention to those things that jump out because that might mean something more important to you now than it did when you first looked at that card or the or the fifth reading you did with that card now that part of it different and that part of it has meaning so you're always going to be finding new elements new nuances of each card especially as they relate to each other there's an infinite number of combinations and you know that's why even despite having like 200 decks I've kind of stuck with only using a handful over the years because you you create that connection and like who has time to be doing that 200 times exactly it can be nice to use a deck you're not familiar with for a daily pull just to kind of get into it to you know do something different but if you're doing some serious readings for yourself or for someone else pick one and stick with it yeah you need something that you're very very familiar with that the correspondences and everything really speak to you and that you know inside and out I mean gez I used that witches tarot for what 25 years yeah before I so much so that uh you kept the meanings on the rer weight Smith deck for real for real because most of these suits are so well- drawn unless you pick something that has uh very plain pip cards it allows you to just go with what's there just go with how the image speaks to you you know have your knowledge do your studying and then just kind of let it go from there let it tell you a story I I think kind of the the moral of our Point here is you really got to figure out what works for you wands is air and swords is fire is what works works for Lea and I but if it is the ass opposite for you go with it you're not wrong follow your intuition because you are the one reading those cards that is your relationship with that deck and the unique language you have between you and that deck is yours and yours alone exactly the tarot is your key to your subconscious and yours alone and if you're the one doing the reading you control all of that so as much as I say you should learn the traditional meanings you should learn the book meanings once you've studied that then give your own intuition free reign and just let it go you are not wrong if your Elemental correspondences don't match up to what everyone else says it's okay to go your own way but I do think if you really want to immerse yourself in Tarot whether you want to read for yourself frequently read for other people make a business out of it whatever you're really have to take the time and connect with each card individually and create that relationship where you know what that card is telling you despite what the book you know that little booklet says all right so before we let go I'm going to give you one quick story because you made me think of a funny now the deck that I have this is the games tarot I have to look up exactly what it's called it's just a generic writer wait Smith clone it was published in the early ' 70s and it was given to me by my grandmother and I love this deck I actually had to go out and find it again to replace it because my dog chewed up a couple of them but anyway point when I first got these cards I was told that I needed to sleep with them under my pillow so I did the whole deck and then I took them one card at a time and not only would I write it in my journal but I would put it under my pillow that night and when I woke up in the morning I would write down any dreams or any thoughts that I had about that card I flailed too much my sleep I would have ripped the damn thing to shreds without even knowing it thank the gods I did not but no that's what I did I I took my 78 days I think it was more like 378 because I'm am not consistent but I took my time and I journaled each card put it under my pillow and would write a little story about each card just going on the colors and the pictures and what it looked like I would write a little little story I wish I still had that journal I don't know if you remember this but I I very distinctly remember this I was barely if even 20 something and I got that Aquarian deck which in retrospect what the hell hard idea plan to read Lord which I ended up I I lost it and I did replace it because even though I despise that deck it was the one right but I don't know if you remember this but I remember going to you and saying I can't figure it out these things suck whatever and what you made me do something ridiculous it was like you made me have a conversation with each card that sounds like something I would do you were like you know sit quietly meditate and talk to the card and it'll talk back to you that definitely sounds like something I'd say I don't know that was how I started did it work not with that deck it wasn't until shortly after we started doing a lot of magical things in our early 20s that I came across that Ellen Canon Reed and that even to this day I mean I could whip that out and boom boom boom that that deck just spoke to me in a way that I just remember thinking who the hell made that Aquarian deck because that is some crazy non-helpful thing so I think that especially for me just because it's your first deck and the one you buy doesn't make it the one that's going to speak to you you know what I mean yes yes it doesn't mean you have to keep using it you can always change it up I started out with my first deck and used it for years and then have moved on to several different decks the L tarot was the one I remember you love that L tar I did I did I still do it's a great deck didn't it have an extra card it did it had a who are you really card that I loved it had a 79th card loved that but yeah so and then I moved to the witches tarot um now I use all sorts of different decks so do what works you have to use what speaks to you if it doesn't fit right in your brain it's going to be a stumbling block every time you try to read so you really do need to find how it flows naturally for you and I I think one thing I I had done at one point was and I think this is maybe a helpful tip I don't know start with your Aces spend some time with your Aces because your Aces will tell you what what they mean I feel like you know they are kind of that that that kickoff to the suit the start of the suit the seed of that suit those aces are going to tell you what they are and where they fall oh I like that and I think it's good to start there too because the court cards make things so much more confusing because once you get into the court cards then you've got like the kings are typically Earth the Queens are water the knights are fire and the pages are air the queen of cups would be water water the water of Water the water of Water that's right the king of cups would be the Earth of water you know the Knight of Cups would be the fire of water so you know you can get those associations all mixed up in there as well you are adding another crazy layer for these folks I know and we're not even going to get into the major Arcana but you know I also remember a time where I I I did a lot of working you know how some people would do the major only mhm M flip the switch people do a couple readings with the minor only take all 22 Majors out and just do a pip reading oh I love that yeah majors are tough man Majors can be hard to read They're overarching themes they're big events their their life telling me stuff I don't want to hear right when you want to get into the details it's the minor Arcana that's really going to carry the work of the reading and tell you all the little things that you need to know how I got that idea was people used to use cards for divination and when they did that they only had the 52 ultimately pip cards and that's kind of what gave me that hey let's see how this goes and and I agree that kind of gives you a more nitty-gritty I don't need the big stuff right now I need the bits and pieces right right the major Arcana is like talking to your psychiatrist that talks over your head a little bit and the minor Arcana like talking to your bestie you're talking to your crazy aunt who's going to tell you like it is and give you some good advice talking to your grandma major Arcana talking to Leila and shell pip cards I love it yeah well hey I think that's some pretty good information right there if you have any questions about tarot if you have your own
