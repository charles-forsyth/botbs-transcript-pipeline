and I still don't know what I'm gonna say here we're going to bring you stories every week from the east coast and the West Coast the creepiest scariest most mysterious weirdest things that we can find we are going to smoke our faces off and try to creep each other out I'm east coast and I'm West Coast we're also gonna talk about why we're smoking over here oh absolutely and I am definitely enjoying myself right at the moment smoking a little bit of Bruce Banner got me a little forgetful see I've got this Ecto Cooler but I think in the spirit of our show tonight it's going to be called East Coast Ecto I kind of like how we both went with like green superhero type things you've got the Ecto green ghost and I've got Bruce Banner who like like the Incredible Hulk man right absolutely so both of them are like green superhero in their own way I like it so basically a little bit about us is we've we've been friends for ever like 25 years yeah yeah definitely a little more than that and I we have been smoking since the day I met you I know and being spooky and being spooky I think we have told more scary stories at night over a bowl than and gone to more scary places and done scary [ __ ] some of the ghost investigations that we have done do you remember back in the 90s when we were doing speaking engagements on tarot witchcraft paganism as a spiritual practice paranormal that type of thing and we after one of those events I think it was at a college I won't name it but a college in Upstate New York and we met a young woman and she told us how her house was haunted and was like yes you you know who I'm talking about right yes her house was crazy haunted she was having all these problems she wanted to know if we could come and help her out and so we went and we did some exercise the demon right and we did a cleansing and to be honest that one turned out to have like a very actually mild ghost presence and most of it was her like most of it was like her kind of emotional issues and sometimes that's kind of what's behind a lot of this we're not really going to focus on that but we're gonna focus on stories of hauntings try and tell people like what's behind that and tell people I guess the facts that we can find out are there stories who's told told the stories where's the where's the articles on it you know like was there a movie you're doing one that a movie was based on it so we're going to try and focus more on truish Tales of creepy American stories there's a piece to my story where and especially back in the early 1900s they address the fact that a lot of folks that believed in paranormal experiences and things like that and they'd get essentially institutionalized for saying that they had this experience or saw this Apparition or what have you and one of the things I found was that they specifically said is mental health services became more of a thing there actually were less exorcisms in the United States well yeah in some of the stories that you find there's clearly a mental illness component you know there's right and that might be a creepy story that we tell and we like hey this is a super creepy story and it was perpetrated by a super creepy person but there's no paranormal thing here it right just sounds like it but some of these paranormal stories you and I are legit there's no explaining it we're not exactly sure how it happened or why it happened but so many different people from different walks of life have experienced the same thing in the same places and and we want to talk about that we've had weird experiences in weird places right from the house my father's house that has a whole history from multiple families and multiple family members of mine to your personal experiences with a supernal that can't be explained I mean there's a lot out there and it's it's pretty interesting and so yeah some of the stuff that we're going to find is clearly going to be sounds spooky and paranormal and really isn't and some of it's going to be truly unexplained and we don't know what the [ __ ] that is what the [ __ ] pass the bomb exactly and that's when we're going to be like I am not high enough to hear that story because it's creeping me out I'm getting chills and I need to turn on a few more lights some of the things we've seen have been absolutely sometimes I think that if we weren't High we might have been way more scared than we probably were oh oh 100% I would totally have been terrified and you would not have gotten me to go to those places if I had not been that high so I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing but it's definitely helped get us into more interesting escapades and I swear I walk into some situations and I'm like oh my God oh my God and you're like Lea smoke this bowl and [ __ ] woman up you got and if it wasn't okay how bad can it be just take a hit and it'll all be good it'll be fine and then laugh at me when I'm an idiot so we figured we uh would would just kind of share our stories share our high high giggles and and and and talk about the things that make us go oo oh absolutely and now that I'm living west of the Mississippi I'm finding so many scary places so many scary stories out here Things That Go Bump in the night um I didn't think it was going to be as interesting as the East Coast but it certainly is I think there's a lot here there's a lot east of the east of the Mississippi like a lot I'm surprised I was I was blown away when I started looking America is just we're creepy we're just creepy people yeah why we're spooky we have superstitions and weird creatures so so tell me like what are some of the things that uh that you found what are some of the things we can look forward to some of the things I'm going to be talking about you know neither of us are are in the location that we had spent a long long long time being friends at it's true we're both freaking transplants you live in a totally different area and I live in a completely different area than when we a totally different Coast who are you talking that's right completely opposite Coast I really wanted to take it back to the beginning take it back to our rout and I'm starting out with a couple of places in rural Upstate New York so right Forest Park cemetery near Troy New York I've heard of that you have heard of it I don't know if you know much about it but we're gonna we're gonna spend an episode talking about Forest Cemetery Park I need to the only things I've heard about that place are super creepy don't know a lot but just some creepy [ __ ] so that's a oh it's getting better so then we're gonna go to another part of New York State Rolling Hills Asylum I've never heard of that but if it has the word asylum in it I'm already scared you're in you're in I'm so scared I'm ready to hear it I don't I don't I don't care what west of the Mississippi has this is one you can't Trump oh we can absolutely beat you I know we can you keep going we've got the I mean we have Roswell out here come on another New York staple the Amityville Horror house that's a good one oh my goodness we were raised on that it's like Mother's Milk of horror stories oh no no we're going up a notch again really we're we're we're gonna stop in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery Sleepy Hollow no [ __ ] no [ __ ] that's like the OG of scary stories is that like one of the oldest American Horror Stories ever New York yeah yeah yeah you can't really beat New York now we're going to broaden out a little more in in the Northeast and we're gonna talk about the Lizzy bordon house oh my God a yeah yeah did you skip rope to that when you were a kid yeah yeah me I didn't realize story was until I was older and then I'm like oh my God why did adults let me talk about that right what is wrong with children they're so creepy that's a good one trans Aly lunatic asylum in Pennsylvania again I have not heard it but you said that Asylum word I said that Asylum word creepy [ __ ] and then I have to do it it's it's a definite it's a definite Staple in the east coast all right tell me one more we're going to Salem oh yes yes the wi capital of the world and there'll be places we'll talk about in Salem so we're we're definitely gonna do an episode on Salem fantastic East Coast has Gettysburg man do you have all the battle sites those are crazy actually there's some battle sites out here that are super super haunted you got the Alamo oh yeah there's definitely the Alamo that's the first one that comes to everybody's mind Pennsylvania coal mines those places are creepy you ever been to the coal mines don't isn't there something that's still burning out there yeah are probably like full of ghosts like full why would you even go in a coal mine it's scary my father always took us to the coal mines it was such a creepy thing why would he do that that's bad it's a tourist attraction you're kidding me unforunately there's a coal mine that's a tourist attraction like when I was a kid I got a certificate from the place that like I went through the coal mine like it's a tourist such a nerd yours we'll talk about that later but you know we've got some of that out here we even have Shanghai Tunnels up in Oregon yeah it sounds like like exotic right they were used it does it does all sorts of smuggling and piracy and murder and and creepy stuff like that so we definitely we have TR I got a more supernaturally thing um oh what have you got Jersey Devil the Jersey Devil J mentioned that to me and I was super intrigued tell me about the Jersey Devil I can't believe you don't know what the Jersey Devil is I I've never heard of it until you said it the other day think of like New Jersey's version of Bigfoot but like we have like the chupacabra out here kind of like that but this is like apparently confined to New Jersey I gotcha I gotta okay to the point to the point we'll go like weird nerd hockey fan info on you for a second um the New Jersey NHL hockey team is the New Jersey Devils like this whole devil thing is a big thing in New Jersey thing in New Jersey you know it's interesting to me one of the things that I ran into when I was researching topics was how much is you know Americana is woven into these stories like how many of them seem to crop up like my first story that I am absolutely going to make you keep the lights on when you go to bed when I tell you this story in our first episode but you know these ghost stories these these different like the New Jersey Devil you know there's Bigfoot there's the wendigo there's the chupacabra similar types of stories pop up all over the country yeah you know and it's just amazing to me how it gets woven in and the story that I'm going to again absolutely scare you way more than you scare me when I tell you is you'll find similar stories in other places but this one has kind of proof that maybe it started there so but it's interesting I think that the the final thing on my short list to uh start off with you're G to be jealous and I have good reasoning for being able to steal this story as an East coaster okay let's see I am actually going to uh separate from talking about Salem we'll do an episode on Salem okay but then we are going to do a a separate chat about Ouija boards which hey yeah how do you get Ouija boards because they were originated in Salem Massachusetts oh well yeah yeah yeah all right all right you got me there I'll give you that one I'll give you I get aliens though I get aliens get aliens you get aliens I have I have Area 51 so I get aliens then wait can we get David Duvy as like a a guest on here he's still kind of hot we probably could wow I didn't think of that David duy if you're listening you have an open spot on our show anytime anytime anytime all right the truth is out there so what so what are some things that that you think you're you you you you think are going to be Spooktacular and scare me out of my wits from the West Coast you got gosh what you got well besides the ones that I already mentioned we absolutely are going to go to the have you heard of the most haunted ship in the entire us the Queen Mary you were telling me about it oh my gosh but isn't it like a British ship is it a British ship holy [ __ ] hold on I need to know a little more about this before we talk about it what happens when you're high I know it has it's in Long Beach let's see the RMS Queen Mary served as a luxury ocean liner from 1936 to 1967 and during that time it was a site of at least one murder right it's people have been crushed to death children have drowned there it was a convalescent ship at one point so many people have died there it was turned into a hotel and it now sits docked in Long Beach so that is actually some place that I can go to maybe we can go to and visit but there's so many hauntings there my God I would love to do that right they have a ghost tour so we're definitely going to do that but there are so many sightings and stories there's also the Winchester Mystery House I've heard of that yes you actually told me about that a million years ago it was some place that you said you'd always wanted to go so when I knew I lived kind of close stairways to Nowhere stairways to Nowhere doors that open out into the open air from like the fifth floor someone who had to keep building or she was going to die I mean what how cool is that yeah we've definitely got some interesting places out here when you talk about that can you tell us who owns that house now sure yeah I know that um I actually looked into going there over Halloween because they have a whole thing on Halloween and they have different tours yeah they have tours all the time but on Halloween it gets extra spooky all right where else we going all right so Colorado in early mining town this gentleman Jay Dawson hedgepath he was an Amorous dude and he fell off a cliff so sad but he loved women's so much he still is a hopeless romantic even after death and he haunts women at a hotel o yeah so different heed no I would not say so okay then that's kind of creepy yeah so you've got Gettysburg and we out here have Sand Creek what's that Creek Massacre so many people were killed and mutilated there that the place is just absolutely covered in ghosts and creepy things continue to happen to this day oo let's see I should have been more prepared to give you this list so we have haunted mines and haunted hotels there's a lot of stuff from the wild west out here you have asylums and we have the Traverse City Hospital o it was a former Asylum that's full of ghosts we have the manger Hotel pic Mansion see so many of yours are like welln you hear about these East Coast places you don't necessarily hear about the wayy house in San Diego that's full of ghosts you know the point sir Lighthouse or the Moaning Caverns in valico so there's a lot of interesting stuff here so that might be new to you so I'm kind of excited to introduce you to ghost stories and spooky stories that maybe you're not as familiar with as the stuff kind GRE up on from East Coast so we'll get you some really interesting things going I'm definitely intrigued definitely intrigued so are you gonna tell us what you're doing for your first episode are you gonna make us waight I'm starting OG here so I figured I'd start with what actually p pulled me in and started this all um you know when we're kids you know you may see things hear things you don't know if it's real uhuh there was a movie when I was a child that I watched and even though I was scared I was scared because I knew that this was real so but it wasn't even so much that it was I knew it was real but I knew that those things could happen in real life and it wasn't just fake movie we're going back to the 1973 ninth most grossing horror movie of all time oh wow what do we got the Exorcist oh man oh man it's so creepy oh my God because you know little known fact not everybody knows this actually two true stories combined what is what made that W I've never heard what what do you mean two stories obviously the was a kid and we'll talk about the kid um and we'll talk about the true story of of the kid but interestingly enough other portions of it were melded together with a true story in Lowden France um from 1634 yeah the movie or for like the The Legend like the real no for the movie okay okay so for the movie they took the true story of this kid merged it they merged it with this incident 1634 in France with a bunch of nuns and Priests put those two stories together and you have the 1973 classic The Exorcist The Exorcist holy [ __ ] so we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna talk about the real true documented events that led to one of the scariest movies of our lifetime wow wow I I'm intensely curious I've seen the movie it scares the crap out of me and yeah it was one of the first movies I had such a hard time with as a kid I mean it was so creepy so to know that like like this stuff happened yeah like that was based on actual events oh my God and I've never heard the France connection like yeah and you know this is this is you're gonna be surprised about something I'm ready to be surprised I'm ready to get high and get creeped out absolutely all right so so where what are you gonna do what what what do you think is a good what's your first what do you think is gonna scare me all right I got you I'm gonna start with a ghost story and I guess I'm going a little OG too because honestly when I first heard this story it sounded so familiar I know I've heard this before so the Trope itself again tell me if you've heard this driving along late at night and you see a hitchhiker almost always a young woman almost always either scantily clad or wearing some sort of sheer white dress been there done that right thousand times thousand rounds like every state every state in America has that story yes yes so yeah the regular Trope that like there you go that's the whole story then but I found the original and I found there's actually newspaper articles and really old story from a book that was written in 1943 it's one of the first retellings of this story although they say that kids in school were talking about it from the 1930s and even Neiman Marcus gets involved and I'll tell you how that gets involved but yeah I tell you a fun fact here that I've noticed what's that so you you said your story is like originated in the 1940s right my story originates in the 1940s whoa coincidence so we both went OG straight to the 1940s I guess the 1940s were like Spooktacular [Laughter] maybe or maybe our Stone brains went 420 for 1942 I don't know that entirely could have happened but yeah so 1940s it's great ghost story certainly has its roots in again that whole Americana thing where it's like found all over the place but there's some specific facts here in Dallas Texas particularly the lady of the Leake Legend o right I love how can you not be intrigued by that name I didn't even know there was a Lady of the Lake Legend in America Lady of the well not that Lady of the Lake this unfortunately is a dead Lady of the Lake but and even better this lake is like a hot bed of deaths like way do you hear some of the stories it's insane and very creepy yeah yeah you're gonna be so creeped out I'm totally gonna win this I've never heard of any of these places right how fun I love the fact that we're getting some of the the OG stuff that you and I are at least even maybe have heard of or like kind of familiar with some stuff that I'm not exactly as familiar with out here so this will be fun I think so too so yeah get some more information tune in to our first episode we'll do an episode weekly of creepy scary paranormal stories see if we can creep each other out one other thing this is so dumb I know this is going to be an absolute Stone thought so please feel free to laugh at me if you need to so I wrote this and I'm like hey thanks for listening if you thought our stories were spooky okay thanks for listening if you thought our stories were spooky enough for a late night bull fright send us a message and tell us what you liked what you thought was creepy or interesting and which story East Coast or West Coast you thought was scariest say late night bull fright it looks better on paper late night bull fright the [ __ ] is that what's a bull right I don't know hi I don't know I was like writing really fast and I was really
