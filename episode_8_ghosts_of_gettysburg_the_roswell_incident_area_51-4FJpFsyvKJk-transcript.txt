of the US and today I'll be talking about Area 51 and the Roswell incident and I'm shell and I'm going to be representing the east coast today and I'm going to be talking about Gettysburg although I am just dying to hear about the aliens oh everybody is aliens are so fun as soon as I started researching this the mountains and mountains and and I'm not talking like mashed potato mountains I'm just talking about mountains and mountains of evidence coming in is insane I love hearing all the firsthand accounts and everything I had to focus otherwise I was getting overwhelmed with the stories and I love them so I can't wait to dig into those in another episode it'll be great and and I can't wait to uh talk about Gettysburg again overload of information overload of ghosts and paranormal activity today is like a chalk full of Paranormal Activity show grab your pipe grab your bong and let's get spooky yeah let's get spooky this is a place I've been this is a place I've had personal experiences at it has been a whirl wind of a week as I'm sure you can imagine but I'm getting by with a smile good it's almost 60 degrees here today holy cow and you're in Massachusetts it's never that warm there this time of year do you want to know what the temperature was here in gorgeous Southern California today yeah I'm probably [ __ ] 85 oh no go higher higher higher it's gonna be 91 today it's February 91 degrees Fahrenheit that's 33 degrees Celsius for our listeners outside the USA really should not be anywhere close to this we've been in the high 80s all week and today it's going to break 90 remember like that February maybe eight years ago where it never got above -10 for the whole month it was so cold they were closing schools because of how cold it was and now it's like 60 degrees on random February it is just absolutely ridiculous I that is a whole another podcast I don't want to get into you know climate change capitalism corporations waste yeah let's not go there right we're going to stay away from the downfall of civilization and go with fun things like murder and ghosts and creepy stuff paranormal happenings yeah really pick me up make you happy things like this marijuana which makes me very very happy as it should as it should so what are you smoking Today Show this stuff you know I I like to try try new things and sometimes I'm a name chaser I'm not going to lie if the name is catchy and the name sounds good it draws me in I know it's dumb no I'm with you it's like the it's like the the book jacket you know when you see a really great title and a great cover art you're into it same thing with P yeah and this this is now tell me this doesn't sound delightful straw Nana that sounds like a summer salad it smells like a summer salad really you know I I really get that strawberry banana hint out of it and I I was kind of surprised I thought well you know they name this stuff and it never matches the name in the end that is one of your pet peeves that's true but this does very good very delightful I love that for you you know I know you're always searching for something that kind of tastes as good as it sounds but that smoke is is it tastes delicious like Fruity weed I do like a good tasting weed I really do I'm smoking Skywalker I went with like a themed kind of weed since I'm talking about aliens so I went with Skywalker which is one of my favorite favorite smokes I do love the taste you know I love a good Citrus like a nice Citrus taste and this has got like that peppery spice you know kind of along a little citrusy peppery I love it it's good stuff also love the fact that it's kind of an indicia as someone who struggles with bouncing from thing to thing when you know ADHD kind of rules my world uh this is kind of a nice indicia to keep me a little focused a little more you know kind of on one track so I can get things done rather than making me sleepy it makes me a lot more focused so I do like it for that too the straw Nana is an indicia as well but this cute cute little tin I like how it has like the banana peel being peeled open with a strawberry coming out of the banana peel the power advertising I I I just wish I could like convey the smell to you like it's so good I love that all right so let me get this stupid Box open I spilled my pot the other day I was so sad oh Lord what what what happened it was awful I remember I told you about that ke box I have my lovely little ke box well it's held the top is held on by magnets that already sounds like a disaster we've had this for years and never had this problem this is the first time so we've basically just been kind of like breaking up buds in here and just anything you know everything that kind of becomes shake or crumble we've just been leaving it and as that pile of kind of crumbly shake at the bottom has been growing I've been getting all excited I'm like I'm going to roll so many fat [ __ ] joints that's going to be so good and yeah so I've been carefully cultivating this pile of multiple different types of weed that's going to just be amazing anyway so I pick up the box and I go to move it and I misjudged the height of the desk next to me and I guess I was just holding the top so when I hit the box it separated the magnets separated oh and Shake on a carpet there's nothing to do but vacuum that up so yeah my heart breaks for you thank you thank you like it actually breaks for you like that's like you can't clean that up no no there's nothing to be done can we have like a moment of silence okay thank you I appreciate it was very sad very sad moment so one of my local retail establishments had a promotion going uh recently that I took advantage of because you know me I'm curious love to try stuff love promotions love promotions you show me something that is eye pleasing and I'm GNA try to see if it is smoke pleasing imagine this this is a pre-roll okay okay so basically like a one gram joint and it is wrapped in rose petal paper oh my goodness I've heard of those really and the gram of weed is doused in butter the cannabis butter really can of butter like not like not like pressed hash oil or something but like actual like edible butter I guess that's what it said it said that it had butter on it I don't know was it butter with D's or te's I smoked it before I read it okay never mind so can of butter all right wow is all I got to say about that it was a it was a one of those Valentine's oh let's all be in love and smoke rose petal joints I love rose petal joints so I go in the guy's telling me about it and I'm like you know so how is it and he's like this is definitely probably not a good Valentine's Day appropriate thing smoke why and I said why and he goes because when you start smoking this he's like you will not be able to do anything and you're like that's exactly the joint for me give me five I'm like so this is like a melt into the couch he's he and he goes this is like a make no plans nice so of course I'm like well could I have two please I love that but you know aside from the ground flow being all wrapped up in The Buttery goodness like the rose petal paper was delightful because you know you're getting that that good weedy taste but then every so often you're getting that little flit of like rose taste you know what I mean it was very it was very wonderful I liked it and I actually almost wish that they would sell them on the regular oh I'm going to have to see if I can find any of those out here because that sounds really really nice there was a company that sold Vape cartridges and I'm going to look it up and insert it later here because they were a great company but they had a limited edition rose water flavor and this I knew definitely they were you know obviously adding tpin for flavor but it was such a delicate Rose taste I loved smoking that pen I loved it so much the high was fabulous the you know the the pot oils were fantastic but just the rose smell and taste that went along with it beautiful Notch beautiful yes it's it's one of those things I guess it was like that um Ratatouille it was like that Ratatouille movie moment where you know the two things blend magically together and there's like a symphony roses and pot just go together fabulously it worked it worked so well and and it was definitely that was and guy was right definitely a make no plans kind of pre-roll good stuff oh I like that granted that that butter really kind took it up a notch delightful either way good stuff it was delightful who was it the first came up with that Rose joint we should like boy that's like a history thing I don't know so it was one of your local dispensaries that you got it at yes yes very nice all right so anything else any other fun interesting things going on before we get into our stories this week I don't think so other than the fact that it's so warm I can't even believe it I know I know I don't love it I I love my februaries out here the temperatures are usually way cooler you know it's a little hot right now so well it's hot where you are you're true you're the land of hotness you're the land of hotness yeah hot people hot places my goodness who do we have let's see who's out here that's hot right now I don't know there's a whole bunch of stars that are having babies and [ __ ] everybody seems to have them in La yeah uh a lot of there are a lot of babies happening in Hollywood I'm just happy about Rihanna congratulations Rihanna and ASAP Rocky I'm very very happy by way Rihanna looks so beautiful pregnant just saying stunning [ __ ] stunning now there's only one person who looks more beautiful pregnant than Rihanna and that is my daughter congratulations I'm so happy my daughter she is the most beautiful pregnant person but a close second now does she have a nickname for the you know people say like baby Bean or they say like ours was the little alien I mean like people it literally was oh my God and I'm talking about aliens today but no we literally would joke that she was like the Creature from the movie Alien well we um we as a mother and daughter are taking advantage of technology and are using apps there was no baby pregnancy tracking apps when I had kids no there was the book what to expect when you are expecting and that was about it no I was on a lot of boards I I was pregnant later than you so I was on a lot of like uh message boards and stuff but she has apps so what kind of apps we utilize these apps the main one is Baby Central I don't know if I'm allowed to say that but baby Central good app and every week they equate the size your baby has grown to a fruit or vegetable well that's fun makes it easy to kind of visualize we kind of each week the nickname changes to coincide with whatever fruit or vegetable we're at that's adorable this week it's little baby mango mangoes hi baby mango so we got ourselves a little one pound mango this week and because we are hitting uh the weekend and the change of the week just so you know we are moving into an ear of corn next week so next week we will have a little baby boy year of corn oh little baby boy corn little tassel a little sweet corn we kind of we kind of keep the nickname changes based on the fruit or vegetable of the week so it's the little baby veggie it's a little veggie baby he'll be a mango until tomorrow and then tomorrow he will transform like a butterfly from a mango to an ear of sweet corn now his his due date is that stayed the same I know that was changing for a little while it has um we're looking at the first week of June excited no 15th June 15th she goes natural June 15th okay psychic Lea doctor the doctor says June 7th but wrong you'll be right my daughter will be mad because I think she's expecting to not go after she said that miday would work for her yeah again whole other podcast whole other podcast all i'mna say is douas are the most fabulous thing in the entire world and every single pregnant person should have one anytime you give birth there should be a doula there there should be a postpartum doula everyone should have a doula douas are like the God's gift to humanity and they should be everywhere rant over I I went the Midwife route well adulla is like in addition to your Midwife or in addition to your doctor they're just like a a coach for the pregnant person so you're giving birth and you have your Midwife you have your doctor Midwife and then you got your Doula who's like a badass kickass I'm here for you that's it and I love them everyone needs one because you know men are not good at that part they think they're gonna be they want to be but all you want to do is murder them in that moment because they're the ones who are causing you all this right and they should be there to be able to focus on I love you I'm sorry I'll never do this to you again everything's wonderful I'm buying you a Tesla everything's great you know that's all that they should have to do and meanwhile the Doula is there to advocate for you to make sure you're comfortable to make sure that you know the Midwife knows what's going on you know everyone needs a doula to give the baby daddy a kidney shot in the back so that you feel like at least they're in pain too now yes exactly exactly that's what a doula is for and I honestly again whole other podcast but yeah wow we're doing whole other podcast talks today it's the aliens it's because they don't want us to talk about the aliens it's the government conspiracy it is it really is but speaking of midwives I'm gonna try to rope us back in here okay okay couple hundred years ago over a hundred years I shouldn't say a couple hundred years ago Jesus I don't what am I talking about how old are we now sh I know right after this week I feel a couple hundred years old what are we talking here like 1863 so I don't know I'm bad at math when I'm high so I don't know 130 years ago Gettysburg Pennsylvania oh yes yes I imagine that their birthing practices weren't top-notch then either you know and they were not imagine giving birth to a child in the middle of a Civil War I thought my birthing experiences were painful and stressful and difficult imagine living in gettysb or that greater area in 1863 and going into labor with war all around you and death all around you I cannot even imagine that's got to be crazy particularly knowing that you know you might have family on both sides right or what was even more common is you may be on one side pregnant by someone from the other side so you are giving birth to a a child that could be mothered by a northerner and and fathered by a southerner crazy times so I I couldn't even imagine giving birth in that setting no I can't holy Lord considering I literally would have died there would have been no saving either of us with my first child so I mean a lot of these women were giving birth in tents out on basically the grassy fields of Pennsylvania some harsh stuff and I can imagine a lot of mothers died I would imagine there was a lot of babies and young children that died and that's just kind of the tip of the iceberg I can't even it would take a 10-hour podcast just to cover a fraction of the hauntings and the Paranormal Activity that place is jam-packed everyone it's yeah I can't wait to hear what you've dug up that place is just like thick with Paranormal Activity have you been to Gettysburg no you have not been to Gettysburg I haven't I haven't I haven't I want to but I haven't yet you know what the the scenery is like at Arlington National Cemetery you know the little white I've been there fields and Fields of those little white matching Stones they have a similar type Cemetery in one location in Gettysburg actually if you're not paying attention you almost feel like at Arlington I spent a weekend there and I went to this cemetery and again the little white uh tombstones very Arlington esque and I had happened to be there early in the morning because I was trying to jam-pack as much ghosty paranormal sightseing in that weekend that I could I mean why not because the place is huge I mean we're talking huge you it's not something you can't even walk it you do sometimes have to drive location to location so it is massive monuments everywhere um things of that nature but I'm at this Cemetery at probably like 8 or 9ine in the morning and kind of a picture fanatic I love taking pictures um not so much of people but more of places yeah you take great pictures too I always love your pictures you get such a nice perspective but different podcast anyway keep going I'm sitting they they actually still have a lot of like the Cannons basically right where they were left you'll just be driving down the road and there's a there'll be a cannon on that's kind of gross actually big murder machines just sitting there truly I mean cool history but also kind of gross from a history perspective super cool though yeah I'm sitting and I'm trying to take pictures in this Cemetery of this Canon and all of the sudden like it was morning and it was It was kind of the time of year where you have those cool nights but kind of hotter days and there was a little bit of a morning fog I'm taking pictures of these tombstones and this fog is kind of rolling in all of the sudden like my eyes were itchy and I have allergies sometimes so itchy eyes on occasion outside is not out of the norm so I start rubbing my eyes because of course you're not supposed to rub your eyes when they itch so what's the first thing I do rub my eyes when they itch and I was rubbing my eyes and stopped rubbing my eyes and like have you ever seen someone walk through like smoke or clouds the the clouds kind of like trail behind them as they're walking through it yeah like on a on a misty morning when you walk kind of through that mist and it kind of swirls behind you right right after I was rubbing my eyes I went I looked back at this portion of the cemetery that I was trying to Capt pictures of and it was just like that rolling Mist behind people like a line of people just walking through but there was nobody there but nobody there oh wow almost in a line that would suggest that it was like a line of soldiers reporting for duty military straight wow yeah one of the nights I was there one night I stayed in a hotel and one night I came okay sorry I had a minor lighter emergency go ahead there is nothing worse than being a weed smoker with a dead lighter by the way KN on W yeah right anyway so the one night I camped they have lots of camping grounds throughout Gettysburg by the way I highly recommend it it's like sleeping with the ghosts in my opinion oh that sounds like a that sounds like an adventure sleeping with the ghosts with shell right that could be a podcast wouldn't it oh my gosh we're gonna that's the when we goep summer yeah later the summer sleeping with the ghost with shell and Lea at the witching hour um i' had been out all day I'd been sightseeing all day I'd been looking at things all day and I was pretty tired I go back you know maybe 11 12 o'clock I'm ready for for bed I'm ready to be done it's a lot of walking it is a lot of walking because it it's it's miles and miles but like I said you know you you you're in these vast Fields it's not a big city there's not a lot of technological noise um not a lot of road traffic you know you're not getting Factory noise or Highway noise very quiet at night I fall asleep and it was almost like as soon as I was in a dead sleep it's almost like you can hear the goddamn War happening still what all of a sudden you'll hear cannons you'll hear screaming you'll hear gunfire what no it is the craziest thing Lea it is the craziest thing it is like the war is happening were you dreaming or or was this no you could hear it physically were you I guess what I'm asking is were you awake it woke me up oh wow it woke me up wow it woke me up out of sleep creepy you you very much get a sense that you are never alone in Gettysburg day or night you're never alone not that you're being like I almost want to say you know that you know you're being watched but it's not like that oo I'm being watched right in Gettysburg it's more like remember in the day going to Raves yes oh yeah and there was just like a couple hundred people there like you just because there was so many people and Gettysburg is like that it's like there's so many Souls that never left that you can't get away from it so they're like packed in shoulder toosh shoulder kind of yeah wow that's sad what a what a place just like steeped in sadness you don't necessarily you know need to go into the history of Gettysburg you know we've all heard that in in in high school and Elementary and Middle School history lessons but I mean 50,000 people died in that area that's a lot that is a lot of people over a short span of time very yes and and for all all of you animal lovers and and folks that that agree that animals have souls like humans 5,000 horses died at Gettysburg oh that is sad so you got 5,000 horses and circling back to how we started this conversation I don't know if that includes women children you know like those unfortunate uh you know the women who who had to give birth on those battlefields and may or may not have made it I don't know if those numbers include them right that I'm not sure if that's just soldiers I guess is what I'm right right you know what's the civilian cost here as well right right that 50,000 could just be soldiers I'm not sure um but the point is a lot of death and none of these people I feel left and and if you were to go to Gettysburg you'd get that same feeling all 50,000 are still there not one of them is left traumatic events that not knowing you're dead dying suddenly and in such a traumatic em you know such a traumatic damaging way I guess all deaths are damaging but such a traumatic horrible way I mean there is a place called the D Daniel lady Farm the Daniel lady Farm was used uh for the by the Confederates as a field hospital because you know they in that atmosphere they're using people's houses as hospitals they're using tents as hospitals so this Daniel lady Farm they dealt with a lot of chest wounds and lost limbs they would try to think of it as like they try to deal with the like almost like hospice the Daniel lady Farm was sometimes where people would go to either recover or suffer through their final moments of yeah there were 10,000 people that actually are reported to haunt that specific Farm wow like 10,000 that's a big number like I can't even go into individual stories there's that many you know there's there's the cash town in actually that is supposedly the site uh where the first Ser the first Soldier was killed during the Gettysburg campaign and this cash Town Inn is actually like 8 miles away from like the main Battlefield and the people who currently own it because it's still there is it still an inn can you still rent rooms there you can't rent rooms but you can go through it oh okay more like a museum kind of thing a historical yeah yeah yeah because a lot of the buildings that are still standing are actually museums there but there they get a lot of they feel that that Soldier uh which they they believe is the first Soldier killed during the campaign at Gettysburg um they feel he's still there a lot of lights turning on and off doors locking and unlocking themselves but one thing that a lot of visitors throughout the years have noticed is folks will see an apparition of a half blown apart Soldier oh wow and then they claim oh no no no no ghost is bad enough but a half a ghost ew blown apart ghost no I'm sorry let's not do like mangled ghost that's no they claim on occasion that there's also visible signs of drips of blood where the apparitions had been seen ew ew ew ew ew ew no no that's gross nope nope nope I'm sorry drips of blood how do you no no the guy never left guy never left what do you know what happened to him like was he blown up in the building or something what happened um it just all I could find is that the cashtown Inn was the site of where the first Soldier was killed it doesn't say like where at the Inn if it was outside in the yard or in a room or if it was by a cannonball or a gun it just says that that's just the site of where the first Soldier was killed wow obviously very violent yeah I wasn't able to find like the exact details of his death you know and then there's the Gettysburg Hotel at the Gettysburg Hotel they got again hundreds hundreds of tales of hauntings one of a ghost of a woman seen dancing in the ballroom paranormal investigators that have been there believe they they have found the spirit of a Union soldier named James curst of company K from the Pennsylvania reserves and that he's still roaming the halls of the Gettysburg Hotel you know interestingly with the names and stuff of these ghosts this we should should still be searchable records of people so they should be able to find if those names are actual people that had served you would think I believe they are oh that's amazing oh wow the the locations in Gettysburg never end the balader in that was also a uh used as a a temporary Hospital the ghost train how fun would this be you can actually a ghost train a ghost train you can actually take a 90minut ride on a ghost train train apparently it's like the only ghost tour in Gettysburg that takes you across the actual battlefield but people have ridden the ghost train claim that they have been able to smell cigar smoke and seen soldiers roaming on the train um with cigars roaming near the railroad tracks and traveling across the battlefield wow wow I want to go on a ghost train a train ride across the battlefield that has ghosts on the train itself dang and apparently given the right conditions you can they they claim they have people who have been on the train have seen ghosts on the battlefield as they were passing the battlefield on the train wow wow I know the battlefield is a site of a lot of one of my favorite things shell I absolutely love the orb photos and I know that a lot of the battlefield oh they're everywhere there yeah everywhere Gettysburg that's just a great historical place to go if nothing else even if you're not into the the ghosty paranormally thing great historical site it really is there is actually a monument for every state and on that Monument has a list of names of every soldier that participated in the war and so like if you were from say Massachusetts and you were a part of that war your name would be on the Massachusetts Monument they literally have almost every solders name monumented there there's got be 75 to 100 different type monuments the battlefields are huge it it it's just it's sad the only way I can describe it is is when you're you're standing on a battlefield and you're just looking across that grass it's a peaceful sadness only way I can describe it a peaceful sadness now are there a lot of reenactments that go on too oh absolutely I think that they do it every summer they're public ones private ones there are groups that do it tourists do it that's a thing that's a thing it probably always will be a thing Gettysburg is I would consider one of the most haunted places on the East Coast personal opinion like don't be blowing up our Instagram or our email giving me statistics how wrong I am but my personal or do right I I I my personal opinion is is that the Getty ber um Battlefield in the Gettysburg area is one of the most haunted places on the East Coast just for the soulle fact of sheer numbers did you see any ghosts while you were there multiple like I had said in in this Cemetery seeing those those Misty body movements through the field I hear things I heard cannons you know I heard gunfire I heard shouting I heard screaming but probably my my only actual visual is ation experiences were in the actual Cemetery I heard stuff on the Battleground but I didn't see stuff on the Battleground but you know everybody everybody kind of Senses things sometimes differently audio visual you know but as far as visually it it was it was that Cemetery for sure audibly everywhere everywhere you just hear fate horror it's horrible o it does sound awful just to hear that type of suffering I you know obviously born in the decade I was born in I haven't heard a live Cannon shop Christ sakes but I was hearing that clear as day clear as day just sad there's just so much sadness you feel there just kind of permeates everything it does it's hard to be like joyous and happy on a trip to Gettysburg like just the whole vibe is oppressive and kind of the vibe is sad and oppressive yeah no I'm not down in Gettysburg I I love Gettysburg great place but it is not a joyous Place yeah yeah I don't think the sight of that much death ever really could be it's just overwhelming peaceful sadness yeah that's a good way to describe it so everybody go to Gettysburg hop on a train hop on a plane get in your car go see the ghost because there is like 50,000 plus there you're not going to miss out you know it it was hard and I I do want to point this out it was kind of hard to pinpoint specific stories um and specific incidences just out a Sher volume you could talk to a hundred people and get a hundred different stories that's why you know I wanted to mention some of the things I saw and heard especially in the cemetery because it's hard to give a detailed Narrative of experiences at Gettysburg because there's just everywhere you turn you know I I kind of didn't feel alone when I was using a port a potty on a battlefield there one day well that's not cool you don't want to have to share a bathroom with a ghost you know there should be some places that are like sacran and I think bathro should just stay out of bathrooms but the point is like you can't escape it there it's everywhere every building has a story every road has a story every field has a story it's all encompassing it's just it's it's it's a lot I mean we could do six full one hour episodes just on specific stories of Gettysburg it it's that much WoW but the feeling you get looking at these cannons out into these fields you know you look at this cannon knowing that five minutes ago you faintly heard it in the corner of your ear right also KN also knowing it hasn't been fired in 130 years wow the feeling you get is just one of being transported back into time you know when you when you hear those screams when you're standing next to that Cannon you are standing next to that cannon that you know damn well caused those screams that you're faintly hearing that are 130 years old that's an eerie feeling that's got to be like really creepy it's an unsettling Vibe it's an unsettling Vibe it definitely sounds like it I mean it's not scared like it's not like you're G to go to an asylum get freaked out or well you said like it's peaceful it is very peaceful but especially if you're an empathetic person it's it's almost kind of heartbreaking to be there because of the overwhelming sadness and and confusion because honest God you know like that soldier that I was saying that was the first one killed I don't think he knows he's dead and that's sad even though he's the one that's like in pieces and his blood is on the walls he hasn't figured it out yet they were young you know those shoulders were very young we'll give them that well also remember you know some of these some of these folks um went into this war at 1516 yeah some it's not like modern day yeah it's not like modern day where there's a you know a legal age limit you know if you could hold and point a gun off you go they were pretty much recruiting everybody yeah sad stories shell super sad geez I think we need to smoke after that was a that was like a a you know and the thing is it just made me sad talking about it but I guess like you know but but Gettysburg is definitely one of those places that I think people should try to try to get at at some point because it is rich in history and Paranormal Activity all right cool story sad story sh yeah you know I guess maybe maybe people don't realize how sad Gettysburg actually is yeah yeah pretty sad go there be sad take or or photos and send them to me orb photos make me happy maybe that would counteract the sad yeah right I have to go look up some orb photos after this just to get happy again or snack on some chocolate what do you snacking on today sh you know actually I have veered away I've veered away for my usual snack and I am actually eating a buffalo chicken kelone oh wow I want a buffalo chicken calzone oh I'm eating cereal straight out of a box that's not cool wow that takes me back a little bit cereal out the box it's like the stoner snack of choice right super easy well in my defense on Stoner food um the I actually had had this for dinner last night so it is think of it as is leftover cold pizza m even better right oh yeah all right well on that note since I don't have any cowone all I have is stupid Dry Cereal I'm gonna smoke a little more pot and then I'll tell my story well maybe if you're lucky the aliens will bring you some snacks I've never heard any I saw so many stories shell but there none about aliens bringing anyone snacks bastards right they should though but they should I don't know if there's like a request box or something dear aliens please bring snacks before you anal probe me before you dive into your story I do want to point out I knew you were doing this this week and I was getting super excited the last few days thinking about oh we're gonna talk about alien I love aliens so jealous you get to do aliens by the way and so I read the news generally every day more online not a paper type person there's been a lot of alien reportings this week this particular week there has been there was a a bunch of what were they calling them Tic Tac shape UFOs chasing Navy ships this week they knew I was going to talk about them so they've been coming out in droves I don't know if it was thinking about what you were going to talk about combined with these news stories this week but like bring it on because I want to get invaded man we're actually gonna kind of break this up into two segments because when you start talking about aliens there is so much stuff so much oh my gosh it's crazy just the sheer again like you were saying with Gettysburg just the sheer volume of stories that people have abduction stories sightings and even the US government has just recently what was it in 2020 that they were like oh yeah by the way here's all these videos of things that we can't explain this particular podcast cast we're going to focus on mostly on Area 51 and the Ros incident we're going to kind of stick to that and then we'll do a separate podcast on like aliens and sightings and abductions and things because again the sheer volume is so much but that secrecy and that lying is what caused a lot of the problems here and what continues to cause controversy even though they've supposedly fessed up and kind of brought all this information forward now people still don't believe them because they keep doing well here's the real truth oh no wait that wasn't the truth that was a lie to cover up this real truth and then they keep doing that and going back and forth all that does is Garner more interest if they would just F if they would have Fest up 50 years ago and said yeah there's aliens here whatever no one would be breaking in to Area 51 currently they'd be like yeah there's aliens there what we knew that exactly exactly and I've heard it referred to as hysteria 51 and I think there's even like a a few videos or something called that and I love that phrase because it suits it perfectly again everything's full of holes recanted stories are changed and this is just government officials I'm not talking about like civilian Witnesses this is just like government people constantly changing their stories so it it's enough to make anybody hysterical because of just everything that's crazy do you remember the um in 2019 when it went viral Area 51 went viral again because of what was it they can't stop all of us show me them aliens yes yes which again if they would just fess up to it and tell the truth stuff like that wouldn't happen because you'd have not there would be no people asking you to fuss up because we would know exactly but like millions of people responded to that although they they didn't end up going but that just shows that the interest and the idea that there's still a conspiracy is still there even though they have now confessed to what was actually going on there which was they that's New Mexico correct the US Air for it's Area 51 is a US Air Force military base it's located in Groom Lake in southern Nevada so it's about 70 or so miles from Las Vegas it's ially classified as homy air homy airport and it's property of the US Air Force and it's it's some it's surrounded by mountains in the middle of the Nevada desert I didn't realize it was that close to Vegas yeah like 70 80 miles roughly so people are forbidden to walk anywhere near it they have TR no trespassing signs and the signs say that you will be shot on site deadly force is authorized if you go there has anybody been shot on site you know what I did not look into that but probably you know I haven't looked into that there was just so much alien stuff I didn't go there you know knowing that it was there is part of what fueled a lot of these conspiracy theories because people knew that stuff was going on there that secret tests of some sort were happening there but the government kept saying nope nothing to see here you know do not look at the man behind the curtain so just makes us want to look even more exactly it makes people highly suspicious so uh Annie Jacobson wrote a book called Area 51 an uncensored history of America's top secret military base and she basically says that area 51 was the birthplace of a lot of spy planes you know the CIA did a lot of work there they um it's where the U2 spy plane was first built back in the 50s yeah and the intelligence Community has a lot of things going on there so there was a lot of reason to keep it secret they were testing these weather balloons uh that weren't really weather balloons they were to detect radiation you know this was back when the Cold War was happening and and nuclear weapons were starting to proliferate all over so they had developed these balloons that could go really high and detect when um nuclear weapons had been set off but they didn't want to tell anyone about it and these so the the airplanes the U2 airplane was developed and of course we had to keep this secret and this plane could fly way higher 40,000 feet higher than any known plane at the time and they could fly extremely fast and so in 5 1955 when airplanes were not thought to go even remotely that high or that fast sometimes Pilots would catch sight of this big round fuel these you two planes had like a a fuel tank that was really big and round that hung underneath the plane so it's flying 40,000 ft higher than any known plane at the time and no one's talking about these things going super fast a pilot or someone on the ground sees light shining off this big round shiny thing in the sky what are they going to think so that explained a lot of it and the other plane that they tested there was this is fun it was called the a12 reconnaissance plane and interestingly that plane has been recently in the news because of Elon Musk what yeah Elon Musk and Grimes the singer the artist Grimes they had a baby right you've heard this right do you remember baby with the name I don't know what the name is letters and weird stuff yes exactly the name is X Ash Archangel 12 which it looks like an the letter X and then the letters A and E stuck together and then the letter a and then x i i for 12 because they couldn't use numbers but they said the letter X they said stands for the unknown variable AE she says Grim says it's the Elven spelling of AI which is like intelligence or Ai and it's pronounced Ash and then Archangel 12 the a12 was Elon musk's contribution and he said that it was because it was his and Grim's favorite aircraft it had no weapons no defenses just speed great in battle but nonviolent so um the a12 or the Archangel 12 was one of the secret spy planes that was tested at Area 51 back in in the 50s this one could travel like 2200 miles an hour at 990,000 feet was this amazingly fast secret spy plane that no one knew about but of course if you're flying it over the US people are going to see it or they're going to see flashes of it and so they're saying that that these secret planes and the secret balloons were really what caused the alien sightings in Area 51 however that stuff wasn't being tested until the 50s and it was in the 40s when UFO sightings really started to happen in the area um there were reports of lights in the sky strange objects in the sky and and those were just rampant in the 40s and if we didn't start testing these planes and [ __ ] until the 50s you know something else was going on at the time so it was in the late 40s it was um July 8th 1947 a press release came out of Roswell New Mexico this is where we get into the Roswell incident which goes back to Area 51 the newspaper said that a UFO had been found and this was on all the papers a flying saucer had been found and it was now in the Army's possession the very next day a retraction was printed saying nope wasn't an army was not a flying saucer nothing to see here again it was just a weather balloon now things get a little weird because this so-called weather balloon um was reported by a man named William brazel and he has a farm in Roswell and he noticed the Sheep were avoiding an area of the farm so he went over there and he discovered debris scattered over like half a mile metallic debris some of it that looked like some type of aluminum foil some that looked like paper and sticks but you know this weird metal that he had never seen before that was flexible thin like aluminum foiling it had some type of writing on it but it wasn't recognizable so he immediately called the authorities and the Air Force came out from the nearby Roswell Army Airfield and they're the ones that issued the press release saying that it was a flying saucer a UFO that had crashed so Roswell in Area 51 are actually two separate locations two separate locations that's right Area 51 gets in in Nevada gets involved in the in the Roswell incident of Roswell New Mexico but they're not the same place two different places two different events okay maybe that's where I got confused and thought the area 51 was in New Mexico because I for some reason I thought they were the same place the Roswell incident kind of predates uh what we know of of alien sightings in um at Area 51 but the everything that was taken out of the Roswell incident was taken to Area 51 and that's where okay okay if you want to get into the conspiracy theories um all right well let's cover the Roswell incident first and then I'll tell you how they're connected inly the news that news report that went out that said a spacecraft had been found was issued by first lieutenant Walter how I think that's how you say his name and he was a public information officer at the Air Force Base so he issued this press release and then he later had to issue the retraction saying oh it was really a weather balloon and this made him by all accounts a a figure of ridicule so he kind of kept a low profile for decades and in the 70s all he would say about it to his daughter was I put out the Press release and that's all he would say he would never talk about it however he did leave a sealed document to only be opened after his death and he passed away in 2005 and in this sealed document he revealed that Not only was his initial press release the true one saying that a flying saucer had crashed but that there had actually been two crash sites at Roswell and he himself had seen the spacecraft and the alien bodies that had been there so wouldn't talk about it while he was alive all he would say was I issued the press release and yeah but I think that I think that some of the people like him in the local law enforcement and and some locals I think they were they were extremely threatened by the US government to keep their damn mouth shut that is why that is why he would only say I issued a press release because you know some of these people they were they were threatened personally their their family and loved ones were threatened and it was literally life or death that they kept their mouth shut you are exactly right this is just one of a pattern of people who while they were alive wouldn't talk or for a while wouldn't talk and then later change their story they all had a pattern of abuse and maybe he didn't because he waited until you know he just left this Ste sealed statement until after he passed away that's not the first person who has either said something on their deathbed or let left a letter at death about this in he is not the first one exactly there's multiple accounts and so things that seem to be explained away suddenly by this deathbed recantation come back to aliens all over again and there's some people that say that these crashes these two um Roswell New Mexico crashes were taken to Area 51 and that's how they developed the a12 and the U2 planes and all these spy balloons didn't they say that they act retrieve live aliens from Roswell that had not died in the crash most of the reports that I found talked about deceased aliens including like a mortician Glenn Dennis Glenn Dennis in 1947 was a mortician and his funeral home had a contract with the Airfield the Roswell Army Airfield Base uh to hold funeral services and in 1989 he claimed that back in 47 a friend of his who was a nurse at the Roswell area field had accidentally walked into an examination room where doctors were bent over the bodies of those three creatures that they had recovered from Roswell and that nurse said that the bodies resembled humans and but were very small with spindly arms and giant heads the mortician Glen Dennis also says that he had gotten a series of phone calls that night in 47 asking him what the best way to handle small bodies was how best to preserve bodies that had been exposed to the elements and other questions of that nature but he did not reveal any of that information until you know the late 80s people were like you said they were keeping quiet everything was you know they were trying to keep it as secret as possible or it was all [ __ ] you got a figure though a whole town was overtaken by the military for days while they recovered while they recovered all of whatever it is they were recovering and how crazy is the US government that they were able to successfully silence a whole town worth of people that just blows my damn mind well that's the thing is is like that's why you know there's so many stories that come out and then are immediately squashed things like um in the early 60s the son of the Rancher where the debris had been found he was like wasted drunk in a bar and he's bragging about how he had kept a piece of metal from the crash the very next day CIA agents raided his house saying that he had government property and needed to turn it over immediately yeah if that was a weather balloon like come on much fuss over having a piece of a weather balloon you know 15 years later and the Crash itself there's varying reports the government officially says that it was just a small amount you know it they gathered it up and it was just enough for like a small bundle weighing like less than five pounds however the the debris that was taken away was taken away in multiple trucks and one of those large planes the same plane that was used to drop like the a bomb so why that much Transportation why that many trucks trucks why why that big of a plane for a small bundle weighing less than 5bs the other um witness statements about the crash site say that it was over an extensive area like like half a mile of worth of debris and it was all these Twisted pieces of metal and these weird aluminum foil shapes and things so so which what's what's true here it's kind of hard to sort through that and then you have someone else a scientist who you may or may not have seen I know Joe Rogan's been in the news lately and this gentleman Bob Lazar when I was looking him up The Joe Rogan interview kept getting pushed into my face over and over and over again so if you want to see it I guess you can go check that out on YouTube or whatever but Bob Lazar is a scientist who in the late 80s claimed that he had worked at Area 51 specifically on alien spacecraft on Craft that had come from this Roswell New Mexico crash this Bob Lazar guy is quite a character he says he got hired because he had put a rocket engine on his car so he had an old Honda that he put a jet engine on you know but that makes that makes sense that they're looking for that one weirdo who is like super engineering and scientific saffy exactly so in a roundabout way that car kind of helped him get a job at this test site in Nevada he did not know that it was called Area 51 that's not what it was called at the time and he didn't know what he was going to be working on he says that he thought he was going to be working on uh experimental aircraft like experimental spy planes and I guess technically he kind of was he was right he says when he first saw the UFO when he walked by it was in a a hanger and there was a lot of military around more guards than he was used to seeing and it had a ironically it had like a USA flag on it he thought it was just a of course we would tag it we're we're like it's like America's dogs that got to pee on their possessions have to pee on everything yeah so he thought it was like a a prototype of some new American spy plane not a UFO so he worked with this guy named supposedly Barry and his job was to reverse engineer the the fuel source that that powered the system and he says he says that there were nine different craft and he was only allowed limited information on the other ones besides the one that he was working on he says that after he came forward just like you said he was attacked his wife was attacked they shot his tires out you know they harassed him into leaving other jobs and he says it was over this fuel source that he had been trying to reverse engineer that he called Element 115 now at the time that he came out in 1989 there was no element 115 it didn't exist and in 2003 they did add Element 115 to the periodic table it's an element called moscovium and it doesn't really resemble what Lazar said he was working on but that doesn't necessarily mean anything it doesn't negate it either correct now Lazar has kind of hinted for a while that he had some of of this element 115 and he says that it's this element is highly radioactive and the stable version of it is what allows alien space spacecraft to kind of like Traverse the universe basically he says by it helps him to bend gravity so you kind of make places closer to each other by bending the gravity so he says that he's got some of this in 2018 he was doing a documentary with a filmmaker get this name I love this so This filmmaker is and you may have heard of it because you just mentioned a video that I think he took Jeremy Kenyan laier Corbell he was filming a documentary called Bob Lazar Area 51 in flying saucers and you can you can watch the documentary but during the filming at Bob lazar's current place of business which is a business of his called United nuclear scientific the FBI raided that business the day after an interview was held there for this documentary and during that part of the documentary Bob Lazar had said I have some of this Element 115 but that had just been amongst them the film crew and Bob lar in his business while he was recording and the very next day he was raid they got that guy bugged they're bugging him that's what I'm saying right the FBI says no of course not had nothing to do with with element 115 nothing to do whatsoever they said it had to do with a murder investigation so apparently let me tell you I am a I am a witch and I do not believe in coincidences here right right right so they're saying that United nuclear scientific one of the things they do is that they they sell rare elements and I guess there's people that collect all the elements of the periodic table that's an odd habit right isn't that weird so supposedly someone had passed away a collector of these elements and their collection had gone to lazar's business to be sold thallium I guess thalium is one of the elements that's on there and it's very hard to get and so this collection had thallium in it and the collection was purchased by some one and then a 31-year-old woman was found dead of phum poisoning and somehow she was connected to the person who had bought the collection that had thallium in it I don't know so they had sold the collection that had thallium in it and that thallium was later used to kill a 31y old woman and so they're saying that that weird coincidence the day after Lazar says that he has Element 115 in his possession he is raided and of course they said it had nothing to do it's just a coincidence did he actually have it did they take it he says he does he says he does he he says they don't have it he says he still has it you know he's been on numerous documentaries again he's been in that you know if you're into Joe Rogan he's been on that Joe Rogan podcast he's been all over the place and the the video that you talked about the Tic Tac lights going around the the Navy ships I believe that the the gentleman who did the documentary also was the person who filmed those uh that video the the government says yeah we don't know what they are it's a uaps they don't say UFOs anymore they like to say unidentified aerial phenomena UAP so I don't know why they're like okay it doesn't necessarily it could be could be Tech from other countries that we don't know about um we just don't know what it is you know they're not saying they're like we're not saying it's aliens but we're not not saying it's aliens either they don't want to after all these years admit right that there's alens well they have all these different secretive things they did this um thing called Project Blue Book Project Blue Book was created to study UFO reports it was like the super secret thing when Project Blue Book ended it had collected over 12,000 UFO reports and it had concluded most of them were like clouds or stars or aircraft you know natural things however 701 reports even after stringent complete total analysis were determined to be unexplained so you know they a lot of those reports again were were explained by like the secret planes that were flying around weather phenomena but 701 reports are completely unable to be explained by the government wow pretty wild rightow that's a lot that is a lot did we find a real spacecraft at Roswell and is that what we studied in order to get the tech that allowed some of these planes you know who knows did they study aliens there's there's a lot of stuff that says they might have a lot of stuff that says that they probably didn't and that's not even getting into all the other conspiracy theories like the Majestic 12 group that was supposedly brought together to research aliens and to find aliens you know there's just so much it's just crazy there's so much show wow wow so you know this is also sadly a good lesson you know kids this is this is a good example of how to not trust your government by their own hand they made it this way you know don't lie to me and then be mad when I call you a liar kind of thing you know what I mean yeah yeah on the one hand I can understand that you know it it does seem pretty logical okay Area 51 is a secret Air Force Base because they're testing you know spy equipment they're testing you know things to help keep us safe you know help detect nuclear detonations and stuff like that and you have to keep that secret you can't just be like oh yeah okay you saw it you saw the you know the fuselage or whatever fuel tank you saw the fuel tank and now we're going to tell you all about the spy planes that we're working on to help stop the Cold War you know I guess I can understand that they're not going to tell us about all of that but but the constant back and forths and the the witnesses who say one thing and recant only to go back to the first story again it just very ripe ground for conspiracy theories now if I had been the president I would have been like you know what you're absolutely right aliens shits about about to get real and then I would have moved all of the secret stuff that we really don't need to know about to a whole different part of the country and I would have fussed up to the damn alien [ __ ] you know you'd think they could at this point but you know the fact that they're declassifying some of this uh video information and saying we actually do have over 700 unidentified objects that are flying around in our in our airspace and we don't know what they are we don't know if it's some other some other country that's doing it we don't know we don't know and to Circle back to the beginning of the conversation you know I've seen at least two articles this week this week I understand we've got some stuff going on here but we need to I don't know I don't want to be a doomsdayer but you know we need to prepare for an invasion man you don't know so true and everybody's got everybody knows somebody if you yourself don't have some sort of unidentified flying object or alien alien abduction or alien sighting story then you know someone who has one I mean I have the weirdest story when I was a kid I'm not going to get into the details but I was pretty sure I saw a spaceship right outside my window and maybe it was sleep paralysis I don't know but couldn't move you know the whole see the bright light the whole thing and I would have dismissed it as a dream except my brother had the exact same thing happen and saw the exact same thing out his window that night so I don't know what happened but could have been aliens could have been sleep paralysis I know this was at a point in our lives where you and I had not met yet and we were we were younger smaller children and we did not grow up in the same town right I also had an experience in ninth grade and not only did I see it but it ended up being seen by the majority of the residents in my county and actually had made it on the news so it wasn't just like you know a ninth grade shell out being weird most of of not just the the town um and surrounding City but the whole County had had had seen these multiple objects in the sky you know that's the Curious Thing here is that a lot of times something has happened that you can corroborate multiple people see this or right you know there's some weird video that you can't account for or the other one that I really love is missing time when people have missing Time episodes some of those are truly freaky and and that was always that was always my thing with with Roswell in Area 51 there's just too many people who have sightings and stories and experiences from not only the Roswell incident but Area 51 that at this point there's too many stories for me to believe you that it's fake yeah it just keeps going back and forth and back and forth and and I remember one of the things that struck me back in in the 80s when this first came out I remember hearing about this guy who had worked at Area 51 and says he worked on Aliens and I remember the investigative reporter had said that they checked they checked the sky story and of course the government said nope Bob Lazar never worked for us and they they checked records and they had done some sort of um foia uh request and gotten a bunch of paperwork and of course time cards no no time cards with Bob lazar's name however there was a whole bunch of other paperwork inter office memos that had his name on it and uh listings of you know we'd like to thank everyone in the office and his name would be in there and different paperwork like that and that struck me as interesting they had scrubbed his name from all the official paperwork but they hadn't been able to go through to all the other hundreds of papers that had his name listed there and and back in 1989 that that was one of the inconsistencies that hit me you know there obviously lying it was this investigative reporter found the LIE what else are they lying about and that's the theme that just kind of carried through with all the witnesses now let me ask you this what has become of the Roswell site year 2022 I'm driving to New Mexico what am I finding when I go to the Roswell site well you can go out there I know that area 51 there's the town of Rachel that you can go out to and they have there's an inn there's a whole bunch of stuff around a little bit of alien tourism which a lot of the people in 2019 when they went out found but the Roswell site New Mexico but I mean where where the crash was was that was that like a like um a personal property where that was or was that like in a I don't know estate land type thing guess I guess I really didn't know much about the the actual site itself the site itself was a private Ranch there was a a Rancher that owned it um Mac Brazil um I think it might have been his Ranch it was a private Ranch William ww Mac Brazil William Brazil I guess at the time because of all the sightings in the 40s of all these lights and and flying objects there was a a talk about a reward and that's one of the reasons why they were so quick to report what they had found it operated as a ranch for the longest time but now you can go on tours it looks like ah okay okay in 2018 so I guess it was a ranch up until 2018 and then in 2018 yeah yeah it says uh Lauren Bogle whose family owns the ranch so the bogul have owned it bogul family has owned it since 1952 when it was sold by the Brazil family uh she says that a lot of the pens that they still had is very original they haven't changed a lot a lot of the ranch is still the same as it was back in the' 40s and again it operated as a ranch it looks like right up until 2018 so it it's just a cow operation until now they're doing uh a Roswell experience you can go do a tour and see where the UFO was and and all of that so tickets are pretty pricey between 65 and $250 you can go on a VIP Roswell crash site tour damn talk about cashing in on tourism why not I mean why not take people that there's still again so much interest even though we know all about these spy planes even though we know a lot of the secrecy was due to you know these spy things why were people seeing stuff in the 40s before these planes were even developed was there an alien crash site is that how we developed the planes you know that's I don't know yes the conspiracy theory in me is uh questioning because they again they flipflop so much so many stories of personal you don't know what to believe you don't know what to believe anymore and maybe that was part of the point you know just kind of Expos some of it to keep the rest of it secret who knows not to mention there's probably still a bunch of stuff about it that no one knows about either right and I'm sure if there were aliens and ships there I'm sure they have moved it all by now and maybe they kind of uh pump up the controversy to keep our attention focused on Area 51 when all this other stuff has been moved elsewhere because you're talking what pushing 75 years ago right and they're only just recently declassifying some of it right right I would imagine you know probably all that alien craft stuff has been moved to a tiny little village in Upstate New York well that's probably what they did with the um the senica Army Depot that's probably what they did did with the senica Army Depot is they've moved all the aliens there and they just pretending that it's a it's a closed white deer Sanctuary it's really where they've got all the aliens don't tell anyone I would totally I would totally believe that absolutely senica Army Depot in Upstate New York is not where they are keeping aliens and UFOs not no it is not that's [Laughter] right thank you so much for listening to episode 8 we now have people on four different countries New Zealand New Zealand has coming so we have people from countries all over the world I

week I am actually going to this is going to be an interesting one trans alany Lunatic Asylum o this is a popular one you do love your asylums are you trying to tell us something sh um but this one popular one this one is one that a lot of Ghost Hunters and a lot of paranormal groups um go to so trans alagan we're give our spin on it and and take you to another Asylum oh that sounds so creepy they always creep me right out of the stories out of the asylums it seem to be some of the spookiest ones I'm so looking forward where you taking us where are you taking us next week I'm going to go actually to yet another place that has been termed a gateway to Hell you know kind of keeping with a theme I love them love them there seem to be so many in the US but this one is called Crater Lake and it is absolutely gorgeous Lake in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and it has a really spooky creepy history so we're going to go there and we're going to learn all about a place that the indigenous people the clay maath people consider sacred and think is a site too sacred for human eyes so yeah so next episode we're going to go sacred and crazy sacred and crazy all right we'll see you then stay Stony I don't know we did that before let's not do that one again all right cool yay
