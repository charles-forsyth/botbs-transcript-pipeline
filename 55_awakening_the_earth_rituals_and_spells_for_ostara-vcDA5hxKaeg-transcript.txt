welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this wheel of the Year episode we'll be talking about the Spring Equinox also called ostara or if you're one of our many New Zealand or Australian or south of the Equinox listeners happy mabin or fall equinox south of the Equator I said equator you said Equinox Equinox you said south of the or if you're one of our many friends south of the Equator Happy fall equinox sometimes called mabin in this episode we'll be talking about spells and rituals that you can do completely knowing which side of the Equator I'm on I'm Leila and creeping up to the next notch on the wheel I'm shelle and today you know this is it this is what we've been waiting for daylight savings time because that's longer days the temperatures Rising because Lord knows if I am going to be cold for any much longer I will just shrivel up and New Beginnings here we are oara I am ready for some new beginnings to be honest I don't think I gave this holiday enough attention back in the day enough you g we we gave it no attention let's be real yeah I'm pretty sure that this was probably the lowest attended ritual at our local Pagan group as many of you know shell and I originally started out in a pagan group in New York state that was comprised of family groups covens soliar people from all sorts of different Traditions who would get together at the eight holidays some of them were indoors at a local Unitarian Universalist Church and ostara was the very last indoor ritual before one of the biggest and most attended rituals belain which was the first outdoor ritual this was always like the Forgotten one because right now you know like the birds are chirping and there's no snow and flowers and buds are creeping up I'm getting ready for camping and belane and for me personally I'll be honest the last thing I want to do when spring is springing is to do an indoor ritual there I said it there I said it we are so ready to be outside but it's very muddy very mud luscious outside and so it or it's snowy or cold is that even a word well according to E Cummings it is is one of my favorite poets yeah it's spring is one of his poems and he coined the word mud luscious and it works for spring but yeah nobody wants to do indoor rituals and we're all kind of chomping at the bit everybody's ready to burst out of the ground we're tired of the Shadow work of being within of being underground we are ready to be outside and in the sunshine and you know spread our wings you know actually out of all of the rituals we've hosted throughout our decades together this is the least one we've ever done yeah I don't think we've done it very often and the few times we have it was not well attended I can think of once doing it with our coven where we did a dawn ritual at our friend's house out on the hill which I really didn't want to attend because you know me and Dawn we don't we don't we're not not mix I was not friendly now I can do a dawn ritual I used to love sleep but anyway so Dawn rituals are popular because of the association with new beginnings and the East and ostara being a goddess of the East and the sunrise so Dawn rituals are are a big part of ostara in spring equinox also being it's like it's like the third New Year yeah right does New Year ever end so it's also the beginning of the astrological New Year I didn't realize that for a long time who knew yeah Aries the first sign in astrology starts then and and also we mentioned a little bit in our Leap Day episode we talked a little bit about how at one time there were no months for January and February between the winter solstice and the Spring Equinox it was basically the lost time at one point in time literally did begin the calendar time this was when months started the Spring Equinox you know how many times have we restart our damn calendar could we just restart it again if that if that's what we're doing here you know everybody kind of has holidays around this no matter where you're at it might not be on the same date but when spring starts when that spring equinox happens everybody cultures all around the world have celebrations of the sunlight of color of fertility of eggs I mean eggs are everywhere rebirth renewal purification all of it it's just such a vital time in the world you know we talked about hkat with pranie and demer the fact that in the winter solstice pranie has been stolen to the underworld by Hades and deer is sad and goes into mourning and the earth goes cold and unfertile and then in the spring pranie comes back now according to some Legends She doesn't come back on imul that's when her mother knows she's coming back so that's when the earth just barely starts to wake up because deer is coming out of her depression and it's some time between imul and the Spring Equinox when pranie goes through that Maze and comes out of the tunnel of the underworld with hkat at her side you know and then reemerges so she's come out the Earth is bursting with energy we're ready to step out into the sunlight you know all these different traditions of growth and renewal you know I just had a little bit of an ironic thought here what's that you you know how my mind takes these left turns I find it interesting that we do Mass celebrate kind of that period when panie goes into the dark but we don't Mass celebrate that period when panie comes out of the dark as far as you know least attended rituals and things like that you know I don't know I think it's because we're we're just so ready to be out of that underworld we're so ready to be out of the dark that you know who's got time to go inside the YuYu church and do a ritual right I don't know it goes against the whole theme of the holiday emerging out from the yeah some of the things you can do for this time of year to celebrate that are get outside put your feet in the dirt you can go out and literally ground or what some people call earthing just by touching touch grass touch the dirt touch the ground with your bare feet preferably depending on where you are in the world this is also a time where you can start like literally planting your seeds you may depending on where you are have to start your little seedlings inside where it's still a little warm but yeah you know it's time to put seed to dirt and you can do so many different spells and rituals with that you know just hold the seeds and put your intent into them as you sew them into the dirt you can purify the dirt the containers the tools that you're using um ancient cultures a lot of times for the the Spring Equinox even if they didn't do a ritual necessarily we're blessing their tools we're blessing their fields and we're blessing the seeds so that's something that you can do as well to be connected to that growth we have to talk about the eggs for a minute oh my gosh eggs are everywhere so many cultures eggs are such a symbol of fertility and renewal and rebirth I love coloring eggs oh yeah me too there's just something about it I even like the ceramic eggs that are painted little Easter colors I just recently had a score at a thrift store and I got a whole jar full of stone eggs different Jasper and Malachite and a couple different kinds of polished Stone eggs that loving now are you going to do anything with those four oara they'll be out on my altar as part of um you know because they're Stone and their eggs it'll be a representation of grounding centering as well as rebirth and renewal you know funny you mention that because I was thinking of an oar ritual that was all kind of about not just like traditional grounding and centering but kind of like grounding out winter like literally ground rounding out the vibe that is been from sa until now Wash It Away you know start over not a necessary doover but just kind of rid yourself of all that muck and mire kind of plant it right down in the earth and leave it there and kind of walk away I really like being able to walk Barefoot this time of year if I can pick a time when it's not too cold to go out and do that better yet you know like we talked about not wanting to do ritual indoors if you're lucky enough to be able to go outside have a bonfire and to just dance around that or even just go stand on that little patch of dirt next to your front steps and just pound your feet on the dirt a little bit to wake up the earth I don't remember what book it was but I know um Eden McCoy edane McCoy uhuh she had a book and in it she had like a an earth Awakening I don't remember exactly what it was called but it was like reawaken the Earth ritual and she talked about taking your staff you know if you have a a wooden staff or some type of Staff taking that outside while you're Barefoot and pounding the bottom of that on the ground you know nine times and then you know saying something to the effect of you know waking up the Earth and to wake up your life and to wake up the energies of change and renewal what is that like knocking on the door of Earth yeah pretty much waking her be like knock knock knock you know and she'll be like Gaia is not here but but yeah literally knocking on the earth pounding on the earth to awaken that Earth I would be remiss if I didn't touch on spring cleaning because you know as much as that is a sounds like such a 1950s housewife thing there's a method to the madness I do this myself this is like gut it all out and start fresh in my spacewise and my altar wise you know how I like to collect random  for my altar you know like I got freaking pine cones on here you know I got like leaves and I got all kinds of  in here this is kind of the time where I get rid of all of that you know we all collect random Goods outdoor goods I kind of get rid of all of the natural stuff off my altar dispose of it and kind of start new because I know damn well the first leaf that falls in the fall I'm G be picking that thing up putting it on my altar I'm going to be grabbing that pine cone I find out in the yard you know so I kind of get rid of all of the natural items on my Altar and knowing I'm replenishing that as I go again you know what I'm saying I mean how many freaking pine cones can any one witch have I'm just saying well you're certainly stretching the uh boundaries of that along with your tarot your tarot collection no no no we're not talking about tarot decks here that is a total separate conversation I was speaking of natural from the ground or Outdoors things yeah so now was an excellent time not just to clean your house spring cleaning is a thing for a reason but it's also a good time to cleanse your altar and refresh your altar make it a little lighter make it a little cleaner I like to buy a new broom this time of year just a little bit of broom magic for you but if you buy a new broom for the Spring Equinox make sure before you bring a new broom into your home that you sweep something into your house like oh maybe a little bit of cinnamon so you sweep good things into your house before you ever use it to sweep things out because that will help keep the good luck in but buy yourself a new broom and use it for Magical cleaning so it can be just like a dollar store broom it doesn't have to be one of our lovely gorgeous boms from three Moon brooms but it can be a broom that you get that you use for Magical cleaning so take that magical broom around your house and clean all the cobwebs out of the house just to kind of refresh it let that breath of fresh spring air in you could make up a chant and say while you do it and you know you can actually get a magical dust pan with your broom there you go but you know get one with natural bristles you can find those sometimes it doesn't have to be an expensive broom but don't use it for your regular everyday cleaning kind of keep it for when you want to do magical cleaning and I did write a little poem I have this little poem I pulled up from aara past so you can sweep the cobwebs out or clean your Altar and say as oara Dawns in Springs Embrace abundance blooms in this Sacred Space with the light of Spring's first kiss I call in here's your fill-in the blank family love abundance uh Prosperity whatever you want so I call in put in one word here like love balance and Bliss say that as you're clearing out your cobwebs and you can bring in all that good energy I love it you always with some crafty little crafty thing yeah honestly just make it simple make a little spell make it three words that you say over and over again that you want to draw into your house as you're clearing out the old whatever that breath of new is that you want to bring in just chant that over and over again you don't have to make it difficult Blue Water West there you go that's a reference Blast from the Past right oh and back to the eggs thing there's so many different rituals that people do with eggs you know there's the ostara turned the bird into a bunny that still laid magical eggs but there's cultures all over the world that use eggs to symbolize luck fertility um they're given to people at weddings they're given to people at birthdays they're given at holidays and they're colored for protection and again for luck for fertility for Prosperity everywhere everybody's got a tradition eggs are definitely a thing um egg coloring has always been my favorite thing even as a kid with my kids I just love a nice colored egg I don't know there's something about it I think it just maybe it just brings back fond memories I don't know but I I I love good colored egg to use it in your ritual or spellwork uh you can use natural ingredients there's lists out there everywhere you know turmeric for yellow red cabbage for blue coffee for Tan but there's other things that you can do with them as well shell I believe in one of our older ostara episodes talks about taking a white crayon and drawing on your egg you can draw a Sigil you can write out a spell you could write out a spell word in white crayon and then when you put it into your coloring that part doesn't get colored so it it appears you can even do runes you can do sigils whatever the hell you want you just all it takes is a white crayon in a dream and if you want to use crayons to draw in color on your egg a good tip is to do it in ritual space have a candle heat up the crayon just a little bit with your CLE and that will allow more wax and color to transfer onto the egg I also recently learned of a type of divination that was done in some Norse cultures with eggs with eggs yeah so this might be a good time to do an egg cleansing which I know a lot of South American and other cultures do to cleanse your body you can do egg cleansings we've talked about that before and you do a divination with that very often after you do the egg cleansing but this Nordic type of divination or umy it's another word word for egg divination basically you take an egg and you know how you can open an egg up you know put a little hole on one end and a slightly bigger hole on the other and then you blow out blow it out yep yep the easy part right the easy part take a bowl of water okay hold the egg maybe write on it with the white crayon uh give it the intention of telling your future put a small hole in one end a big hole in the other and blow the egg whites into the bowl of water and just leave the egg yolk in the eggshell so you just want the egg whites in the bowl then you let it sit for 24 hours and you come back and you look at it and basically I'm I believe it's like tea leaves I looked for a little while and I couldn't find any particular divination encyclopedia like divination list of symbols but I'm imagining it's much like dream interpretation or Tea Leaf reading where there's some Universal type signs but most of them are personal I was going to say I would think it'd be more intuition based you know especially with Tea Leaf like I might see something one way and you might see it a totally different way right I might interpret it one way and you another you can even like bone throwing yeah yeah yeah so I think that maybe your best bet is your personal intuition yes so I I would look at some tea leaf Some Dream symbolism meanings because some of them are archetypal they are relatively Universal so that'll give you a place to start but most symbol interpretation like shelle said it's going to be highly highly personal to the reader and to the person being read so going with your gut instinct and how you interpret those shapes is going to give you a much better reading than trying to look at a list of symbols online and interpret it that way right right but yeah so that's a type of egg divination that you can do on Oar there's a divination for everything yeah we're still gonna recommend tarot we're still gonna tell you to do the tarot but yeah some rituals to do right now dedications are fantastic it is the astrological New Year everybody feels new and fresh and ready to start over so dedicating yourself a new to your path to a deity to a cause rededicating yourself to something or doing a ritual to rebirth yourself or to start over again after ending a job ending a relationship after trauma after growth you know becoming new you could do that rebirthing ritual to celebrate that spring within yourself start from the balance of the Spring Equinox and go forward and grow now you just touched on a word that that I definitely want to make sure that we don't forget talk to me about what you have tried to balance on the Equinox because I've tried everything I've tried to balance an egg I've tried to balance a broom I've gotten the broom to work before I've never gotten an egg to balance tell me your experience with balancing on the Equinox I've never done that are you kidding me no I mean I've balanced a broom before but I don't think it was on the Equinox I do know that the exact time of the Equinox which is the time that the sun crosses the equator perfectly which makes the day and night exactly equal that's what I need to know that time is Tuesday March 19th at 11:06 p.m. eastern time so at that very moment you should be able anything this should work with anything um get a penny going sideways an egg a broom whatever the hell you got at the exact moment of the Equinox it should balance even on its own without you holding it this sounds like I don't know Google it I your n I'm Googling this this sounds like an old wife's tail uhuh I mean I usually like old wies Tales but this sounds this doesn't sound real although I've only ever done it on the Equinox so maybe I can just do it and that's when it happens with theom I'll try it I'll try definitely try the broom I'm going to do it I'm going to see if I can balance a broom on the Equinox 11:06 p.m. Tuesday March 19th be there or be square so see what you can balance on that but balancing yourself The Equinox is about balance it's about after this day the light is growing it's coming out from the dark time so just use those themes in your rituals and in your spellwork and it's going to give it that much more power and Effectiveness I just want to let you know that I found out that there's actually EV vents all across the world world that are egg balancing vents held on the Equinox what egg balancing events yeah yeah I've heard of egg drop events no egg balancing events I got to look this up balance eggs on the Equinox what the heck is this it's become oh an American urban legend can you balance what the hell I told you can you really balance an egg during the fal Equinox all right let's see so this is according to ABC vernal equinox is the term that describes the switch from astronomical winter to astronomical spring it occurs when the sun is directly above the earth's equator during its orbit which this year as I said is going to be March 19th at 11:06 p.m. so the legend says that you can balance it okay this says despite the fact that there's nothing special about egg balancing on the first day of spring you can still do it that's because you can do it any day of the year what some people prefer to balance an egg on the first day of spring because it symbolizes ringing in the season with a metaphorical sense of balance that is according to wabctv like I said I had only tried it on the Equinox so there was so there that's a ritual in and of itself that everybody was doing that's a spell that everyone participated in balancing an egg to symbolize that balance I say do it just do it just do it that's fun though that sounds like a fun thing to do I would well it's the egg time I guess maybe that's why I thought it was only at the Equinox I don't know apparently it's an American urban legend that I unfortunately was not part of so I don't know but that sounds like a fun thing to do this is also the Year of the Dragon right wooden Dragon right the green wooden Dragon this is perfect time of year for that dragon energy oh yeah the dragon of the earth is Awakening you know all of this energy is coiled and ready to go spring is potential energy it's that energy that's within a seed coiled up powerful but in kind of like a still waiting period and it's just starting to come out so that's this dragon energy this green dragon energy like that Dragon this is how I Envision it me and my Celtic mind work the dragon is in the cave starting to muster up from its sleep yeah you're starting to see the smoke come out and hear stirrings inside and and that's where we're at you know we're we're we're waking up we are ready to be outdoors we don't want to be inside in the church we want to be outside in our bare feet dancing around a bonfire with the drums pounding all around us I feel sad a little bit for our south of the Equator friends because it is the opposite for you folks things are winding down things are scaling back and you're getting ready to enter the dark time and man I don't envy you I do love fall though I do and it is beautiful time of year but it it is for part of our listeners they are definitely going into that period of within whereas here in the northern hemisphere we're going into that period of without so I just wanted to acknowledge that we do have some listeners that are going into that dark period right now I really love that this day this one day for at least just that minute it's equal day and night is balanced we're all on the cusp of the next stage ours is Awakening and theirs is going within right you know that's really cool that's kind of a a neat way the yin and yang of it you know the Opposites and yet still the same I really like that oh that is an Nifty way to think of it I never thought of it that way yeah just for at least that fleeting moment we're all the same we're all exactly balanced just for that little bit in the same point yeah we're all at the same point so definitely if you're up at the dawn like I am lately unfortunately go out and greet the dawn if you are you know a wake and bake kind of Soul a weed witch like myself you know roll up a little bit of herbs with your cannabis to greet the dawn go out and offer a puff to the winter and say goodbye and offer a puff to the spring and be ready to wake up you know greet the dawn turn to the East and take big deep breaths and stretch be in your body maybe touch a bare toe to the cold ground or if you're like me wake up and greet the after afternoon there you go wake up and yeah make it be you can do this at sunset too but there's something to be said about the dawn but it can be at any time of day just go outside face East and say goodbye to those things that don't serve you any longer say goodbye to that within that shadow time that darker self and be ready to be a little more outgoing a little more open you know so just turn your face to the east to the Sun and and say hello and be ready for brighter days you know here in North America we have that whole crazy thing that we call time change that period that we just went through of time moving forward an hour that hour first of all for me personally makes all the difference in the world I'm not going to lie but it kind of I don't know makes your innards feel like it's spring we're we're there the light is here the light is coming the light is lasting that's the important part the light is lasting I know these weren't necessarily big huge rituals or spell times for you know the ancient Pagan ancestors but for me I freaking love the equinoxes because you really can feel that change like you said we just had the the spring forward of time change the days are longer the sun is out more there's shoots there's such a palpable visible change in everything that it's so much easier to feel that magic especially when you're outside outside you know you don't want to be cooped up anymore you want your windows open even though it's 45° outside you know but the sun is sh open the windows that's right sun is shining the birds are chirping you can't stand being closed up any longer pranie couldn't stand being in the Underworld any longer she needed to come up and burst free it's time to be open and embrace the changes and embrace the light and you know the minute I see those Robins I know here in the Northeast Robbins are like Robins baby bunnies and mosquitoes and you know you've made it I know that it's different all over the country what your harbingers of spring are so tell us what yours are in California when I lived there it was everything getting green the flowers coming out it was just a fabulous time of year here in the Northeast it's still cold and a little dark thankfully the days are longer and like said the birds and the bunnies and the squirrels are out and so those are the signs here what are the signs in your neck of the woods what tells you that spring has happened one Cool Spring fact fun fact that I I just thought of because you were asking what people are going to see out in their Spring View we actually may depending on the weather we may catch the spring cherry blossom bloom down in the Maryland Washington DC area um and that's like a big thing like they have f around that cherry blossom bloom and I have I've been down there during that time and I feel like all you can smell for like a 100 mile radius is cherry blossoms and for the folks that live in that specific region like that's that's like the sign that spring has sprung for them there's something to be said for that spring Breeze this full of scents full of flowers I was just going to say that that the smell of spring just oh it does it for me me too me too so calling in air calling in fire feeling your feet on the earth and feeling that snow thaw out and lots of rain depending on where you're at unfortunately I guess you know so yeah if you're lucky enough to be down in the Maryland area join us for the Sacred Space conference down in towns in Maryland the end of March just coming up here very very soon just a few days away getting excited very excited cannot wait
