welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi I'm Leila and I'm shell and today we are gonna talk about something so fun ilila tell us what we're gonna talk about we are going to be talking about festivals at Brushwood folklore Center we're also going to be featuring some personal stories from people at Brushwood folklore Center super exciting by the way and you know not everybody has had the opportunity to partake in In Summer Festival season and to you I said put it on your bucket list oh yeah there is nothing like it there's no vibe like it you have not lived until you have been listening to drumming around a bonfire under a Summer full moon there's nothing like it absolutely absolutely and I mean this is a festival I mean I would say what roughly maybe give or take about 2,000 people participate uh maybe a little bit lower than that attendance since covid is still down a tiny bit but things are starting to ramp up and they always do these festivals big at Brushwood I'm talking about the San Kofa which is relatively new I think it's about a decade or so old and the Sirius Rising Festival which is going to be celebrating I think their 30th Anniversary next year oh I love Sirius now if you're if you're unfamiliar with Brushwood folklor Center this is located in Western New York and this is York this is an outdoor location um I know that there are festivals around the country and internationally that are held in in hotels and such but this is an outdoor location camping the whole nine the best bonfire you can imagine it's almost like going home home it is home they even say welcome home right when you come in whether it's your first time or your 50th time Brushwood started out as a an artist Retreat Frank the man who owned Brushwood he's passed away his wife and his daughter and her husband currently run it he was an artist and he was one I believe of four brothers and when their father passed away the land was divided up into parcels and Frank took the one that was the least farmable but the most campable it's beautiful oh gorgeous there are acres and acres of land rolling Fields there are the Fairy Woods there's ponds there's a couple ponds they have built over the years different areas there's the amaton which is a very spiritual place there are shrines to each of the elements the air fire water and Earth shrines as well as Fairy Woods The Fairy Woods there's a spirit Shrine with a labyrinth the place is very very spiritual I found it when going to a festival for zido music for a band called hypnotic Clambake it was the hour Festival the outrageous Universalist Revival festival and as we were driving in in the middle of the night to pick our campsite we go by what looked to me to be Mapes and I'm like those are  Mapes and as we roll down the windows I hear the drumming coming from The Roundhouse and I'm like that's Pagan drumming wait a minute this is a pagan place I know it is I feel it I feel it and indeed it was and I started going to the Pagan festivals there ever since and it's just a magical lovely place as you can imagine um I then was introduced to it by Leila and like like to the point where remember back when we had seasonal sites there because also folks you can get a seasonal campsite at this place and you can camp even during non-festival season which is equally magical on a different level the people that camp there as seasonals love this place and it is a true community and they are all invested in making this very magical space even more magical and welcoming there some spiritual out Western New York it really is it's a great place this used to be home to the Starwood Festival which is now I believe being held in Ohio so like shell said we highly recommend getting to Pagan festivals because it is a wonderful way for those of us who don't have community at home who don't have a Coven or a group to worship with to immerse yourself in a witchy Pagan lifestyle right and you know there are some great festivals all across the country not just in in Upstate New York and if you Google them um you're going to find that there are some good good reasonable prices and I'm telling you if you can get to one this is like bucket list stuff yes truly the the just the experience you can't replace it you can't and they do workshops and and as we've mentioned earlier on this show I was there as a presenter I presented several workshops um and we'll talk about those at later date but I did workshops on sigils spell jars and I did a three-part series on podcasting on how to get your voice out there how to you know get your magical witchy story told and part of what I did throughout the week was listen to people's stories how did they find Brushwood how did they find these festivals you know what brought them home and also what kind of story did they want to tell to our listeners you know what did did they have to say about themselves and the very last day of of the festival um the very last Workshop I did at the festival we recorded some of those stories and one woman a very famous Pagan um a lot of you will recognize her name when we get to her story told us two very moving stories um so that was that was pretty special and I was very thankful because although you were you were kneed deep in in hosting workshops at a festival I was on my own private vac vacation sad I was actually sad to be on my vacation um but I was actually able to tap in Via Zoom uh to the last Workshop so I as well was a participant um in the conversation and you know great people great stories and I really can't wait to share some of these stories with our listeners because this is part of why I like the festivals because you do get the camaraderie you do get you know that that magical environment but you get the workshops and you get these seminars where you can learn and gain information and make connections with people um and kind of take things next level it's not all about the ritualistic part of it or the quote unquote fun part of being out in nature and camping part of it there's also that educational piece to these festivals and again you know experiences that that just can't be replaced and you did the witch Con on Festival earlier this year which was fabulous so many classes so many wonderful presenters and this is the this is the same kind of thing but in person you know you'd get the workshops all day long that you get to choose from and trust me it was really hard to choose which Workshop that's the one thing I hate about festivals because it's like nine workshops are all at one o'clock that I want to take right do I go to the belly dancing Workshop do I go to the fire spinning Workshop or do I go to paganism in the 90s you know it's hard man it's hard and and and sometimes I get frustrated so all you Festival organizers that are listening there has to be some way where it's like pick your own schedule just saying but with even with all the wonderful classes at night there's the bonfires and the rituals and the dancing dancing yep and it goes until dawn and falling asleep to the sound of drums is something that I love in the summertime so it's that spiritual slash educational Blissful week of Happiness yeah exactly and so I asked people how I was all about the stories I wanted to hear people's witchy voices how did they find home or how did they find their way home to Brushwood to these festivals and also what kind of stories did they want to tell and Sh and I kind of explained how we found Brushwood you know I went there to a music festival and real realized it was actually had a witchy heart and of course dragged my witchy bestie there with me who also fell in love with it then we found out that another long-term friend of ours who ended up being in Coven with us later also had gone there quite a few of our community would go there as well been there and you've been there and you've been there yeah and we realized that all these people that we loved and cared about had connections to this place and had connections to these festivals so like shelle said it is a fabulous way to not just immerse yourself in that witchy lifestyle gain knowledge but also to gain a lot of connections and meet a lot of wonderful people whether it's online or in person and I know you you had you had the the blessing of being there for two weeks for both festivals and and you met some wonderfully fabulous people um and made some beautiful connections but just tapping in uh to your final work shop uh from my vacation I felt like I was able to almost like transpose myself to Brushwood for that little while and and have those same connections and I was able to interact with wonderful great people but unfortunately I just couldn't see them in person so straight from these wonderful pagans we're going to give you a couple of their stories about things that they're interested in I believe we have one gentleman who discovered a talent for ghost hunting which I love Yeah in his love of trains he discovered he was picking up some ghostly voices and so he's kind of gone with that and then we also have Joe Frost the daughter of Gavin and yavon frost speaking to us about the passing of her mother and some of her experiences as well we're going to hear from um some of our Workshop participants got some great stories also interestingly enough you know we we had a conversation with Joe Frost in this Workshop fun fact Leila and I participated in a workshop at Brushwood with Gavin and yavon what would you say like about 25ish years ago yeah I'd say maybe a little less than that it was a very interesting Workshop very magical definitely pushed a lot of my boundaries and the space that it was in was fantastic but I can't say it was the most comfortable of workshops I I almost want to say that um when I realized that Joe was a part of this Workshop of yours it almost felt like a full circle moment because of having done a workshop at Brushwood with her parents all the years ago and then you know just recently doing a workshop via Zoom uh at Brushwood with their with their daughter it just it felt so full circle and it was it was wonderful but let's stop talking and let's listen to your last workshop at [Music] Brushwood we'll start our stories with Shannon from the YouTube channel they still speak well I would always take my camera with me when I when I go up there and yeah I believe this was yeah this was how this was the Halloween trains mhm you know they get to their little pumpkin patch thing that they create there and then they they basically Park the train while the kids and the parents and grandparents whatever get off and go pick out a pumpkin get their face painted and all it and after the parents and grandparents and kids clear it off the car I thought to myself you know this would be a good time to get some interior shots of the car sure so I you know shoot the interior of the car didn't notice anything out of the ordinary at the time so now this is like an oldfashioned train car it's that well oldfashioned yes it's it what it started as a Canadian national uh commuter car in the Montreal area anyway I I I shoot maybe five or six minutes worth of of footage mhm and after I got home later that night and downloaded it I thought i' well let's take a look at it and see how it turned out while I'm looking through it I hear you know I'm the only one in the car at the time right and the kids and parents they're far enough off in the field that I'm not really hearing them M but I hear this what sounds like Whispering like in the background of your yes oh my goodness and I thought well I must be imagining things so I played it back again still there still hear the whisper yeah the whisper yeah it was still there and uh thinking am I am I muttering to myself or something but what happened next thoroughly dispelled me of of that because I turn the volume all the way up on what sounds like the whispering it is a a man's voice speaking in French Canadian oh wow mhm oh wow and that matches the history of the car right which was built in I think 51 or 53 for service in Montreal where it stayed until 1996 MH so yeah and that was your first experience capturing it on that I'm aware of yes someone went to work they didn't realiz realized they died and were still working on the train White possible or it's just a someone who wrote it to work every day and back and maybe they're not they don't realize they're dead yet right exactly or they have some you know some real energy invested you know having a very high emotional experience on an emotion gets trapped in the middle ex Furnishings of the car yes and we've noticed that repeatedly it might not necessarily be that that person's spirit is there it could be maybe they had a lot of intense emotions every day on their commute to work and that imprint on the the train itself that's interesting and then about the same time I was shooting a lot of other train footage MH and so I thought well you know if this happened once and I started noticing I was getting all these voices on the they use the sound well they they can use they can manipulate any sound to speak they use the the sound of the train to speak the energy and I have gotten all kinds of of different voices different ages different accents some are very very negative very angry and some are very kind and loving and even helpful and I one thing I I have noticed in terms of evolution is that when I first started doing this I would say that probably 90% of the EVPs I got fell under the the classification of uh Angry or unhappy you think that changed though oh yes definitely I can see it in the most recent ones I've gotten in the over the last say six months or so it's now probably 60 or 70% positive loving I get various voices on there all the time telling me I love you we love you or there was even one that said God loves you oh wow now that was that a though do you think that the the change has been where you're getting picking these office do you think it's a change in you I think it's more in me because it's pretty much the same locations although I found that when it comes to me getting EVPs location really doesn't seem to matter a great deal I could turn my camera on in the middle of a mall parking lot and probably get multiple EVPs well it sounds like from your earlier experiences yeah it could be this could be a you thing you know this I I think it is I I think I I have a connection whether I want it or not I have a connection right because it it is a mixed blessing mhm the only times I've really had a problem getting e just attracting EVPs was one time I took it just as an experiment I took the camera out and to the the edge of this farm field it's miles out the country you no no houses nearby no towns nearby nothing nothing nothing that's one of the only times that has happened usually I at least get one or two and sometimes it's like wall to wall it's like once they get started it's just everybody kind of want once one comes in everybody kind of piles in well that's and they will they're all lining up for their conversation with yep they find that opening Al although I have to say some of the things that that they say it's like okay you had this microphone to the world as it were to speak so why would the choice of first thing first things say be Donuts or something like that that's a good question I might say that that's like a yeah it's like it's like if you you you have a message for the world what is it donuts donuts I wonder if some of that is due to the recording Factor as opposed to a being an actual entity that's trying to speak if some of it could just be recorded I've thought of that but almost every time when I'm out by the tracks it's just me there's no one nearby now on the outside chance that I could be just picking up random Snippets of conversation from several blocks away M could be but I mean I would encourage anyone to to check out my my check out my uh recordings and see you know decide for themselves yeah definitely and again what was the name of the the channel they still speak perfect thank you so much but Caroline did you want to say anything talk about maybe your experience here at Brushwood or anything that you've enjoyed here I'm not sure how much would fit why don't you move on to Joe okay well and it's funny because I was going to invite Caroline to speak because I think um she and I shared the gong bath MH uh earlier this week oh yes love to hear about Carol such a special smile and you can tell you know like she's enjoying her experience it seems like you're enjoying your experience at Brushwood and I would love to hear from you about you know like really fully engaging festival or the gong bath or something just it's you know I think you have something really special to contribute I agree okay all right so Michelle this is Caroline this is Shannon's partner and I believe this is your first time here at Brushwood this is my first time here at Brushwood uh I have never been here I'm so excited for you and it's been not quite what I expected uh I am here because uh Shannon had come to Brushwood and Starwood Starwood yes and and wanted to come back and I wasn't sure if he was going to be okay camping or I wouldn't have been better together right Better Together there you go she's she she was a girl scout yes and we we we got a decent tin and a serious cop so I figured okay I'll try anything almost anything once it's a good attitude so so I got here and I looked at the program and I said okay I've got to go try some of these things and just to see what's going on the first Workshop I went to was on managing stress our presenter did not show up I guess they managed their stress very well I have a story for that oh so we have here at Brushwood there is North stage and North Pavilion so the story that I heard was the presenter went to North Pavilion to present the workshop and the participants were at North stage and the presenter sat at North Pavilion and thought wonder who all those people are there for that Workshop who's what Workshop is that and it eventually occurred to him might be his Workshop but he was afraid to leave the Pavilion in case anybody came to the Pavilion for the workshop so there was a just just a touch of confus so at any rate after about 5 minutes one of the people said well we may not have a presenter let's just why don't we talk among ourselves so we had a very good discussion it turned out to be a very good Workshop probably very different from what it would have been if our presenter had been there uh and I'm glad to know what happened sometimes those are the best ones though to be honest so we we we exchange stories we exchanged different ways that we dealt with stress everything from uh medications and drugs of various kinds to exercise to biof feedback to uh relaxation techniques uh to shouting at the world and and then at the end agreed that what was discussed was going to stay in the workshop nice because some of it was Private I think that's a good that's nice boundary setting right there good to take care of each other I like that okay um let's see went to um the um gong immersion for for women thought okay this sounds interesting it'll be a different experience and what a Gong immersion is that's a sound bath right they have different G and they yes they can you tell us a little bit about what went on uh well there were a lot of people there and people managed to rearrange all get themselves arranged into places MH and our our presenter had do you remember honey gongs she was like little on 10 probably 10 10 nice 30 some inches little bitty ones so all different size bongs different about 10 mallets of different kinds wow so we we sat there for about an hour on one level it was a Gong concert MH and on another level it was a spiritual experience to uh just listen to the sound feel the sound come through you and then in the background there were Robins calling throughout almost the entire hour that's they they are ubiquitous here at uh Brushwood and there is in fact a a robin Nest at one of the trailers very nice and that I've been to one sound meditation like that and when you said that you felt the sound on one level it was a concert and on the other you could feel it you really can feel that sound I was surprised and amazed I think when I went to it that I could literally feel it it it shifted my brain and my body did you yes and I think uh there there is that recent movie called everything everywhere all at once which I think describes the experience because part of it I was feeling like the beginning of the universe and part of it I was feeling like the end of our universe and and then of course we came back to our current universe that's beautiful that's beautiful I'm so glad you got experience and I felt you know sort of at the time that a lot of the people I know who have passed were there with us they're always here yes everywhere sometimes we can feel them better than others but sometime sometimes you feel them and sometimes you don't so I love that that sounds like a beautiful experience I'm so glad you got that here I'm so so glad that's wonderful so do you think you'll come back do you think we'll come back I think probably yeah uh when when before I got here this was in the category okay I'll try I'll try it once but I don't expect it to work out but you you had to be talked into it yes and there have been there have been a fair number of birds here I'm I'm an active birer so so past the roundhouse there's a path that goes back into the woods and we're camped out there and there's a variety of birds back there that you don't necessarily see up here is that getting into the Fairy Woods I'm further back you're further back okay yeah cuz I don't P well so I relate to that I like that I'm going I'm going to I'm going to steal that that's okay so we have about half an hour left and we still have Joe and Ed Ed Pagan that's right add the Pagan here if either of you would like to share a little of your story I want had a couple things and you guys can kind of you know vote by committee about what so there's the first thing which is uh I conducted my mother's service here Sunday and then shave my head afterwards and then the other thing is uh the kind of the Crux of living loving our mother yesterday which is being able to be Pagan in a mainstream way and live my values in a mainstream way so I don't know which one would be more interesting to the folks at hand Michelle you have a say if you'd like to have a say too um so who who has an appetite for what kind of thing would you um Michelle Joe's offering to share either talking about um her mother's service that she conducted here or the living I'm sorry living loving your mother yeah living loving her mother do you have a preference for what she geeez I'm intrigued by both this is a quandry um I'm I'm gonna go with a service for her mother because I like to hear about how people honor those who have passed from our spiritual perspective and if you wouldn't mind I I also would like to cast my vote for that as well because I have lost several people this year and it's been a tough year and so it's it's okay it's okay and so hearing that I think might might be might help I think that would touch people so um my mother is was is I don't think that's a past tense thing yvon Frost and so my parents are Gavin and yvon frost who founded the church and school of Lua and were activists in the Religious Freedom Movement as well as in the Pagan you know bringing witchcraft to everybody um can I can I just stop you for a quick second did you say your parents are Gavin and yvon frost yes yes wow I'm glad I picked this one I try to keep a low profile but I sorry for your L but I'm very interested in this um I I try to keep a l profile but I'm I'm starting to kind of own that role in the community um and so I've been coming to Brushwood for nearly 30 years raising my kids here um did children's programming because that's what I wanted as a kid because I was one of the few children in the Pagan community in the 70s and so I kind of led the way to have children's programming at Brushwood when that was happening here and um yeah I mean it it's it matters we we need to build this next generation so um so we are I did my mom's service here uh she my mother both of my parents were obviously interesting characters it takes a lot of personality to be be able to stand up like that and uh they they had very large personalities and I was kind of the Entourage for a long time and I'm really comfortable with that role I'm really comfortable about being behind the scenes um so Gavin passed and I think 2016 and within about 6 weeks it was clear that yon was not really good at living on her own and so I moved her in with me and they weren't getting great Medical Care and so I kind of managed all of that and improved things for her helped her get healthier um and which led to healthy gut healthy life healthy gut and so I do a lot with fermented foods and building people up uh physically through kind of anecdotal although they're starting to research this more between healthy gut and what's happening in your brain and so I got yon stronger and healthier and in in the whole getting the Aging mother stronger and healthier uh just she just got meaner and meaner towards me because she's like this is not how I wanted stop controlling my life child I did my own religion stop this uh so she's quite a character and an interesting person roles right yeah absolutely an interesting person to live with so she was always a little bit of a uh disruptor let's go that's the modern parland for who she is and so she eventually the beginning of lockdown um had convinced one of her old bows prior to Gavin that she needed rescuing from me and my controlling her life and so he came and rescued her from me and so she spent the last three years of her life um and the older son called her the 90-year-old 90day fiance uh they Remar he did and she spent three years uh very happily with her her husband and passed away February 14th uh of 2023 and so her I'm very sorry to hear that I I appreciate it her current husband her the most recent widower uh he said she had asked for no service but when I did Gavin service many years ago uh she said this is what I want I want service in community and I want I want this this group and Brushwood of course needed because they had been coming here for 30 years some kind of Mark of that passing and so she um we did a service Sunday afternoon uh July 16th and uh we called quarters and it was a small service it was smaller than I expected because I did try to make it available for people to come into Brushwood on a day pass so I have money kind of fared it away so that people could come to Brushwood on a day pass to to participate in yon service since it was the only service held for her and uh we I wanted to open it because my mother and I had a difficult relationship I started the service invited people in we we Sayang we all come from the goddess and then I got out of the way so that people from the community could honor not just yvon's memory but the the dynamic couple that Gavin and yvon were and so people shared their memories we recorded that and we'll eventually broadcast that but we wanted to edit a little bit of it and um gosh there was some beautiful stuff shared and then uh we went up to the studio after I shaved my head um because I'm now the you know the oldest of the family and um there is a tradition what is the significance of shaving your head as the as the Elder of your family can you just talk about that real quick there's a little bit of cultural appropriation there are people in the Middle East uh who um it's traditionally Hindu families I think and again it's vague I meant to re it before I talked about it but uh the oldest son when the parents die the oldest son will typically shave his head and I don't have an oldest son so uh you know to to Mark the passing of the generation I shaved my head um in honor of that right of passage I think that speaks to a lot of cultures there are several cultures that have Traditions around that and hair is such a personal thing and it grows with us through these years it holds everything it holds all of that and she was in some of that hair you know and I can very much see the blessing of of the release of that as part of honoring and the only real interesting aspect of that is I'm pretty introverted and of course shaving your head is like being pregnant you become public domain um and so apparently a female with a shaved head and not only is it people are like we're really sorry that you're sick it's all in my brain guys it's all mental health it's not anything else and and then it's of course rub the bald woman so I I become the good luck Buddha of of Brushwood you're roing it by the way you you know I I I I I feel for you for why you did it but you actually look great bald well I'm pretty sure I'm going to keep it it depends on how my boss and the you know the mundane World handles it because I I've pushed some boundaries at work before and I'm not sure how she's going to respond to this uh so watch her face but I but I may be keeping this for a while um so we we had a wonderful EXP experience there are some people who have come from a fur piece to uh celebrate uh yvon's life and uh the neighbor here came about 800 miles uh to to celebrate your Bon's passing and uh just you know I feel like we we've done done the right thing to honor her memory and so I'm grateful for that I know that they were a part here very late but all ha The Travelers travelers all ha thank you for sharing that I very much appreciate that you know and having yes thank you I have done service here for people private ones that have passed the space here the the lab the spirit Labyrinth and then the ancestor Mound the space here is fabulous I mean I it's very you you can't walk out there without feeling it because of the people I think that have walked there and have come there with those emotions like you were saying earlier Shannon right you know it very much is a place of peace and you know remembrance it's a nice spot and I I love Gavin and yvon's wedding rings are at the ancestor Mound and contained within the ancestor Mound now oh that's beautiful it's a nice tribute it's true that that you're more likely to to find spiritual activity at a location that has seen a lot of human interaction over the years with it and that that's why you can go in like way out in the middle of nowhere and find nothing in just an area in a city or Cemetery or something and you will and lots of activity yes lots of people have been there and you know back and forth and just like this this property here lots of intense emotions as well the the people for decades have walked Brushwood and and this place has so many stories and has held so many different lives and people have met here and been created here right yeah you know it's it's definitely a place that uh brings a lot of characters I think and then there are presumably those who have transitioned to come back that's right and then they come back we hope and then we have Ed the Pagan actually um be heard why don't you come over here oh no I'm me say I want to say this really quick um I'm ad thean I'm glad to be here at rushwood I think you should be listening to this I want to hear your second story I'd like to give up that time to hear the Second Story I would like that as well thank you Ed and so every listen in and uh this is a rare opportunity for me I'm really excited to have met you thank you thank you yes we would love to hear your second story so if you want to know more about the church and school of wika there is still a living breathing website although I'm navigating some technical issues it is wi.org so wca.org is our website we have YouTube I have a Twitter handle you know all the Social Media stuff um so living loving our mother is something that I'm I have invested a lot of energy in um we as pagans we don't often feel welcomed into Community unless we somehow hide who we are and what we're doing I I think you know culturally uh in the United States of course of course we have a lot of conservative people with conservative values who are somehow louder than people with less conservative values and so um I I see lots of nods happening around me yes um so uh particularly in some parts of the country well and I'm I'm a teacher in a high school in West Virginia so I absolutely respond to that um you have my sympathies I'm good so I teach math so that people don't think I'm recruiting for wiah in the math classroom which would be kind of an entertaining uh Behavior but um in living my values the church and school of VI's Min statement is to create green spaces in places that are are less green and at my high school there was a pond donated by a graduating class and the pond uh had become stagnant and was one of the most toxic sites in West Virginia as determined by Thea and the DP it and it becomes the most thing right right and so you know the pond was donated and built around the time the church and school of wi was started and around the time that I was started um and I thought this is something I really want to get involved with and I'm a Master Gardener so greens space is Master garden and that kind of is really complimentary to our mission and they're re reclaiming this Pond and making it a more green site and so we have been involved now for about five years with um putting in pollinator Gardens and putting in and naturalizing that habitat so we have a wetland L now and this is all at this high school so it's you know it's all the biology classes get to go out there and identify plant life and bird life and W and insect life and so they're really having you know we now we have this outdoor lab at the school and uh this year we raised enough money with my sustainability Club to plant 21 native trees at the site and so Earth day was a very hard very long day with an all going into old kind of beat up ground planting trees but so we're we're trying to build this green space and the site itself with this Reclamation project has been nominated for an EPA success story so I'm living my values hard right doing the work but it's not you know people are not saying oh this is this Pagan thing and we we can be resistant to the Pagan thing because I'm I'm reclaiming the the Wetland so I've heard that twice and I just want to speak to that quickly is you're the second person that I've talked to one was another presenter who is living Pagan values out loud who is using them in the community but feeling the need to tone down the Pagan aspect of it and and but doing these things and presenting them in a more palatable way to the mainstream I guess and I I'm feeling way about it on the one hand I'm loving it because get that out there we need to do this we need however we can get the right message out there do it and on the other hand I'm like why can't we say this is a a pagan thing and I so I don't know it's it's tough and I'm loving that you're doing it though I don't want my children to have some of the early memories that I have of the Cross being burnt in my front yard of brand new kitchen cabinets being shot out from the road and there being no repercussions um you know I don't want my children to have those experiences so they've had some push back you know teachers or people in the community have felt empowered to hand my children Bibles and say you need this in your life holy Bibles not whiches of Bibles and say you need this in your life however my children have said we're not confused we get presents at Christmas end at saus we're good so I think that's a much healthier reaction than what I had um but Gavin and yvon were Advocates and they were Fighters and they you know and you saw the difficult as the person who the brunt as the child you saw the difficulty of that and so so my children have have had very different childhoods than what I did and yeah and and again that that goes to my I love that you're doing it and that you found a way to do it to protect yourself and your children and and to still get the message out there but I hate that you have to be quiet about it sucks I can answer from a financial point of VI I just got finished being uh almost eight years a industrial worm farmer in Chicago selling worms to Amazon and compos and all that and I was at the worm guy you know even though I was still doing Pagan values nobody wanted to hear my values what they want to hear oh you want to sustain the Earth and two you're going to save me money so it became more important for them to live my values of being an earthworm farmer right and being this sort of thing than it was about my spirituality gotcha and uh and when they found out my spirituality go oh that makes sense you're get you're giving us money so it was better them to learn what we were doing first and I agree with you and my teenage children had the same I was more active as in Te my teenage children my grandchild children don't even have fact give you such a impact my children have asked me never to carry pictures of them in public my wallet if you get it it's only my ID there's no pictures of my kids no addresses no families no numbers and that's because with what you you went to it much worse than than they did right yeah to that great it's hard it's hard activist Pags are hard on their children and we should respect that yes well and I've had people ask me you know we we want to be leaders in our community we you and they their kids are playing at our feet we want to be leaders in our community and I'm it can wait 15 years mhm you can wait and take care of the family first and bring those kids up in a loving hopefully safe environment yes so that they can not have those difficult memories but still have the good ones and and start to you know live those values and out loud hopefully hopefully I can't believe it's been this many decades and we're still still in the broom closet in a lot of ways I like that as a title for something still in the broom closet or in the broom closet yeah still in the broom closet well we're back on the broomstick so take the stick out of the closet that's right take it out of the closet you you got to crawl before you walk you got to walk before you fly you know you got to so we're we're still crawling for fighting for acceptance and fighting for and I love your pond project that's fantastic you took something that was the most toxic site and now you've won an award for the biggest I mean it's a team it was definitely a village it wasn't just me oh yeah that's a lot of work I love that I that's fantastic and it it's a big enough Pond that that you said um the biology students go out there and they use it as part of the curriculum and everything that's fantastic absolutely well thank you for doing that I think that's wonderful and for teaching the class here about it gut health and the whole fermented food you touched on that a little earlier I'm gonna have to pick your brain on that I may need to retitle it rage cooking because you make cabbage weep which is really fine well see rage cooking would probably get more people interested that's a title right there for sure I might actually learn to cook for that there it's not dinner till somebody bleeds in our house and I'm a vegan but it's not dinner till some all right well I think we are just about out of time so I'm gonna say thank you so much Ed I appreciate you giving up a little bit of time there for Joe but this is it's just a rare opportunity everybody can hear me so if you want to hear me pan World TV that sort of thing you can find me easy right Jo I want to see more of her that's right encour we want to see more of her we do actually you have a unique voice and and and something that people need to hear you know with all the things that you're doing it's so important and focusing on the kids coming here with my kids is I think it was one of the best things that we did with them you know the things that they learned the memories that they made here the the classes they went to it I think it's really helped them be more caring people and so I love you know I love that aspect of what you've done as well you know it's really we noticed a difference and for any parent who's Len listening who's on the edge of about whether or not they take their kid to a festival be selective about where you take your kids but you got to you got to take your kids to Festival because my kids were different the years that we were unable to make it here they the years they were much more rounded through the winter they could help them manage school all of those things and deal with the mundane World um in a different way but the years that we didn't make it here I could see a difference I agree I think even for adults here the the freedom that you have here to be who you are you know to literally dance to your own Rhythm and be you know Express that part of yourself is so important for people I think just Community but I'm going to thank you all and thank Michelle and uh I'm going to
