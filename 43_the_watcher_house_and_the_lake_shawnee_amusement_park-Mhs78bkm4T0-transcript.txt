it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to the stoned Witches Hour if you haven't been here before this is where two best friends ended up on opposite sides of the USA and decided to start a podcast and why did we do that sh why not well partially honestly truth be told was because we missed each other yeah it is and we wanted to hang out like we used to and tell each other scary paranormal stories and creepy urban legends from all over the United States so we decided to do that while smoking mass quantities of the devil's lettuce so normally representing all things creepy in the western half of the USA but this week I'm stealing an East Coast story I'm Leila in representing the devil's lettuce on the East Coast I'm [Laughter] sh well you know hey there's all sorts of things you can call it other than weed right you know I haven't heard Devil's lettuce in so long and that just made me laugh that just made me laugh well good I got some good Devil's lettuce this time holy crap I'm high nice I'm very high myself what are you smoking this evening shell okay so you know how been kind of on this like Baker's eth kick lately oh yes so they had a different one this is Kush mints oh love Kush mints delish I'm I'm out there nice I'm partially here on Earth I'm partially on a different planet and I'm loving it especially in the stratosphere and kind of out there I love it I love it I'm smoking some homegrown some of my Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] I love that name don't know what the phc content is but from what I understand around 27% is pretty average and it feels like it's probably right around there I would say it's a higher mid to a lower really good you'd be super proud of me because so I get this this Baker ath the other day and it's really good don't get me wrong but I got something else with it and I haven't tried it yet but I was waiting to tell you about it oh what did you get what did you get you know how you have two rules rule number one if it has silver in it buy it rule number number two if it has cheese in it buy it those are good rules yes this is called cheese whz oh I like it where's the silver come from that was just your first rule okay so this is a good cheese then cheese whz huh well I I haven't tried it yet but it's 29.2 and I think I'm going to save it for our next podcast oh I like that okay a nice high TC for Shell I know you like the big ones and like you say you can't go wrong with cheese no you can't go wrong with a good cheese that's very true they can usually taste a little funky like sometimes that cheese name means that you're going to have a little bit more of an earthy kind of taste sometimes even an almost cheesy taste well are we really in it for the taste I'm just saying yes absolutely I am 100% you know I was in a lift the other day I had to get a lift ride and uh my driver was amazing and she's telling me all these different places and different things to do and she mentioned something about drinking and I was like well yeah I'm mostly just a stoner and she lit right up and we started talking about weed of course which was so much fun here here's the thing would you ever be honest now be honest would you be like oh that tastes like [ __ ] I don't want anymore or you know what I'll pass that didn't have a good taste like really I guess it depends but if I don't have anything else to smoke I'll definitely keep smoking the weed that tastes like [ __ ] sure as if it gets me high I'll smoke it no problem exactly but if I have a choice I'm going for something that tastes good and that's where the lip driver was in total agreement with me she said she loves something that has a great flavor and a great smoke she'll grab every time and I'm the same way I like something that tastes really good you know I do find it very ironic that oh by the way that's a gorgeous pipe oh my God I wish the people could see it beautiful pretty I just got this at a new shop Riverside it actually used to have a bumblebee on the top of it but of course I broke it because anything glass that I touched you do that's right I break so this one the Bumblebee saved me though when it fell on the pavement the Bumblebee shattered off but the bowl is still intact and very cute but I find it very great and awesome that the more weed is kind of that legal accepted getting into that you're not just a drug addict if you smoke weed kind of Realm the more you're finding out that every damn person like your lift driver or you know the cashier at freaking Walmart or% you know the lawyer down the street the business owner say all the time everybody smokes but nobody believed you because you were a stoner yeah but if you drop a couple code words into a conversation you know about giving thanks was a good one amongst other pagans was a good way to identify someone who smoked weed remember when we used to call it pie that's right we would be like hey you got any lime pie got half a pie I need half a pie you got an e of a pie with my brother it was well one of my brothers it was Apples that's funny that's funny everybody had those codes but we all had code words and you could kind of tell who smoked and who didn't it and it seemed like every [ __ ] buddy smoked and now that you can say it now you know everybody smok now you know for sure sure and I love just kind of casually dropping it in conversation but I like that it's not so taboo that there's there's something there's something comforting about it I don't know yeah finding your tribe I mean it's always been really nice to find other people who grew and other people who smoked and now that we can be much more open about it we're seeing so many people that do it and I just I think it's pretty great I love it but you know what there I do not want to get into a debate here I do not oh frustrated shell what what's up so I go to the store and I see a sign that says we do not accept EBT okay you know what EBT is right yeah it's the it's the electronic benefit transer yeah yeah so I see a sign at the weed store that says we do not accept EVT and I was a little high when I went to the weed store it seemed acceptable I was not the driver and I made the comment well gez I hope not the cat year went off on me so apparently they're trying to get it past where you can use EBT to BU weed for folks that need Edibles as medicine and like EBT is not for medicine a like I don't I am a big weed proponent I a big weed proponent like smoke until you can't smoke anymore but EBT really how are we justifying this so EBT is electronic benefits transfer and it is in use in all 50 states District of Columbia Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands and Guam and it's like a snap uh supplement I guess like a food stamps and you are allowed to buy things other than just food with it Edibles really let me check I'm checking to see if you're allowed to buy medicine because if you're allowed to buy medicine I I would say that yes I would think medic I would think medicine would fall under um Medicaid I would think so too but I'm checking to see if it's if like if you can buy like cough medicine or something with EBT so cuz if you can buy like say pain medicine with EBT then I would say okay if they were trying to say that you could do it with Medicaid or Medicare or like my health insurance like I'm all for it health insurance 100% we absolutely I think New York state is working on trying to do that I hope more places are yeah I definitely hope more places are to find a way to have it covered by Insurance health insurance I totally get it absolutely should be the the food stamp benefit I can't wrap my head around that because here's the thing you cannot buy water with EBT so that's my [ __ ] you can't buy water with EBT you cannot buy water with food stamps you can buy soda but you can't buy water like I said I'm not trying to like open a can of worms if you're allowed to buy medicine I say you should be able to buy Edibles I AB abolutely use it as a I would have just thought that would have fallen under the Medicaid part that's all and it should definitely fall under the Medicaid part absolutely 100% sure I don't know but I do want it to be covered as a medicine for sure Medicaid medic benefit health insurance benefit should absolutely cover it absolutely like I said I'm just kind of confused when we start bringing in the food stamps part of it and I'm like what yeah I'm not sure if you can use uh EBT or snap or food stamp type benefit to buy painkillers then I say go for it if not then no you shouldn't so anyway now that we've now that we've opened that now that I've started some controversy here last episode was the blood moon the full moon eclipse it was also the anniversary of when Charles Wetzel discovered the Riverside monster the pumpkin headed crypted ooh yeah that's great that's right so I was going to go to Riverside and go to that intersection and see what I could see and bring our homemade Ouija board oh my God please tell me you did I did I wi oh my God oh my God I know that everybody else listening is like saying oh my God just like me I didn't do the Ouija board it was pouring [ __ ] rain I don't know if you heard but for like three days straight we got nothing but rain yeah but didn't you kind of need it or something out there wasn't time rain is always a good thing we are not built to capture that much rain unfortunately but definitely needed and in the area that I went to where this monster is supposed to have been seen back in the 50s I would have thought rain would have been cooler because it been rainy and maybe foggy and creepy it was definitely creepy I was afraid that there was some type of wild animal in the brush it was very overgrown don't see the river I leave the river dried up quite a while ago but was your Vibe kind of like something was off super creepy the vibe was definitely creepy and it was more than just because I knew there were coyotes in the area you know it was certainly kind of a creepy Mystic Vibe is this like a like a like a dark secluded Crossroad kind of thing or is there like streight lights like what's the atmosphere there's a there's a lot of businesses nearby there's a lot of Roads nearby and there's quite a few highways and stuff nearby so it's not included pery not really no no and I did ask a couple people um at the nearby businesses if they had ever heard of this crypted none of them had did they look at you like you were so freaking weirdo yes they did love it I tried though for the sake of the show I went in and I sacrificed my pride and I asked if they had ever heard of Charles Wetzel or the Riverside pumpkin headed crypted and no they had not you know who you needed to look for you needed to look for like some nice elderly lady making soup or in a rocking chair and she would have told you all the direr right I did find a better story of Charles Wetzel which I will tell you quickly before we get into our main stories of the evening do tell do tell so I I found out that he was he was driving home that night again November 8th 1958 and this version of the story mentions where North Main Street crosses the Santa Ana River so he noticed that his radio all of a sudden went to static and at the same time that his his music went to static a creature jumped from the brush at the side of the road onto his car it landed right on the front of his car and it had a round pumpkin scarecrow looking head can I just interrupt you and say that if my radio went static in that atmosphere and something jumped on my car my first thought would be alien and that could be because of the movies but I'm just thinking what the hell ship just dropped out of the sky mhm he said quote like something out of Halloween it wasn't human it had longer arms than anything I'd ever seen when it saw me in the car it reached all the way back to the windshield and began clawing me so from the front of the car from the front of the bumper like Vine arms yep it reached the windshield and around into his open window and started clawing him and he said it didn't have any ears the face was all round the eyes were shining like something fluorescent and it had a prot turbant mouth he later said that the thing's legs stuck sideways out from its body and its skin looked scaly like leaves oh wow I love it he said he reached for a 22 caliber pistol that he had under the seat and he was going to shoot at the thing and then he changed his mind and decided to floor it instead and got away he said it tumbled off his roof uh the roof of the car to the ground and he went straight to the police station the Riverside police station right in downtown Riverside California they noted and there's a police report where they noted scratches on the hood and windshield and oily green streaks on the underside and the sides of the car no [ __ ] they went to the scene later with blood hounds and didn't find anything but the next night another spooked driver went to the police station with an almost most identical story of what had happened to him in the same spot but no one else saw it until the 70s when Bigfoot like tracks were found around the Santa Ana River in that area and then once the river dried up no sightings have been seen But when I went there it was very very wet was pouring down rain and that was the one area that had like a misty fog over it and it was definitely spooky but I didn't see anything and I didn't stay for very long because it was very cold and very wet W so no other reports since those none and like I said other than thinking I might have been some creepy crypted the the locals had no idea and had heard of it they'd never even heard of Charles Wetzel or the pumpkin head Riverside river monster dear Riverside California Lila is a crypted it's been verified it's been verified I am a small Bridge Troll of an undeterminate type so I'm going to pack another Bowl in this I I do love this while I went up there I did get this while I was researching that story and hoping that the rain would break long enough I could bring the Ouija board out there um so I'm going to pack this nice big bowl it's super cute even though the little bee broke off of it it's very fall looking isn't it adorable it almost looks like one of those honey um sticks you know those honey tools you get it was quite cute with the bee on it I'm so sad that the bee broke off happens considering my luck with glass just have to get another have to get another it's not like it cost that much it was it was $18 for this bowl so damn yeah it's not like it was anything expensive mass-produced glass I am saving my pennies and getting yet another glass piece from the Woody guy that I got that Woody Gandalf from I'm gonna get another one of those yeah we talked about them in an episode I'd have to look back super for nice stuff but very expensive still on I'm still on the silicone kick can't lie I think it's the cap I love having a top oh yeah so convenient I loved having that when we were walking around Salem it was so nice to just be able to pop it back in your bag or it po hit cap it take a hit cap it because I don't want to you know I don't want to smoke around other people you know so we'd go someplace private and if you also don't want burn marks in your pockets from where it might have fallen out or so the cap is actually super convenient and I love it if they had caps for glass I'd be totally down I just try to Puff it really fast and finish it get suck it all down and get it well so I know I did just tell a story but I'm kind of eager to tell you my story this evening because it's something that's kind of famous so famous that it's popular on Netflix right now oh my God there's so many things you could be talking about right now go ahead go ahead now this week I'm doing a story out of New Jersey it's an East Coast story and I normally do a West Coast story but shell stole the UFO stories from me last week so I decided I was going to steal a story that I have been super interested in from her I started researching The Watcher house thinking it was a West Coast story and I kind of abandoned it once I found out it was an East Coast story but since shell stole my West Coast UFOs last week I'm stealing The Watcher from her on the East Coast this week oh my God I have been enthralled by that damn TV show it's okay I'll let you have it I know I had to do it I'm sorry but oh my God like I'm enthralled with this it's okay I decided I needed to do it even though Netflix did it because they faked it nothing in that series is real did they pull an Amityville Horror we'll get to that in a minute but the no no no no the the the letters really happened everything really happened there there are some people that think it was possibly an amodil horror but the the series doesn't exactly tell the truth all right it's like the crown damn it the broadest family who the story is about they wanted the people in the story to not resemble them at all in the Netflix version they have two teenage children and in real life they have three children that are I believe 108 and five roughly at the time it all happened but three kids under 10 and a lot of the details in the story itself were also kind of faked so basically the Netflix series is a is a dramatization of what happened but that's what TV is so I figured I would do this and uh tell you what really happened what we've got here is a house on 657 Boulevard and basically that's it which I feel like everybody is like going to right now because of Netflix and I actually kind of feel bad for the Neighbors yeah I have I did read quite a bit I tried to stick to some older sources I wanted to get some original things that were going on but ever since the Netflix uh series came out they have asked for people to kind of leave the new owners alone and to kind of stay away right it's a sleepy upscale town in Westfield New Jersey and Boulevard that's it it's not like Maine Boulevard or Jefferson Boulevard it's just Boulevard is the name of the street so Boulevard is is where all the really fancy houses in Westfield were built that's where if you're the upper class that's where you would want your house and 657 I guess was one of the grander houses on the whole street itself it's all started in 2014 June of 2014 Derek and Maria brought it decided they were going to go live in Maria's hometown of Westfield and of course she had her heart set on bulvard where all the nicest houses were they decided to buy 657 which is a Dutch Colonial shingle style house built in 1905 has six bedrooms four bathrooms and is a kind of unwieldy 3,869 square feet damn right and they bought the house that June of 2014 for $1.4 million I'll take it right wish I had that kind of cash so they started moving their their belongings into the house between June and August shortly after drik turned 40 but they never ended up living there why would you buy a house like that and not live there ah see this is where things get kind of creepy shortly after they purchased the house June of 2014 Derek had been working on the house doing some painting and things until late in the evening and he decided to go check the mail now keep in mind this house never went for sale publicly there was never a for sale sign in the road it was never like for sale on Zillow it kind of went up for sale quietly there were a few people that were interested and then it sold to the brises so nothing was ever really public Derek goes and gets the mail and there's just a couple things a few bills and in it is a card shaped envelope stamped and addressed in very kind of shaky handwriting almost like somebody was trying to write in a different style or maybe was writing with a dominant hand we and it was addressed to the new owner you want to hear the letter oh boy what is it I couldn't find full versions of these letters but I was able to piece together as much as I could of them so I'm going to read to you what I've got and it might not be in exactly the right order but this is what I could find okay so this letter that looked like a some type of birthday card type letter or whatever he opens it up and it says dearest new neighbor at 657 Boulevard allow me to welcome you to the neighborhood how did you end up here did 657 Boulevard call to you with its Force within 657 Boulevard has been the subject of my family for decades now and as it approaches its 110th birthday I have been put in charge of watching and waiting for its Second Coming my grandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched in the 1960s it is now my time do you know the history of the house do you know what lies within the walls of 657 Boulevard why are you here I will find out do you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested better for me was your old house too small for the growing family or was it greed to bring me your children once I know their names I will call to them and draw them to me who am I hundreds of cars pass by the house every single day maybe I am in one check all of the windows that can be seen from 657 Boulevard perhaps I am in one welcome my friends welcome let the party begin and it was signed in a really elaborate cursive font The Watcher that's [ __ ] up so this is just a couple days after they move in to their brand or start moving into to their brand new house they're doing a few Renovations and they decide to just kind of continue on with the renovations because this is just really freaky wouldn't we all right they reached out to the previous owners after after getting this really weird letter they kind of asked the previous owners the woods is if they had ever gotten anything strange or any letter from someone calling themselves The Watcher because it sounds like this person has been kind of watching the house for a very long time or their family has that's the implication anyway it's what they say so the woods just get back to them and say actually yes they'd lived there for 23 years and had never received anything until shortly before they moved out right after the house was closed on by the broes they said they got one letter and they thought it was really weird and it talked about thanking them for taking care of the house but that was pretty much it and they just thought it was odd and threw it away then later in June the bruses get a second letter from The Watcher and this one now mentions them by name even though it's not spelled correctly it says Mr and Mrs bratus welcome again to your new home at 657 Boulevard I am pleased to know your names now and the name of the Young Blood have brought to me you certainly say their names often the letter mentioned the children by names and their nicknames but of course it wasn't included anywhere for the safety of the kids it also mentioned one of their daughters their youngest daughter and it mentioned seeing them doing art at an easle on an enclosed porch that can only be seen by a certain just a few houses in the neighborhood have access to be able to see that but it said is she the artist in the family 657 Boulevard is anxious for you to move in it has been years and years since the the young blood ruled the hallways of the house have you found all of the secrets it holds yet will the young blood play in the basement or are they too afraid to go down there alone I would be very afraid if I were them it is far away from the rest of the house if you were upstairs you would never hear them scream will they sleep in the Attic or will you all sleep on the second floor who has the bedrooms facing the street I'll know as soon as you move in it will help me know who is in which room then I can plan better it says all of the windows and doors in 657 Boulevard allow me to watch you and track you as you move through the house who am I I am the Watcher and have been in control of 657 Boulevard for the better part of two decades now the woods family turned it over to you it was their time to move on and kindly sold it when I asked them to the workers have been busy and I have been watching you unload car fulls of your personal belongings the dumpster is a nice touch have they found what is in the walls yet in time they will the house is crying from all the pain it is going through you have changed it and made it so fancy you are stealing its history it cries for the past and what it used to be in the time when I roamed its Halls the 60s were a good time for 657 Boulevard when I ran from room to room Imagining the life with the rich occupants there the house was full of life and young blood then it got old and so did my father but he kept watching until the day he died and now I watch and wait for for the day when the young blood will be mine again I pass by many times a day 657 Boulevard is my job my life my obsession and now you are too broadest family welcome to the product of your greed greed is what brought the past three families to 657 Boulevard and now it has brought you to me have a happy moving in day you know I will be watching signed again in a different very elaborate cursive font The Watcher now some of that was included in the ne Netflix series I remember now I would be creeped out yes but some of it just doesn't make sense like I don't know he says he asked the other family to move out and they said they never got a letter right and when they asked the woods about that part they said you know no one had asked them to move out they had just you know they had just decided to they really had legitimately just gotten the one letter other people believe that they've also gotten letters through about the history of the house and just didn't want to say anything they were just like oh my God don't ask don't tell right kind of thing that is of course the rumor but there's no proof of that and the woods themselves say they never got anything and but they must not have gotten too much or they wouldn't have stayed there 23 years because if you were that freaked out you don't stay right exactly exactly so Maria is the one who' found the second letter and it came 2 weeks after the first letter arrived and she had recognized the the lettering on the front of it and immediately called the police and told them about it but the police weren't very helpful shacker no offense yeah basically although it's creepy and I'd be scared I mean they talk about right they talk about hearing the children scream from the basement and young blood and have they found what's in the walls and I mean it sounds kind of stalkery but no real crime has been committed just watching just they're just watching just watching the brises were not happy I mean this letter mentioned their kids names their kids nicknames it talked I would feel violated you would feel violated as a parent you'd be like what the actual [ __ ] yeah and that's exactly how they felt they were scared they were invited to a barbecue shortly after they'd gotten like the first letter and they were so creeped out they they kept yelling for their kids they didn't want to let them out of their sight I would like suspect every neighbor to be honest literally I'd suspect especially the ones that had access to a view to that one room absolutely and they did contact FBI agents they they did contact private detectives and um you know the CIA help yeah they got a profile of who the person could be they did also get some DNA from underneath where someone would have Li the envelope and I believe the second or third letter and determined that it was from a woman oh and the family the bruses were ruled out they were not a DNA match and they did actually go up and down the street getting DNA from anyone who would let them have it and they could not find a match there were some neighbors that were kind of high on the suspicion list including like a creepy old lady yeah but but side question yeah so a private investigator knocks on your door hey Leila I'm detective shell so we got this funky issue going on would you mind spitting in this tube are you going to be like oh yeah sure hand it over let me just wad up a a freaking spitwad for you [ __ ] no I'm not suspicious but I ain't giving my spit to some Rando who knocks on my door either exactly I also would not either I am a paranoid no it just would not happen there's no way i' give you my wallet before I'd give you my spit right it's not happening so I imagine that happened but they did say most people were pretty willing to do it probably because they were creeped out too right so the letters also mentioned um Renovations that were happening and none of the renovations were visible from outside the house oh uh neighbors weren't even really aware that Renovations were happening so it would seem that this Watcher had some sort of inside knowledge or was watching enough to see people coming and going wired with cameras they did they set up web cameras all over the house and Derek even said he went a little bit wacky during that time I think the Watcher had cameras Oh possibly but dererk and Maria BR us set up their own cameras all over the house uh and he also would would spend a not good amount of time with the lights out kind of staking out the house watching outside to see who was going by and if anybody would look suspicious or come up on the he basically became the most paranoid man alive exactly he really did in the I didn't see I did not watch the series I watched the first episode one of the things I thought they did well was like pretty much everyone was a suspect as you start digging into this story everyone is a suspect the broadest family is a supect the the neighbors with the the adult sons that are a little on the not neurotypical side they were suspects the there was a couple that had been interested in buying the house that bought a house like just a few streets over they were suspect um they ended up actually buying the house from the broadis later but we'll get to that oh the real estate agent was a suspect pretty much everybody was a suspect did they ever hire like a psychic I don't know if they went to a psychic or not I do know they did hire a priest to Come Bless the house um so they did have their priest Come Bless it they also got a new alarm system installed on the home Derek even posted like on Craigslist or something looking for um people to come guard the house with military experience and he wanted them to do just exercise in the backyard to kind of give the impression that there were military type people there at all times he even looked into getting like trained German Shepherds they realized such a man thing right the house was sounding more and more like a prison and less and less like a dream home so they didn't move in they kind of stayed with Maria's parents in Westfield so they're still paying this huge mortgage including the loan they had gotten for all the renovations without living there without living there they hadn't really told anybody about the letters at this time and then in July now that they haven't been staying there they got a third letter from The Watcher oh [ __ ] this letter wanted to know why they had gone and said that the house was missing them and it said 657 Boulevard is turning on me it is coming after me I don't understand why what spell did you cast on it it used to be my friend and now it is my enemy I am in charge of 657 Boulevard it is not in charge of me I will fend off its bad things and wait for it to be become good again it will not punish me I will rise again I will be patient and wait for this to pass and for you to bring the young blood back to me 657 Boulevard needs Young Blood it needs you come back let the young blood play again like I once did let the young blood sleep in 657 Boulevard stop changing it and let it alone like is Young Blood like a new generation or like sacrifices can we at least clear that part up it sounds like an oldfashioned saying like the Next Generation yeah just like young blood you know oh you know you're yeah like the Next Generation but it sounds so creepy like this but it makes it less creepy if that's the intent as opposed to like young blood you but that is one of the things that uh when they had a forensic analysis done on the letters there was a few things that pointed to an older person and using the phrase Young blood was one of them it was also it was in the verbage yeah right it was also double spaced after each period which is something only older people who learned on a typewriter would do and some of the phraseology that was used was also kind of indicated an older person so between that and the DNA on the envelope they're pretty sure they were looking for an older woman possibly someone who was interested in the house or someone who felt they had a connection to the house or just someone kind of calling a prank but they didn't know and the bruses were getting more and more nervous so after the third letter they definitely don't go back to the house in the town the rumors were kind of flying and everyone had started to hear about this I would totally live there so in February of 2015 they decide to sell it because they can't live there they can't make the payments on it they're just too creeped out so they're going to try and sell it they they list it for 1.5 million which is a little more than they bought it for because they said they put over $100,000 of Renovations into it however the first time they showed it the realtor called them back and asked them about the letters because they said that the potential buyers had heard some Rumors in town and there was all sorts of crazy rumors going on and they just wanted to clear it up and wanted to know exactly what was happening so the bruses decided to mention the letters and they told them what was going on bad move however anyone that learned about the letters backed out and was not interested so they lowered the price to 1.39 million and people continue to be scared off by these letters May 14th 2015 house is still on the market they lower it again to 1.25 million in June of 2015 they filed a lawsuit against the Woods's saying that they knew about these letters and that they should have disclosed the letters before the sale in the lawsuit they seek a full refund of the 1.3 million they paid for the house money for the renovation expenses attorney fees and triple damages along with the title to the house so they want to be refunded get all their damages refunded their loan refunded and keep the title to the house too AR they cake and eat it too I guess that part seems very odd to me so they try to seal the documents but unfortunately news of this has gotten out to the press and these letters have leaked to the press and now there's stories going on about this house and in July of 2015 the Westfield leader publishes an article with Anonymous quotes from their neighbors and the neighbors are saying they don't think any Renovations actually took place and they feel that the brises did these letters themselves Dereck and Maria decide to buy another house in Westfield and they get a loan and buy it privately using an LLC I believe so they don't have to disclose where they bought this house because there's so much rumors and so much stuff going on now in town about this house they want to hide they want to hide so the house is rented to a couple with adult children and several large dogs who are who say are not afraid of The Watcher and in February of 2017 a fourth letter arrives and it was coincidentally possibly uh dated February 13th which was the same date that the broad were in court giving a deposition against the Woods's and that letter it says to the vile ins spiteful Derek and his wench of a wife Maria you wonder who the Watcher is turn around idiots maybe you even spoke to me one of the so-called neighbors who has no idea who the Watcher could be or maybe you do know and are too scared to tell anyone good move that's weird right the couple also decided at one point they decided to solve their problems they would tear down the house subdivide the property into two properties and build two new houses on it oh because the property was 3 Ines Too Short they had to get special permission from the town so they took the town to court in order to get this special permission and they were denied so this fourth letter that went to the renters mentions that and taunted them about this proposal being rejected I guess the Watcher was kind of pissed off at the whole idea that they were going to subdivide the property and kind of suggested that they wanted to harm the family oh that's illeg that's where it gets illegal the br's lawsuit against the Woods's gets thrown out and lose their bid to subdivide the property as well in December of 2017 several Neighbors in the area all got handwritten personally delivered so like not post stamped or anything letters signed Friends of the broadest family basically they were delivered to people who had been vocally against the the bruses subdividing the property those letters were traced back to Derek brus he did that oh yeah so in 2018 the story kind of blows up online and people are hearing about the Watcher all over and in December of 2018 is when the the broad uses signed the contract with Netflix reportedly they only made enough money to cover how much they lost on the house because they did end up selling the house that's what they all say they sold the house in July of 2019 to the car family Andrew and Alison car for $959,000 oh wow and reportedly they only made about half a million dollars from the Netflix deal yeah right so super creepy though right I mean who's the Watcher it is super creepy it is super creepy but you would think that somebody whether it's some local yolal police guy or private investigator with a bug up his butt somebody would have looked into this and nobody has how come nobody has well they did hire um Derek reached out to a former FBI agent that he actually had been on the High School Board of Trustees with so he knew him on a personal level and this FBI a former FBI agent's name was Robert Lenahan who happened to be the inspiration for the character of kice Starling in the Silence of the L O So this FBI agent tried to use the letters and did kind of like profiling to conduct a threat assessment uh and he's the one who said that the way that the the letters were addressed to like mm for Mr and Mrs bradus made it look elderly or that's right the way it was signed some of the the double spacing a few of the things he determined that it was an older person that did it he also felt that the writer would not probably act on the threats made in the letters but it they definitely somehow had a way to view into the home they could see this back porch that could only be seen from certain angles and they heard the names of the children even the nicknames of the children they knew the layout of the house you know so they were familiar with it and obviously had to be somewhat close but he didn't feel that anyone was going to hurt him so there were investigations that were done but nobody could find it the closest they got was that little bit of DNA showing that it was a woman they hired private investigators but hey the new owners say they have not gotten any letters there are some theories that say that maybe the new owners did it because they did buy a house shortly after the brises bought 657 Boulevard very near it and then they were one of the first people when the price dropped to get it yeah right some people say that maybe they had wanted to buy the house didn't win it and so figured out a way to get it right went on an Amityville type campaign to lower the price and and get but it doesn't really make sense they would have had to wait years I mean that seems kind of silly and the woods has said that there were a couple other biders on the house but they backed out for perfectly explainable reasons like one of them I believe was a health issue and and one was they just couldn't get the financing so there was no jilted homeowner or anything like that the bruses were ruled out their DNA didn't match there are some suspicious things that made people kind of think it could have been the brises they did have I believe 12 mortgages in the space of 10 years holy [ __ ] and they traced the letters to the neighbers back to them that's exactly right so he kind of did do something similar but he did admit to that part of it and like what would the point be I mean if they were in the habit of buying properties and kind of like flipping them to get a better property some people think maybe they saw this 657 Boulevard as a way to maybe their whole plan had been to get a reason to tear down the house and then build two houses and sell them each for a million and maybe make money that way or get a Netflix movie contract they didn't make a lot from the Netflix movie contract and they lost a lot on the house so it doesn't really make sense that it would like why if it was the bruses why what would the point be you know the Amityville people did it to get out of their mortgage but the bruses just could have sold it and they would have sold it if it weren't for the letters so it doesn't make sense that they would have written the letters to themselves so I don't know it just seems like a very creepy unsolved mystery what do you think you just sound over it I is this another Amityville to you are you having Amityville flashbacks of like you wanted it to be creepier and it just turned out to be the family all along I just feel like like somebody should have been able to trace it by now that's that's why it was a ghost because they haven't been able to trace it it's some sort of Supernatural Watcher people otherwise they would have been able to find him that's my theory yeah but he talked about his dad dying and now it was his turn his Supernatural dad and his Supernatural Grand they're The Watcher people and they just watch this house it could be it could be it could happen we'll never know we won't so that's the story I stole from the East Coast The Watcher house definitely creepy and my personal opinion is it's absolutely some sort of crypted some sort of ghost people or polter okay polter guys it's something it's something creepy I mean I'm totally buying that three generations plus of Watchers have been watching this house I did find when it was built back in the early 1900s it changed hands for $1 three different times oh wow right weird so I'm saying that there is some sort of generational Mystic type entity family that is in charge of watching this house that's my theory well we'll see how it plays out on Netflix I now I'll have to watch the Netflix thing and see how that comes out I did love how they made everybody suspect because really everybody kind of is at this point and they really actually had good characters that made kind of crazy neighbors it was a good show oh fun yeah I I like the everyone kind of you know the whole Twin Peaks theme where everyone is a suspect everyone did it everyone did it they've all got secrets that the Watcher knows it's kind of funny that you did like your pumpkin crypted guy and some weird entity thing right I'm going to Bluefield West Virginia have you ever heard Bluefield West Virginia I never have okay have you ever heard of the lake shaie abandoned amusement park because I want to go there no now I am super intrigued and I want to go there that sounds so spooky think of a full-blown amusement park that people just walked away from all the rides are there they're all rusted they're all overgrown they just left it [ __ ] just left oh that's I love pictures of abandoned places like that they are so so Eerie now we'll we'll we'll just jump right into the the depths of it why did they abandon it is it haunted was there a monster there is it crypted did a murder happen there tell me shelle lots of stuff happened there really oh I'm so excited okay lot a bad stuff oh well that's not exciting so a lot of people in Mercer County think that basically the land was cursed before they even started using it oh really so before it even became why would you build a carnival on top of cursed land don't people watch movies do don't they go to the movies well this was before movies oh okay so I mean obviously there's I I'll get to the prehistory of it but some of Lake shaunie's issues began in the late 1700s oh wow that far back it actually a little further but we aren't jumping into that quite yet so late 1700s a man by the name of Mitchell clay uh brought his family out west this is when people were going out west getting dentary right so he established him and his family an 800 Acre Farm and he raised 14 children on it holy whoa that's a scary story right there 14 kids God two frightening two is plenty I only got two arms and two eyes here people 14 14 people 800 acres and they didn't even do that for a TV show check out this [ __ ] so in 1783 a Native American tribe slew two of the children while Mitchell was out hunting did he even know that they were gone they kidnapped one of the boys named Ezekiel and they burned him at the stake oh poor Ezekiel those poor kids so clay clay decided to retaliate Mitchell clay retaliated with the help of other settlers because these were new settlers he had tracked down several Native Americans and killed them obviously as you can imagine that Homestead was never the same yeah three kids killed one burned alive and then you know in retaliation other people are killed yeah that's it's bad you don't hear much about the land and nothing's really going on with that 800 acres that's like what what I say 1783 so fast forward all of the sudden in 1920 a man named snid I smoke too much weed for that name what's the how do I always come up with the names that are like [ __ ] up what is it again snid so he shows up and he's got rides and attractions he's got circular swings a water slide creates a dance hul a Speak Easy it's s's circus yeah he added a pond a swimming hole and like canoes the whole got money yeah but at some point things went arai oh no poor snto a little girl died on the swings a boy drowned in the pond oh [ __ ] in all roughly six visitors died dur oh wow yep during the amusement park probably no safety features back in the day nah and snid probably didn't give a [ __ ] no in 1966 it was abandoned wow like just walked away so all of the beautifully colored rides all of the shiny [ __ ] just started to slug away into the Shadows to avoid getting lynched or sued for all the people that died there well then snid the circus dude is Sleazy and then come to find out 20 years after that so that would have been like roughly stayed abandoned for two decades another two decades yep so it seemed like it have stayed abandoned for 200 years and then gets abandoned for another 20 so like mid 80s so in the mid 80s a man named Gaylord white thought that he'd take this little sleepy Meadow and make it into a neighborhood okay are any of the old swings and things still there all of it okay every bit of it all broken down Ferris wheel the whole broken down Rusty crappy and deadly and like like Vines and [ __ ] growing probably looked cool but not functional so Gaylord white brings in his construction crew and they start digging and they start oh no yeah they start unearthing bones now not only are they disturbing a site where children were killed Back in the Day Native Americans were killed in retaliation six people died in the recent decades now they're gonna go and [ __ ] around and dig there and they found bones Unearthed bones and Native American artifacts so that's gonna rile up some energy right there interesting fact the amusement park long story short was built on an ancient burial ground and most of the skeletons belong to Children of a children's burial ground great great children's yeah a children's native burial and kids were killed there settler kids were killed there on top of this native burial ground now archaeologists archaeologists do believe that that the remains were there long before the settlers so they do believe Amic the settlers settled on top of this children's burial ground and then their children were killed so the question is is they think that the clay family was cursed for going there I think so too and then somebody would be drawn what kind of sick bastard would be drawn to this cursed area full of dead kids that would then build a kid attracted there like a well what happened was this white guy decided he was like I ain't gonna mess with that [ __ ] and he just left it and walked away rides intact the whole thing so the rides are still there everything is there they actually do a tour in October called the dark carnival oh no [ __ ] who owns it now I believe it's the county if I'm not mistaken so they do like a so they play up on the fact that it's haunted they do they do and has lots of bodies and a and a very scary shitty history and it's like sounds spooky you have to like make an appointment you know it's like an appointment only thing but they think that basically like you said you know you've got you've got this Native American barrial ground that was kind of earmarked for children which that was a practice that they had and then you have an amusement part or no then you have a family on there where natives were killed children were killed children were killed violently right so you've got a burial ground of children then children killed violently then people killed in retaliation for that right and so as you can imagine there's um apparitions of children they're hearing playing they're hearing screaming children they're hearing what sounds like Ezekiel burning at the stake I mean all the things you'd think you'd hear you'd hear that sounds awful you know shadow people um people hear Native American drumming you know the whole everything that you would think that you'd experience on this land you experience on this land why would they I don't know is it best to leave it take down the rides like I don't even know what you would do like do you just leave it I don't know I don't know I think from what we've found in the other stories that we've come across is that anything they do is going to rile up the ghost I mean if you take it down they're going to get Disturbed if you renovate it they're going to get Disturbed I mean anything that happens there is going to kind of but the theme Here is is that children seem to be the target here notice I didn't say any of these adults died right you know children died at the amusement park the original owner clay it was his children that were taken by the Indians there's something that's not good for kids there so of course they build a [ __ ] amusement park right what made that guy build an amusement park there the energy had to be off the charts bad but what would have drawn him to build an amusement park that's specifically made for children he had to have felt something did he do it on purpose but it's bad enough that no one will touch it still you know like one of those don't ask don't tell places right right wow I can't believe it stayed open long enough for six children to die I mean after the first one you'd think two yeah but you got to figure you know back in the 20s and the 30s and the 40s like like you said you know there want no safety [ __ ] their the care and concern wasn't necessary necessarily the same as what we do today right right that's true very true I mean just remember you and I were kids that grew up with no car seats or seat belts right safety measures what were those so this is like a very tainted land like I said it seems to be targeted to kids in my opinion I just think the eeriness of having the amusement park stuff still there like I think this place to be area to begin with but you add that stuff holy crap creepe Factor 11 there have been folks that have have gone there that weren't able to stay more than an hour because they said that the screaming crying children that they heard just was so overwhelming and didn't it was just nonstop oh I want to go I know right I want to take the Ouija boards and go you know other than other than the actual kid related noises the only other things people hear is like native drumming everything else is either playing or crying or or Screaming that is definitely child like apparitions seem to be mostly kids there's been apparitions of uh someone thought they saw like a native circle like a a group of Native Americans in like a tribal Circle I'm kind of sad that with this much Native American activity and that it was possibly a a native burial ground that that this this hasn't been given back to any tribes in the area or anyone who might have ancestral claim to it I'm I'm a little sad that they haven't been allowed to have it back because if anybody could take care of it and put those Spirits you know kind of to rest and to to rededicate that land I would think it would be the people whose ancestors are buried there you know what's unfortunate though what's that um we live in a day and age where if you put those spirits to rest that's no longer a money maker good point good point capitalism and uh GH set his finest so it definitely is a place to check out sad creepy sad it's it's got a lot of got a lot of layers to it yeah for sure what an unfortunate history I I think that that it's definitely one of those places that's just just not good bad stuff happened there and then bad stuff kept happening there stuff like it you know where you take like cherished childhood things and then turn them evil and creepy that just scares the [ __ ] out of me that and that's what this place is exactly I I'd love to go there and take pictures just because of that creep factor I mean that's super scary imagine the type of atmosphere that it has I bet when you walk onto that property even if you're trying to be respectful of the graves that were there before all this happened I I imagine it's still going to just be so so spooky and so creepy and I I bet there's so many experiences there the the orb photos would probably be phenomenal when you see the pictures online I mean just looking at it you just get that Vibe I believe it oh I'll have to look up some of the pictures because I love pictures of abandoned places especially abandoned places that have paranormal activity attached to them they do kind of have a Vibe right when you look at them they do we have to see if we can find find some and put them on the Instagram see how creepy they are and I mean there's nothing like a a a ferris wheel that's got overgrown Vines growing up right oh my gosh and swings that are kind of like gently moving on their own well and that's the other thing you know they they do see things like the swing is moving and um I can't think of what it's called like a merry ground around thing will start moving around on its own oh no way if that like Carousel music starts coming I am out I am so gone are still balls all over the place and balls will start moving um like I said it's all very like childlike activity sounds like it that would definitely be a creep tacular place to go very very interesting to go explore I I totally want to explore it however conversely do not go to 657 Boulevard please stop apparently once the Netflix show started people started going to this house and trying to take pictures at it trying to go on the property just leave the people alone if there's a watcher there maybe they need privacy to deliver another letter I don't know but stop going but yeah you actually can go visit the amusement park at Lake shaie you do have to make an appointment it's not like you can just go there it is private well we are adding that to our round the country bucket list putting that for when we're hopping in the schoolie to do our round the trip tour we will make an and we'll go for sure so I think those are our stories for tonight I think
