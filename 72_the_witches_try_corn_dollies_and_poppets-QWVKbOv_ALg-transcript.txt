welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hey there witches welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and in this episode we are doing another try it project this time we're trying a llamas craft we're doing corn dollies this week llamas or lunasa is August 1st we'll go over a little bit of our confusion and what we got wrong in the beginning as well as ways to make a corn dolly for yourself for your alter as a spell or to celebrate lunasa how you doing there shell hey you know I'm glad to be here and I'm confused about corn dolles but here we are yeah I think there was definitely some confusion at least on my part because we're both from upstate New York we both still live in the northeast of the USA you don't get that kind of corn until like September man right we have like the knee high by the Fourth of July but I can tell you that some of the farm stands and definitely the grocery stores have corn available so if you wanted to make a corn dolly with corn hot you could but we'll get into that and all about the llamas craft of corn dollies some of the history what you can do with it the magic the ritual the spells all that good stuff here in just a moment but first I want to say a huge thank you to star andne Raven Hawk the host the founder of witches Fest USA in New York City that just had their 13th Annual Festival shell and I were down there it was amazing first of all it was blazing hot let's just put that out there it was like 90 something per humidity and I think it was over 100° the feel like was 114 and I felt every of every single one of those 114 degrees oh yeah shade was at a premium everyone was Dripping with sweat but there was a lot of smiles and a lot of fun and a lot of witches it was very cool but who else was what else was there of actually we had a very cool moment what we find there we're sitting in the shade sweating our balls off honestly smok and weed not going to lie waiting for our workshops to come up and all these people are walking by there's music playing and yes we were indulging in a little bit of the smoke which is probably how she recognized us at first to be honest but this gorgeous witch goes walking by and stopped turns around looks at us and says are youa and shell from back on the broomstick and we were like well yeah yes we are I thought she had just read our Workshop descriptions yeah but no she didn't even know we were going to be there she is a fan hi Terry hello again made my day absolutely made my day how fun was that no she was freaking fabulous and by the way I just want to apologize to her if I if I seemed a little off in my workshop it was because I was sweating my body weight out okay yeah it was definitely a hot day and all we had were these little easy ups but it was very cool to see Terry and you also had another fan of ours in your Workshop so at least two people who are back on the broomstick fans we had a wonderful time and it was very cool seeing people so thank you for stopping by to say hello and thank you for braving the heat with us too oh yeah lot of people I guess it was the best attended in years we had a great time thank you star I thought it was freaking fabulous it really was I don't know if she listens to the podcast but the harpus Michelle Mountain played one of my favorite song s savage daughter I'll put a link to it in the show notes but I love that song she was freaking fabulous The Bu dancers were great it was a good day in New York City it was a good day for the witches to together and then of course came back home to my beautiful spot in the Wilds of central Pennsylvania and we had a try it to do you know we haven't done a try it in a long time and I was like hey let's do something fun and crafty so I know you I know that you kind of started off with the corn dolly thing but we did want to kind of Encompass all types of poppets and because of my I don't know I'm from New York I don't even look for dried corn leaves until like September it's a thing so I went the poppet route ah well before you go there let me kind of explain something because I didn't know this until I started looking I thought corn dolly like the corn husk doll have a kitchen witch corn husk doll that's 25 plus years old that I got as a house blessing made out of corn husk right yes yes she follows me from house to house however while I was researching this craft because I've never made one before I found out that in pre-colonial days back in Ireland and Europe corn was just another word for grain it meant any type of grain so oats barley rye wheat those were all corn because it was pretty much just another word for grain and then when they came here to the Americas and they were introduced to ma they called it Indian corn because it was a grain that the Native Americans introduced them to then we just dropped the Indian part and kept it as corn so that's why when we Americans say corn we're thinking of Maze and it used to mean any type of grain I gota I Goa so the llamas craft of corn dollies because llamas is the first harvest all around me I live in the middle of farm country basically and most of the farmers around me use horses and not engines to do their work you know the first haying has already happened and now I'm seeing the big straw bales get picked up the little farm stands outside of everybody's house are being filled more and more this is the first fruits Harvest and so where corn dollies came from was a way to honor those first fruits when they would Harvest their corn which would be like wheat or grain or whatever they would take some sheaths of the wheat and they would braid it into a a vague representation of a figure so it's just kind of like a four or five they can be very elaborate but it's just kind of like a braid has a round top and then the sheaths are down at the bottom I'll show lots of pictures it's hard to talk about but this representation was to hold the spirit of the Grain and so the first person to harvest the crops around llamas would braid a corn dolly and then would toss it into their neighbors's field who hadn't yet harvested their crops as a way to kind of like bring that blessing of harvest to them and then once they harvested their crops they would drop that corn dolly off at the next farmers who hadn't and so on and so on until the last person was left with the corn dolly and they would keep it safe all winter to hold on to that Spirit of the crops the the goddess of the Grain and keep her soul in that corn dolly and then they would either burn it or bury it to bring um fruitfulness back to their crops so that's why it's called a corn dolly but you really make it out of grass or wheat or oat or straw nice I was looking for actual corn but here's why because I did take the poppet route I decided to make a poppet really because I thought that a corn Del was that a poppet is you know you can do a couple different things spell wise with but essentially it is kind of a doll made to represent a person if you are looking to do some magic aimed at that person good better and different not for me to judge so I think in the old days they used to find them lodged in the walls and in chimneys when you came visited me one time in Salem and we went to the witch house didn't they have one that they had found like shoved in a wall or something they did they have one at the Salem witch house I think we both have pictures of the poppet and glass and I believe when we were doing our other podcast and we were actually searching Salem for any signs of hauntings in these it was that poet was one of them that poppet was one of the few things that we felt something emanating from what people back then in the 1600s and even prior to that used to do is it was a relatively common folk practice for people to create a doll and put it in the walls of their house and hide it there and the idea was that anything malevolent or bad being being sent at the house would go to that puppet and would be distracted by the puppet and so the puppet would take all the curses or negativity aimed at your household so it was a protection thing a good luck thing but like I said you can also make them to represent a person to essentially either cast a spell on them or Aid them in some way and these are actually not just made of corn actually this is so funny and I'm going to post pictures you know you can use a lot of different things um as popet and I have got a couple good examples here that I find very crafty and yet useful for what you get I actually have about a 6in tall baby doll okay yeah and that is actually something this is something I bought for a poppet type thing for this but I can use this for that kind of house protection or or like what you were just talking about now if I was going to do something say I wanted to either cast a spell on someone or Aid someone in some way one type of Papa I like to make because we've all seen the one that's like shaped like a gingerbread man filled with herbs and sewn together that's super common but I used we used to make these as kids I don't know if that's creepy or if that's cool but yarn dolls basically what it is and I I have pictures of the process that I'll post up you know you cut some y YN you kind of fold it in half tie off a head and then do the arm thing so it looks like you have like a person a poppet can be made out of anything you can mold it out of clay you can make it out of yarn ceral lavender I have one that I made out of once I got tired of making the braided traditional corn dollies I tried to make a corn dolly out of the lavender and flowers I have here so I'll I'll post that up but anything that you can make look vaguely humanoid can be your poppet you can even use carved wood you know and that's that's where I've seen like actual corn dollies where they take the dried corn husks and uh shape it into a person so that's what I thought I was going for and couldn't find it and we ended up with the yarn dollies you know this is this creates like a representation of a person puppets are a form of sympathetic magic you know again whatever your purpose is you can use that for a love puppet you can have a a healing puppet a protection puppet um a Prosperity puppet whatever whatever your intent is but it it is it's it doesn't have to be corn is I guess my biggest Point yes if you're talking about a corn dolly that's a specific thing to hold the spirit of the Grain and we're I'll go over some different spells and different ways that you can use that for llamas a little later in the episode but it basically is a poppet I look at a corn dolly as a poppet with a specific purpose the corn dolly is more to represent the first harvest of the season and hold the goddess of the grain that particular purpose and poppets can be any purpose you want them to but I love my little yarn doll like it for some reason it looks like some Crone witch or it does it does what materials you choose can help aid you in your spell so shell chose black yarn so that could be for something for protection for banishment um maybe it's so someone could be more witchy because it kind of looks witchy whereas the baby the baby doll I might use more for like a protection or or like a healing type thing because it looks just like a person you can specify you can you know put something on the eyes and say this is so they can see more clearly but it's a form of sympathetic magic which is basically like for like because it looks like a person and you would put things on it to represent that person maybe they have blonde hair so you put blonde yarn on it to represent them the more you can make it like that person the better sympathetic magic will work the more I don't want to say the more effective I don't want more effective but yeah yeah more effective for sure 100% more effective if you write their name on a piece of paper and put it inside popet if you take a piece of their clothing or cloth that they have used and make a dress or a shirt for the poppet things like this are called tag locks basically if you want this spell to Target a specific person you could just make a generic poppet name it that person's name and say that's them and that's fine but the more things you can use to represent that person the more tag locks like hair saliva blood urine skin fingernails their clothing something they've slept in something they've partially eaten all these types of things are TAG locks tie them to that puppet yep the more you can tie them to the puppet the more that puppet magically becomes keyed to them tied to them and the more powerful your spell will be and if use the cloth ones that kind of look like gingerbread men sewn together you can also stuff them with your paper with a name on it or or any of your tag items or also you can stuff it with herbs you know say it's say it's a a healing spell for example you can stuff it with some healing related herbs in there too so there's really a lot you can do with them and you know I think that this actually made me think that this is really the same thing as V DS this is just it is it's just a different culture representing a human form is a very powerful form of magic taking someone's picture drawing them you know these are types of sympathetic magic that can be very powerful so you'll find this across multiple cultures but voodoo dolls are something that's specific to a closed religion so I wouldn't do a voodoo doll one thing I have done speaking of pictures that you mentioned I have actually taken a picture of someone and just cut out their face and fixed it to my poppet so that my poppet actually had that person's space on that person's face yeah draw their face or write their name on a piece of paper and stick it where maybe the face would be you could cut a paper doll out of paper maybe out of your favorite magazine or maybe out of a piece of paper that's your favorite color or their favorite color and then dress it like you would a paper doll but there's all sorts of things that you could do to represent this person anoint it with oils incense smoke you know what I found in doing this project what's that a very cheap way to make those types of poppets that you can kind of stitch together and fill did you know Shameless plug at Walmart you can buy two yards of fabric for $4 and you can pick any I happen to get like a black and white um stripe pattern but you can get any type of fabric and literally just draw a shape like a gingerbread man essentially the best analogy I can use cut the two pieces stuff that sucker and sew it up or for maybe someone that was a good friend that maybe stabbed you in the back and turned into a complete and total terrible awful person maybe they gave you one of their shirts that had been their favorite shirt for a long time it's possible it could happen I'm not talking about anyone in particular this is a hypothetical we would never do this but take that shirt and make a popet out of that stuff it with the rest of the shirt which you may or may not have ripped into teeny tiny little shreds in anger and then stuffed it into the poppet you know that could possibly be a very powerful way to create a little doll nothing nothing we've ever done before just something we read on news I'm sure I read that somewhere I'm pretty sure I read read about that somewhere has nothing to do with anyone we both mutually know anyway the closer you can get this doll this poppet to represent the person the more things you can get from them the more powerful and more connected more effective it's G to be that's right should you cast Magic on someone without their permission probably not I ain't judging that's a youth thing do what you feel needs to be done but these can be done for good or for ill it does not have to be banful magic and it doesn't have to be for someone else it can be for you for yourself yeah one of our mutually favorite witches Irene glass uh has an article about poppets for for the holidays actually to help you get through the holidays make a poppet for yourself that represents you and fill it with herbs for calmness relaxation self-love uh standing up for yourself boundaries strength whatever you happen to need to get through the holidays you know she talks about making a puppet to help yourself and all the things we were just talking about making a puppet for someone else you can apply to yourself use your own hair your own saliva your own blood your own fingernails your own clothes and make a popet to represent you and put good things into it or use that as a charm to help you through a certain situation and just like I said that you could pick different like herbs associated with what your intent is same with your colors you know if you're doing something healing it could be like yellow or orange um you know you could do pink or red For Love or silver gold or green for money you know whatever your intent is you could have you know if you're making one of those fabric puppets or or the yarn the little yarn Dolly um you can have the colors represent that type of magic you're trying you're trying to create as well as the herbs the whole purpose of these is to hold your intention and you can make the creation of this poppet part of your spell or part of your ritual so you would gather all your materials together and you would create this Poppet in ritual space you could make the creation of it part of your spell work and like that baby doll I got to use as a poppet again like you were saying uh earlier um I was going to draw some symbols on it I was going to draw on the clothing on it I might actually take the outfit off and create a dress out of material for it to to kind of customize the doll more so even if it's something like that that you've purchased you can even still customize to reflect what you're working and I highly recommend that you do this is one of those types of magic that you can't really just buy a puppet I know I was just thinking that in my head there's so many stores here in Salem where you can just go buy them don't you can I mean sure buy a doll buy a poppet but if you just do that and then don't do anything else and be like here's a puppet you I hope you lose your job it's just not going to work I bought this online damn it why isn't it working right this is a type of folk magic this is a get your hands dirty get in and do it kind of magic if you do buy a doll you best be like shell said putting symbols on there writing sigils putting oil on there changing the clothes changing the color hair you really need to dirty not to mention also prior to doing all of that cleanse it of like I got this thing at wal or maybe Target Target or Walmart you know cleanse it of the Walmart Target and energ and then do all of those things yes yeah absolutely you got to go with what works for you but I really think that for me I I know you like to to weave the weeds that's a that's a good thing a good phrase that is a good thing I love that I'm a weed Weaver like to weave the weeds I do I like the little yarn Dolly I do love it the yarn dolly is great that goes along with my weed weaving so I'm going to show you a bunch of my little dollies I love those and I know they don't look like a doll but what it is is not magic essentially yeah and so what I found while I was learning about these is that okay so they're traditionally made for llamas and corn the corn part of corn do can mean any type of grain it doesn't have to be the corn husk Dolly what we think of is corn yeah again these were made to embody the spirit of the Goddess the Earth goddess the the harvest goddess the grain goddess while I was making these I found that yes they're a beautiful craft for the first harvest this lunasa coming up to honor the god Lou and but while you're making these the easiest ones are basically a four strand boond doggle if you've ever done you ever done boond doggle you know actually as a kid in summer camp with plastic strings we would make necklaces out of boond Doling so I found a tutorial online and basically these traditional corn dollies are a four strand boond doggle it's not that hard to do and as you get into it it gets to be very rhythmic it actually gets it's almost I hate to I hate to use one of your favorite things but it's almost meditative it's very meditative I love it so much you did as you do it it's like any type of knitting or weaving or Doling braiding it's very meditative and very conducive to not magic so after I made a couple and got the hang of it I decided to get very fancy and here's this one that actually looks like a little doll I made this one look like a little person and decorated it with flowers crafty right but I started making them into spells so as I was doing this I was thinking about llamas and the first harvest and the things that I want to harvest I was thinking about lunasa I was thinking about the Sun and growth and so I was weaving that into each of these knots as I made the dolly and then you make a circle to the head and you can think about fullness and the the completion of your spell as you tie these together let it dry keep it on your altar to remind you of that spell or toss it in a fire or bury it like people would traditionally do it makes a phenomenal spell you don't have to just braid it and be like Yay lunasa you can make it into a spell for abundance for health for happiness for love for whatever it's freaking not magic now essentially we we decided uh to to do this and you know you understood the assignment and I again took it with a left turn and when a total pop it down the road different way I'm still related but I found the same I was thinking about the same thing as I was making my yarn Dolly because you are doing not magic when you're tying off the head and when you're tying off the arms and now with this it's it's kind of not necessarily so much a a llama specific thing and in this particular case unknowingly I was thinking about a person when I was making this that'll be a different conversation on a different you know it's basically all of those same things except this wasn't llamas you know like your quote unquote spell was llamas related and my quote unquote spell was more person specific yeah I guess mine kind of veered more into an abundance spell but that yeah you understood the assignment and I took a left turn it's okay we were going to poppets anyway so you're right on track I just couldn't find corn is where this all started yeah and that's what really surprised me like I said is I was also thinking corn you know the big ears of delicious sweet corn that we love up here yeah no corn is any kind of grain maybe because I've seen a corn husk Dolly multiple times maybe that's why when I heard corn dolly I was like oh my God I can make that but there's no freaking corn yeah and making a corn dolly or um you can buy raia or you can also buy if you ever make tamali I don't know if you like to cook tamali or not but you can buy dried corn husks right in the you know right at your grocery store if they have a section for that I wouldn't even know where to look for that I wouldn't even know where to look for that usually in the Mexican food section you can usually find it right there because tamali you need those dried corn husks to make those yum yum tamales my local Whole Foods guy is going to think that I'm making tamali when I'm really making corn dollies hey that works what they don't know won't hurt them the braining one the boond doggle corn dolly is very very easy and simple making a corn husk dolly is a little more involved but that can still be turned into a spell or ritual for lunasa or for some other thing you know for a regular spell like shell said this could just be a puppet at any time of year it doesn't have to be for lunasa see and that's why I like the yarn dollies because let's say have a couple of intents with your little poppet doll and you have a couple different workings you can use different colored Yarns to make the one Dolly right maybe you're doing something for your friend and they asked for you know heart healing they asked for inspiration you know maybe they ask for new Love and so you put all those the lottery numbers don't forget the lottery numbers oh chaos magic if only you would come through for me on that one but you can just add all those different things you can put oil on the yarn you can tie it off with different threads the other thing you can do with poppets is you can almost turn it into your own what the hell am I trying to say representation of your deity that you particularly work with you know maybe you can't afford one of those kickass like $200 statues of Athena don't worry cuz neither can I and but you want something to represent the deity that that you are drawn to you know let's say I didn't have a representation of hiate I could make a little corn dolly let's say I could take little keys I could tie keys to some of the strands of yarn you know how they have those Pandora charms I could get a little Pandora charm of a dog and I could turn it into my own personal hellhound and have it tied down like by where her feet would be like you know like you can you could if you would like because you know witchcraft doesn't have to cost you cash here folks you could make a representation of deity out of one of these dollies as well and kind of I don't want to say use that to direct it to but kind of use that when you're directing your appreciation or you know you're giving your thanks or or what have you especially Harvest goddesses I mean Deer uh pranie I guess isn't exactly a harvest goddess but it could work for her too but if you worship series um Lakshmi and um and CIF are all goddesses of harvest and of grain pick a harvest goddess and make your corn dolly or your poppet represent her that would be a great called Poor Man's witchcraft Man Poor Man's witchcraft we love that's right got to do what you got to do gotta do what you got to do and and this is so that's why I think that poppets and dollies are very versatile maybe because this isn't something that's you know should be cost in your bundles and if you need to make a hcat out of some black yarn rock on with a damn bad self yeah use your scrap yarn use your scrap cloth you can make poppets out of anything and the corn dollies that I made to represent lunasa and the corn dollies that I made just as not magic spells I just got Tall Grass out of my back field or lavender the other ones I made I got lavender out of my garden and some flowers out of my yard so it doesn't have to be you go bu you can just get stuff out side and use that or like shell did scraps I'd just like to point out to all of our listeners Lea does all these things with outside scraps which is wonderful and crafty and very Pagan of her but I'm allergic to everything on the planet and the minute I go cut in that grass I can't breathe and my eyes are watering and everything itches yep and both of those work I love your yarn Dolly I really like the versatility of that yarn Dolly maybe you live in the city maybe you're a city witch or you know like shell maybe you are allergic to anything green and you can't go outside you know and that was kind of interesting because I was thinking about things like that when we were down in New York City this past weekend and you know there isn't the option to just go cut some grass and do that so you gotta you got to use what you can work with man and as long as it's in the shape somewhat of another of a human go for it I mean I would even go so far as if you had to actually make dough use a cookie cutter in the shape of a gingerbread man and cut that out and use that do it what better way to do say a self motivation spell then to mix up some fabulous cookies and you know as you're adding your cinnamon you know make sure that that's for that get up and go when you're adding your brown sugar that's you know to sweeten your heart to yourself and as you're making these cookies and turn it into a gingerbread man or a cookie man or a poppet man now you added these Spell components to it and turned the whole process into a spell and then you eat that cookie after you bake it that's internalizing those ideas that's internalizing that spell energy just like if you're harvesting your cannabis and you roll have you ever seen those joints shell where they have like the little arms it's like a three-headed joint so you can do that now you've got a little joint poppet I don't care how you make your puppet there's all sorts of ways to do that and it can be to honor the season it can be to honor yourself it can be to do a spell or someone just pissed you off or someone pissed you off or you really need that irritating coworker to get a promotion to another department you know there's a lot of different reasons to make puppets or corn dollies or corn dollies I just think it's funny that we totally went left field in opposite directions with this on the the same premise we'll post up some pictures of the different types of corn dollies and poppets that we made so that you can see and we'll post links to different ways to make either a puppet or a braided corn dolly or a corn husk Dolly and uh try it so that you can try that magic yourself this is absolutely a fun summer try it because it's quick it's easy and you can do a lot with it I mean I grabbed four strands of that really tall grass out of my back field and was able to do an amazing not magic spell just like like that the yarn that you got these are not you don't have to think a lot or grab a lot for these spells they can be on the spot here's the spell do that magic and be done be done yeah or you can take longer and make a more elaborate doll out of it I love magic that can be tailored to the situation you know what you need at that time that's kind of more like what the baby doll would be used for because that would involve you know drawing symbols and and you know kind of crafting that to a you know cleansing it initially that would be more of an intense intention um and probably on a a most specific person so really it just depends on what you're doing and and how you want to use it yep and it can be fun I I like to make little crafts so I had a good time making this it was definitely you know really good it's certainly something you could do with kids if you're doing it for the season not necessarily if you're doing it to curse your coworker but if you're doing it to curse your coworker you know this little black yarn Dolly it's a good go-to there you go not that we would do such things you know get some of their clothes just saying so we have lots of great episodes coming up for you over the next couple weeks we have an interview with an author coming up as well as more llamas SL lunasa crafts and more information about the upcoming holiday and things that you can do for solitary practitioners all you witches out there but it is getting to be summertime shell so we are pretty busy witches coming up the next month or so and I I hear someone hint hint Leila Lea has a radio show coming up at a festival so you'll have to you'll have to put the links out there so that all the folks can check out the radio show you'll be a part
