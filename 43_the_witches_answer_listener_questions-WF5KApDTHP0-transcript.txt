join us as we get back on the broomstick welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I'm shell and tonight we are so excited you know I don't know what we love more chatting to each other or

dedicate an episode to responding to your emails and your comments and your questions in your stories you guys are so amazing at sending us emails and I apologize that I am not as good at sending them back so some of you know I'm a little slow because life happens you know life happens and there's a lot to get through and I appr appreciate it don't get me wrong I appreciate it but it might take me a minute to get back to all of you and just so you know she reads them all to me it brightens my day it so we definitely wanted to give back to you guys by reading these and answering some of your questions so that everybody can take advantage of some of the information here because they're pretty awesome so thank you all and uh let's get into some of these emails so let's start with Meg Meg sent us an email which by the way hi Meg how you doing she said she ran a half marathon here in Salem where was I honestly mag I am the least athletic person on the planet I was probably in bed and I was probably only like a mile in a half away from you but I was probably in bed so you didn't see me at the half marathon because I was sleeping if I was downtown I was working and if I wasn't downtown I was probably in bed at the time of day where would run a marathon on a Saturday I've done 5Ks before not very fun and not very fast I definitely have not yet done any marathons and she has questions aside from her little marathon thing she's got questions so we thought what the hell we'll answer them so first of all Meg asks she's talking about our mirror episode I don't remember what number episode that was LE will put it in the show notes now Meg said she has a question about placement of the mirrors we talked about a spell where you put the mirrors face to face and put your written spell in between them so she's wondering if the mirrors are supposed to touch each other or where they're supposed to be placed and where she's supposed to sit well it depends on what you're doing with your mirror my friend she's asking about if you do do them face to face which there's a time and a place which we'll get into that in a second do you want them touching like touching touching face to face me probably not because you know how there's that thing you can do with your hands where you can like play with the ball of energy between your hands but like your hands aren't touching but you can feel it kind of thing same thing if you're doing a face tof face mirror thing you don't want them touching but you want them in the same like energy sphere I think what she's referring to is in that episode we talked about a type of spell where you could write out a spell reversing something back to someone and making their own energy kind of bounce back to them and taking that spell and putting that slip of paper in between two Che mirrors that are facing each other and sealing it that way so it kind of bounces that magic onto that person just kind of bouncing it back and forth for that particular spell this is what I would do I would put that piece of paper on a little string and put that string on a little toothpick and put that toothpick over the top of those two mirrors so almost like it was dangling in between them you know what I'm saying I see what you're saying almost like it's hanging in between the mirrors not that the mirrors are necessarily touching like I said there the same energy sphere but not touching with that paper kind of almost like floating in between them so to say okay people mark your calendars because this is going to be the first time you know I can't even think of any other time where Lila is going to go simpler than shell is nuh uhuh I say take that piece of paper stick it on top of one mirror slap that other mirror right on top of it like a sandwich put it together like an Oreo cookie and just leave it there don't dangle no toothpick and string and who's got time for that here's the thing a lot of the mirrors I use are kind of they're in pretty frames so it's it's difficult to like butt them together that's different you see what I'm saying in that particular spell I believe we talked about going to the dollar store and just getting like one of those cheap ass little mirrors that you can put like on the inside of your locker or something when you were at school just two cheap little mirrors to put it together so that someone's own negativity and their own energy will just repeatedly bounce back to themselves and not get out to you you know I never thought of a locker mirr I can just see little people around having these rubber banded together since we did the mirror episode I've actually seen a lot of people talk about a mirror box spell that's very similar to the idea of you know having the mirrors face each other or me actually just slapping them together facing each other right some people will take a box like a shoe box and line it with aluminum foil I mean you could do actual mirror if you wanted to but mostly I see people do aluminum foil just whatever is reflective and then they put that spell like either a jar spell or written spell inside the box and close it basically what that does is allows the energy to kind of reflect back to that person whatever they send out is going to come right back to them you know I've actually used aluminum foil as a mirror before I'm just saying sometimes you know obviously you want to use a mirror if you can but you know sometimes just don't work out the way you want and and I've learned that since I have moved a few years ago there are less dollar stores in Massachusetts than there were in New York there's no freaking Dollar General here everyone's bougie in Massachusetts I think it's jabl lot oh okay which we're used to Big Lots and it's kind of the same thing but like you know how in New York there's like Dollar General on every street corner there's no freaking Dollar General here I don't get it so yeah tin foil in a pinch as long as it's reflective who gives a whatever works for you exactly and a really fast Return to Sender spell write their name on a slip of paper and just write sit in your own or whatever you want to put on there crumple it up wrap a little bit of aluminum foil around it crush it into a ball and throw it in the garbage and that reflective aluminum foil will just bounce their own negativity back and back to them and keep you protected but when I'm doing some fancy pancy stuff which I do I know two fancy dangling Str dangling string in my I love it no I love it it's great it is well also what I've what I've done before is then at the end of such type spell depending on where I'm going with it it's easy to burn that paper in between the mirrors when it's dangling like that just saying oh that's imag how that fire is reflective in both mirrors just saying just saying so don't be mocking my toothpick hanging paper I'm not mocking you at all now Meg had a couple other questions some practical things like where do you sit while you're doing this spell and honestly Meg there's really no wrong way to do this sit at your kitchen table if you're working with fire you might want to be doing it in your kitchen sink you know safety first so you can be wherever some people have a dedicated space where they do spell work which is really nice some people don't so basically just wherever's comfortable and safe particularly if you're using fire honestly in a pinch I've actually done a spell in a closet before it someone house if we're being real so like whatever works for you man and if you're using a Black Mirror like Meg asks about best way to look in a Black Mirror is kind of not straight on more a little bit sideways I was going to say more a little bit like not sideways per se but like almost not like crossing your eyes but like almost purposefully blurring your vision yeah almost like you're looking at those old 3D prints yeah but I don't like to use a black mirror looking straight on it I like to have the mirror angled or angled away from my face or looking at it not not straight on just angled a little bit away that's what I think works best I just I don't know even if it's just a regular mirror you know if I'm looking at myself to like get ready for work or what have you or or to go out that's one thing but magically I I don't look things straight on like that you never know who's behind you have you ever seen those horror movies where all of a sudden you look straight on in the movie and there's some behind you like I don't want to see that yes we've already established mirrors are a little freaky so I hope that answers your question Meg all right so the next one comes from rean Regan's 44 right around there and they say they've had one foot in the witchy world and one foot in the mundane world since their teens and I really love this email I really wish we all had all feet in the Magical World by the way just putting it out there and we get that a lot rean that that listening to this podcast is like finding your tribe like coming home because there's so many of us that are getting back on the broomstick there's so many people I I've met so many people at the different conferences and festivals that I've been to that this is their first or second year of Witchcraft and they're just loving it and they're experiencing that Rush of coming home of finding your people and really feeling like you belong in such a fundamental way and and I love that we're part of that and I love that we're helping to bring that to people so thank you Regan so much we really appreciate that I just I just also wanted to make a comment um about Regan's email as well that I kind of took it as a little bit more of a there's a lot of people in the sphere of our age group that we were all doing this in the 90s and for one reason or another had to take a step back and for one reason or another we're all getting back into it kind of like not all at the same time but within a realm of the same time frame and can't there be like a Harvard study on this what is up with 40 and 50 somethings all of a sudden getting back on the broomstick why did we get off in the first place all in one Mass Exodus and why are we all seemingly hopping back on in one Mass Exodus like I don't know it's very weird but you know what rean I'm so glad you are a part of getting back on the broomstick with us but I really want a Harvard study on this because I'm curious I am too I really do feel like it's a it's a calling that the world needs her witches as Phyllis kirat says and so absolutely Maybe the world sending out the call and we're all answering I don't know but I am also glad to be part of it so thank you what do we got next who do we got next Leila all right so next we have oh next we have Megan Megan says that they have recently been interested in learning more about Witchcraft and happened upon our podcast and Megan says that we refer to various Pagan Traditions like Celtic Norse Etc and that she doesn't know much about those traditions and didn't realize that various traditions existed in such a differentiated way and also Megan is interested in how Witchcraft and Pagan practices in general are different across the various Traditions before we address all that I I want to address her last question first Megan asks are there any plans to do an episode on this topic and to first and foremost answer that question yes actually we do have that um listed on the calendar I'm not given an exact date at the moment but we we are planning on doing that so definitely stay tuned for more info on this particular topic but in general first of all I am glad that you listened to that episode and we're kind of laying it all out there for you but we didn't even touch on the surface we didn't even touch on the surface of the Traditions out there and we won't be able to answer this question in full like shelle said we do have an episode on it and it will be a big episode we're planning on having a couple guests from different Traditions but it's a big topic just to dozens dozens upon dozens upon dozens and we only had mentioned maybe four or five or six to start out with like the big things that you'll hear are heathenry which is Norse paganism you'll hear paganism which is basically any earth-based beliefs wiah you'll hear wiah which is a more formal religion that has set rules and guidelines and that goes back to Gerald Gardner there's alexandrian Wiccan there's Garian Wiccan Alexander Crawley went off of that so there's a not not to interrupt you but I just think that that's a whole another point in and of itself wiah has its own different branches of tradition aside from the Pagan Traditions like there's so many branches and so many different it's just a lot it's there's a lot there's a lot there's Celtic traditionalist there's Welsh Egyptian Egyptian there's Druids and druidry the Andre feain there's the Golden Dawn there's so many different types of wiah and Witchcraft and again those are typically more formal religions and so they'll have their own rules then there is witchcraft which is a much much bigger umbrella and you can be Wiccan and be a witch Pagan and be a witch Heathen and be a witch Christian and be a witch you can I don't love it I didn't I didn't ask if you loved it I'm just telling you you can I know yes you can whether I like it or not we've had a couple friends including um a past coven member um that was a Jewish witch so yeah like you can be any kind of witch different umbrella different umbrella witchcraft is more of a belief system that has a few General similarities but one Witch is going to be very different from another witch because it is a growing learning changing belief system that has at its core a belief that we are all deity we are all Divine we are all part of this thing maybe not necessarily deity or Divine we are all part of this thing that is life this Energy System together and that all of that is sacred in whatever way you see sacredness and Witchcraft also has to do with manipulating energy and forces to to work your will to help you live more in harmony with the forces around you and with nature and with people and and I think the biggest differences people get confused the religion aspect and the Magical practice aspect because they are two different things they are very different and and again paganism is more of an earth-based animist type approach heathenry is more Norse based religions there's the corellians there's the um Church of all worlds this could turn into a whole different episode and I don't want to do but we are going to do a future episode to touch on a a small portion of the different traditions because boy if we did all the Traditions it would take us 96 episodes that's right so we'll have a specific episode about wika and the history of wiah and wika in America in particular and then we'll we'll go into more depth on all the other ones so hopefully that answers some of your question yeah I was gonna say I definitely hope that that covers it without turning it into an episode thank you Megan all right so what's the next one shell Okay so we've got Lori here and Lori's been reading a lot of uh different books that all kind of touch base on somehow people are just born witches and some get into it later on she wants to know do we believe that there are signs that you were a born witch and if so what signs do we think fall into that list wow this is a this is a topic right here this also could be a whole episode I do have a sign to know if you were a born witch or not really so I take it I take it the answer to her first question is yes you do agree that you can be a Bor wait wait that you can be a born witch or that you have to be a born witch please clarify your answer ma'am we're gonna answer that here in a second but I'm just going to tell you you're signed if you know you're a born witch oh okay what are they were you born that's that's pretty much it I thought you were being serious and I was going to what the hell no no honestly I I believe everyone's born a witch I mean and everyone can become a witch so yeah they're both true now okay I have a way to answer this question that could be maybe the angle that Lor's coming from okay I do believe that everyone is born with abilities that as we grow up that society and our cultures and whatever the hell you want to call it I don't know beats out of us scares out of us bullies out of us whatever the case may be and that we lose those abilities I I believe that you're talking about like psychic abilities and magical abilities correct correct so yes I do think that everyone is born with those types of abilities it's just not everybody can hang on to a piece of it like I feel like folks like you and I were able to hang on to a piece of it and I think that other people aren't able to but that we were all born with these types of abilities my belief is that witchcraft is a belief system so if you say you're a witch you're a witch and I think that a lot of people talk about being born a witch in a couple different ways one is they talk about being a generational witch my parents were witches my grandparents were witches I come from a long line of generational traditional witchcraft a I feel like the only people who can really say that are our kids pretty much yeah there's a lot of I would say that there there was a couple gen xers that we knew whose parents were Pagan and I would say there's you know a few there's a decent amount around the country then the Millennials I would say there's a lot of Millennials a lot of Millennials a lot of Millennials whose parents are witches I have a millennial exactly and her mom's a witch I swear and then there's a lot of Zoomers a lot of gen Z and younger who are witches or parents were witches grandparents witches I know there are generational families is it great if you learn something from your family yes does it really matter does it make you a better witch no it does it make you more validated no it it might give you more access to information than someone else which is cool you know information is great but it doesn't make you any better or cooler I I love it if you're a witch my daughter loves the fact that she grew up as a witch so great you know it's awesome but it doesn't make you any better and you don't have to have that to be a witch you just have to say you're one I think the other thing that they're addressing is a lot of us feel like when we find witchcraft we're like oh thank goodness this is what I have been believing and feeling and new in my very Soul right down to my toes was the right way to be in the world all along I just knew this I was making potions when I was a kid I was writing spells I was I had this belief system I just didn't know what to call it but I've always been this way and a lot of us feel that way right and so you might say I was therefore born this way I was born a witch and I think that's valid too and I think a lot of us were you know like you were saying it's just something that so many people are born with and then for whatever reason we put away for a while maybe and then come back to so that just makes me want to break out to baby we were born this way by Lady Gaga oh yeah who doesn't want to Lady Gaga rocks love you Lady Gaga so Tori um that is what we think on being born a witch and you know whatever works for you that's I feel like that's my motto whatever works for you I mean it's kind of like I think if you're if you say oh I was born a witch this is how I've always been it can be extremely validating but if you're trying to say oh I was born a witch and this is how we do it and you're doing it wrong that's that's not cool that's a little different yeah you know I guess you want to see why someone says they were born a witch but you don't have to be it's not important you are a witch if you say you are but if you are if you are generationally a witch that is cool not g sure kind of fun yeah why not having that access having grown up I mean I would have loved to grow up in that environment we dragged our kids around to festivals and to fire circles and to rituals and to spells I was that weird parent all of the volleyball games and the baseball and softball games I was like the mom that everyone was like oh she's a witch yes I am exactly and that can be very very fun and I'm not trying to invalidate that at all that's kind of cool but it doesn't make anyone a better witch just might give you more access to information and you might have been able to do it longer so next this next mail this kind of touched me um Amanda so am Anda from Oklahoma has sent us a lovely message um first of all she would love to meet us one day I think that's cool and Amanda you know what maybe one day we will be able to work that out absolutely Amanda you're not the first person to say that right now your best bet if you want to see us is next year at the end of March we're going to be in Maryland at the Sacred Space conference so you can check them out at sacredspace foundation.org to see all the information how to sign up where to stay you would definitely get to be in person with us at workshops and hanging out the entire conference so check that out sign up and you you'd get to hang out with us so for as lovely as that part of of Amanda's messages now we get on to her question so Amanda's from the Bible Belt and she says there's not many cins there that is heartbreaking to me and we need to change that she wants a start one but she needs to know does she have to be a high priestess to do so answer that Ila oh hell no right serious no you definitely do not need to be and so the second part of her question is if so could we help Point her in that direction so I think that we should give her some tips and and tricks and point her in that direction now that we've told her not necessary starting a coven is a fantastic way to get a group of like-minded people together and try out all those spells learn together study together assign roles uh let everybody have a turn creating a ritual leading the circle so no you do not need to have a high priestess will it make life easier well yeah having someone with experience is a big help but not necessary it's almost like when when you're starting out and you're with a a a group of people and you're all kind of starting out together it's almost like the high priestess ends up kind of default being the most organized person who gets every freaking thing together in time much and you will need someone to be at least one person in the circle will need to be not necessarily in charge but need to be the organized one the person who keeps track of the calendar who notifies every one of changes in schedule who make sure that if the person who's going to lead ritual that night isn't there that they have a backup plan and also one of the biggest things that you're going to need to do if you start a coven with or without a high priestess is interpersonal relationships and emotional management right you and that has nothing to do with being a high priestess actually that has a lot to do with being a high priestess but Amanda definitely be prepared for the first you know half hour if not more of all your coven meetings and rituals is going to be a good oldfashioned session people are going to need to get their emotions out people are going to need this safe space to talk so you'll you'll need to be able to handle interpersonal relationships and that's one of the best things that you can do be organized and be able to work with the people you've got and you know just remember there's no you're not screwing anything up you're not doing anything wrong and you will definitely find your path and it I don't want to say it'll all come to you but it'll all come to you we started a a te teaching coven granted we had a little bit of experience under our belts but our big goal was to learn from each other was to teach each other was to to learn from other people and to teach them and to have that kind of coven is magical it allows you to grow in so many different ways the one thing you cannot do is call yourself an alexandrian coven or a Garian coven because those have initiatory practices that you have not followed you would need to be iated into that by another group to be able to then start your own group correct but you could say you're a coven of witches or a coven of people learning newbies I hate the term baby witches but you could even say we're a coven of baby witches if you want but you just can't say that you're a member of a particular lineage or group if you're not if you're not you know you could say you're studying that but you can't say that you are that if you have to be initiated into it other than that go for it get down with your bad self seriously so Amanda keep on fighting the good fight and I hope you get your coven together as a matter of fact when you do get your coven together drop us a line because I want to know how you made out now I did kind of feel bad for Amanda because I looked on mangora Maga to see if there were any covens in the area I think in the whole state there were four covens listed no  yeah yeah that's hard that's pretty harsh sorry Amanda well you know what Amanda's going to create number five there you go keep it witchy Amanda okay now this next one really I really wanted to include this one because this one um touched me it was very personal for me so this email is from Lena and I'm G to read the whole thing so Lena says hello I love your podcast I'm newly calling myself a witch but in retrospect I've been a green witch for most of my life I wanted to ask your opinions on ancestral magic in a specific context my grandfather passed away very recently and of course I've been grieving part of me wants to incorporate him into my witchcraft as a way to share my love with him on the other hand my grandfather was a devout Muslim and I have zero doubt that when he was alive he would have hated the thought of me remembering him through anything but Islam so please pardon if this is a silly question do you think that changes after death do you think once our spirit is free of our body it's free of constraining ideas as well I would love to call my grandfather to me be able to chat with his Spirit if he's willing incorporate his watch in an altar but his living self wouldn't have been open to that and I don't want to be disrespectful what do you think lots of love Lena oh Lena my heart breaks I am so sorry I have also had a very difficult year with a lot of losses and In some cultures it's considered disrespectful to talk to your loved ones for a year and a day after after they've passed that it's better to kind of give them that year and a day space to kind of acclimate so that being said it might be a little too soon to reach out to your grandfather but in the meantime I think that honoring him and remembering him in whatever way feels comfortable to you is the best way to do it I do believe once people pass on they are able to see so much more clearly I think that they can see their whole life the good and the bad and I think that they can see the energy of the universe the energy of Life the energy of the beyond that much more clearly and I think giving it labels like Muslim Christian Pagan Wiccan are irrelevant at that point exactly and I do think that all they really see is are you a good person who are you and I don't think religion matters that much I mean to some it can sure but I have had contact with my own an ancestors and with other people that I've spoken to who have contacted ancestors who are very religious in life have found that they're still religious but it's softer it's more spiritual it's more accepting it's more in tune with the flow of of life and love and nature so you might find that that's your experience with your grandfather what I recommend is maybe um a year and a day after his passing U maybe have a memorial definitely use his watch his watch that holds his energy for sure a watch is such a personal thing and ask him you know approach him respectfully maybe incorporate some uh Muslim phrases that you love there's a lot of poetry and Beauty in that religion you know find something that speaks to you from that and approach him on neutral ground that way and ask him how he would like to be remembered you know tell him what you would like to do for him and I believe that that conversation will go more easily than you think it will I am always is a believer of ask you know these These are people that you loved and still love ask they'll tell you I mean I I wouldn't say that my grandmother was religious per se but she sure as hell wasn't down with what I do and there came a point where I just had to ask you know she kind of shows up to bit CH now but you have to ask so ask your grandfather he'll tell you and I am a very strong believer in reincarnation I do think that energy can neither be created nor destroyed and the energy that moves our bodies has been here from the beginning and it will continue to be here for a long time but I do feel that once someone reconnects with that overs soul with that energy they're able to see many different sides and you know maybe there was someone who was very angry in this lifetime and once you reconnect with them on the other side they've had a little bit of time to you know integrate all those lessons and maybe find out why they were angry maybe not but like shelle said ask them present them with some of their favorite things call to them with some of their favorite music their favorite foods their favorite pictures you know some of your favorite memories of them and then ask them how they want you to approach them so I am so sorry for your loss Lena it has been a very difficult year and I have a lot of people that I am waiting a year and a day for so I'm right there with you good luck to you Lena and hail the traveler so moving on to the next email we have one oh I'm gonna let you read this one sh because this has to do with hkat this one this this one's a good one I can't read the whole thing because this one is so long but I laughed this email is from Sarah now Sarah first of all what made me really laugh the most is the fact that she was trying she saw a picture of us on our website and she was trying to figure out whose voice went with whose face oh no so you know what that led me to of course that led me to sit here and try to put my voice to your face and your my face in my head which oh that's fun whole hysterical thing so first and foremost thank you for that and I do apologize I think it took us a little while to realize that not everyone would know who was who because we know who's who so obviously on our website we do have our BIOS with our names and the the notice that I put out on Facebook about the Sacred Space conference also has our pictures with our names on it so hopefully that will help clear up any confusion but what I thought what I what I liked about this one as well other than the how I got the funniest laugh of that whole thing in my head she was very interested in our herat episode and I feel like that hiate was nudging her in the right direction so she makes this beautiful freaking wind chime and like she sent this picture I don't know if you're looking at the picture but this thing is beautiful very lucky daughter-in-law when you have a good mother-in-law daughter-in-law relationship cherish that that don't happen often and you know that was the other thing that kind of made me giggle I'm like wow she likes her daughter-in-law that don't happen right so lucky but first of all she wasn't really sure what keys to use ended up using skeleton keys boom right ones it's funny how hiate works like that right she didn't know that she had anything to do with the moon boom guess what so it seems like to answer her first part of her question yes hiate was leading you in the right direction she was shoving you by your shoulders all I can think of this this is the visualization I have someone behind you grabbing like the material above your shoulders and like shoving you down the street like yes skeleton keys yes skeleton keys and did you notice it was specifically nine skeleton keys now for me hkat has been showing up a lot in the last few months as as I talked about on that episode and particularly she shows me 333 and three is sacred to hiate because she is the triplef faed goddess and nine is three threes so I love that she had nine keys on there how cool she also mentioned the Christopher Hughes Tarot deck which everybody loves I love it Lila don't talk about it I love it it's great I like the U one and I cannot wait he is coming out next year with a bee tarot and I am obsessed with bees you know actually I am really excited about that because I think a bee Tarot would be just the man it's G to be gorgeous I cannot wait now the artist for the Ule tarot is Emma O Brown and she's from Buffalo New York and as many of you know I am currently in Rochester New York right down the road and Buffalo's right down the road so I'm really really hoping that we can get an interview with the artist of those gorgeous gorgeous cards so the other thing I just wanted to point out about Sarah's email other than her freaking phenomenal pictures Al I just got to mention that again by the way she binges us on the way to work and while she's working well you know what I too like to listen to random stuff today was Christmas music at work so I am glad knowing how sometimes work can be like totally sucky and you've got to have something to distract you from the nine-to-five I am glad that we can brighten your day and be what distracts you from your work because you know Le I kept saying we got to do another salarium and I was like oh but I got a runny nose and I'm coughing I agreed to do it and it made your damn day Sarah so I hope you like it I love those episodes they're a lot of fun oh she also wanted to know if we could start adding the ingredients that we use for our DIY stuff I didn't even realize that we didn't sorry Sarah sometimes  just flies over our heads I think she's talking about the teas and the smoke she wants the recipes for what we're smoking and what we're drinking that day that's probably why we forgot but yes Sarah we definitely will do that coming up on our Instagram at back onth broomstick and also on our Facebook also back on the broomstick and hopefully on our blog too maybe even on our newsletter if we're like feeling really inspired we will have a bunch of smokable and drinkable recipes for you yeah and actually I was thinking of putting out like a nice little U tied drink recipe on Ule stay tuned that's coming right around the corner keep an eye out for it on the old Instagram and I'm going to have the Hey cuz let's go for a walk recipe for all of you who are trapped with family over the holidays and and maybe need a little pickme up or break I love that I love that that's the greatest name I've ever heard of right well that's going to be the recipe you'll get for this Yu tide season so Sarah thank you for the pictures thank you for the huge huge Giggle and yes hkat was pushing your ass down the street to get all that the right proper way oh absolutely so what do we got next next we have another hkat email this one's from christe everybody loves hiate everybody loves hkat I really do think it's that she's the goddess of witches she is the queen of witches and I really think it's WI witchcraft Rising woman I mean hkat rising hiate Rising I think the Resurgence of Witchcraft all over the world oh by the way thank you all over the world we love seeing all the countries pop up just seeing all these witches surging right now our numbers are getting bigger by the day I really do think it is the time of hkat it is it is Christy says that unfortunately she is an old soul with a traumatic past unfortunately like many of us and congratul on stopping drinking I am so happy for you Bravo seriously 110% man good for you and now she says that our HEC episode intrigued and frightened her at the same time that's normal you're not scared it's not her she says that your bond with hiate seemed to her to be very much a maternal Sisterhood type of relationship would you say that's true yeah yeah she she definitely yeah and that whip in my ass yeah yeah yeah you know a tough maternal figure for sure not always you know sometimes it's been okay but kicking me in the ass don't don't you doubt it definitely a strong maternal excellent Sisterhood type bond for sure BFF's ride or die Christy says that she's a shelter veterinarian and honestly girl hiate loves that one of the things you can do I know shell does not with that aspect of her but but one of the things you can do to work with hiate or to honor her is to volunteer at a shelter to you know go help walk dog so she definitely is a goddess that comes to veterinarians that work with dogs for sure she mentioned that in her email so I think that if you think kkate might be interesting she is is and you already have a bond with her I can see it in your email so if you're interested in her go for it and she asked will I dream it maybe or it could be a whisper in the ear or all of a sudden you are like our last email and you buy nine keys and make a wreath all of a sudden an episode on hiate pops up when you were just thinking about her just being interested is enough I mean if you want to study her and follow her and worship her I think that's great that's all you need is an interest now this is Lila's Forte because she's like the internet wizard here she asks if we know of any good covin in Las Vegas I want to go to Las Vegas because let's just face it shell likes a good Casino not going to lie well I'm going to point you in the same direction that I point pretty much everybody because which by the way she pointed me in the same direction and I actually was able to find a kick-ass Coven in Salem Massachusetts so go Leila listen to her advice that's right this works go mandra Gora Magicka and yes I know it sounds weird I'll put a link in the show notes it's just hard to spell that's all in Las Vegas on this website they have three different covens listed they have camping with Las pagans Inner Circle Sanctuary and the Magical Bard Society all of these have email and Facebook contacts they were all updated very recently so yeah there definitely are covin in Las Vegas and there's three that are pretty open about it Lea pointed me in the right direction so it's a good site check them out you got nothing to lose by reaching out because generally they have like an email address or a phone number that you can reach out take a chance man give one of them a call read the bios of the covens this because this is exactly what I did no joke read the BIOS and you're going to know what ones feel like you know what maybe I should respond to that group and the ones that you're like okay I need to keep scrolling look for meet and greets look for open circle nights um you should be able to go and check them out nobody should have you sign anything right away or swear you to secrecy the first night sign something who's signing like what is this IRS you know if you're asked to pay anything something small a nominal fee fine but you know most places won't but maybe especially if they have to cover some type of room fee or something like that if it's small okay but if they're asking you to sign or give away a lot of money that's a red flag but for the most part you know take a look at them if they feel good go check out an open circle or a Meetup night and definitely make sure that you are comfortable with whoever you're going to meet because you know let's all stay safe people so now the next one I'm not even sure how to say this C SI I'm not even G to try because if you if you are an avid listener you know I butcher names and I'm not going to be disrespectful and do that so we're going with what Lea said it's beautiful and it starts with Syble I'm not sure how to pronounce the AIS part of it cile I don't know it's very pretty this sounds just like us I love these emails that sound just like us yes our people she wants to know if we would consider an episode or two geared specifically towards ways to get back into your connection with practice and deity and part of it is it's not just ways to get back into it but and this is where we all got off the broomstick here folks struggling to find the time the energy and the connection after the  of the mundane day and week I get you I get you so much so hard I can relate to this so much and for me the best thing that I have done is returning to my folk witchcraft fruits my everyday what we used to call Kitchen Magic basically whatever you could find in your kitchen it's just so different than Kitchen Magic today by the way I mean it can still be cooking especially now because that's the best way to do it when you don't have time shell has a very magical shower in the morning use your shower time as your meditation as your cleansing as your purifying your aura and your space and setting your intention for the day when you drink your coffee or the tea in the morning Stir It deoil or clockwise and add an intention add a spell to that as you're Brewing it or as you're drinking it or you know like when when I have to go to my mundane bull crap job which I love by the way you know I have to walk from I park my car at a a local train station and I have to walk from the train station to my work and usually I have to stand at a crosswalk and wait for the crosswalk to let me go so I don't get plowed over by a car and sometimes I just while I'm waiting for that crosswalk to start blinking you know I just kind of take in around me not necessarily the cars and the other people waiting but kind of my surroundings and nature and just the sky and I can smell the ocean from there so I'm taking in the scents too and you know sometimes is just taken a moment and to just appreciate for a second what's around you I have found that the absolute best thing you can do to get back on the broomstick is to be consistent true true that the two things that I do in particular are one in the morning and one at night because otherwise my neurod Divergent brain is not going to hold on to them so in the morning my very first drink of the day I drink with intention I am also a cannabis smoker so I do a little wake and bake in the morning I have a little smoke and I have my caffeine and I take that 5 minutes and set my intentions for the day I make sure to do my breathing my meditation grounding and I started out very very slowly I said I'm going to do this for one week and that's it and I tried to be very consistent with it just for that week and then at the end of the week I said well I'm going to do it for the rest of the month and that and that's why the shower works for me because I have to take a shower every day when I wake up so it it forces that consistency you know what I'm saying yes and the consistency is where the magic will come right if every single day you do your meditation in the shower and you're cleansing in the shower and you have an intentional magical shower that completely changes the act of it yes you're getting ready for work but it is also a ritual in and of itself but that's how I started with a because I I I have to take a shower every day it's who I am I'm that type of person um not judging if you are not that type of person but making something that I know I do every day making it magic bring the magic to you don't wait for the magic to just be there sometimes you got to bring it to you and I bring it to my daily routine via shower and then the other easy thing for me to do was at night I was a sporadic journaler in the evening so I got myself a gorgeous Tarot deck that I really really connected with and I set a goal to at night before I went to bed I would pull a tarot card from that deck and I would Journal about it and I would meditate on it and I did that intentionally for a month and it has continued and so now I have those two moments in my day that are very magical see sometimes I don't have time for even that though is the problem it's true so as long but you have your morning shower and you've done that at least most of the time if you can do one of them and then add one more later great but if all you've got is that one make it magical and you'll find that it makes it easier for you to see the Magic in other everyday things like when you add your herbs to your dinner or when you microwave your lunch you can still add magic to that and it also makes it easier for me to want to do spell work or ritual work or to honor the changing of the moon or the changing of the seasons because I have that daily practice on under my belt it's almost like once you start doing one thing it almost starts to snowball know what I mean magic flows where intention goes right you know like you start with you know the meditative shower or what have you and then it turns into you know you noticing nature as you're waiting across the street and then it turns into starting to keep track of the moon phases again and then it turns into you're starting to keep track a Mercury retrograde which by the way is it ever not retrograde and then you get into you start getting into different practice again so it really is kind of a Snowball Effect that's my opinion start with mundane things pick something you already do every day or pretty close to every day and find a way to make it magical if it's your shower buy special soap buy a super amazing after shower lotion buy something with scent that reminds you of happiness mindfulness whatever intention you want to set for that day maybe you have a set of different bath bombs bath bombs for your magical shower or different types of tea different blends of tea or smokable herbs to set your intention magically for the day so just take something you already do and elevate it and make it magical and then do it with intention and then after that it just flows it literally I swear it just flows whether whether you want to make time for it or not it just does I didn't even realize I was making time for it after a while wouldn't you agree I do 100% and it makes it easier things start to happen if you start to pay attention to it it starts to happen more so the more energy you can put into it the more it's going to come out you're gonna yep absolutely all right so this next one is a little bit closer to when this episode goes out we'll kind of be right in the middle of the 12 days of Ule or the 12 Days of Christmas which we talked about on our episode of Ule myths and traditions I've actually just recently come across this Three Kings Day okay so maybe I I was under a rock my whole life I didn't know about it till recently and the whole I always wondered why there was so many Christmas cards with three kings on them now I know oh the three wise men right they're called Kings oh I don't know I think they're different okay well I know that the 12 days of Ule are different than the 12 Days of Christmas because one starts on Ule the 21st roughly and one starts on Christmas the 25th we have a listener Chandra who wrote Us in to explain what the 12 days of Christmas are because neither of us know what that is and Chandra says that they do the 12 Days of Christmas and the 12th night lands on Epiphany or Three Kings Day and the Three Kings or Magi are balazar melar and Gaspar or Casper and it's also lab buana Day in Italy which we had talked about in that episode yeah so the 12 days of Christmas are a Christian thing and the 12 days of Ule are kind of a pagan thing now I don't know exactly what the 12 Days of Christmas represent but for the 12 days of uel it basically represents that that kind it represents what my true love gave to me duh well that's the 12 Days of Christmas right the 12 days of Ule are more about personal Comfort going within taking care of yourself you know wrapping things up and I kind of like that tradition well all I know is the end of The 12 Days of Christmas there's a partridge and a pear tree and I pears and apparently on 12th night there's it's also Sherlock Holmes birthday so that's pretty cool that I did not know so thank you for that little fact Shandra I appreciate it Shandra you have a very happy holiday season so our very last email is from Kimberly and Kimberly sent this email particularly because we asked for them on our you Traditions episode so thank you so much Kimberly we as ask Kimberly delivers now Kimberly lives in Hawaii and is also a I can't even Kimberly first of all I can't even why did you have to put that in your email I didn't need to know that you lived in Hawaii because let me tell you right now it is like 38 degrees in New England and you're in Hawaii probably on the beach damn you now I'm very excited for your family's first uel celebration I hope you have a lot of fun and I'm so excited that you're going to use my family's four candle ceremony it is beautiful meing that is very cool my kids are ecstatic that you guys are going to be using it too so we'll be thinking of you a little bit and sending you happy Ule energy when we light our first candle but Kimberly says that it's a little bit weird celebrating the solstice in Hawaii because it's 80 degrees there there's no yeah lucky that's what you get I'll trade you I'll trade you you come to New England right now and I will pack up and move to Hawaii now I lived in Southern California for quite a few years when we first started podcasting together and I also found that the warmth in the middle of winter was something I loved but it did make the season feel a lot different and Kimberly wants to know if there's any ways to adapt these European American witchcraft Traditions while still being in a place that's very tropical first of all if I lived in Hawaii I would be decorating a palm tree just as we decorate traditional Christmas trees here in the Northeast my ass would have ornaments hanging from a palm tree no given the solstice itself celebrates the shortest day and the longest night how does that work in Hawaii well they're a little closer to the Equator right a lot like Southern California is I'm pretty sure so for me when I was in Southern California the days and nights didn't get too terribly short this time of year but it was noticeable and things were cooler and so I didn't necessarily celebrate winter per se but I did celebrate the solstice itself and focused on the return of the light and the return of the sun growing stronger and the days is getting longer I also recommend focusing on where you're at Spirit of place is really really important you know focus on where the mountains are in Hawaii I know that he yeah the volcanoes the land itself is sacred so focus on those sacred spots where the water is and the spirits of the place where you live yourself you know where your house or your apartment is you know focus on the land right around you and honor that and honor the celestial season and that might help you to find the meaning in the solstice more so than snowy New England type Christmas scenes I think my biggest piece of advice would be tailor it to what feels right for you in your environment you know here we might focus on on the wintry aspect you could focus on the energy of the ocean like Lea said either the energy of the mountains the volcanic energy P energy you got a a lot to roll with there in Hawaii so just kind of mold it to make it more location appropriate if that makes sense witchcraft it's very important to modify it to where you're at um because that's like the key to this whole thing works for you yeah whatever works for you and and meet yourself where you're at literally and figuratively you know and meet the spirit it's where you're at and try to incorporate them as much as you can maybe your souls to Celebration will focus more on the sun because it is 80 Dees there celebrate that the sun this time of year isn't out to kill you but is just out to grow things to get ready for spring celebrate the return of that strength I want to be in Hawaii we should go visit
