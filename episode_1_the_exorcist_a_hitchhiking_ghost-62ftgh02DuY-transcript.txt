it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 1 of the stoned Wich is hour with shell and Lea grab a seat pack a bow and maybe turn on a few extra lights listen in as we smoke more than a little cannabis and tell Trish Tales of paranormal events ghoulish crimes and Things That Go Bump in the [Music] night all right I have a I have a legitimate question for smokers female female smokers so have you ever lit your thumbnail on fire multiple times especially after I've gotten a very expensive manicure which is a big huge pain in my ass no one ever talks about the drawbacks of smoking marijuana and lighting your thumbnail on fire is one of them that's how you know you've met a fellow Stoner look at their thumbs first of all we have the callus you have the C yeah the lighter c y yeah the lighter callous and we also have melted nails so yeah not to mention look at our lighters and it's got like that bowl Mark oh yeah that's the first thing if you look at the bottom of someone's like like hey can I bum your lighter and you look at the bottom and you see that it's a little melted it's a little black and yeah you Spirit you know you know you know I hear you gotta really you're gonna really scare me tonight so I'm packing another bong in anticipation because this movie all right I know I'm spilling the beans but you said it was at The Exorcist did did I did it scared the crap out of me when I was a kid I think it's kind of silly now looking back on it but it was very scary at the time well you better pack a bowl because this this is really an interesting story because it was scary back then because we were kids but now it's kind of unnerving as adults because there's truth behind it and we're going to talk about that truth oh okay that sounds fun all right so let me grab this why don't you uh hit me with some facts so it goes without saying that director William fkins 1973 film The Exorcist is probably the most celebrated and perhaps the most horrifying horrifying motion picture ever released this movie has won nine Academy Awards pretty much the greatest horror movie of our lifetime definitely creepy I have to I I do remember it I mean it looks so old now although they did didn't they just redo it yeah but we're kind of old too by the way you keep saying that it looks kind of what I want to talk about is the real story behind the classic The Exorcist when you dig a little deep you know we all know pretty much the story of the little boy who actually in the movie was played by a little girl but but we all kind of know the story of the little boy but there's a little Side Story that kind of briefly Peaks into this and has a part of the writer's version of this and I want to kind of into that yeah yeah like a little Side Story um it doesn't play big huge key rooll um into the true story behind it um but there is a small piece that does and when when I dug a little deeper it was intriguing okay I I'm down for some Side Stories was intriguing so I I just kind of I want to kind of talk about some of the interesting things about the story we all know um about the boy but I also want to kind of delve a little bit into this little Side Story because that's the part that I think maybe nobody knows about oh all right I never knew that there were two legitimate documented stories that actually were kind of merg together to make first of all the book the book The Exorcist and then the 1973 movie which was based off the book it was actually two totally different stories everybody knows the boy which obviously in the movie was a girl um but the real life story was a boy a 12-year-old boy there's a couple different towns that have been mentioned actually this boy lived in Maryland but ultimately outside of DC like rural Washington DC but like in Maryland all right so in the movie it was a girl and you're saying in the real life story that it's actually about a boy a 12-year-old boy yep I did not know that I'd never heard that before I always assumed that even the real true quote unquote story was about a young girl by the way I just want to point out that in the St Louis University's Pious the 12 Library there are binders of documents that relate to this really they like they have a ton of information about it yeah all of the news articles the case studies the newspaper articles like there's like a folder man oh [ __ ] this was in 1949 so you know I mean it's a upper middle class type environment to say the least okay some people call this guy Robbie some people call him Roland but he like was a Lutheran so he was Christian but he was a Lutheran he had a favorite aunt don't we all yeah I think I have a favorite a you know you figure it's the 40s and this Aunt Harriet is her name gets some into Ouija boards 1949 this kid's playing around with Ouija boards with his aunt probably open some freaking demon portal by the way seriously then Aunt Harriet dies like right after using the Ouija board well not like right after but like okay she dies and the kid keeps the Ouija board is kind of like a momento momento of like this was my aunt now she's gone and I loved her so the dude inherited a Ouija board from his aunt like everyone you know it always comes back to a Ouija board I feel like don't you feel like every story goes back to a Ouija board somehow some way especially in the 70s and 80s it seems like every single story had a Ouija board involved I I do have to admit though I I inherited a Ouija board but from my grandma mother do you remember the one that we used yeah we've used it a couple times I think in some pretty spooky spots um that the really old one like the first run Parker Brothers 1974 I think Ouija board you know funny story um I also inherited a Ouija board for my grandma course you did but no like here's the irony of my life this predates Parker Brothers it was from like 1949 manufactured in Salem Massachusetts woo oh wow nice talk about legit Ouija board and and and I have some interesting stories about that that we'll talk about another time actually I uh I bought a new one as well I have a collection you know how I am I like to collect things you have a collection of tarot cards I know about your quite extensive collection of tarot cards which I envy and covet but I also have a mini colle ction of Ouija boards oh I love that what what have you got like I know you have the super Old Salem one and you said I got this I got the super Old Salem one which I guess um kind of long story short my grandmother bought back in the early 50s when you know when when ladies would have lady parties lady parties I don't know what you call them like like card parties sewing parties drinking parties I don't know like okay like how I would come over in Smoke and we'd hang out and smoke but this would be like people drinking tea and having crumpets and like there' be like 10 of them and okay they wouldn't be smoking weed but anyway so like you know they'd play cards and this and that so anyway 50s Ouija board got it then my mother used it and my aunt and my uncle as teenagers and then when my grandma died they were like hey you know do you want this I'm like this is gold and you people don't even realize this to me it was gold it it's 16 I got the Parker of Brothers version for Christmas one year Santa was kind I still have that from from my original one uh for my my teenage years and then I've collected about four or five other ones most recently I got this most beautiful artwork one in Downtown Salem and it is gorgeous I think you showed that to me that's the butterfly beautiful blues and yeah it looks way too pretty to be a Ouija board which actually they have the um Ouija board History Museum or something or other here yeah yeah I remember that's part of the reason why you get Ouija boards but Okay so we've ascertained like everyone obviously inherits a Ouija board from a family member of course correct then they start having like Paranormal Activity in their house vibrations to strange noises to flying objects did they immediately connect it like did it happen right after the ant died or was this like not connected it was connected but they didn't realize it okay so they just didn't know yet at the time what was causing it right basically they felt later down the road they realized this was probably like the infestation stage of possession like books would fly off all of the sudden and then that's when like the bed would start shaking violently which I'm sure you remember from the movie furniture moving across the room the scratching noises on the wall like any parents you're GNA be like hey maybe I should take my kid to the doctor because it's 1949 and where else do you take your kid if some shit's going down you take him to the doctor how do you explain that to your doctor yes my my four-year-old is levitating three feet off of her bed most nights and occasionally we are noticing that as her head spins around she's vomiting pea soup I mean how do you say that to your pediatric so as you can imagine the child was taken to St Elizabeth's Psychiatric Hospital oh yeah highly regarded place for the time granted 1949 treatment required institutionalization and was basically often referred to as an insane asylum the goto is your freaking nuts let's lock you away well didn't they do that for everything particularly women at that time oh you're cranky insane asylum oh you have bad periods insane Asylum oh your husband's an [ __ ] well you need to go to an insane asylum well listen to what they tried to say was wrong with this kid they tried to say that he had like schizophrenia or tourettes so you know back in those days they just assume the Paranormal was nuts he happened to get like the parents happened to tell the story to someone who was like hey actually you should get a priest and they were like hey we'll do anything we can to try to fix this the parents were able to get a priest to go to this like crazy hospital was he responding at all in the hospital like as the doctors were trying to treat him like were they having any success with him at all no no no were a kid so remember I told you they were Lutheran so the parents were referred to this father Albert Hughes now this guy was Roman Catholic so basically that's the whole point of pointing out their Lutheran that now they're referred to a Roman Catholic which is a little bit different but I don't know how Okay this guy totally believed that the boy was possessed and ended up seeking permission from the Archbishop of Washington DC to like immediately begin exorcisms yeah I think that is something I've heard don't they have to get permission to do that like they can't just go performing exorcisms willy-nilly they have to ask permiss it's like you gotta ask your supervisor kind of thing right okay so he goes and tries to do this and then he can't do it anymore because the kid starts breaking off pieces of the mattress Springs and slashing the priest with it wow wow oh my goodness so ultimately leaves the the first exorcism unfinished bad idea oh no then scratches start appearing on the kid so is the kid scratching himself with the with the springs or did they take it all sharp objects away at that point like all sharp objects away and all of a sudden the word Lewis like carved into them okay no like a name so the mother think what's the kid's name uh Ronald or Roland that's right not Louis so the mother thinks that it actually means that they need to go to St Louis where they have relatives okay why would you make that connection oh yeah someone's carving the name Lewis into my son that must mean the City St Louis she has this cousin who's going to St Louis University they put her in touch with this other father father Walter H hollerin and Reverend William boder these are actually Jesuit priests which again oh a new flavor we're introducing a third flavor a different flavor okay and they agree to do the exorcism with like a whole bunch of assistants so remember in the movie where they had like a couple priests and like five assistants so here we are with that they go there you know that's the whole vomiting mattress thing kind of like the same types of things that happened when the first exorcism failed ripping the apart blah blah blah he was kind of they noticed that nighttime was when a lot of this happened and daytime the kid was pretty all right is he still under the care of doctors at this point or has he been released to his parents and now they're just going to different types of Christian priests going they're they took the kid out of the institution and heght tailed it to St Louis they're on their own now so the kids going in like trans like States you know making those guttural sounds things flying all around the father decides he's not given up no matter what all these like horrific things are happening so they decided midnight why would they do this at midnight they're gonna give them the Holy Communion that sound like it's going to work it's not because basically the way that the priest put it in his diary which is in that library that you can actually go to they said that Satan would have no part of it Satan wants no part of communion right you know all these things are getting carved on this poor kid they're trying to like hold the kid down but like what they do finally in the end so you know this is going on for months they're trying to exercise this poor kid for like I think it was like three months Easter comes is it like Jesus's birthday maybe maybe that's what happened kid wakes up with seizures things are really bad so they call St Michael I don't know why they didn't do this before as a witch I would have even done this prior to this if all this [ __ ] happened you bring out the big guns right from the beginning right why weren't you doing this like two months ago so he'd be a logical pick I mean St Michael they already know that he's he's like a warrior against Satan so if they think this kid is possessed by demons I mean bringing out the big guns means bringing out St Michael the guy who's got a big sword and is more than willing to use it against evil well and you figure these these folks were uh Jesuit priests so you know their belief in the Saints and the archangels and all of that was extremely strong so they probably felt deep down that if they called St Michael they would somehow someway win this battle and it's definitely a thing you and I have both seen it we deep-seated beliefs whether it's a deep-seated belief in St Michael or the cross or a pentacle or whatever your religious symbol is if you have that deep-seated belief that this is protection it is protection it is remember in the craft I love the craft me too they actually talk about that the policeman that his badge the star and you know he didn't believe in the whole witchcraft thing and then he actually saw the demon guy and they told him that if he believe because he believed in his star that was his Talisman to ward off the evil and was that Practical Magic oh no yeah you're right Practical Magic that's right the police officer in practic Star and he held the star up and he's like and it and it basically made the demon guy like go away temporarily because he believed that his star his police badge would make it go away that's right his belief that his police badge was his Talisman against evil it's right right yeah it was so much a part of who he was exactly that exactly that so whatever your belief system is if you believe that putting your foot underneath the covers at night is going to stop the demons from eating your toes it will that blanket becomes powerful it becomes a safe you've made a magical space underne it just so you know I do that every single night and I do believe that by the way oh it's true everyone does that ghosties can't get maites if they're under the blanket still that's a life truth I think everyone we all learn that as children we just carry it with us into adulthood we just don't talk EXA exactly we just know it's true so they call St Michael to kind of expel Satan from this poor kid's body St Michael was like supposedly like fighting Satan for his soul they are doing like this right there room there's like a a saint battling with Satan over this boy's soul that sounds [ __ ] guess yeah yeah so this happens for like 10 minutes but like all these weird things were happening like during this battle like it was like this 10minute long battle like an ex appeared on the kid's chest and it's supposed to be like they thought that meant he was possessed by 10 demons instead of one and like oh because X is the Roman symbol for 10 yes points for me I'm a stoner and I still got that all right and like he had like a pitchfork shaped pattern with red lines on his thigh and like a snake going down his ankle like this poor kid and I mean imagine being like 12 13 years old and get all the stuff carved on you oh that poor baby and then all of a sudden like the kid just comes out of a trance and he said he was gone and never coming back St Michael won their belief in their faith in that kind of pulled through for them wow that's fantastic what a cool story and and the the author used that story it was his he was looking at you had said he was looking at stories of exorcisms and he came across that local one right yeah he he was a student the author was a student at Georgetown University outside of DC he was taking a college course that this article somehow infiltrated and related to that course course and kind of dug into all the newspaper articles because it was happening at the time I mean it was like here the time yeah it was the headlines at the moment he was kind of looking into the exorcism stuff separately um in his college life and in his outside of college life the headlines is this current thing happening to this boy you seeing these articles he's a writer wants to write a story even though it like evoked negative reactions from like religious groups do you realize this is going to blow your mind this guy actually wrote this novel to try to scare people into going back to church wait that that was the whole premise yeah he really thought he'd scare a whole generation of people into going back to church like sorry pal led me down the path to Witchcraft that backfired like really he he thought that the premise of the story would lead people to go back to church he during his classes at school had been going into the loud in France incidents um the exorcisms that happened there 1632 uh when that happened there were exorcisms that happened in France this isn't just an American phenomenon there were no actually yeah that this this actually happened in 1632 in Lowden France and kind of resulted in what became the witch trials across the world W the the Salem Witch Trials you know everybody everybody in the Free World has heard of the Salem Witch Trials right um whatever year that was I don't even remember 1692 or something we always kind of don't focus on the European Witch Trials you know some of the European Witch Trials date back prior to the saem Massachusetts witch trials they're they're called the allowed in possessions that's that's the name of this particular story that is also intertwined in The Exorcist which I'll get to how was actually also a notorious witchcraft trial uh that took place in Lowden and this happened in in 1634 and I'll get into into the the Witchcraft trial part of it in a second so that was quite a bit before you are absolutely correct the Salem Witch Trials were in 1692 and so that was quite a bit what almost 60 years 50 plus years before the Salem Witchcraft Trials 58 years before yeah what people don't realize is the Second Story actually dates back to 1634 so like we're talking [ __ ] I'm high I'm having a bad math moment what like 400 years I can't even do math when I'm not high hold on let me get my socks off so I count of my fingers and toes all right what are we doing 1634 so like I don't know like three 400 years ago whatever like a long time ago okay long time ago in France I don't speak the French language so maybe I'm not pronouncing some of this right and for that I apologize but okay so 1634 I think it's pronounced loud in France I think you might be right I don't also don't know French but I think that sounds right yeah loud in France I believe there was some issues with a nun and a priest actually 17 nuns I believe it was a priest wow that's a prolific priest it was the Covenant of ursin nuns Ursuline Convent I think yeah I think that's how it's pronounced ursaline or something ursaline Convent or Ursuline Convent yes all I can think of is Ursula from Little Mermaid right and they were said to be visited and possessed by demons and again you know I I am not a french-speaking person so I might be pronouncing this all wrong the Catholic Church did an investigation and there was this local priest named uh Urbane gardier and he Urbane Urbane Orban okay that's a name that's quite a name all right it's 1634 in France his name's not Steve all right good point I'm sorry Urbane Lord listen to this the wit I'm sorry I can't his name's not Steve no it's your pan that's why it's funny all right sorry it's not Steve no but so this guy's a priest and this is Urbane Urbane the priest Urbane the priest sorry I'll be quiet now you're high I know I'm sorry smoke a bong smoke a bong while I talk all right hold on anyway or ban is a priest and as is true with pretty much all Witch Trials he is like not a witch being accused of a witch and what happened was he was like this kind of debonaire kind of hot and sexy guy I don't even know what hot and sexy in 1634 France looks like I have no idea imagine like do these people like they don't brush their teeth they don't shower for weeks like when they do shower it's in a river I don't know what the expect is but apparently he was like a good-look fell he pissed everybody off in the town because basically whether they were young or old or single or married he was pretty much [ __ ] everybody oh Sneezy he was sleeping with everyone in the town all the men in the town decided to try to persecute him oh yeah they're like this dude has got to go he's Mak because basically their wives and their daughters were like fair game and they were getting pissed Urbane sexy man sexy sleeping with the whole town Urbane come trial time all of a sudden nobody wants to be a witness so they had no choice but to let him go really no choice basically in like 2021 terms basically all charges were dropped for insufficient evidence because no one would snitch on the town Castle Nova nice because well obviously they were happy enough with him that you know everyone was like you know what I am not giving lover boy up another problem that was going on in in that moment is there was a king it might have been one of the Louis they had a wall around this town already so like imagine this like medieval town that has like a like a stone wall around it okay the king wanted to tear down the wall well the town was split like think of it like Berlin do we keep the wall do we not keep the wall what are we doing with the wall here the Catholic Church decided no matter what they personally believed as a church entity they were going to side with the King to tear down the wall guess who didn't want the wall torn down and fought tooth the nail Urbane Urbane why did Urbane like the wall was he keeping his lovers separate probably he felt that that's the way it was that's the way it always should be and just because the king wants it doesn't mean we should do it kind of thing like he wasn't really a rule follower obviously no care for the sanctimony of marriage basically he ended up winning the battle of the wall and as punishment because they couldn't convict him of basically being a manhor they made him the priest of Lowden wait wait wait so they took the Manore and they made him priest of a whole city yeah behind the wall and then like these people couldn't leave the town they were stuck behind the wall like wait wait wait wait wait even better so they took the Manore and they made him the priest of the like trapped people in the city they're like you want your [ __ ] wall then you ain't leaving there was 17 nuns there are these the 17 nuns he slept with yeah typical Manor Orban okay go on well because he's the priest and he's the priest yeah poor nuns those poor nuns now these chicks range to be about 25ish years old there was a plague it's like freaking now 2020 plague that was part of the reason actually why they were kind of quote unquote locked in the town couldn't leave the wall because they didn't want the plague coming or going oh so they were on lockdown like we like basically year okay basically plague is 1632 I don't know okay but you know a lot of the wealthy people and a lot of like the doctors and like business owners they had left before they were kind of locked in the town there was a period where the people who wanted the wall to come down they were able to leave when the decision was made to keep it and it was kind of like you want your wall here you go okay people were kind of isolating oh my god I didn't even realize that it is like now even the nuns kind of like lock themselves in their little house all right hold on I need to do one more hit because I'm not high enough for time repeating itself okay continue so the nuns aren't getting any visitors anymore and Urbane plague because the plague so they're kind of even though they're like in the lock down town they're still kind of like not leaving the house okay so Urbane was still visiting sick people and giv money to the poor gracious man gracious man gracious in public but then behind the convent walls he was raping 17 women then all of a sudden there was a nun now you got to remember these are like 5-year-old kids probably have to be like what 18 to be a nun I have no idea I think they were throwing their girl kids that they didn't want into the nunneries like left and right so I think some were pretty young this young nun all of a sudden has a vision of her dead father basically all these other nuns started having visions of a dead priest like a recently dead priest that died to the plague so they decided because they're having all these Visions dead people that they need all these nuns need to have an Exorcism of course and isn't that what you do for bad dreams you call in a priest and have an exorcism duh remember the kind of controversial scene with the crucifix in a sexual act kind of way oh yeah that scene yes that is what these nuns started to do in France like for fun were they coerced did the demon make them I guess the demon made them I guess they decide to let Urban tried to exercise the demons but then two other priests got involved and blamed Urbane and they said that herbane was the one who brought this demon as mode and purposely like possessed these nuns what so Urban was behind it the whole time I should that's what they were saying that's what they were saying these these nuns are kind of quarantined in their Convent so like they're not even opening the door for anybody except essentially Urbane homes to the poor no no no they're they're they're on lockdown they are 100% quarantine lockdown women locked down in a Convent locked down in a city no one can see them except handsome sexy Urbane sexual devant sexual deviant Urbane this is not a recipe for good things no so you know he he was doing some shady stuff and that's where some of the the the tie in to The Exorcist the movie or the book either way there is a tie in somehow you know this is such a good story I forgot I'm like what the [ __ ] is this crazy demon possessed dude gonna do next I forgot there's a tie into the Exorcist all right so you know these these 17 girls young women are are being taken advantage of by a person they trusted their priest there does seem to be some weird stuff going on because they really did kind of it does seem like he was maybe either a jackeline Hyde or maybe invoking something not so nice I I I don't know if there were actual possessions of him or if they're saying they were possessions of the nuns but the nuns were doing sexual things with religious objects not just crucifixes um they were masturbating on statues they I mean they were they were doing some freaky decky you said you said in The Exorcist that the boy was kind of normal during the day like right like Urbane going to people's houses during the day okay and then at night he turns into a freaking demon and he's like doing all this crazy stuff with the nuns potentially correct because see I don't know I don't know how or I don't know what he did I don't know what happened he could have just been a Manor who got possessed and his man whoress went all sexy demon he kind of quote unquote put a spell over these girls and they would just get violently horny and do some crazy stuff with some religious objects and they started calling him a magician then it was like they decided to have these big hearings again so they do this trial the second trial and at the end of the trial they find him to be guilty so this time is he guilty of being a a Manor or is he guilty of being a demon he's guilty of being a witch essentially okay now that he's guilty it's execution time crazy thing is they tried to hang him lightning storm the lightning bolt hit the Noose and let free no so they were scared of him no [ __ ] they tried to hang the manor and lightning oh my goodness wow so then of course they were like oh my God you are a witch you are a witch like all these guys jumped on top of them and tied them down put all this wood around them and burned them alive damn that's a rough way to go and then they basically tried to say that the possession stopped with the nuns and then that was it everything stopped once herbane was gone so it was his fault kind of yeah well he was probably raping all 17 of those poor nuns the poor things were probably like scared out of their Wits of them and when the other priests came they were like please it's a demon right but to go back to the boy yeah how is this related to The Exorcist oh because of the the crucifix that scene yeah basically that was like the one piece still an interesting story absolutely so they stole that part and like inserted it into oh wow sorry no pun intended and they stole that story and put it in the Exorcist just for shock value that's what he took away from that story he's like hey this uh masturbation thing is way too interesting I'm throwing it into the Exorcist story you know you look at the story and there's a lot to it and it's a very interesting story I never heard about the loud and exorcisms I had no idea that that was kind of the Pinnacle of the the witch trial movement but yeah you look at the whole thing and that's the one piece you can pull out of this my friend that's it I no idea where is your head I mean that's obviously that's why they made this little boy into a girl so they could include that sexualization in there right what's what's a scary movie without a little bit of TNA right you got to like throw in a little sexualization or people aren't just going to watch your scary stuff and some of that vulgar talk where she's talking vulgarly about some of her body parts and stuff those that was also said to be some of the stuff that the nuns would do the whole sexual piece of The Exorcist is what came from the Lowden exorcism stories I wonder if it was the same demon you know right right that be interesting it could be we'll have to look and see a little deeper I can't believe you found that like how I never knew that and and you know like I said a a total Side Story but just that little piece that ties it in made it so worth finding out about that you know that makes the movie so much more interesting now just to know that it it's not just one beside the fact that it's a it's a true story that you can go to a college library and look up the actual documentation of people that experience this beyond that to know that there's these other interesting historical pieces that were pulled into do it like how interesting is that yeah because again you know that was like what almost 400 years ago amazing the things that you can find when you get high and go down a rabbit hole seriously seriously dig a Little Deeper smoke a little more you know that's actually good advice dig a Little Deeper smoke a little more things would be so much nicer so in the end these priests like did it man they rocked it well like what the seventh one they tried yeah right and no one would ever talk about it after that they just went on and lived their lives they wouldn't even release like technically like the last name or the real name of the kid that's why you don't know if it's Ronald or Roland or Robbie they're kind of sketchy about that the kid never admitted it like grew up all these years and never was like hey that was me I mean that kid's got to be like 80 right now if he's even still alive and never once publicly was like hey that was me just kept it quiet never said anything never tried to seek Fame but this guy heard about it and wrote a book about it and then it became a movie correct wild oh my God and we we think back at that you know that's that's like one of the original awesome horror movies of our lifetime you know we look back on some of those crazy Parts apparently they were one story or another all pretty much based on fact you know you got the Ouija board that open the portal you know you got the the story from Lowden where the manor priest is is burned alive for being you know supposedly witchcraft to like this poor little boy who's getting his body carved up by God knows what and then these priests that are doing whatever they can to try to save this kid and at least the priests and the parents didn't just like leave him in that Nut House God knows what happened to the poor kid right well let's see we have the bad priest and then the good priest to make up for it gotta like that just interesting to see that what what the true story of this was and it's documented and it's kind of weird that it actually is because that movie Diary from a priest there's a actual written diary from a priest of of what he experienced during this that's that's just crazy that's absolutely amazing nuts so what are you smoking tonight after that story I'm really really glad that I'm smoking some of my favorite Gorilla Glue although I think we're not supposed to call it that anymore I think we're supposed to call it g g like G or gg4 g Gigi number five G number four but yeah it's Gorilla Glue and I really I don't know why but yeah I don't think the company appreciated having their name associated with a marijuana cultivar but yeah so I'm smoking some Gigi number five from my my favorite delivery place the gas station it's pretty good I like it it's very tasty it's got a a really great high it's one of my favorites I I first started smoking it when I came out here to California and I I discovered it because the the garden shop that I went to had some clones and while we were waiting to get our Gorilla Glue clones they were packing bongs which they probably weren't supposed to do of their own homegrown gorilla glue and it was just so tasty and the Clones came out great growing it was easy smoking it was even easier very tasty so yeah tonight I'm smoking some Grill glue how about you sh what are you smoking this evening in the whole true Spirit of getting it at the store this time although mine's not delivery one of

all right shall spark up a pre-roll make sure you've got those lights turned on are you ready for a story uh oh let's see scare me all right you got here it goes like any good ghost story I'm gonna start with a dark and stormy night okay not really but it had just been storming and the wet pavement was black as ink there was a young couple let's call them Kim and Pete no reason they were parked on the shore of White Rock Lake which is near Dallas Texas and this is in the late 1920s and you can probably guess what this young couple was doing parked at the side of a lake in the middle of the night little Smoochy casy so after a little interlude of you know whatever a young couple gets up to in a car in the side of a lake they were getting ready to go home and they turn their lights on in the glow of the headlights they see the silhouette of a young woman dressed in a kind of sheer white dress outlined against the Dark Shadows of the lake this young woman moves closer to them and in the light of the headlights they can see that she is soaking wet from head to toe the dress is just clinging to her in the cold and her blonde hair it's always a blonde shell why is really right I don't know I think they think we're stupid like why so yeah so her blonde hair is soaked and just clinging to her face her shoulders and her back the poor thing is just drenched she's speaks in a faltering voice and she sounds distraught and her voice is horar as if she'd just been crying or really cold and haltingly she tells them that she had been on a boat on the lake with her fiance and her friends and that there had been an accident between sobs she says something about the boat capsizing and that all her friends are safe but she had somehow become separated them when trying to get to the shore and that she needs to go home and Pete being the gentleman that he is is gives her his coat to wrap around her scantily clad body and she climbs into the rumble seat of a car uh is it like the back seat not only is it a back seat but it's like picture an old like 1920s car where it's just like a two-seater right and then it has like this big trunk off the back well the trunk folds up backwards and basically makes a bench seat outside the car so that's your rumble seat or your mother-in-law seat right like it's like the monsters yes so it's like a it's like a trunk seat they're not actually sitting in the car with you they're like kind of outside the car so she decides to climb into the rumble seat of the car cuz she's soaking wet she doesn't want to squeeze in with the couple so she sits in the seat and gives them a dress that's just a few minutes away from the lake as the driving to this address Kim is like clinging up next to Pete and and nervously glancing at the young beautiful young woman in the rumble seat and she sees that this woman doesn't speak again but is just kind of sobbing quietly and staring off into the distance after a few minutes of this Kim notices that the young woman appears to have fallen asleep and when they get to the house and are pulling in the driveway Kim tells Pete not to wake the woman as they're pulling in because she just feels so terrible for her so they pull in and Pete Sprints to the door and knocks on it just hoping that there's someone going to be awake this late at night to retrieve this poor sad cold girl from his car the door opens and an older man looks kind of sleepy befuddled and confused and and then as Pete explains he starts to look sadly resigned Pete explains that this woman in white had given them an address this address and she appeared to be distraught and in need of help and Pete just really wanted to get her some help as Pete turns to point to the woman in the rumble seat so the gentleman can see her he sees that Kim is now standing outside the car holding his soaked jacket and the rumble seats empty now where'd she go right so she's nowhere to be seen and Kim looks really scared Pete's very confused at this point and the older man gently Pats him on the shoulder and with tears streaming down his face he tells Pete that years before his young daughter had died in a boating accident while celebrating her engagement oh yeah and every year since then someone has come to the house late at night claiming to have picked her up hitchhiking only to have her vanish before he gets there a yeah that's so [ __ ] isn't that so sad so it's like some people say that she's still trying to make her way home and and that she just can't quite do it now the thing about this story is that it's kind of repeated all over the country I'm sure you've heard something similar everywhere everywhere every single state I think has a hitchhiker ghost on a road kind of story you're were not wrong that is very very true there's like tons of them all over the place and the interest interesting thing about this one is that it was first published in a book uh in 1943 and it was called The Ghost of White Rock yeah it was written by a woman named Anne Clark and it was based on a story that apparently kids had been telling each other since the 30s in high school I did a little digging and tried to see if I could find if this actually had any truth to it because a lot of people seem to think that this is one of the places where this particular story had originated I dug around and I found that um the area originally belonged in the 1800s uh it originally belonged to two families the Daniel and the Cox families and they settled there and it was not a lake at that time it was just Farmland there was a little town nearby they had a private Cemetery that's still there to this day that has like 500 or so people buried in it and in 1910 construction began on White Rock Lake itself in response to a drought in the air so they just made it they just made the lake because of a water shortage so they basically took these farms and turned most of it into a leak and the cemetery is still there but not much else remains of what had been there during World War II it was used by the US Army to induct recruits and there were actually 403 German prisoners of War housed there so it didn't have the greatest history as a happy place so the lake itself was created in 1910 the earliest written account is the story that Anne Clark wrote in 1943 and she wrote it about stories again that had been circulating since the 1930s I did find that in May of 1929 now remember May so may of 1929 three young boys drowned there in a boating accident oh yeah so a group of kids I guess they used to regularly go out in these homemade boats and they would go fishing and on this particular day one of the boats capsized and three of the young boys uh in it drowned I feel like a homemade boat you're already taking your chances you'd think apparently get they did it regularly but on this particular day yeah their luck ran out but none of them are obviously a young woman so I didn't think that that although that fit the time frame and it is a tragedy that occurred in the lake it didn't really fit a story of a young woman there were two young women that died in the lake a Louise Ford Davis age 38 drowned herself there July 5th of 1935 broken her they think so her sister found a distressing note and alerted police and emergency responders rushed to the lake only to pull her lifeless body from it moments too late they did find a suicide note and her white gloves carefully folded in the seat of her car and it is rumored that it was a broken heart it's always a guy but again she didn't die in a boating accident true the second story that was easily found was another distraught woman this time and in November of 1942 a 35-year-old Rose stone committed suicide also by Drowning herself in the lake and she was discovered there after a brief search and she had a note pinned to the sweater that she drowned in um asking that her relatives be notified of her death I couldn't find any proof but that was also rumored to be of a broken heart that's just kind of a shitty Lake it gets worse shell I'm not going to this Lake no no do not go to this Lake it's freaking creepy yeah this is not even the beginning so after a little more dinging I did actually find what I think is the origin story of this ghost tell me tell me I got you we have the tragic drowning of hiy Enid Gaston this was in May again remember that month May yeah this was May 26 1927 Miss hiy 19 a teacher drowned in a boating accident when her boat and her friend that she was on with her friends capsized on White Rock Lake interestingly enough Louise and Rose the two women who committed suicide tragically in the lake are mentioned all over the place I can find mention of them everywhere hiy Enid Gaston was a lot harder to find and her story matches almost perfectly and so I just found it really odd that it was difficult to find any information about her at all oh wow yeah so she was 19 again a teacher recently engaged and she drowned tragically on the lake in a boating accident and this again was in 1927 and and the original story that had been published she had said that it was based on stories that teenagers had been telling themselves since the 30s that one really fits there have been numerous documented stories of a ghost in this area on White Rock Lake and some of they're different areas of the lake and they differ in a few stories some of them the woman says that she uh was with friends some say that she was on a dock uh sometimes she says she has to get home or she has to get to her fiance some people think that there might be multiple ghosts here because of there's so many different sightings and and different things it's like a hot bed there it is like a hot bed and locals say that there are places that are so creepy that they won't go there during the day let alone at night it almost makes me want to go there just because they said that swi you're not going in the lake but you want to go there to investigate right right oh no I'm not going swimming no you know who knows what's gonna be grabbing my foot and pulling me down no way oh Absolut well see here's the thing those again were not the only lives that this lake has claimed more recently in July of 2012 a young man named Joe Steven Cunningham he died on the lake after he and his son were pal boarding and a a freak gust of wind knocked them over over and his son was able to swim to safety but the father was unable to make it out and they found him wow yeah they found him drowned after a brief search and then so this just keeps happening this just keeps happening in May again of 2014 Jeremy doy also 21 and a friend jumped off the Mocking Bird lane bridge over the lake and doy unfortunately had trouble swimming back and sank and his friend escaped unharmed holy [ __ ] yeah a lot of these people were around 20 the boys that I mentioned that that perished um one was 12 one was 17 and one was 19 so a lot of young people one of the saddest stories associated with this lake is in October of 2015 a woman Patty Stevens uh I believe she was in her early 50s she committed suicide um by turning her car on in her garage and she lived in a home in a suburb on White Rock Lake and the reason she committed suicide is that her beloved husband of 25 years had been killed days previously by a machete wielding man as he jogged around White Rock Lake Jason Vorhees this actually I couldn't help myself yeah no this sadly was a mentally ill former football player but yeah so this man was as he jogged around White Rock Lake and his wife then committed suicide because she it was too much wow that's not all there's more there's more the most recent one that I saw was in June of 2017 a saleboat capsized on White Rock Lake again with a boat capsizing again after a freak strong gust of wind and a man and a woman got dumped in the water the woman was safely pulled out but the man couldn't be seen and after a short search they found his Bonnie oh this is like this is like a bad place where is this again Austin Texas where is near Dallas Texas this is called White Rock Lake it is a park near Dallas Texas and the urban legend around this Lake there have been so many sightings of people picking up this hitchhiker that reers digest reader digest named White Rock Lake is one of the world's most haunted bodies of water in 2018 oh wow yeah that wasn't that that like that wasn't like 20 years ago that was just a couple years ago that was just a couple years ago but interestingly enough nean Marcus comes to play in this Lady of the Lake Legend how so in 1953 there was another book published uh it was about Neiman Marcus Texas the story of The Proud Dallas store and in this book U Mr guy Malloy who was the director of display for Neiman Marcus at the time he recounts a story in which he's driving home after work and a beautiful blonde girl again blonde girl blonde girl appears on the side of the road soaked only she's in a very fine dress that his wife says is obviously from the nean Marcus store and she said well duh of course it is and the wife says stop guy that girl seems to be in trouble she must have fallen in the lake her dress is wet can you tell I'm using my 1920s accent you know I wish you had the outfit so yeah okay imagine me in I'm gonna do it again imagine me in a flapper dress stop guy that girl seems to be in trouble she must have fallen in the lake her dress her dress is wet you can tell that it is a very fond dress she certainly got it at the store meaning of course nean Marcus of course of course so the girl asked them to take her to an address on nearby Gaston Avenue and she doesn't say why she's soaking wet and they're of course too polite to ask and when they get there the girl is gone but the back seat is wet just a damp spot remains as usual and same thing they go to the door tell the gentleman who answers the door and he says that it was his blonde daughter who loved to wear nothing but Neiman Marcus clothes had drowned two years before when she fell off a pier at White Rock Lake oh wow then nean Marcus clothes make it sound kind of funny but interestingly enough guy Malloy did not ever add that part that was actually added by his wife much later the original story that he had been telling for years to people he was kind of reluctant you know you would have to kind of get him to tell it and in it there was no trace of Neiman Marcus clothes but he did say that he had picked up a young woman and she didn't talk much but gave him an address and he put her he wrapped his jacket around her because she was cold again no NE Miss Marcus clothes in his telling of the story took her home and then she was gone and only his jacket remained you know one one thing I noticed about both of our stories is the real people involved aren't necessarily jumping out there to tell their story to everybody it's almost like they kind of shy away from it and other people tell it they kind of try to hide from it it seems like the people that that had it happen are are a little reluctant to speak about it and and in this particular case it got very much embellished by his wife she obviously threw the Neiman Marcus bent into it but well yeah but there are a lot of different stories there the Dallas newspaper has several different accounts of people writing in it was pretty easy for me to find people who have said that they have had something similar happen or have know someone that something something similar had happened to interestingly enough like you had said at the beginning of our conversation it it is part of Americana it's like woven into so many different states and a lot of them do seem to have a similar origin story maybe not quite as early as this one but they're out there you know I I think that part of that is there are people who just go in a bad way and and and their Spirit their their whatever sticks there you know like that we've heard it all you know somebody was doing whatever got killed on the side of the road and then they're forever walking on that side of the road it's like their their Spirits stuck there and I think that's what maybe makes that a universal Coast to Coast story is because unfortunately bad [ __ ] happens to people and when they die they sometimes get stuck in that location and sometimes that location is a deep dark Road you know I my personal theory for that is that a lot of these hauntings are I guess I think the term a lot of people use is residual hauntings meaning that it's not really like someone's spirit or their ghost that's there it's more like something so bad so emotional or so powerfully so psychically powerful happened to a person in this location that it kind of recorded itself somehow on that time and space and sometimes people when they stumble into that they can they can feel that energy there or they might actually be able to see that recording play out in the form of a of a wet blonde hitchhiker I I believe it I believe it yeah who knows it's interesting to me that so many different people even some of them seemingly not having any knowledge about the history again the original woman that I found hiy she was very difficult to find I did not see her name all over the place even though her story most closely matches the ghost story so it was kind of kind of strange to me to see that the sto the ghost stories follow the original story very closely even though that one's not the popular tale that's told right and again you know the these original people that these are these are based on are the people that aren't trying to brag about it and tell everybody who will listen they shy away from it yeah they keep it kind of close to the V so true all right I need to have some of this Gorilla Glue oh excuse me G not allowed to call it that GG that makes it sound like the cat from Kiki's Delivery Service love that movie love that movie I love your story this week sh what have you got in store for us next week so next week I'm gonna take it to a scary place you know like I
