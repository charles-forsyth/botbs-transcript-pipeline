welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and today we'll be talking about what to expect at Pagan festivals shell and I are huge Festival fans most of our 20s and 30s and okay even still now are spent going from music festivals to Pagan festivals to drum circles and local Pagan camping events the types of festivals differed but pagans could be found in large numbers in every single one of them today we're talking about what to expect when attending a Pagan or Pagan likee festival with us we have representatives from two different types of festivals Castro and Hank from dragonfest in Colorado and Rob from Fairy Festival in New York state now dragonfest has been around for a little while from the 1980s yes that's correct it's been around quite a while in the mountains of Colorado and it's celebrated every August and you guys welcome people from all religions and spiritual Traditions according to your website but they work workshops and rituals mostly focus on neopagan Wiccan and earth-based spiritual practices so welcome to Hank and Castro and we also want to welcome Rob who's joining us today from the fery festival and the fery festival is located in aaga New York in the woods in Upstate New York gorgeous place you need to go there fairy Festival is now correct me if I'm wrong Rob this is kind of a Music and Arts Festival arts and fantasy the theme is kind of very fantasy mythical so while this is not a festival that's marketed at pagans it is marketed for everyone it's obviously a place that attracts a lot of pagans as well as mundane people it's perfect for friends families and anyone looking for a little bit of enchantment in their lives uh fery Festival is one weekend a year so it's a Friday Saturday Sunday it is most like a renaissance fair and that we do have a jousting tournament every day there we also have three stages for music a lot of character actors and we probably get anywhere between three and 5,000 people every year wow that's mostly day Trippers so these are people that come in the morning and we close the gates I think at 7 or 7:30 or something like that but there's a good five or 600 of us that stay overnight and enjoy the nighttime activities which are adult wise at least a lot more fun now fair f very Fest has been going on for about 15 or so years right yeah roughly 15 16 years something like that we did miss a couple of years so it's like with Co and all how do you how do you say how long the festival has been going because we missed two years of it I think covid got everyone isn't it kind of a A Midsummer dream yes that's that's the theme the tagline of it is the New York fairy Fest the midsummer's dream and it's uh the last weekend in June every year Castro or Han could you tell us a little bit about dragonfest so dragonfest is a regional neopagan spiritual Retreat it takes place in the mountains near biley Colorado every August 2024 will be our 39th year of putting on Dragon fests um similar to what Rob said dragonfest had two years where we didn't have a festival because of covid and then we had one year where we had to cancel the entire Festival because the fire danger was so intense that we just it wasn't safe um but other than that we have been doing it every year uh since the 1980s as you had said and Hank here has actually been going for most of that time so I'm gonna turn it over to Hank and have him talk about some of those early days yeah I've been going about 35 36 years to it uh been on the board twice so I'm familiar with it but yeah it's it's a regional Festival well not really a festival but a religious retreat but it enjoys a membership that actually extends up into Canada and we've even had people come from overseas so it's it's got quite a wild wide appeal basically it's it's Pagan oriented but as you mentioned it's uh Neo wian and and Garian and all the earth-based religions but it is a religious retreat primarily now Rob real quick to kind of touch on that because that was one of the first questions we actually wanted to ask you guys who is fair Fest aimed at like I say it's a Fantasy Fest so for some people their fantasy and their religion all go together right but not for everybody so this is just like a Renaissance Fair it's open to the public that includes everybody and so the spiritual aspects of it are more the fact that we're deeply in nature but there's no rituals particularly that go on there or or other things like that there a lot of the other festivals I go to and you know I go a bunch of them um have more of that there are some that are very entertainment based and some that are very much work-based and so I'm within the same group I mean in for rights of spring which is in Massachusetts and that's a that's a fun party of things and a lot of spiritual stuff happening there too and the rituals there are awesome um and there's a lot of entertainment there's concerts and things like that and the same group in the fall does twilight coveting and there is no vending there is no concert there is no entertainment it's about doing the work and that's because of that different shift and focus it's uh it's wonderful for a whole bunch of very different reasons than the other one is wonderful that's a very good point there are quite a few different types of festivals that you can go to there's more of the spiritual Retreat of the type that dragonfest is uh like you said Twilight coving is all about doing the magical work it's about not necessarily going to party but going to get deeply magical and in tune with your magical self some like fairy Festival are aimed at mundane people but have a heavy Pagan contingent that come to it depending on the type of Festival that you want to go to you kind of have to do a little bit of research on it but they all have a lot in common as well particularly that pagans love to go to all of these different types of festivals so for a spiritual festival for a festival where magic and and doing the work is the important part what can someone who has never been to a festival maybe expect so when they first step onto the land for dragonfest say what would they expect to see or to do in a typical day uh in a typical day I mean there are workshops during the day that focus on things like uh making drums or how to put together a public ritual or you know what people have experience in most of the time these people have uh a decade or decades of experience in putting these workshops together so there's that and and typically in the evening there are there is a ritual of some sort sometimes during the day we've had drawing down the sun we've uh done other rituals as well some of them quite fun we had a a chocolate ritual and a flower frenzy ritual and some other ones yeah and that's what you get and breakfast of course and some of the other things it's a lot of fun now could could you describe a a typical same question typical day at fairy Fest so I get to fairy Fest and I walk through the gate and then uh the first thing you hit there is a stage there usually some musician playing some cool music out there and then there's right at the entrance there is the food area so there's uh vendors there that sell food and as you walk up the path there's other other vendors that are basically selling uh stuff they make and Magic IAL stuff so I had this question asked me the other day like where can I get a pair of ears or where can I get a pair of wings so that I can go to the Festival you can get them at the festival the people there make the very best stuff once you get past that then you're into the areas uh where there's performances in kids my friend Ed is there too he's our local blacksmith for the fairy Fest you get to watch people hammering hot steel into shapes that's right past the jousting field which is near the Star State stage which is also where the uh some of the comedic actors hang out in that area too and there's some insane people there it's awesome there's this one guy that's the cello Goblin and he climbed up into a tree like 30 feet standing on a branch that's like not even the thickness of a baseball bat standing up there with his cello playing so he walks through the woods and you hear this music and you can't tell where it's coming from and then you look up and there's this there's this lunatic and he's really good so it's it's a lot of fun as you go further there's the troll bridge there's seders there's there's the Mermaid Cove there's so many different things and those are all the the fantasy aspect of it I mean really the joust is fantasy too because they're not really Knights what I'm hearing is fairy Festival festivals like that more of a Renaissance festival type are more for experiencing you go and there's vendors and there's things to see and there's actors and there's people there and then if you camp at night that's when there might be you know the music around a campfire and that's when you might have a little bit more access to more concentrated number of pagan oriented people yeah one night there is a concert night with a masquerade ball so that's up at a stage in a a dance floor that you don't even see if you're a Day Tripper not spending the night there so that happens on one night the other night is an interactive drum circle with we have a dragon that's 8 foot tall she she's on uh spring tilts and she's got two different Dragon outfits one of them has long wings with these lit lines on them that are like neon and the other one actually has fire coming out of her wing tip she's hidden you know a couple of propane tanks in her outfit somewhere does she fly over from Colorado to get there is that what's going on I don't think from Colorado I think she's an East Coast Dragon oh okay okay I didn't know if they related to dragonfest or not but there's fire Spinners and they're singing There's bun of other stuff we also have a lot of um music mainly drumming there are drum circles there several different ones for different purposes and some entertainment we're we're toying with the idea of actually having a a talent night and entertainment involved it's about the magic Hank would you say that dragonfest is more for the experienced practitioner or is it also for a new practitioner you can be totally inexperienced or not even in involved in the Pagan community and show up and have a good time and we we invite and accept all religions it doesn't matter I mean you could be uh Southern Baptist and we don't really care come aead on if you want to experience the Earth Magic nice from what I have experienced in my time going to festivals like dragonfest one of the big draws for me is being able to go and do workshops these are usually practitioners who have been doing something for a while or are experts in a subject or have a lot of knowledge they'd like to share and the workshops that you can find at these festivals are so much fun and so amazing you can learn meditation you can learn ritual craft you can learn different I don't know you can learn Fire spinning you can learn anything different types of magic and and so that's a big draw to go and be able to do these classes some of the some of the workshops we've had one time this guy set up a sweat lodge and did a Native American rituals and introduce people to do that I at one point had a me making Workshop I've been making me for like 30 years and it's it's those kind of things not just the the magical side but where the magical side and the mundane side intersect absolutely yeah the me making um workshop and the me tasting Workshop are very very popular yes there is absolutely and the drumming and now rob you mentioned fairy wings and I know for Fairy Festival a big draw is the the actors and the skits and the wonderful little things that are going on all around and the fact that everybody that comes to the door can dress up you can be whatever type of fairy mystical Enchanted creature you want in fact you're encouraged and there's vendors there for every Delight anything that you want to look like you can and and that is absolutely fun I highly recommend festivals like fairy Festival if you're a little bit in the broom closet because everyone goes to these they're for everyone you don't have to be a pagan but you can go and be very Pagan under the radar but with that in mind wings and and looking like the Fay what's a dress code what do I wear if I'm going to something like Dragon Fest or fairy Fest so dragonfest has uh what we call be country um and so it's just a section of dragonfest that is section off from everything else where you can be nude in nature if you would like and have the freedom to as long as you are in the bare country area to be as naked as you want to be I love that you call it bare country and it's b a r e like be butt I love it yes and um and you can be as naked as you'd like there uh nobody's going to tell you to put a shirt on or bother you about it at all and um then once you go into the main bestest area you are expected to be what we would consider Beach appropriate so you know you need to be wearing a top and bottoms but other than that we don't really have a dress code and one of the things that I really love about dragonfest is watching people Express themselves through clothing that they wouldn't normally get to wear in their mundane lives either because it doesn't match their physical gender expression or their physical gender that they were born with or because their job has a strict dress code or they're you know they have a specific position in their community that they they have to live professional and so people show up to dragonfest and they wear costumes and they wear beautiful regalia and they have a great time I think that's one of the my favorite things about Dragon Fest I'm glad you mentioned Bear Country because a lot of festivals will have that I know fairy Festival does not because this is more of a mundania thing um yeah it's open to the whole public so it's really you have to keep that in mind yes so dress code there is what you'd wear in public if you're a fairy right or costume the other thing in dragonfest is we're very concerned about privacy so we keep that you can show up and nobody will know um we we use um codes in the registration and such to maintain privacy because some people show up and they could be in the middle of a divorce or something who knows and so the legal aspects are there as well sure and anytime you you have nakedness involved you know you have to be a little careful a lot of places that shell and I have been to uh refer to it as skyclad or we'll have a skyclad area which as we all know is clothed only in the sky or in the air just means naked real fancy word for naked which is wonderful a lot of people love to be out in the air in your own skin it's a great way to be but there are rules around it like you were saying Hank there's privacy you know no picture taking especially if there are skyclad or bare country areas keep your camera to yourself get permission in everything towel etiquette and how about towel rules shell you want to bring up some good towel rules use one that's that's the best rule we have we have been to a place out in Western New York a Brushwood folklore Center which is a clothing optional place and that's where I learned about towel etiquette if you are going to be clad or in bare country I love that term by the way you know have a towel with you something to sit on be polite no one wants to be sitting on your icky bits after you so my best advice to folks uh that that choose to go to clothing optional or no clothing type events have a towel to sit on be respectful please yes and definitely ask permission um before you hug anyone touch anyone particularly if you are skyclad and For the Love of All That is Holy please shower before you get in the hot tub all I ask if you do one thing shower before you get in the hot tub it is not your personal claw foot tub that's Leila's PSA thank you now I just just so we we didn't get off track Rob was there anything else that you wanted to add about the dress code or lack thereof at fairy Fest can I come to fairy Fest if I don't have wings and I don't have things can I just come in a t-shirt and shorts is that okay of course of course just just to get ready for the weather but check it out and see what's going to happen yeah it's uh it's fairly relaxed there but there there is no nudity there because we have we are open to the general public and I can get my face painted once I get there right oh you can get there yeah yeah you can get that a lot of people are doing that there there's a lot of things you you can do there but again that's just fairy fast and I go to a lot of different ones uh free spirit down in Maryland is usually in the hot bit of the summer and they've got a pool or two there and um you know the whole place except for instead of having a skyclad area they have a small non- skyclad area so it's like this is the area that like if you if you are skyclad you should cover up when you go into that area and and that's that one then there's things like rights of spring which are um they have smaller areas that are are open for nudity but um it's usually cold so you don't really see much of that there you know it's in the mountains of Massachusetts and so it's a bit of a pre you don't see a lot of that but it's not because people are prudish it's because it's cold and that's about it one of the things that I did want to touch on there too um if you're concerned about nudity and all of that stuff is many of these places that your festivals your camping at will have bathrooms and shower facilities and for the most part most of the ones that I've been to do are very they don't care about gender right so there's not a women's shower and a men's shower many of these things it's four showers on site you know four shower areas and sometimes those showers are lined up Outdoors that's true sometimes yes and I do want to touch on the fact that we're talking a lot about nudity and that does not mean that these are crazy sex fests the biggest no the biggest thing with pagans is we just like to be free and open and we don't really care what your body presentation is you be you come as you are be naked be not naked be comfortable it's more of a being in your own skin being outdoors and just kind of being connected in that way exactly it's more of just a freedom and being connected to Nature and to life and to the air and all of it it's it's very beautiful and so I find that it's very very respectful I find that people when their skyclad tend to be more open I guess more more because you're very vulnerable in that type of position but it it's more of a magical thing and not anything you ever have to do just be respectful do what's comfortable for you and go from there one thing you should probably touch on too is the the whole concept of polyamory because that is very common at Pagan festivals and it's again it's not something you have to do or have to get into right but just uh you know at least open your mind to the Poss possibility of if you see this couple together and they're obviously connected and then later one of them is connecting with somebody else whe they're holding hands or kissing or whatever uh it's not necessarily somebody's cheating on somebody and right I mean just just know that there's a lot of options out there and that's one of the things about Freedom means you can do this or you can choose not to do this right it's not a one- siiz fits-all world out there it just isn't you know just like relationships gender expression however you want to be is cool with us we want you to be happy where you're at and we'll help you get there if we can but we just that's really what we're looking one of the things that we really focus on at dragonfest is safety and it is a community in the truest sense of the word if somebody is acting inappropriately it gets reported and uh dealt with so it's more than anything else we try to make it because of the nudity because of the the legal aspects again uh we try to be very very conscious of the member safety and I've found and shell I think you and I have both been to quite a few of the same festivals people are super sweet and open you know they'll ask to hug you they'll ask to hold your hand and this is decades ago I'm not talking about just the last couple years I'm talking about you know in the '90s when we were first going to these places consent informed consent and being you know who you are was super important and it always has been I've always found at these places communication is Paramount and people's safety has been of a prime concern so if you ever feel uncomfortable you know talk to someone mention it to anyone and these places are right there to get swiftly handled absolutely now just so we don't focus on that too terribly much I don't want us to all go off on a tangent I'm I'm G to pose a question to all three of you and I'll start with Rob if you want to go first and answering what do you think the importance is of events like these to the Greater Community whether it be the Pagan Community or just the community in general who wants to go spend a day in a Fantasy Fair world what is the importance of these events um the importance is really for me and I can only speak for myself on it if this is the stuff that you like and really works well for you once you go to one of these things you feel a lot less alone a lot less isolated a lot like am I the only one like this no you're not whatever it is that you're like you're not the only one like that there's Bunches of people and it's nice to hang out with people that have a shared sense of wonder a shared sense of spirit a shared sense of non- judgmentalness a shared sense of being weird right exactly I understand the whole uh welcoming all religions and I'm I'm pretty open to a lot of different religions there are some aspects that I'm not open to at all and one of them is the uh what and this could come from any religion we have the right answer we are the one true yeah and it's like yeah well no you're not you're just nobody is one size do at all red flag red flag don't come to a pagan uh Festival to try to find like I just Jesus is example non-christians in order to convert them and save them don't do that nobody appreciates it no one's going to try to convert you or they shouldn't anyways you'll find lots of things to get involved with people would love to have you come play with them but no one's gonna try to convert you this this isn't conversion Camp folks right and that's honestly that's the biggest part for me of of pagan life in general is that the whole idea of frtiz or that we have the one true answer and that everybody else is wrong and therefore our enemies and therefore less than just doesn't occur because that's all just so much I don't have time for it none of us do now krel same question to you um and and I I know that you're you guys are kind of almost I don't want to say a learning Festival but kind of like a learning festival with the workshops and the classes and such so what is your take on the importance of these types of festivals for the Greater Community I think like Rob said the Bigg biggest benefit is connection with people who are like you people who aren't going to other you because you're different or because they think that your religion is evil my first year I actually had a really hard time showering after the festival that's over because felt like I was washing off this like happy Pagan girl who had made so many friends and you know I was using my community name at dragonfest instead of my mondane name and it it's just like it's so welcoming and it's such a great Community it feels like you're with the people you're always meant to be with and it it just felt like me and it was very hard to go back to normal life after that but I think specifically too for dragonfest because it's outdoors and it's in the mountains there is that chance to reconnect with nature a lot of us live in cities for various reasons that's where the jobs are maybe that's where we were born and it's hard to connect with nature harder to connect with nature in cities so for dragonfest being set in this beautiful remote area don't have much cell reception everything's in a tent or outside you don't have to follow your calendar or your clock quite as much I mean of course we like you to be on time for workshops and rituals but other than that you're you're really free and I think that's a great feeling and I also wanted to bring up uh Leila and I have participated in festivals that are based in hotels and that is yet again a whole different experience um because you are in a public Hotel you know it's not like they cordon off the whole hotel uh for these things so you know there are people there that aren't participating and that in itself is also a whole different vibe equally beneficial and I I love the hotel festivals just as much but definitely a different vibe because you are just kind of in the in the big ballrooms and conference rooms um and even when they hold rituals the rituals are ballrooms and the conference rooms but you still hotel or not you still get that sense of community um that sense of reconnecting and having the ability and the opportunity to go to workshops and participate in classes but I agree with everything you said Kestrel I've actually been um to where fairy Fest is held and I get the whole you just want to step on the land and again fairy Fest is a very family oriented more fantasy type place but if you are of the Pagan persuasion stepping on the land where fairy Fest is you can't replace that we have the same feeling about the land where dragonfest takes place for the last what is it Hank like 12 years maybe dragonfest has been um on some private land that is leased to us for the duration of the Fest we have a wonderful relationship with the landowner she attends Dragon Fest as as well it kind of feels like home for some people I think because we have this intense relationship with the land owner and the land itself and I think that's the same story actually with fairy Fest wouldn't you agree Rob oh definitely I mean our own local community here has been doing work on that land and rituals on that land for a lot longer than fairy Fest has been around so that adds to it that adds to the energy of the land it changes it and the land changes us we're it does I do think think that going to festivals is definitely a transformative experience and one of the things that will absolutely get your blood pumping and change you is the nightly bonfires the rituals and the drum circles uh that they have at night now rob you have been my drum Guru for a very long time you introduced for as long as I've had a drum it's been you rob my drums are yours built and rebuilt them danc around a bonfire and drumming is something that is a phenomenal part of outdoor festivals and that too comes with some etiquette you know what do I expect if I'm going to a drum circle around a bonfire what types of things should I do or should I not do there anything that you can think of you know that a newbie might want to know going into a say a drum circle what types of things should someone you know expect for that dragonfest has several different drum Circles of different purposes one is a trance Circle specifically for transing another one that we call Freedom Circle where you go to express yourself and and just have a good time uh clothing optional we don't don't bring a glass container to a drum circle don't you know you've got to be careful of of people injuring themselves also uh there some of the people dance together some don't you mentioned consent and other things like that so just be respectful more than anything else and uh and aware yeah I would say also just um as Hank had said kind of be aware of the the safety needs of the site if you feel like you're maybe too inebriated to safely dance around the fire take a short break and sit down for a little while sober up and then as far as etiquette goes one of the most serious uh etiquette things that we try to follow at dragonfest is not to touch someone else's drum unless they have said that you may do that um because drums can be expensive or they might have been Handmade by the the drummer and they hold tremendous emotional value for that person they know how to take care of it they know how to play it to its best you know ability and they may not want to share their drum with somebody so um definitely asking permission before using SP drum and I don't know if this is most of the Dr Drum circles I've been to where at dragonfest but um a lot of our drummers will offer I have this spare drum would you like to join us and help drum and then the other part of etiquette is try to stick to the beat that the drummers are going on and don't don't try to change it to the beat that you want to have because it does kind of mess with the flow a little bit you can hear the other drummers kind of tripping up to try and match the new beat just kind of let things flow organically I was actually gonna ask Rob that yes I'm biased look at Rob is is my drum God like Ila does Rob what is the etiquette for a person that is never drummed before brand new to drumming um you know hey I this that sounds good that looks like fun I want to do that what do you do and and and I want to start off with and because I talk with my hands start with you know do you wear jewelry while you drum you know what is etiquette if I go to a festival and a drummer hands me a drum and says you want a Dr and I'm like hey I've never done this before biggest thing is communication and ask around cuz each place will be a little different I go to a ton of festivals so uh each one's different on the East Coast typically this has been the rule in a lot of places but not all if you're playing your drum and you don't want anybody else to use it when you stop playing either take it with you or put a cover on it if you see one sitting at a bench just a drum there by itself without a drum cover on it you're more than welcome to play that but that's at those festivals that have that rule and that not all festivals so yeah you should not wear Rings it's going to damage the skin it can damage your rings it can do a bunch of other things too um there are also other instruments that get played sometimes and you have to be wor about that you might be the best uh musician in the world but it's a drum circle which means there's room for everybody to play percussion play together uh if you're playing an in strument which really demands an audience then that's probably not a good one to bring right like like K said there's different circles a lot of times I I've seen uh at some of the festivals I go to there'll be a dig Dome where it's a little more of a mellow Vibe and they're doing Digos or quieter things there might be a a slam like a slam poetry a spoken word Circle sometimes there'll be guitars and flutes and all sorts of different instruments but the if it's a big time drum circle you can try to f a flute in I've heard a few people do it and do it successfully or different instruments but typically it's it's just drums a drum circle yeah and you will very often a couple people mentioned this so I do want to touch on the fact that at most places that I have been to there's a a designated area where the drummers will usually be and a lot of times they will leave their instruments there and like Rob said you should ask you if it's covered or uncovered sometimes there's unspoken rules there over who can use them or when you can use them best thing to do is just leave it and ask someone before you touch it again consent even in Drums is is an important thing so you'll see drums or instruments laying all over even when there's no one there but just make sure you ask before you touch them because that's pretty common sight yeah and honestly for most beginning drummers they have a fear built into them because the drum is a very powerful instrument and most people aren't used to being the musician they're used to going in sing to the music that somebody else is playing but now you get to play and that's the other egalitarian thing of the drum circle is that it's a circle you can all play now a lot of the ones at least here on the East Coast they take the the mode of the flying ice cream cone the what flying ice cream cone yes it is a like a V of chairs or benches okay shaped like an ice cream cone okay and then and the the ice cream is the fire so people won't be all around the circle drumming generally speaking they're generally on those benches or nearer to the benches than on the other side and I've been to places where they're drumming all around equally but honestly if you're a dancer and you go around a big drum circle you'll hear this particular Rhythm being played and you'll go 30 more feet and it's different Rhythm because they can't hear each other that well yes right they're playing what's there's also the the concept of what what you're doing there as well that's an important thing there's the the whole concept of the alchemical drum circle which I love it's container magic you're basically making a circle you're drawing a line you're casting a circle whatever it is you're making a a designated area you're taking your stuff there you're adding energy to it you're heating the B Jesus out of it you're boiling away all the lead and leaving you with gold that's where the whole Alchemy thing comes in and Lead is philosophical lead and that goes away in a drum circle or it should get burned away in a drum circle ego the sense of ego goes away too you'll have you'll see people out there with the big 18inch Remos gang gang gang gang you know playing like crazy people call them all sorts of things you know uh roosters uh shooting stars because they they play hard and fast for 20 minutes and show off and uh then they're done they're just freaking done 20 minutes they're done they go away I just wanted to mention that drug invest actually has a beginning drum Workshop um that we usually hold early on in the week we've had it every year for the last several years so I kind of want to say that it's a it's a staple at this point now do people have to bring their own drum or can necessarily A Drum yeah sometimes we do have the ability to provide a few drums but we recommend that people try to bring something they can bang on okay because there may not be enough to go around depending on how many people attend the workshop but we do have a beginning drumming workshop and that usually takes place early in the week so that people can then show up to the drum circles and practice a little bit more now we've talked a lot about drumming and drum circles and alchemical drum circle fires am I going to get any sleep at night no yes maybe no yes maybe that that sounds about right so at Dragon Fest we do have quiet hours yes it depends on where you camp as well I mean if you want to live next to the drum circle you can but there are also family areas and quiet areas uh for those of us who are not quite feeling as boisterous so it's it's trying to be as inclusive as possible and make sure you ask before you pick your campsite when if you go to some place that has these a lot of times they will go well into the wee hours of the morning if not all night and all morning so please be aware if you have small children if you need sleep if you need quiet you're going to want to bring your earplugs and you're going to want to ask where the quiet camping or where the family camping is and stay away from where the drum circles are yeah we we label it pretty prominently on the map where it is yeah a pro tip for that is I don't care how much fun you're having or what workshops are going on or what druming and and singing and dancing you need to not forget to sleep and eat at festivals because hydrate you can find yourself 16 hours in and not realize it and you need to eat take that sleep break take that food break don't forget those things cuz they are vital to your experience indeed they are if you're coming to the desert mountains in colado the other thing you really need to be careful of is hydration it's very dry it's also high in UV up in the higher elevations and the first thing that you notice when you start to dehydrate is you get a headach and it goes downhill from there uh it's something to be really really careful of yeah one of the one of the benefits to dragonfest serving breakfast is that you know everybody shows up it's a social hour but also we're we're getting at least one meal into you for the whole day and we we watch you eat it not literally but we're all hanging out you know eating breakfast together and then um at dragonfest we actually have a phrase that we yell at each other randomly throughout the day which is hippies hydrate um so that people remember because sometimes you're having a really good time and you have your water bottle on you but you are not drinking it so yeah we we about I would say six or seven times a day somebody will go over their radios that we all use to contact each other and they'll say hippie hydrate then everybody yells hippie hydrate everybody takes this s from that water bottle and you are supposed to be hydrating with water not other substances another question that I think is important for listeners and that is you know we've talked about water and food and clothing what do you bring to a festival Rob if I'm coming and I'm camping for the weekend what am I bringing always a small flashlight always some bug repellent unless you're one of those lucky naturally bug repellent people always some sunblock us let say you don't always know what the weather's going to turn into I would add that uh it's also useful to bring incense because the bathrooms don't always smell that great I thought that was a pretty cool tip nothing like a porta potty in July yeah that can be a bit ripe speaking of yeah bring your baby wipes you know bring your regular camping stuff bring baby wipes if that's going to help you stay clean you know bring your shower things bring your musical instruments if you have a drum if you have a guitar bring your ritual Garb like we were saying in the beginning dress like a fairy dress like a pagan bring all the beautiful colorful whatever things you want to bring um a lot of times places will have themed days or themed events so you might want to look at that to see what you want to bring uh we've met Brushwood folklore Center their festivals Sirus and S usually have themed days after each element so you might want to bring something to wear to match that color or to to match that element so check the websites check what they've got maybe they have a you guys mentioned a masquerade ball Rob I think and then do you guys have anything like that cast where people can dress up special so some years we have an event we call the Unicorn parade which is a gender expression parade and we encourage people to dress in the way that they would like to and then we parade through the site and I we I haven't heard whether that is going to occur yet this year it's put on by a very specific member of our community and that person has taken a different role this year so we will see if we'd offer the Unicorn parade but regardless we encourage people to dress however they would like at dragonfest as long as they are clothed in the clothing appropriate areas and they are also taking into account that we are sitting at 8,000 ft in Colorado and so it can be a little bit iffy as to what the weather's going to be we've had years where it's hot and sunny and dry the entire time had years where it rains every afternoon we actually had snow a couple of times we do recommend that people are capable of layering up okay so my two big Festival mus haves okay Hank you said incense and honestly that's one of them but the other two are a hula hoop and a journal I love to have those I have to have those things at a festival and I'm a weirdo I do this when we're tent camping at festivals too I actually set up an altar and bring tarot cards yes awesome for the three of you we're gonna start with you Hank yes what is your one unusual item that you love to bring to a festival a cot hey that's cheating that's a camping item but that's a good point otherwise you're sleeping on the ground being comfortable sleeping is important honestly I bring divination tools more than anything else uh you can get some amazing readings when you're on the land when you're in circle which the whole dragonfest the the opening ritual cast Circle and uh brings it all to a magical space so divination stuff thank you for mentioning that Hank because I forgot about that I love that yeah cestro what's your one must bring uh my one was one must bring is I bring an entire tote full of clothes because I love changing my clothes I love wearing a different outfit for every single ritual that we have and sometimes we have multiple per day so I change my clothes a lot and then I have outfits that are just for the drum circle and so yeah I bring an entire like cooler sized rubber made tote full of clothes I love it the Pagan fashion Diva I love people that go all out like that so thank you cuz it's so much fun I can't afford it yeah and so the other thing I also do is I bring um a tub of clothes that I'm no longer wearing that I just string up on my tent you know or somewhere in Camp and people come by and they're like oh hey could I have this I'm like yeah that's what it's there for I'm G to cut in really quickly because that's something I see a lot and I love it and people will often outside their camping area or sometimes there'll be a designated vendor or area they'll have little free libraries or they'll put out you know this is free and and you can just come take it so if you have things that you have outgrown or no long use bring them with you know add to that uh add to that Community we actually have a ritual around that we call it The Giving Tree ritual and it takes place at the very end of Fest and the idea is that if you have magical tools or specifically like ritual clothing not necessarily just costumes but ritual clothing ritual tools magical items that no longer serve you can bring them to the G tree ritual we do it around this huge Pine Tree on the land and you can place your item there and then take something with you that you feel serves you better love that now Rob what's what's your must have and you can't say a drum I like to have a folding chair that is easy enough to carry that I can drum in and most of the typical camp chairs they're like butt hammocks you hang backwards and you can't drum them yeah I don't bring those right mine's more like a director's chair but sure so the canvas on the where you're sitting is straight across and tight so you're not leaning back the whole time and uh yeah I always I always bring that um I always bring Sage that's a good one that's a good one yeah I almost forgot me I usually bring a couple of cases of mead we're gonna camp with you Hank oh definitely thanks wonderful me wh which site did you say was yours I'll Camp right next to you I'm going to rights of spring and I've got uh I'll probably be bringing 40 cases of me rights of spring in Massachusetts come drink there is one other thing that I wanted to mention what to expect as far as uh what to expect to a a festival if you come to fairy Fest it's like going to a Disney World so you walk you know you come in and there's a park there's a whole bunch of people that you don't know but it doesn't really matter because there's a whole bunch of people you don't know so what yeah you go to a place like rights of spring that has a really high repeat customer base and as a new person coming in there it can be daunting because it seems like you've walked into somebody else's family reunion and everybody knows each other so really well except you and a lot of them haven't seen each other for a year and that's why they're like giving each other big hugs and it seems like that's that ofing to everybody except maybe you because you're new and it can be daunting but don't let it get to you come anyway you'll be there next year you'll be uh you'll be getting the hugs next year huging all these people that like hey remember we had that long conversation best friends you only see once a year yeah exactly and speaking of that sort of thing the one thing that the infamous Pagan hug thing where you go up to somebody you know and hug them and then whisper in their ear like do you know the name of the person that's standing behind me because you you saw them last year at that festival and you had a 4-Hour convers you met I can't remember their name for the life CH names in the first two minutes and then you talked for five hours and it was awesome but you never said each other's names again and now you don't know and you feel stupid because you know all this stuff about them and they know it about you Rob you're giving away Secrets man the the Pagan hug secret is now out in the world everyone knows there you go yes I know who you are I just don't know your [Music] we still love you can't remember your name that happens all the time so I just have a quick anecdote I camp with the same group of people every year and every single year we are ve very famous around camp for adopting someone who's new and it it's not even something that we really try to do it just keeps happening last year was actually the first year in a long time that we have not had somebody who's completely new to dragonfest we did have Hank in our camp who was new to our Camp not necessarily new dragonfest of course but we tend to collect the newbies um which is always really interesting that you get to know somebody new and then you get to turn them out into dragonfest with some wisdom you know and then dragonfest also does this thing we have golf carts on the land that shuttle people from place to place if you have Mobility needs and um we on the first main day of Fest we have a shuttle tour so you can get on the shuttle and the person who's driving the shuttle will drive you around Camp point out all the different things and tell you where you know this is the community tent where they serve breakfast this is the place where we have freedom circles so on and so forth um which I think is a really fun and interesting way to introduce people to the site but then next year I'm hugging you and never got your name yeah that's okay you can ask me what my name is a hundred times and it will never upset me that's right most people just ask is a big one I know it's a hard hard for people to kind of get out of your shell especially if you're new but these places are so accepting of everyone of every type and usually so inclusive just ask try and ask or just have a quizzical look someone will come over and ask you if you need help with something you know especially at registration or always there will be a first aid station you know you can ask at these places places like Brushwood have people uh called red suspenders that will wear um literally red suspenders and they're part of what's called fire tribe and they take care of a lot of the fire safety so if you have any questions about that you can find them by their red suspenders and so you'll hear about things like that and so there will be people you might not always necessarily get a go-kart ride around to show you all the good sites but there's people but there's people yeah yeah our staff wears a specific color of t-shirt yeah some places they're more structured on that right spring on occasion uh or they they used to be more regular I don't know whether they're still doing it or not but they had buttons that were like two inches across and most of them just had a big script L on it and that you could take it on and you could put it on and you could put it on no it wasn't for loser it was for listener you have an issue different button different button if you have a if you have an issue and you you don't see anybody that you know was on staff you see somebody with a listener button you could go to that person and for some people that counts as a workshift that's something I should probably touch on as far as what to expect yeah some of these things can cost quite a bit of money cly yeah what if I'd like to go and can't afford it Castro how can you help us so Dragon Fest does have a scholarship program we are about to close our scholarship application window for 2024 it ends on Friday so probably by the time this episode airs it will be closed but we do offer it every year and then also if you volunteer as staff will get a staff discount we have a a two-tier staff system that's more complicated than needs to be explained here but um basically how many hours you volunteer your time to dragonfest translates into a larger discount so we have a couple of different ways that people can reduce the amount or possibly get their amount covered now Rob is there the same opportunity at fairy Fest yes there definitely is fairy Fest is a huge undertaking and we need a lot of volunteers and luck we get a lot of volunteers it's all divided up into particular team so you'll have responsibilities for a set period of time at a set place so and the rest of the time you're free there they generally like if you're on on the volunteer thing they generally like it if you pay for your dinners there um but if you can't they if you can't do that they will give you more hours to do stuff in in place of that there are some places like rights of spring that do work trade all the time so you just say I I can't I can't afford to go and I'd like to do you know work study program they call it work study but it basically is like you know you're in the kitchen for five hours every day you know honestly it's quite fun at times you you meet some really interesting people at these festivals at the kitchen while you're slicing potatoes that's a good way to meet people is take on some volunteer work exactly so yeah that's all there and there are some places like Spirit fire for instance you can volunteer and be unstaffed if you want they expect everybody to put in a two-hour work shift and they're really easy work shifts but everybody has to do that but their scholar program is not connected to uh volunteer work at all and they they like it that way and honestly I like it that way too I know people that have gone to festivals couldn't afford it volunteered and wound up seeing very little of the festival because they expected 10 hours of of work out of them every day you know they they got their food paid for and they got to come to the festival but they were exhausted by the time anything happened or they were working during the workshops or during the performances uh and that can be a little daunting so I I it sounds like be cognizant of of what you're volunteering for what the give and take is in that Arrangement yep my experience in that is that most places are are actually really good about it you know you might have your work shifts but even the garbage shifts at places I've been at have been a blast you get to meet people you become a little crew like you mentioned working in the kitchen Rob it's it's not like your regular part-time job it tends to be very very fun and an excellent way to meet people and it's usually a small amount of your time so you know check the festival and see what they require in return for for what you get for it that's where I was going with that is that there's a wide variety of that out there so know what what you're getting yourself into yeah because say Jos and Steve running Spirit fire they want you to be at the festival they don't really want your work so if you can't afford to be there they do a bunch of fundraiser things they actually raffle off every year a pass for next year and all of the money that goes to the prize which they're donating go towards a scholarship fund so theyve had times where they've had eight people on and this is not a huge Festival it's a couple hundred people eight or nine people on complete scholarship with no additional work requirements because they want you to be at at the festival nice the festival so not everybody's so generous but they are all right magical people so Pagan festivals I absolutely love them I can tell you guys are very passionate about them why should someone go to something like this why should you go to any Pagan Festival whether fairy Fest dragonfest Spirit fire anything why should someone go to one of these you mentioned it before it's about communicating and about Community it's very validating to go to a large group like that and meet people that you can totally relate to and open up and have those 4-Hour conversations with it's it's very liberating awesome it changes your life you know it changes your Viewpoint it's it's the same thing I think in some ways like you know I've traveled a bit I worked in Europe for a while um I've done a few things and I I know other people that have never left New York State and they have a different perspective than I have I have a way different perspective than they do so this is a way to widen your perspective choose choose what you want out of life and go forward and it can change your whole life when this all started I was actually an engineer you know I was a microchip designer and it's like you know and then you went to a festival and I went to F that's where I started in college I started going to festivals yeah I got out I was an engineer for 13 years and it was like it it changes too your perception of what's important you get to find out what's really important to you and that's just specifically to you and it does cut down your your level of being able to tolerate crap in your life like I don't I don't have to do that I don't have to work for IBM for the rest of my life so I don't now you have drums and me and Magic yes drums me and Magic that's it should be its own name right there right yeah what else do you need it's uh yeah it does change your perspective very much for me it fills up my cup I have even come to dragonfest when I was living outside of Colorado and I had to fly and borrow camping equipment and bum a ride from somebody from the airport because the people there are just so special there's an emptiness of sorts inside of me that slowly come you know just like slowly get like Rob said it changed your life yeah exactly and so wait all year to see those people again I mean it fills up my cup and I need that I need that to go back out into to the regular world and be a person who's perceived as weird who's you know like on the weeks around the water cooler when everyone else is talking about church functions or whatever I I cannot participate in that discussion because my church functions are going to be my quote church functions are going to be looked at as super weird and possibly devilish by people who don't understand that and so to spend that time around people who get it who believe in the magic and who share it with each other and teach each other how to find it that fills up my cup and I need that every year that's why I keep going and that's why I'm on staff because dragonfest means people to get involved in order to keep the festival moving getting involved is so important we're gonna post links to your guys's websites to your social media make sure people can find you and you know we'll try to post links to some of the other festivals that we know about as well because we do know how hard it can be to find these places but once you find it get involved ask to volunteer ask to be part of the committee you know to see if you can help to make them happen don't let the festival die folks buy tickets show up support yeah you get the world you vote for oh yes that's absolutely true with your presence and your attendance going to these places is definitely a wonderful way to connect with other pagans find Community find yourself really in a lot of ways it sounds just a thought that entered my brain here uh something that Kestrel had said that I experienced too in the early early years of me going is that I would go to a festival like this and I would experience such joy and such happiness and such a feeling of acceptance and growth and all of this stuff and it was so freaking awesome and then it would come home and three days later it's like now what like a crash mundan so that's something to expect too like if you go to a place and you do get that super high experience just know that that crash is normal there's an adjustment period back in day-to-day life you had all this stuff and you can't take it home with you but that that is a misnomer you can take it home with you you know I I definitely changed my life around that I like I say I don't work for IBM anymore instead I go to festivals all the time I made it profession for like three years after I left IBM before I opened a Magicka all I did was festivals it was year round I just came home I built drums I made me and then I would go to a festival I set up a booth there and sell drums then go to see stuff and you you adopt that into your life and it becomes your life it becomes you know like you say it's an unveiling of who you really are I like that I like that that's pretty true that's pretty true I think think I definitely found big chunks of myself at festivals for sure Castell you want to give us a little how do we find dragonfest how people find that so I always recommend people come to our website first because you
