welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and today we'll be talking about the greater Sabbath of lunasa also sometimes called llamas this holiday is celebrated on August 1st in the Northern Hemisphere and it's all about the Harvest of the grains the first fruits Harvest and I'm shelle and I'd like to start off by saying happy llamas to everybody happy llamas happy lunasa hope Summer's treating you well thus far I hope you're cool because holy cow it's hot you know I have a little saying I've been sticking with lately and that is and and for all of our underage listeners please do not repeat this in a high school setting but it is hotter than a Jalapeno's vagina out right now like I ain't kidding like I ain't kidding I didn't know they had those that's spicy you know funny story so when we went to New York City recently for uh witches Fest USA I actually heard that phrase down there because because it was that hot and now it's stuck with me I think that's going to be my summer phrase anytime it's over 95 degrees okay all right that that uh sounds like it'll go over really well in your New England area I'm I'm sure they'll very much appreciate that they don't know you by now right yeah right and back to llamas back to llamas back to lunasa now if you haven't noticed yet we're you two different words for this holiday why are we doing that we're doing that because it's actually has a couple different Roots lunasa is a celebration of Lou or to be more specific Lou is the Sun God and lunasa is his celebration of his foster mother talu who cleared the lands in Ireland to help create agriculture I guess so she cleared all the land for planting to create agriculture but she died from exhaustion because it was a big job so created this right so Lou created this Festival to honor his foster mother we honor grains and the Sun and Lou himself but it's also called llamas which is more I think a christianized holiday but it it means loaf Mass it's the first bread it's the the first loaf of the Season that you get from these harvested grains well and as you're aware there are B essentially three Harvest festivals um this being being the first so this is kind of that that time of year where those those seeds that you planted very early are starting to come to fruition or those ideas that maybe you had poking around in your brain back in maybe November December January are coming to fruition now yeah you should be starting to see the first inklings of things coming to pass yeah yeah so you're kind of in the very first stages in a three-phase stage of reaping what you've sown this is what you're doing energetically and magically while in the physical world the sun is at its height we were just bitching about the heat mere seconds ago now the sun feels very powerful but is already on the waning side it's already the dark half of the year and the Sun is getting less and less powerful really tell that to my skin that's on fire right that's the that's the dichotomy of this season that's the the balance that we're walking here is that we are faced with abundance everyone is trying to give you zucchini there's the very first sweet corn there's beans there's herbs there's grains there's so much out there but at the same time to get that you're cutting down the grain things are dying the God himself is dying he's going towards his Sage phase so the the Bright Young Sun God is on his way out so you're celebrating both kind of at the same time life and death beginnings and endings and I think people get kind of caught up in that because it is hard it you know mid late June to think we're starting the downswing it doesn't feel that way until usually like September October is but yeah we we technically are on the downswing of light the days are getting shorter nights are getting longer you know what is it 90 seconds a day we're losing of light now so now is the time to start taking stock of things and maybe not going crazy balls out prep for for the dark times but getting those inklings of ideas of starting to you know again you know reap all of your fruits and harvests to kind of start hunkering down in the coming months and this is also a great reminder to live in the moment you know that Harvest that third Harvest of s is kind of far away it feels far away and so we have all this abundance around us now and I know we've talked in previous episodes if you want to check that out we have older llamas episodes but we talked about the first fruits festivals and celebrations that we would have with our local Pagan community and everyone would bring things from their Garden you know and that's a wonderful way to celebrate this holiday especially you know maybe you don't have a Coven that's going to do a big bonfire or picnic or something like that you know maybe you're going to be celebrating at home by baking bread or making Honey Cakes so you know I was thinking of some what can I do for llamas if I'm a solitary person kind of ideas and you know we did talk about this is kind of where you get those first grains um and herbs and things of that nature so we all know I can't grow  but ironically enough I can somehow grow potted herbs which I'll post pictures of that because I know it's you got to see it to believe it kind of thing so I've had this Sage growing for a couple years now and because it's been so hot and humid it like Gang Busters like flowered like nobody's business normally I take off the leaves and I dry out those leaves and use them for my loose incense Blends and and things like that but this year I decided I wanted to see if I could make smudge sticks what the hell everybody else can make them I can make them too so what I've done is I have started to cut stocks of that off hanging them to dry and then making those Sage sticks will kind of be my own I don't want to say llamas ritual per se but kind of I'm I'm going to ritualize making these smudge sticks once they're dried out making a smoke stick incense like that drying your herbs I have lavender myself drying right here or earlier in the month we had the episode where we talked about corn dollies and we braided the straw or the oats or the long grass from your backyard and using not magic to rep represent the season you can do that I can't wait to see what your incense sticks are going to look like what those smoking bundles will look like once you're done you know I and I have a couple of cool ideas too because I just like making up so I was going to do a couple of just the sage and make like a sage bundle but I also have mint growing a friend of mine gave me mint and I'm like that is like like the most weedy weed thing there is like if you've got mint it is growing everywhere oh yeah so I know I can keep that alive so I was thinking of drying a few stocks of mint as well and making like a mint Sage bundle I love that that's great yeah that's fantastic I've seen those and some people do them very pretty have you ever seen the um the incense bundles the herb bundles where they're very pretty they look more decorative than useful but it'll be like a bundle of something sweet grass or Sage or or whatever and then on top of it it'll have whole flowers yeah yeah or like a stick of of some type of aromatic wood or something has anyone burned those like are you supposed to take them apart first and then just burn the incense bundle or do you burn the whole thing flour and all I'm I'm not sure how those work if anyone out there and has used one of these before let me know are you supposed to take them apart I actually have I actually have I got one of those here in Salem one time and it looked it almost looked like the outer layer remember that time I got that pre-roll that was with rose petal paper yeah okay this looked like like a like a herb bundle that was wrapped in like rose petals and then tied so it almost looked like a little Rose but had the herbs in in the inner that makes sense you could definitely burn rose petals yeah that sounds like something you could just burn just like your mint and Sage together sounds like something you can just burn I'm talking about the ones that like have whole flowers and on them why not why why not that's what I'm asking is does it work like how well does it work I've never burned one I mean I totally would I just want to know is it practical does it work or do you have to take it apart first is it just for looks because I've never burned one let us know let us know email yeah so anyway now that we've done that tangent the herbs and everything are great baking bread making cookies making any type of baked good is definitely one of the things that is traditional this time of year I have a little story for you shell and okay this is going to be a spell for our listeners too now my grandmother and my father are big gardeners uh my dad more the weed but you know hey other things Gard gardening's gardening but in the backyard of my grandmother's house in senica Falls they had this big like huge backyard garden and it would have tons of tomato Poes and peppers and all sorts of things in it uh cucumbers and zucchinis and squashes and sunflowers and everything about this time of Summer my grandmother would be harvesting a lot of her first fruits from the garden and what she liked to do with it is bake bread she would bake so much bread this time of year this is like zucchini bread time there should be a festival there's probably a zucchini festival right probably is and I was just going to say I was so sick of zucchini bread by the end of August that in yellow squash exactly didn't want to look at at it anymore I love zucchini bread don't get me wrong but she would bake so much of it not by the ton you don't that's right now one of the interesting things that she did with this bread was she liked to give it away um she would give a lot of her abundance of her garden away to her neighbors and as well as the bread that she would bake but one of the first loaves if not the first loaf she would break up in into four pieces and she would put one piece at Each corner of her garden in the backyard and she told us kids that it was to keep the fairies happy she said that that would keep the fairies the garden fairies happy so that next year she would have just as much if not more abundance from the same garden and so that was her little tradition she wasn't a witch though very Christian just as oh of course not of course but this is something that you can do in your home as well so if you bake a loaf of bread especially if it has something that you grew or maybe got at a farmer's market or something like that a nice fresh element to it doesn't have to be zucchini but if you bake yourself a loaf of bread and break it up into four different pieces you can then take that to the four corners of your own property and leave it outside for the Fay for the spirits of place uh for the animals and offer that to help bring abundance and to protect the abundance of your home so that that you know sacrif iice that loaf of bread so that that energy can come back to your house you know that whole cyclical nature of sacrifice and abundance and if you you know if you have an apartment you don't have land you can break it up into four pieces and then just bring each piece to the corner of your home and offer it symbolically and then just eat it later or give it to your neighbors or donate it again that sacrifice element but that was something that we did in my family that can be translated into a very magical lunasa practice I like that I like that I could like do that around the corners of my little herb garden on the deck exactly and it doesn't have to be a huge loaf I'm not talking a big huge loaf it could be a cupcake size it could be biscuit size doesn't have to be big but that's a great way to incorporate you know the whole idea of grains and sacrifice because bread itself holds all of these elements you know you got the Earth in the in the grain you know you combine it with water you've got the yeast from the air and you bake it in fire now you've got this magical creation that holds all the elements of life and has turned into something greater than its parts so that's magic in itself easy peasy nice or you know one time this was back in my more adventurous younger days I would this time of year make bread from scratch like remember when bread makers were like all the hot raid I do yeah I would make bread and it was weirdly okay I'm not a great cooker but it was weirdly okay there's really easy bread recipes now where it basically involves like tossing flour and water and yeast together and then just mixing it up and slapping it into a bread pan and sticking in the oven yeah all that rustic bread it can be really easy but even if you don't want to bake you can celebrate this season by celebrating abundance by going out into the sun I think in Ireland one of the ways to celebrate is to go for a hike you know just go enjoy go look for a farmers market my stepbrother and his wife have a gorgeous Farm up in the Finger Lakes of New York State and they have a upic flower farm it's absolutely stunningly gorgeous to walk on this hill along the rows of flowers and look out over senica Lake that's a beautiful way to celebrate you know lunasa and for our friends in the southern hemisphere it is imul which which is again you know you're talking about this is where things are stirring things are starting to to get ready to be popping out getting ready to start sprouting and and creating that boom of life so for all of our southern hemisphere friends we also want to say happy imul to you too don't want to forget that especially you know because that's imul is my birthday so but this isn't but this isn't D I can't take August 1 as my birthday too you know half birthday that counts right okay okay winie the Pooh it's your half birthday I that I can go with that take it so lunasa is a celebration of Lou the Sun God he is part of the Tua daanan which is the Fay race in Scottish and Irish lore he's associated with all sorts of crafts he's the god of Art and forging and anything that you can think of involving creation or crafting he is the god of he's also associated with taking Oaths and with law which kind of makes sense with the whole corn doy thing and the bread making and the incense making those are all making type things oh yeah absolutely crafting bread this is if you lived in Ireland you could get away with being a witch under the radar because a lot of these celebrations are secular you know they they celebrate the Harvest and everything it doesn't have anything to do with being a witch or with religion it's kind of just like us celebrating the first day of spring or something I guess just as a day not necessarily as a pagan thing right so if you wanted to do that here and get away with being in the broom closet still you can decorate with sunflowers you can decorate with with wheat now here in America we usually associate signs of harvest with sin the third Harvest more in October but you can start decorating with some of that now maybe put some sheaths of wheat as a decoration up or you know lots of flowers you can bake your bread into different shapes to represent the Sun or to represent abundance what I what I always have thought is a really cool decoration for this time it's not decoration but kind of per se you know kind of circling back to drying out the stage drying out any kind of herbs or flowers uh for later use whatever that may be and have those bundles just hanging around your kitchen or hanging around your space not only are you drying them out for other purposes but it creates an aesthetic so to say and and you know like right now my house smells like Sage it creates multiple layers of magic being able to use something that you dried maybe maybe you didn't grow the herbs or grow the lavender yourself maybe you bought it at a farmers market or Trader Joe's or you know maybe you got it online but if you can have that in your home and try to dry it yourself or prepare it yourself package it put it away for later that's also a way to celebrate this season you are taking this abundance you are processing it you're working with it and then you're storing it away so that you can use it again later and you can do that actually with physical things or you can start to do that in your journal and start to talk about things in your life that you need to work through and process and then put away to come back to later is the season to buy a ton of mason jars and a couple new journals there you go it's always the season to buy a couple new journals well I'm talking normal people not you hey you get all the tarot decks and I collect journals I guess to each their own right yeah now before we kind of close this out I do want to talk about an easy solitary ritual to celebrate Lou I found this on patheos.com which is a wonderful love that website by the way so great so many different articles and this is by John Becket and it was written July 21st of 2015 and it's a solitary ritual for lunasa and basically the idea is to celebrate Lou in his aspect of the master Craftsman and so in this ritual what you're supposed to do is find four of your crafts four things that you are good at like if you were to sit down shell and say all right well I'm not good at growing plants Let's cross that off but but you could say say I am a phenomenal herbalist I am a fantastic witch I make the best tea and what's a good fourth craft for you sh um like I said a lot of mine just comes down to creating and stocking herbs but I really did like making my uh yarn Dolly well there you go so we'll say that you're an herbal Craftsman and your fourth one is you are the tarot reader extraordinaire so there's your four there's that so you would take these you write down your four crafts that you're good at and then you would find a symbol something to represent each of those crafts and then set up your altar and put elements there for the season and each of your symbols that represents you your four crafts get prepared set your space cast a circle if you wish say some words about the the season call in the elements if you'd like but the idea is to take each of those craft tools of yours and to really feel it to think about it to think of yourself using it to think why you chose that particular item and think how Lou might use it you know relate that and ask for the blessings of Lou to that item and to that craft for you it could be as simple or as elaborate as you like but it it's the idea is to take those four items that represent you and your crafts and to honor them and to honor yourself and to ask for the blessings of Lou on those items so I'll put a link to that in the show notes but it's a very nice very easy solitary ritual that you can do for August 1st llamas and I think with that I think all I'm thinking now is is weaving grains you know baking bread it you know it's one of those holiday shell where it's summertime it's hot it's slow I move SL litha I want to say litha is probably the most forgotten holiday ever this number two yeah probably but I like it because of that it's Qui it I I like to think of myself strolling through the farmers market with a little basket not that I've done this but I could and picking out the freshest Tomatoes the best cucumbers the nicest basil and you know bringing it all home chopping it up in my beautiful sundress with the warm breeze blowing through the kitchen and get my lemonade with some Lavender in it and just get my witchy Cottage core on and just sit back and you know be all warm and comfortable and eat some ious salads I mean that's a great way and here I am all unshowered hair up in a messy bun trying off to Wegman's getting that in the produce aisle and going home to my AC I didn't say I did that I just said I wanted to going to Wegman's is appropriate I'm just saying I can put a sundress on and go to Wegman's and try and get the same experience that'll work exactly when you walk in the grocery store door they have the blower that can like be your pseudo Summer Breeze oh no that's like the pseudo that's like the breath of Ule coming after me it's terrible right but just enjoying the weather you know go to the beach if you can shell you can get down to the beach and get down to the ocean you know I can go for keep on doing that yeah that's right I can go for a walk in the cool woods wherever you are try to celebrate and embrace the slowness the warmth the sultriness of this season I mean everything is right there there's so much abundance the flowers the green the herbs the smells I mean it's beautiful the sunrises and sunsets are decadent and gorgeous be in the moment the colorful flowers you know the I think the best thing about this time of year is the color yeah you know we we harp on that brown gray season that we live half the year it feels like every color is alive right now you know between vegetables and plants and flowers and trees and and and all the things is everything's just so colorful right now and I love that it's a great reminder especially with this heat to take things slowly you know pay attention to yourself hydrate do good things for you and just kind of move a little slowly and with gratitude through this abundant season because it doesn't last toally do that I can totally do that yeah that is a beautiful way to celebrate the season you know you don't have to do anything elaborate make yourself a big salad bake yourself some bread if if it's not too hot do some canning or drying like Shell's drying her Sage I'm drying some lav we should put them together oo let's put some sage and lavender together o mind blown so yeah there's so many things that you can do with that to celebrate the season the best thing I could suggest to folks is get outside while you still can buy some canning jars so that you can start storing away the things that you're Harvest right now and you know even if you have to go to Trader Joe's and buy a bundle of flowers good enough go do it if you're harvesting magical things or spell work that you started back in imul now is a good time to sit back and reflect do some journaling pull a tarot card or two and really see where you're at with those goals if you need to replant if you need to restart Now's the Time to do it before you get to that third Harvest and things kind of a little to late for the season yeah yeah re-evaluate reate clean things up and start start harvesting some of what you've sewn reap what you sew and enjoy the zucchini bread until it gets to be too much yeah but then we hit right the minute zucchini is too much we immediately bounce into corn season and pumpkin spice season and every damn thing on the planet is either made of corn or pumpkin spice I love love pumpkin spice don't get me wrong but there comes a point where too much is too much yeah so try to enjoy the abundance don't overdo it and uh hopefully you are having a wonderful lunasa coming up here on August 1st and celebrate the abundance in your
