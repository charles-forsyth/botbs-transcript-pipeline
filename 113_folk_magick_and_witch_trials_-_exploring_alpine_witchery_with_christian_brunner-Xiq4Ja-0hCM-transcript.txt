welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode will be talkin Austrian folkloric magic and a surprising history of witch trials in the Alpine region to help us with that conversation we have as a guest Christian Berner a druid author and folklorist with deep roots in the magical traditions of the Austrian Alps with Decades of study and shamanic practices Christian brings an insightful and fascinating perspective to his book Alpine witchery Austrian folk magic lore and spellcraft and I'm show and I am taken aback by the subject so welcome Christian we're so glad you're here tell us a little bit about yourself and the Druid and Alpine folk magic aspects of your life very much for having me it's really the and honor and a pleasure first podcast appearance on my self ever so  and definitely the pleasure is all ours too so you a little bit about myself I grew up in the 1919 hundreds everything is born 2002 Nissan everything before 2011 black and white label 32 years Brook in Vienna for a while and opportunity to come to the United States and 97th and moved into this house on Halloween I didn't know I mean I've heard of it but I didn't know what's going on really come to this country evening here on the kids  jump into the deep end exactly and I was a banker and soon found out that I was waiting for green card and all that enough Bankers in Boston with substance abuse and homelessness services but I'm still working and my very much mass and and statistics were into all this as needed account balance Bass the clan and so I started I think one of us sixteen or so and I never heard of it started reading it and it was one of Carlos Casas Lita's books and with all the things that came to light after  there are some very interesting and very important for me and so I came into this half of shamanic work in the beginning I had the opportunity to work a week or summer Willis shamans from Tuba and learn and that's where I kind of figure out her it's very interesting and what about my own culture and so I've read a lot about Native American dwellings top of a Mesa and looked around and totally amazed at the smell of the sagebrush there and so forth and a couple of Native American staring from there and they told me all about the history of that it's real  that's because I don't know anything about my spiritual history in the Alps and I would like about castles and kings and Emperors and all that but not so much but the background is that that I had to then that's where I started to see if you found you found that here in America and then that that kind of brought you back in searching for your roots in the mountains until you found the Celtic people there in the mouth and so and Independence to go through it needed to go in and stopped and say I have no idea about the Druids I mean a herd of them and all that but I even do something then you have to do and so I basically signed up with the course by the order of bards always enjoy its and England  brought a shamanic work. A overlay and that was really a connection again back to the other side of my brain to the statistics and and backlog knowledge and history of what I done did in the book I have a question how do you mix Druid work both Magic from your Homeland and living in the outskirts of Boston  yeah after reading the book I'm thinking you know if I were practicing Alpine folk magic and you know I have a similar perspective I'm I'm on the North Shore of Boston and tell him I mingling with this environment and complex to practice all these things in such a different environment that almost send the trees and in the end Open Fields and then with the Alpine tall snow peak mountains in in our concrete Village in a Grove  call it to the group of people who meets know at least eight times a year to do the fast and often enough for that standard directions to bring our bardic inspiration into that part of the ritual or the winter solstice in the pearl in Massachusetts already know that that's lots of land and Roads around so far and 4850 people and everybody knew that place and when they when we went to the Ridgewood Place until the sun comes up as I stepped back and and and nobody noticed really that I wasn't there  how many people do things but don't know why and dressed up as Grandpa's in in the back of my fake you know how about on my back and so forth and then go in the ritual I was called in that was part of how I wrote it but then I ran into that circle like they do in in Austria right and yelled at them in in Austrian. He knows people and ran at them and whack them a little bit but no articles with this which cuz that's part of it but it became part of the in in the dark in the woods of Berlin Mass that's how I can am able to sometimes bring into that  the Middlesex Fells Reservation I don't know if you know that that's a huge Winchester Medford in middle of that a large piece of land that state park or something and I do a lot of dog walking there and do I collect Pine resin from there for my much we can make a lot of things myself like that the candle that is building background made herself with the mother worked as hanging the background when it's full of pictures and sounds in there and then I collect things for that as much as you can in the forest where big collectors of growing things and I have my own little dried herbs that can go in a lucky enough to have a collection of mugwort drying yet but hopefully this year you're kind of bring it back to the book this really intrigued me because you do edits as we talk  when we see each other in person as our listeners know I'm up in Salem and if nothing else it is discussed before and as you know the accused here were actually not witches and I was really surprised when when we had our conversation at the Sacred Space conference that the accused witches in Austria actually War which is at least some of them at least you actually have documented verified information which I find absolutely fascinating and I was talking to Layla prior to ask it's almost like if you had a textbook conversation this has a lot of factual information but it comes across as a comp  seishin I'm going to go you one better it's not even a conversation okay I am a huge fan of folklore and Mysteries in the Supernatural your book did not read like a textbook at all it felt more to me but the people are in the True Crime nowadays write the podcast about true crime and you want to hear about all the court cases you have factual information about these court cases and some of them read like the most salacious interesting wild court cases that you might hear on a True Crime podcasts in textbook way in a bad way but documented like I have this one that I want to talk about a minute you have you know the accused their interrogation date the court they were this is Hardcore fax this isn't Siri and conjecture I am surprised that the stuff was actually put in the court documents like that blew me away for a second  Christian if you would please explain a little bit about the history of their witch trials they were kind of freaking out about right now so you can just a little bit brief as possible cuz I could talk about an hour and a half at the time when was written so that's sort of when the witch trials started and what happened to her was that both the beach. Started a little bit early up and burned record of people just didn't think that was an important came and we can see from from the beach towels how overtime the ideas of the imported into the  thinking of the judges and prosecutors before the book and then or in popular culture I guess you could say I kind of switch a little bit I think what happened was that the judges the judges were kind of the elite one of the group of a little better at least somewhat educated agreed and and and and so forth has Auffenberg actually Mobility themselves and they kind of felt probably compelled to implement what's in there in order to not get in trouble themselves make sense that happened in a lot of places and therefore his absurd as some of those accusations were they thought well you know that they match the pattern the match what's in that book and I better use that as our or accepted us as legit evidence  in order to not get prosecuted myself and if they didn't listen to those things then they might be accused know if I'm not listening maybe that people will think that I'm also doing evil thing as a scary time in the early 1500s were most often something actually happened somebody got poisoned or stomach also started giving blood email or something and the money is money to go back to you. The devil is all behind that that's where it became so I became a little bit weird it in terms of accusation flying out of the chimney on an open pipe with the devil and Prada  everybody knew that the farmer's wife did not fly off think so and receive also in the witch trials how that affect the influence of an economist work influences the the death penalty in the rise of it and is he a lot of increase of women because they're quite a bit of man jumping over all accused of Witchcraft higher than those of War happen in a lot of people come back cuz I will Returns come back have nothing can't work there often disabled or did they don't know what the birthday cousin ever learn anything and so they stop using things like witchcraft to make a coin every now and then and then and then males being prosecuted  because they are kind of disturbing the peace of the community coming back didn't have jobs and so they resorted to like folk magic so they became like the village which essentially from what I understand and your book they were mostly that accused of being a witch they're mostly accused of doing witchcraft exactly so they would be like the the folk healer the person you go to and you know my neighbor made all my chickens die so I want to I want to make all their milk go bad and so you'd go to this Village person and he would give you a spell or something Have you do something to get back at your neighbor to do that Witchcraft and that's what people were starting to get in trouble for at that time exactly and anything that could be seen or observed they do that is out of the little Christian ordinary why would say could be a red flag and then  if the person also had no motivation to accused of that which was not really then then it was basically the next thing goes to court Thursday as one who was called in to reverse a curse on the cow and she is named as a witch so we know basically that she must have offered and was well known that she does those things so the thing though that I observed and notice is that the more romantic image of the witch you know the the person living in the forest alone yeah with the rafters of herbs hanging from the rafters in The Raven on the door came so defender in the Romantic Period in the mid-1800s the richest that we experienced in the Renaissance and and shortly thereafter they as far from  who won record on the lift and I am in a ravine aside from everybody else in shacks and they have to go from from Farm to farm and beg for the food and offered their services and as long as they didn't harm anyone I think they were saying but if you had a beef with them until they are a lot of our Granny's practice granny magic they were Christians but they practice Earth Magic or he'll magic or Mountain magic but it was also like magic but they were Christians they would have given you the evil eye in Baton your name if you had said they were a witch and people very often  at the same case here right now so that's why it was accepted because they would kind of had that veneer of acceptability by following the major religion at least outwardly what is Deborah. Two men are out in the community you get too many of us together and stuff starts print than the witch trials here in Salem but the one thing I found very interesting is that people offered up the Spells and rituals and you detail these out in your book that that blew me away to be able to read some of that stuff didn't do any magic or spells so he had me but these people they said they did say what they did sometime I know that obviously things are different than they were in the in the 14th century 15th century but I just wanted to point one out that I  I found fascinating this is called a spell to help a possessed person and what the spell is obtained the heart and liver of a pike dry and ground it and then smoke is the person with that then rip a black head apart and place it on the possessed person's head ground cinnamon Clover mace and Nutmeg into powder and give that mixture to The Afflicted person first male who at least it's spiced well I mean I just I can't believe that this was all detailed out in court was that was that common were people kind of detailed out some of these spells and rituals when they were on trial but they called sort of in excess of painful interrogation and then there is state animal  and some of them I'm British or where obtained during the painful okay okay but they have to take that into account it was under duress at the same time you have these old people were compelled to say that I've made story admit to the things like that often and often enough to admit to kind of absurd things under to rest so I can get out of that situation I was just like wow A lot of people are given up a lot of spells and rituals and court and I didn't know if I was shocked and Preston  now that's part of what I love reading about in this book because they are extremely interesting and then my Christian like you just said Christian these were allowed to spend under duress and a lot of these have raising wild ingredients that will get into in just a minute so don't try this at home we don't know if they're true so just be careful don't do it at home I think they also but I found very helpful is it's pretty much all sympathetic magic and if it fits that mold that if there's a good chance that it was actually done that way and then it's from I don't know if they're so I went through many more I went over to over a thousand accused oh wow yeah  is not that great in that same vein one of the spells that you have in here is very much Practical Magic that would have seemed like magic to the people at the time in 1669 when this particular court case happen and you're going to have to help me out with the name of the accused here this is a test Celiac Kylie Kylie add grouper to Celia Celia okay Cecilia Gruber December 13th 1669 one of the spells that she details in her trial was to take a horseshoe nail that you found on the street and put it in the fire once it's red-hot you then drop it into bad milk they didn't have refrigeration obviously in the 1600 so late you explain in the book of  it was fresh from the cow and even when it was fresh from the cow could have had bacteria in it so if you had bad milk that tasted bad and you threw a glowing hot piece of metal into it your Century could be sterilizing some of the bacteria in their cooking it and making it safer to eat so this spell is very practical so that's sympathetic magic goes all the way straight to actual real and effective thing to do an effective scientific thing but it would have seemed like magic to these people  do I found in the street  yeah I mean the metal itself to use those things that happened over when you found that in about 7 something although I'm booked another submit it to Laval and another book about all those beasts and creatures that we are having our celebrations around from November to April 30th and all three of us have a different view of the legs and feet of Krampus  but the 15 minutes to drive from different regions that that's enough but I for example have my my view of composite likes are human and the horse to horse I don't see a human and a goat and the horse that could be a connection. Never stay anywhere a lot of folk magic has to do with horse Nails roads Crossroads that's why I'm not surprised at all and Byron Ballard actually said that your history isn't from where you're from it's from where your grandmother is from so that could explain that difference right there real quick before we get off the topic of spells I want to go back to us  talking about some of these accused may have been under duress when they gave some of these spells and one of my favorites is towards the beginning of the book someone mentioned a spell to make it rain and this is the baker's Simon in 1666 and his lovely spell included you had to dry and then grind together Alpine Valerian and stinging nettle which I love Valerian stinging nettle again to Great ingredients also catkins and marjoram and then here's the kicker the droppings of a squeaker which is a baby wild for good name for it so the poop of a pig try that grind it together with these herbs and then smoke it not like a brisket but like the Tok it was wondering if the beggar Simon was like okay you are rested me I'm going to tell you to go smoke some pig  you know sometimes I wonder if maybe they were pulling our leg a little bit with you spell ingredients at least maybe the bigger Simon was he has his coming a couple of times appears in the book the loss of his name basically meaning that he was a stained himself with drink and twist bread probably he probably make it interesting for the people in the court drunk wise person wanders around the countryside  also in this book you do mention a few people that's the outcomes in these cases these court cases were very different a lot of times and they were here in the states and in some other places around the world in some cases these people said yeah I did that spell and this is why and then they were let go because we know so much about that guy Christopher Catholic funeral and they they found at 16 which the items in his house and he was definite yes I remember that guy definitely a lot of Witchcraft and so he  she basically was accused of Witchcraft in the in the staunchly Catholic environment until her and cooked bruised all bad with his witchcraft he always invoked the Christian daily benefit spell start with the Christian dating and he asked Jesus to do things like he know she sent to Steve Devils or demons it's a demon Conjuring spell but okay for good purpose because basically compel it safe to bring stolen goods back and he has another chapter about  weather magic he tells the court another spell how he fended off weather so bad was coming and he would stand some Barren and I'll probably like a movie and book the weather away behind the mountains where no aux moves and no crows and I felt it all in front of the court in front of a priest and the judge doesn't Witness  it was okay and if it didn't suit them they were convicted in Catholic thinking he could prove he was doing good stuff I think the Catholics not have survived British or Jesus or not I would not have people that have time sounds like the reason a lot of people were accused here in Salem was more for petty reasons it was more for land and money and power and things of that nature where is a lot of these trials they actually did some witchcraft some of these it seems to say I love your sense of humor mr. nineteen-hundreds over here  this book I'm reading it and I'm reading of like oh wow beggar Simon here with this poo smoke and paragraph later you very quietly just feel free to place any of those ingredients that you  so I love this  Brooks Twitter or seen wild forest and they are not the reason why people say they keep their guns in case 2240 wild boars come up on their property there I'm going to try out your Instagram because I have seen on your Instagram you had a cough remedy not too long ago few months ago and then it was a nice dear old little herbal joint I myself love herbal smokeables of all kinds and I was trying to guess what you had put in there I'm guessing there was a little Mullen in their time I do it it's perfect it's a fabulous herb there's so many uses for it okay so it was mostly Mall in in just a little time  all right. So now tell us a little bit about did you get into the herbalism here in America or is that something that you got into an ostrich you know where does that come from I think that already and it was a little bit easier because I grew up with all the plants there and dandelion yes I know you're too but there are some things that we don't have a sense that I had for you that kind of leaves into did you when you were growing up in Austria were there other people around in about that practiced witchcraft is this something that kind of died away after the. You're talking in your book I mean are there obviously you know there's probably Modern Day pagan the local  going strong I guess is my question is the Celtic tradition that you mentioned earlier still alive is that thread still in there I would say no to that in the play date is our beginning of the 9th is when when it was much more into indigenous people all around the book mostly practicing and remember it was an old lady we called her contacts between which she gave my dad a salve for his room at Rite Aid and they put that on there and make a day later he had a lot of pimples went there and they went back there what's going on it's all coming out of energy the negativity coming out okay if you get better did it help  suggestion is my book on and I'm talking with them that this is a lot of folks like us now who practice witchcraft in various ways in there as well as some to have a great grandparents who may have written something down or they had a chance to talk to them before they died but came back I meant that exists but it's not it's not the same it's so it's going to be able to look back at some history like this and I also loved at the beginning of your book you talk about looking out at the mountains you talking about being there and and and looking out at the place where  magic is and you know as a druid as a shaman animism and spirits of place and spirits of the land are very very important is there a way that you would like to connect to spirits of place you know where you're at now and the Boston area you like to go hiking and then things like that you mentioned that is there any particular thing you like to or way you like to connect with your local area Middlesex Fells Reservation bear walk the dog there's a place where they can usually make arrests leaning against the tree on and I'll build a relationship with the tree in zone in the place and there's also a wild Juniper Bush on there so I do get my honey bear is for all kinds of things in sense of making bacon volume way to do that is used more than the usual parents do that and then Juniper to you know it's kind  isn't it like a snot astringent 1920s or so they would go through hospital rooms smoke in the mouth with a stripper again that sympathetic magic that is actually does cleanse the area this really does something in the physical world so Juniper smoke would be a wonderful way in the match of maybe we should get back to do things exactly I like that idea too I do want to mention that in your book I was a little intimidated at first because I thought it was going to be like she'll said in the beginning a textbook  within the first few sentences you can really bad and now I'm totally didn't mean I know what you mean but oh my goodness with his folks so much fun to read because it's just kept me Hawks going through the whole thing like shells that is packed with information how to pay just later you have a funny and I really like how at the end of the trial you talked about a lot of them like today you know how would translate today and what they may have tried to use those ingredients for what you know what they may have meant by different things that they did and that was a lot of fun to read this while I really like those connections yeah I was happy to read that I don't really have black hair  mean like cutting off the brass and the legs in the thighs and then sees me it was all those yummy seasonings I can get into that kitchen magic I had this vision of actually look after the traffic cock in the turkey legs to rip it apart but the level of detail is mention I feel much more confident that that was truly for it folk magic I guess it was passed down to me I was always told that you should not haggle for a magical item so I've heard that one before he said in a court record  those things that's been brought to us from our ancestors I think that's probably something that you can spell the word they they actually read that way so I'm going to read you like oh oh oh yeah okay that sounds type of thing and you know those are things that folk magic the world round or so some of those you can like you said kind of clue you into which ones may possibly have a hint of Truth to them. Found them in other regions really like that the one that found in an English book of spelling and you know who do you can say about that is one that was widely used and practiced and that's that's one of the things that I find fascinating stories folk magic is that  you know somehow I think we've all kind of tapped into some sort of universal truth and a lot of these things because you story is in these these magical spells and ingredients show up in so many different places developed separately but they're all so close and similar and I just I love finding those I think that's absolutely fascinating so this is definitely a book to get Alpine witchery if you are interested in folk magic if you are interested in the history told in a fascinating and not text bookie way sorry she'll then you should  then this book isn't very fun read I highly recommend you check out Christians book check him out at any workshops are you coming up on any workshops you doing any more coming up Arthur talk and in June I have signed up for June 19th because I have they are wonderful that's great then the conference's is over 10 days a week and also so I don't know yet when I will find some information I will squeeze that out of our llewelyn people and pick some information up on the on the show notes for people to find that so they can sign up because we absolutely love your Workshop was a lot of fun and a lot of work out there next time I heard your podcast about the conference and I heard you guys talk about giving things to people  tarot cards if something has started with us doing that all the time with different things that we do is that I had gone to a few workshops at various places over the years when I was given a takeaway I was thrilled beyond belief like you give people a takeaway and there's something that sticks with him about you and I'm going to put a recommendation out here for you Christian please if you do decide to do a takeaway and you maybe you do ingredients from the spells in the book no Pig poo I just recognized he's thinking  it's not fair I said no  well thank you Christian so much for joining us we have had as usual a very enlightening and very fun time hanging out with you will definitely have you back on because there's so much more to talk about and we are so glad that you took the time and were able to chat with us tonight interesting yeah let's get together and then you're like by the way I will also be Sacred Space was one of the first synchronicities that we had a secret space but one of my favorites and thank you for coming to our Rachel there to that was very nice to see you  walking the dog that's my usual podcast time and I knew what I'm going to do be surprised everyone so all our listeners go check out next Workshop in person maybe you will to get a very cool take away that's not going to be paid for you I'll be there all right well thank you all so much for listening to it back on the broomstick and Christian thank you thank you thank you but my pleasure and honor and where they can find your next workshops online and in-person and all that and of course when I get copies of their book Thank you thank you so much to Christian Berner for joining us on back on the broomstick as always it was a very fun and interesting conversation I totally love him and folk Magic from around the world so aside from the fact that he's super great he's got some great content that is totally worth taking a look at and I know we keep saying it over and over again  this book has so much information and it's so much fun and so interesting to read and we're not just saying that it really really is interesting to read even if you're just interested in weird court cases get this book didn't have to be a witch to like this book there's so much in it and it's a damn textbook even though especially if you're a history buff this is a good one this is a good one in you know if you're into different Witch Trials again a good one so whether it's for your into ancient spells I mean I think I just saw today somebody was like hey what's the oldest grimoire of real spells this kind of is it you need to smoke pig poop please no nope nope not going to happen I smoke a lot of stuff not going to do  alright thank you again so much for listening please like subscribe give us some Stars give us some reviews really helps to show asking to make sure a little witches we will see you at next week same time same which channel keep it Wicked folks and please do not smoke the pig poop  not even on 420 keep it with Chi and pig poo free
