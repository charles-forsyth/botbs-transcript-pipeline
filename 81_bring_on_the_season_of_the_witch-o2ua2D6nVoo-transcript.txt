join us as we get back on the broomstick hi hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm ilila and on this episode we'll be talking about heading into the Season of the Witch all things witchy and spooky and ghouly and ghosty we love it this is one of my favorite times of year the colors are coloring people are decorating their houses for the season there's pumpkins and gords and I just absolutely love fall season and heading towards sin the third Harvest okay this is shell here welcome guys glad to have you but I have to interject I love this season but in Salem Massachusetts it's getting a little people get people this is the time of year I want to kidnap you and take you out to my house and save you from all of the crowds that are there seriously and this is the time of year where I just want to be like Lea don't let me go home Salem is great but folks it's a little peoply but anyway welcome because T the season to be witches F la la la la it really is and I love it this is when all my home decor goes on sale right all my favorite things from HomeGoods where they have amazing little C oh my goodness I love it all why are you lying to people you decorate your home from Spirit Halloween and now let's be real come on well that's what I'm saying everything I love to decorate my house with is now suddenly on sale it's so weird but I did also do a little bit of shopping recently because this time of year is also Pagan Pride season and we were just at the central New York Pagan Pride we were and just one last comment about shopping if you have not checked out our socials go look at a post I put out a few days back I was shopping in Leila's yard and a the most therapeutic thing I've done in weeks and B you know sometimes I think folks forget that you have an herbal cabinet right in your own space and I mean I'm not just talking you personally I'm people in general I will include big city livers too because there is greenery to be had in cities even New York City but shopping in your yard was better than any mall ever you really don't need a special fancy protection oil or insect s you know you can grab things right out of your kitchen right out of your yard right out of your garden that will work even better for you actually I kind of prefer like I don't want to say I feel like there's more quote unquote magic in it but there's something different about something that you have gone and kind of foraged on your own versus stopping at a store on your way home or going to Amazon you know we talk a lot about intention what we really mean is putting energy towards something and if you're searching your house looking for a piece of paper that looks cool enough to write a little witchy spell on that's energy that's intention that's power that you've put towards the spell just by looking for that paper even if like one of our listeners you just find some fancy wrapping paper and use that for your spell that's freaking perfect I love it and that adds much more energy to the spell for you but before we get into all that Jazzy Jazz you and I spend an abbreviate we'll call it an abbreviated weekend together I want to talk about what we did and tell our listeners where we were and what we were doing and who we saw and who we met I am still blown away I am absolutely still in awe over our weekend you and I were supposed to have more time together and through a series of events unfortunately we did not but you did make it here on your man 11 hour the witching hour literally the night before and we drove together to CNY this is up in Liverpool New York near Syracuse New York it's the central New York Pagan pride and they've been doing this for a little while now they have quite a few other events this is a big deal no like I had no idea like wouldn't you say like 2000 easy oh easy easily there were so many vendors and so many performers and workshops there was a drum circle and a ritual I just loved that I was somewhere where there was so many Pagan folks yes you were surprised coming from witch capital Salem Massachusetts Massachusetts I know you didn't quite expect the crowd that we had there but it's a it's a beautiful Park and you know everybody that was part of this was fantastic and I walked in and within seconds of stepping into this space we met the most lovely couple and their Foster baby who

our gifts together and I am going to post them and I am so sorry I don't remember everyone's name that came up to say hello to us it was kind of a whirlwind day and I'm a little bit of an introvert but thank you so so much to Alan to Angelina to Gloria and to Stefan to Raven and Carla Todd Judy Andrea Diana Ryan Michael all of you everyone whose name I forgot again I'm so so sorry but thank you all so much for making it such a wonderful wonderful day even if you didn't come up and say hi to us if you were there we appreciate you coming we appreciate you sitting through our workshops and we love you guys it was such a weekend of love and I had told a couple of listeners this I had a super shitty week before I went there and it was you guys showing up with all that love that I was like you know life is great it really is it really is so thank you guys from the bottom of our hearts for real that was really nice we also as a little treat for you guys this week have been working on actually been working on this for a little while but a reading of a writing by someone from our old p in community now this is one of those I wouldn't call a poem I guess like yeah writing I guess is a good way to describe it this can shake you to your core I heard this for the very first time was it 91 1992 and it speaks to your soul but in such a way where you want to be empowered and cry all at the same time yeah and what we're talking about is never again the burning by Gail perago Hami and I also have a special connection to this piece long time ago I lived in a place called skty New York and I was a young witch that didn't know anybody who was a witch was in the early 90s that's because you hadn't met me yet I hadn't met you yet I was working at a thrift store and a big huge stack of old green egg magazines came in oh my God Green Egg yeah and I ended up buying all of them the funny thing with that is they were marked like $33 each and there was a good 20 of them there so I went home to get more money when I came back to buy the stack the person that was there was like oh $3 each that's ridiculous you could have the whole stack for $3 so so I was so happy but as I read through these magazines in one of them was a poem called Never Again The Burning by Gail it dropped me I mean I didn't even hear it spoken like you did but it really hit me hard I cried I've loved it ever since well then when I moved to the Southern Tier of New York I happened to mention this writing to my new found Pagan friends and they're like oh yeah we know that we know Gail that's her over there well not quite they're like we know Gail yeah she's part of this community so few days later I'm at the mall at a Barnes & Noble waiting in line the cashier happens to be a woman with Pagan necklaces and rings and her name tag says Gail then someone comes up to her and says hey Gail Otter's on the phone for you now otter was one of the people from Green Egg magazine so my brain put two and two together it was the wrong otter by the way put two and two together and was like this has to be Gail that wrote Never Again The Burning so when I get up and it was it really was and then I got to see her repeatedly and do ritual with her work magic with her when I was May Queen she gave me one of the most amazing magical energetic gifts and she has just always been one of my Idols I'm going to cry right now because she has listened to our current rendition and loves it she likes it even better than the one that she did and to hear that from one of my witchy Idols is just blowing me away I can't even you know when I was first exposed to it I was exposed to it like kind of the exact opposite way I was at one of our old Community rituals and she spoke it wow and then I was like what is that and then she was selling the poem on cassette tapes and I bought the cassette tap and God I wish I could put hands on that right now I actually might have it in my storage you said that before and you better go look for that woman but this is one of the best pieces of work witchcraft related in my opinion period it's really a call to action and and we need that right now you know you can't have religious intolerance Injustice you can't have blind hatred and ignorance calling the shots I mean there's too much going on in the world right now to not call attention to it to not try and call it out I mean witches are in danger women are in danger people of color are in danger immigrants are in danger lgbtq people are in danger it's scary it's a scary time you know we need to take care of each other and and that's really what this work is about is and I know that the people that were killed most of them especially here in the US were not witches they were regular old people people nor were they necessarily burned but it's more about the sentiment and not the literal context you know in other countries there were people that were burned and some of them probably were hedge witches but most of them were just persecuted people and we can't we can't have that so I think it's very timely that we we put it out not to mention that is something that I always kind of go back to this time of year I don't know why it stirs like almost like a memory yeah a lot of people that hear that it stirs almost a past life kind of memory you know maybe again maybe you weren't necessarily a witch being burned at the stake but maybe you were a persecuted person in a past life and it it really is it's stirring go listen if you haven't listened yet it's freaking fabulous but yeah it does bring me into this time of year this introspective dark kind of sour time of year and we're headed towards that Harvest yeah I mean this is we are we are walking up to that last Harvest kind of last call you know the final things that can be reaped from what you've sown literally and figuratively like you said you went shopping in my yard and the reason you could do that is because I live on the top of a mountain in farm country in the middle of the woods and I see that on a daily basis I see people out there you know they're getting the last few big harvests out of the fields but things are dying you know the tomato plants are pretty much dead and you can just grab the last few and there's a lot of gourds and everything leaves are changing and falling yeah and that's really what s is about is death things are dying and getting ready to go inside and underground for the winter at least here you know there's there's a big thing with this being kind of like an ancestor work time a spirit work time very much so yeah it's a lional space belain and sin are both what we call Lial spaces spaces between like between this world and the next when the veil between us and and our beloved dead is thinner but you know I've been seeing an argument pop up over the last year or so and it seems to be a Hot Topic this time of year rightfully so oh what is it that that Veil is always thin we only focus on it these two times of year and I feel like there's something to be said for that it's almost like you only think about things when they're relevant sure so this would be the time where you'd think it'd be the thinnest okay I think we're gonna be on opposite sides of this so tell me what the argument is for being thin all the time because I'm very curious okay so you practice psychic mediumship it's not my thing but I've done it yeah but but okay so how come you can be a psychic medium in July if the veil's not thin just because it's not thin doesn't mean you can't talk to them I could talk to my friend in the other room through a wall but I can talk to them easier through a door you're so logical [Laughter] my opinion is that yes I talk to my ancestors all year round I talk to my beloved dead probably more often than I should my I've told you before my grandmother doesn't like to be quiet is it easier this time of year do you feel yes I do I do feel that I do very much feel that and could that be because so many people like you said are paying attention to that it could that much energy focused on that type of idea puts power to it so that puts strength to it however I feel that the veil is thinnest on belane and sin because those are the cruxes those are the culmination of life and death and those are the limal spaces being born and dying those are the two times when you are closest to that Veil okay I get you on this I do I I I agree with that completely and I wasn't thinking of it that way I was more thinking of it as a talking through the wall or through the doorway kind of thing that's how I see it I mean you can talk through the wall you know it's just harder if you have a phone you can make it easier so some people can talk to them easier than others you know depending on your abilities what tools you use how often you talk to them but I do feel that this time of year is literally things are dying no matter where you live in the United States your seasons are going through a change right now things are changing and you can see that and the Kels that started this Festival they could see that they knew that this was the dying part of the Year people were more likely to die in the winter time right you know babies were more likely to not make it in the winter time you know we don't have those pressures but we can see the trees and the fields and the the farms you know Going Quiet nature itself is going towards death going dormant that dormant stage and in the southern half of the world it's belane things are growing birthing going through that birthing tunnel they're coming out into the world and coming up from the Dark Again a Lial space those two times birth and death and that's happening right now on both the northern and the southern hemispheres that's powerful so yeah I do feel that it is more thin this time of year and for reasons okay so you're swaying me in your direction I was I was let astray by the old internet I'm interested in that I do see where people would think that I'm you know I'm not trying to say that that's totally wrong but I'm I'm starting to think that maybe they weren't taking into consideration your exact point point and and maybe they were just thinking of it more on a communication level which again you made a good point with the whole door and and wall thing but some people just think that that Veil is just as thin 247365 and those might be the people that have a really good connection with their dead or with all the dead you know there are some people there are levels of sensitivity so maybe those are just super sensitive people I don't know it could be just thought since it was a good thing to to get our opinions on but one of one of the traditions of sin that I kind of like the most is the ancestor you know I guess this is kind of not that we don't have ancestor altars going on the regular or that we don't do that type of work but this is almost like preset on your calendar to do ancestor work right yeah and because like you said it it looks like ancestry time you know everything's going seepy atoned everything's dying and going within so it it it's looking very Cemetery like yeah yeah that's right that's a good way to put it I like that so yeah working with ancestors is huge this time of year and you know how you view who and what your ancestors are is absolutely a personal thing you know you could be working with the energies of people you are genetically related to 8 10 Generations back or you could be working with an ancestor that say Your Grandparent or your parent you could be working with an author who was married to a rockstar because she decided she wanted to and they don't have to be related to you you don't have to know who your relatives are there are all sorts of ways that spirit and an I look at ancestors is people who have passed on before me it doesn't have to be a DNA link that's right just like people in your life right now some of them are chosen families sometimes spirit will choose chose you for all sorts of reasons bloodline be damned well you're my sister from another mister so that's right yeah yeah you're stuck with me whichever one of us goes first is going to have to deal with the other one in spirit form that's all there is to it pretty much you know I think this is a time where maybe it's on people's minds more it's on mine I know for me personally it it it's a little bit easier because two people that I do a lot of ancestor work with my my grandparents one died in September and one died a few days before sin so it's almost like more like I feel like doing that type of stuff connecting with them now because it's also I don't want to see like a death anniversary but kinda yeah yeah that does make sense I mean anniversary the time of year when I lost them September October so it makes sense for me to have that come to mind this time of year you know in preparation for recording this I was listening to our last year's sa episode and man I was depressed I was sad I remember after that we were both like man we're depressing Nellies here I actually got some emails we were like I didn't like that episode you talked too much about your feelings I'm like well I was sad man sometimes it happens but you know that's that's part of the the ancestor work and the shadow work and the going within is dealing with that and you know it's easy to avoid your inner on a hot sunny day as opposed to curled up on your couch cuddling with your blanket and your cat and all that floods to you when it's gray and rainy and the leaves are falling and you're snuggled inside that's when your brain is going to start reminding you oh yeah your beloved grandmother passed away last year you know and you start thinking about that but yeah it's more in your face now last year when I was sad I found a lot of comfort in doing the rituals don't sa your don't say journaling don't say journaling I won't say it yet but no it was mostly the my favorite parts of s you know decorating for the season getting out all the fall things putting up more candles um I I really enjoyed clearing off and resetting my ancestor Altar and as hard as it was I've talked about this before but one of my rituals I stole from one of our Pagan community members was I have a very large black plate big huge circular black plate and around it I have started writing in sparkly markers gold and silver but I've started writing people's names that have passed on in a spiral around this plate and I use that especially this time of year to remind me of my beloved dead of those that have been in my life that touched me that have passed on so I put their names on there and so adding names and looking at the names that are there and and redoing my altar gave me a lot of comfort now just real quick I don't want to go in depth cuz we are kind of running out of time here but I wanted you to Quick tell me tell them I know what you do with it the plate so you do the dinner for the dead what's that called yes the silent supper or some people call it a dumb supper or a silent supper I I like to do that as well I'm actually going to do it starting October 1st this year but I will usually set a place with really fancy place settings at my table and I'll leave it there and the reason you do that is to invite your beloved dead into your home it's basically Al setting a place for them at your table and you can just do it at a meal or you like me you can set it for the entire month if you wanted to but this is a tradition that did come from the Irish from the Kelts the idea was at this time of year your dead are more likely to visit you good and bad and so you want to put things out to invite your beloved dead to you and to scare away anyone who might be trying to cause problems uh and a silent supper is literally just what it sounds like you set a place for them you set places for everyone else you serve food and drink to that plate for your beloved dead and then you have an absolutely silent dinner and the idea is to honor them and I'll usually put that plate outside for the animals and then take it in the next day but you know that's a silent supper and that's something that traditionally you can do for S and then I love how you personalize it with your plate and your Plate's gorgeous you know that's something that's special we've talked before about having ancestor altars we like to have items from our ancestors on there and you have quite a few tokens from your ancestors on your altar now when you meditate or speak to your ancestors do you do anything special with those do you like hold them do you you know how do you call to your ancestors it depends on what ancestor I'm working with and maybe that's a good thing I want to convey to the listeners is you know how I call my grandfather and how I call my aunt are two different things because we had two different relationships you know with my grandfather lifelong fireman um I will just sit there and kind of meditate with one of his fire badges it was a badge he wore while he was in service and but like with my aunt it's more like a just like hey you out there but that was the relationship we had you know right so you connect with your ancestors differently you know what I mean oh absolutely if you're connecting with an ancestor that may not be a maybe a blood relation or someone that you ever met in this lifetime me personally I'd be a little more you know kind of like how I am at work well hello there you know would you mind if we had a conversation you know I would be a little more I don't know if polite is the word but like with my aunt I'd be like hey little code switching with your ancestors absolutely yeah so you know just how you deal with people face to face differently yeah deal with you know Spirit differently when I want to talk to my father-in-law pack a bowl and hang out and and that's when we chill and I can feel his energy yeah or you know you can do the same thing with pictures if you have a photograph yeah but with my grandmother I am not going to have cannabis involved with that espe she would fly that wouldn't fly right so like you said we you know you call them differently and you'll know how that works with each one as you work with them because you journaled it I worked it in there you had to didn't you I did I did but the beginning of October is just fantastic it's when the the leaves here in the Northeast are stunningly gorgeous and everything is just speaking fall to me the things that I do throughout the month like carving pumpkins or last year I carved some parsnips to kind of be a little more traditional because people used to carve turnips into scary faces to ward off evil spirits which by the way if you're interested in Lila's carved turnips by the way hysterical hysterical so cute go go back through our Instagram because I posted them last year and they are the cutest damn things but yeah carving gourds decorating your house this is a great time of year to set Wards at all your windows and doors you know keep out the bad keep in the good the whole trick-or treat thing right you don't want any tricks you just want the treats so now is a great time to do that speaking of trick-or treat I forgot I had gotten a message somebody asked about what do you do like you know how they kind of portray that you if you don't celebrate it on the day you'll be damned you know you know trust me we've done you know the holiday was on a Tuesday and we did the ritual on a Saturday this is real life here people and I had someone say am I allowed to celebrate sin the next day I have young children they expect to go out trick-or-treating blah blah blah blah blah okay people can I just say that my my my coven ritual is scheduled right now for November 2nd you're okay you don't have you're okay if you take your kids trick-or treat and you're good it's not a big deal if you want permission from history they traditionally celebrated it on the evening of the 31st to November first and their calendar was different than ours so don't even worry about it and some places they celebrated for three days and three nights with all sorts of great parties so don't worry about it on the night of the 31st between the 31st and the 1st if all you have time for is hey happy witches New Year then that's okay you know do it when you can it's not that big of a deal now one of one of the folks that I honor every year happens to be my grandmother and you know you remember her she was she was a a ho but Halloween was like her Christmas my my grandma put Halloween above everything she did don't you have a pin of hers that was like a C CAU yes I put that on my ancestor alar for her but my kids every year after she died while they trick-or-treated which my kids trick-or-treated till 18 power to teenage trick-or-treating yeah if you come to my house and say Trick or Treat with a bag you're getting candy my kids would set aside one piece of candy and put it on my altar kind of not for my grandma because obviously she wasn't you know phys here to eat it but my kids would put a piece of candy because when they think of my grandmother they immediately go to Halloween because that was her thing so like they would leave out like a piece of candy granted knowing my kids it was probably a piece of candy that they hated and wer G to eat but it was the sentiment behind it you know that made me think of food offerings and a lot of times people ask what do I do with food offerings and I don't remember where I got this from but one of the things I like to do with not all of them but with some like say your candy right there what I like to do is say I have a a bite-size Snickers bar and I'm going to put that on my Altar for my grandma what I will do is instead of saying here grandma here's a bite-size Snickers for you as an offering I would say I offer you the Sweet Taste of the Snickers and then I would leave the Snickers on the Altar for a day or two or whatever and then I would eat it and as I eat it that taste I would offer that to my ancestors or say you're making tea or or blending an incense you can say I offer the aroma of this tea to my ancestors and leave the cup there and then as you drink it and smell it that is honoring your ancestors so you can do that with all sorts of things with the food you can say I offer the flavor of this food or the heat from this food to my ancestors and then consume it yourself or give it to Nature and then that way you're not offering them something that they might not necessarily need you know the spirit would probably like the heat from that food more than they would like that piece of mashed potatoes or whatever I'm super basic I would put the candy on the alar and be like hey Graham here's to you and then after a little while I would open it and be like here's to us and I'd eat it yep exactly same thing same thing I'm such a candy I'm sorry yeah I just like to take it one little step further and say I offered you the sweetness of this candy or I offer you the flavor or the Heat or the you know the spices of this food or whatever just to give them energetically something a little more appropriate I don't know I'm just way more conversational with my spirits I guess yeah absolutely same thing hey let's have some food together you know you enjoying that food and talking to them about it I think is very magical but I do like the whole separating sa Ritual from Halloween thing because I like the concept of trick-or-treating with my grandson and you know we all still dress up come on now but it's almost like I look at it as you're going around with this mask on almost like the mask of Summer oo and when you are done trick-or-treating for the night you know you kind of lift that mask off and are kind of like I don't want to say a new shell look at you getting all deep someone does that to me it's weird it's weird why do you think our our last year's episode was so depressing this is what it but kind of like a because remember it's also the witch's New Year right so kind of like a coming out the other side you know what I mean you're shedding The Mask you're sh you're you're kind of shedding that old skin like how a snake sheds its skin yeah exactly I love that maybe I'm a weirdo it made me think of in last year's episode we talked about maybe taking you know how kids can take paper plates with string and you could cut out eyes and cut out a little mouth and draw a face on it well yeah we talked about making masks like that magically you know maybe drawing sigils or or drawing something on that mask that you want to get rid of you know and removing it and then burning that mask in a bonfire or a safe burn dish you know burning things I know you're a fire buug this sa is a huge fire Festival you know used to be marked by people putting the fires out in their home lighting Central fires in town you know walking through it or putting your cows through it to purify them and then taking that fire back to your house so incorporating fire into your decorations or into your spell work or rituals can be you know really Empower them this time of year so burning those masks is a good way too but I like what you said just as your trick-or-treating with like your regular costume or whatever just think of the idea that that's the old and then when you take it off that night you're shedding the old and getting ready for the witches New Year I love that you know kind of shedding your skin that is pretty cool I know I'm taking a Halloween costume using it to like shed your skin but that's how my mind works I love it I think that's a really great way to celebrate I think that's cool I also like separating Halloween and S I do too I mean I know that it's it's similar in the whole you know you're disguising yourself so the bad spirits can't find you you know you're decorating your house to invite in the good good spirits carving pumpkins again to try to keep the bad fairies or the bad spirits from getting to you but it's more fun to just you know experience Halloween and then you know do something a little private for yourself for sa I think that's cool well and you know again to my previous Point sometimes it's just a real life thing you know you have kids I have kids we had to do the take your kids out and and get the candy loot thing so you know I always looked at it as Halloween was the night I celebrated with my kids we honored my grandmother and then a day or two later was when I kind of got down and witchy with my group or my coven or you know whatever so I kind of looked at Halloween as almost like my S and celebration with my kids I guess you know what I mean oh I like that it's like it's like a s for kids oh how fun yeah that's a good way to look at it so we have a whole month this is the end of September when this episode comes out and we have a whole witchy month of episodes planned we're going to talk seances and Ouija boards we're going to talk to a ghost hunter we're going to talk about dark deities and ancestor work and all sorts of wonderful things we have some excellent interviews coming up all things October this whole month is a wonderful time to really get your witch on now you can put out all your witchy stuff even if you're in the broom closet CU you can just say it's seasonal you can wear your more flowy sweaters that look like cloaks and I love those wraps those like sweater wraps that totally look like a cloak my favorite and if you live in a place where being an outward Witch is not a great experience this is your time to shine wear your cloak wear your witchy stuff and when they say what are you for Halloween I'm a witch when my kids were in elementary school I mean I wasn't exactly in the broom closet but we lived in a somewhat conservative area well I happen to have a collection of witch hats so every day in October when I went to go pick them up I wore a different witch hat to kid pickup no one said a damn thing because it's the witchy season it's October you can get away with that even in a slightly conservative area that was fun I mean I I kind of looked at it as my time to shine man yeah you know if you're doing the incense and the candles and the simmer pots I know you love a good simmer pot this time of year I do baking if you're baking something muffins and anything pumpkin spice and you know you can put sigils in your baking kitchen witchery you know put a little magic in what you're cooking but yeah it's it's definitely a time of year when it feels like everything I do has a touch of magic to it right now I know we could talk about this for 800 years but these people they they got to get to work and tent to their lives so good point we need to
