it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends on opposite coast of the USA get together to tell each other's spooky Tales from across America while smoking copious amounts of the sweet G to they can get their hands on really what we try to do is not giggle the whole time and as usual we have been doing a little pregaming because this is a somewhat of a rough episode at least for me and uh getting ready for all of it but before we get into it I am your host with the most on the west coast Leila that that kind of flowed really good the host with the most on the west coast well I'm the beast on the East yeah baby that actually sounds good because I do crypted a lot beast on the East I love it that's true my queen crypted I'm shell and I'm really high today can I just oh gosh me too like you said we kind of have some we have some deep story today so I needed to be high to hear this from you it's a good story and I I I'm definitely intrigued but I really needed to be high for it oh absolutely we are in the middle of our holiday 3 podcast program we are at ghost of Christ Christmas present this was hard because very hard you know ghost to Christmas Past I that's that's easy and you know I have a good vibe for ghosts of Christmas future but this present one kind of threw me for a loop oh same I called you last minute last night being like H I have some ideas but I don't know what I'm doing and you being awesome gave me some fabulous advice and some great Avenues and then I went right back to the first thing I thought of anyway so we're going to stick with our ghosts of Christmas present but first what the heck are you smoking oh I'm loving it it's like it's like Christmas in my house today because I have cracked open a jar of the best the most yummiest Jack hair that I have been curing for a little while and it's ready it's ready and I love it it's so beautiful oh my God that's pretty isn't it gorgeous for all you folks who can't see Lea's weed it's gorgeous it's beautiful and it actually you know what it looks like a tree like a like it's got that Christmas tree color it's like that darker greenes it's about as long as my thumb it's pretty thick it's got it's dark green with dark red hairs like you know how sometimes weed can be like lighter green this is like Christmas tree green very seasonal it is thank you thank you now it's delicious it has a great insensi taste I would say however if this is a real Jack hair I'd be surprised it's got a great stone I'd probably say mid to high 20s did someone just get high and name it is that what you're saying the s a real Jack hair is that what you're saying possibly I got this from a reputable breeder and as far as they know I'm sure it is a jack hair but it's not like the tasty yummy delicious fabulous kick you right between the eyes Jack hair that I remember from back in the day I'm stilling for it I feel like we just talked about this last episode about how things aren't like Jack hair in California Jack hair in New York two different things so this this kind of circles back to that conversation where there's no consistency my friends no consistency no if you get a gelato here there's no guarantee it's going to be the same delicious gelato in Colorado so I got this stuff called grape glue let me tell you it's kind of funny because I've only been smoke I've only been smoking for about a half hour before we started recording and I'm really high nice to get you high that fast it's got to be good it doesn't taste like grape FYI but I'm always up for a good glue and I'm feeling chatty and I'm I don't feel like I'm ready to like go to bed or anything like that I'm feeling uppity chatty high so two thumbs up so far I like that now is it purple with the name grape you would no really bumer but I've had grape strains before that did have like purple hairs on it this no not so much probably same thing it's probably somebody calls it that and it's not really now I would love to see the science on it but I would guess and hope that gorilla glues seem to me at least in my experience have the same consistency if I get a GG number four anywhere it's going to be good they're going to be solid midsize nugs super sticky maybe not super crystally but very sticky very good tasting and an excellent mid to high range smoke every single time well my theory on this one is that my theory I have nothing to back this up on is that they potentially took the grape diamond and crossed it with a gorilla glue with a gorilla glue and that's how came with the grape glue I'm guessing I I know you go to to great um dispensaries so this is not the case for them but backyard weed breeders in my opinion are almost as bad as backyard like puppy mill breeders because I feel like I feel like there was a time in our life where you were like oh I got these clones I'm G to give them a go oh I love it I will grow anything I will grow a clone happily because then at least you know it's female but seeds and I'll grow it like I'm not that picky I'm going to grow it but don't tell me that it's a gorilla glue I'm just theorizing that it's grape diamonds crossed with Gorilla Glue I don't know that for a fact right well don't tell me it's a pumpkin jack when you just made that [ __ ] up and passed it off that way if you don't if you bred two things together and you don't know what they are that's fine I'll still grow it but don't pretend that it's a it's a stable cultivar right so rant over call it a salad where you just Blended a bunch of [ __ ] together and whatever Happ kitchen sink call it the kitchen sink call it the salad call it Grandpa cookies 1 through 12 I don't care but don't but don't say it's when it's not that's not fair but it but but it's tasty and it's good and I'm high so we're on it we're having a good start here with this yeah not talking about Happy Valley I'm not dissing them in any way because I'm sure that's not what they did we love them but somebody must have that's right somebody did it h okay so I'm packing more weed forcefully thank you you're gonna need to I'm stuff and shoving because today my bestie I am talking about a cur True Crime Story that's happening right now and is ripping hearts out all over the country this holiday season and unfortunately this is a quote unquote ghosts of Christmas present a lot of emotion this is actually not even just a nationwide story right now this is a worldwide story right now um and it's it's sad it's sad we're talking about the Moscow murders the four college students that were killed November 13th in Moscow Idaho I don't even know where I want to start with this it's so [ __ ] hard it's difficult because every it's gripped everyone for different reasons either you are a college student or you have a college student who's a friend or a child or you were a college student I was gonna say from my perspective Jesus I'm a parent I have kids that age I have I also have a child who's almost that age and about to go off to college and do these things and and it was a time in their lives when they were partying and having fun and one of them was just back for a visit and was ready to start her life in a whole new state and it just it's young lives cut short and there's so much mystery around it I think is why it's captivated people so much the bottom line is it's [ __ ] up it's very [ __ ] up oh okay so I follow daily mail Daily Mail is kind of my news source um I find that I'd rather have my news come from England than America we won't go there so I I I I read daily mail every day um in between work in between meetings here and there I'm checking Daily Mail and it has been all over obviously since day one I think what what first got me because you know how when you're on these news sites um you kind of scroll to something that catches your eye and I think what really caught my eye in the beginning was that I do have kids around around that age I have been that kid going to that party house and too many questions you know the other thing that I that that kind of sucked me in a little bit right from the get-go is what is with all these incident like this is this is just my personal opinion do not bombard us with emails but what is going on where I feel like every time some [ __ ] goes down in America the cops don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing like where did you go to school friends who trained you this is yet another instance where bad decisions by the police particularly in the beginning may have compromised the situation so again what what we're talking nobody does nobody does their job perfect I can't say that I've done my job Perfect all day every day day after day year after year I get it but so how have you not figured this out that's your job that's what you do and for someone and you know me back in the day back before I had children I was on track to become I was going to college to be a police investigator like that was my mindset so it's not just me shooting off at the hip on my opinions I feel like I have a good basis to have that opinion like get your [ __ ] together police peoples now in the early hours of November 13th Sunday November 13 2022 this year so we want to make sure people know this is present this is this is present this open investigation as we speak that's right there was new information just recently but Madison Mogan kayy Gales shanana kodal and Ethan chapen who was Shana's boyfriend we're all out having fun they were students at the University of Idaho and we're living in a sorority house in Moscow Idaho on King Street or King a I'm not 100% sure just just real quick geographically this is kind of like a relatively wooded area correct at least where this house is I mean it's a suburban area and the the back of this house where the sliding glass doors were is is somewhat wooded it's kind of private back there the front of the house where the parking lot and the main entrance of the first floor is um that has lights and is kind of open it's quite a large open parking lot in that area but I mean I just want to give people perspective that might not be familiar it's not like it's in the downtown of a city per se no that's correct it's more of a suburban area um with houses not not directly close to each other but not too far apart either so the four students went partying separately shanana and Ethan went to a fraternity party at Sigma Chai which is on NES Pierce Drive in the area and they left and were seen at that party around 8:00 p.m. that evening Kaye who was in town to show off the new Range Rover that she had bought for herself had arrived to show Maddie the car and to go to a pifi party did I say farty pii party pii party to go to a pifi party U I believe it was a formal that's the annoying thing about being in college is trying to figure out how to say all these fraternity and sorority names right that evening Kaylee and Madison decide to go out and they go to a club uh it's called the corner Club on North Main Street and they were seeing there around 10 p.m. or I'm sorry uh they decide to go about 10 p.m. they're picked up at 10:15 and arrive at the club at 10:20 and at midnight that night just on 11:13 at midnight anah kotal called her father Jeffrey and spoke to him what unfortunately was the last time and said everything was fine and that they were all just hanging out then at 1:00 a.m. the two roommates who were on the first floor the two surviving roommates get home at about 1 a.m. about 1:30 Kaylee and Madison leave the bar and they end up being seen um at a grub truck on South Baine that they're seeing on Twitch video there laughing having a good time and they end up getting a r home back to the house and they get there around 1:56 a.m. so now everybody's at the house the two surviving roommates on the first floor shanana and Ethan are there as well as Kaylee and Madison so basically by 2 o'clock in the morning they're all back in the same location then exactly they're all they're all back at that house we also know that starting at 2:26 a.m. Kaye calls an ex-boyfriend Jack she repeatedly calls him several times over the next 20 or so minutes did he not answer he did not oh Maddie and again they were found in the same room so they were probably in the same room talking Kaylee had moved out of this house and she did have a room on that floor with Maddie but she wasn't staying in it that evening again she wasn't living there she was staying at her mother's house she had just come back to show Maddie her new car and to go out for the night now Kaye and Maddie grew up together they were referred to as sisters by almost everyone who knew them they were extremely close and so it's no surprise that you know coming home from a drunken night of partying that they would end up in the same room and apparently drunkenly try to call kayle's on again off again ex Jack so about 2:44 Maddie starts to call Jack as well to no answer they both try a couple more times and stop just before 3:00 a.m. that night in the morning roughly 11:45 a.m. the two surviving roommates get up so how much time basically has passed well the last call to Jack was again just before 3:00 a.m. about 2:52 and and then I woke up at about 11:45 about 11:30 sometime around we don't know exactly sometime around 11 is 11:30 in the morning so maybe like five hours give or take have passed right now some of this is going to be speculation because the police have not released a lot of this information what we know for sure is that at 11:58 a.m. someone a friend not one of the roommates used one of the roommates phones to call 911 and report that someone was unresponsive at the residence what is speculated is that when the roommates woke up they went to Ethan and Shana's room or one of the two bedrooms and found a locked door and tried to wake them up and maybe were calling and texting their friends phones and were getting no response and so at that time they called some friends to come over that part is known that they called friends to come over and then those friends said we need to call 911 so we don't know for sure if they saw the murdered friends or if the doors were locked and shut behind the killer we don't know but it's speculated that maybe they didn't open the door and that's why the 911 call was for an unconscious person ah it's also speculated that when the roommates opened the door and saw the what is described as terrible scene of the killings that one of them passed out and that the 911 call was for that unconscious person but that's just speculation I Goa so the police um arrived very quickly after that 911 call within minutes and they found kayle's dog there they released that dog later to kayle's boyfriend Jack released the dog like what's that even mean just that they gave it to him you know so they did say that the dog was not in any of the rooms where the killings had taken place and that there was no evidence on the dog itself so speculation is that the dog either maybe knew the person who came in was asleep in one of the bedrooms that wasn't being used or possibly had either been let out of the house or shot in one of the unused bedrooms by the killer oh wow the police arrived and pronounced all four students dead and described the scenes as horrific and very very brutal there was speculation at one point that the amount of blood in the second floor bedroom had been so much that there was blood showing through the walls coming down the outside of the house I do believe that was later debunked but I can't find that information but I'm fairly certain that that that rumor was debunked however they have said that there was an extreme amount of blood at the scene wow wow oh my God I didn't realize that so the coroner arrived at the scene and Report reps now have stated that alternately that all four people died in bed and that some of them had defensive wounds that I heard yeah it's believed that they died very quickly even the ones with defensive wounds because the wounds were described as very deep lacerations very deep stabs and they would have bled out very very quickly um so it's not believed that they woke up or if they did it was only briefly gotcha the theories as to why the people on the first floor were unharmed now before we started recording this podcast I showed you the layout of the house right and it's very very mazike it's reminiscent of when we were in college and we and some of our friends rented apartments in town off campus they were very often houses that had been converted right and had the weirdest layouts this house is similar so I do feel that particularly in shanana and Ethan's case their bedroom was on the second floor or which the same floor as the sliding doors and the and the kitchen and to get to that room it kind of involved going through a little bit of a maze to get back there it's kind of tucked back out of the way so you I felt I felt after seeing the floor plan that that person had to have been familiar um with the inside of that place because it really was a maze and I was shocked when I saw the floor plan and and yeah now unfortunately that doesn't really rule out a lot of people because yeah this is a sorority house and it has been a sorority house for years um it's a well-known party house and people have been in and out of it quite a bit what about the theory though that one of them had a stalker that is a theory and there have been some people looking into it police and other people have spoken to a vape shop owner in the area who said he do Madison and uh Kaylee quite well and at one time when they were there he was talking to Madison about safety and she had mentioned that they were very familiar with a stalker type situation and kind of made a head motion over towards Kaylee more or less implying that she had dealt with that in the past and mentioned that they traveled together because of safety reasons the stalker issue that Kaye herself is believed to have talked about was a time when she was at a pet store and two men she felt were kind of threatening to her but upon looking at footage and speaking to people that were there including the two men in question they've determined that it really wasn't anything they were just two guys that were there and saw a pretty girl and didn't really follow her or harass her or do anything so the stalker thing has not really been there's no real leads on that that hasn't really gone anywhere however it is a popular Theory because it it feels strange to have something like this be so Random a knife attack feels very personal if you talk to profilers they will tell you that usually if someone uses a knife that's an up close and personal rage f sex filled kind of act but to kill four people as you can see from the floor plan of the house they're not only on separate floors they're like on separate sides of the house on separate floors he had to go up one set of stairs to kill Kaye and Maddie down those stairs through the house around the kitchen and you know through another place to get to Ethan and shanana so I don't understand if it was just one person or one person with a stalker those rooms were far enough apart he didn't have to do it why kill both of them which is apparent in the fact that there were survivors right right and why leave survivors so there's a lot of questions here I do personally feel that the police know in what order they were killed and my reasoning for this is DNA is amazing nowadays they do feel that there was one killer with one knife so that knife when you kill one person is going to then transfer that DNA onto the second person we'll now have two DNA types of blood on them right then when they kill the third person they'll have three types of DNA and then the fourth person would now have four different types of blood on them so my personal opinion is they can kind of know in what order everyone was killed well i' also like I'd also like to have faith in the fact that in the year 2022 the coroner can pinpoint right down to within a moment or two of death and should be able to know the time of death of each individual person and kind of lay out a time frame that way I also feel I've seen a few interviews with people talking about the particular type of knife and they think it's some type a type of knife called a kbar knife which is a US military knife and honestly that's pretty specific what they're really saying is it's a it's a knife with one sharp blade a sharp point and a relatively thick blade that has a short stocky cross piece but that's really all they can tell they don't know for sure it was a Kar it just a Kar like KN style yeah and I'm sure that the coroner can also tell that that knife is going to get dull the type of wounds that they had on these students were extremely extremely violent and more than stab wounds they were more than stab wounds from what we've heard so by the time they get to the second third fourth person that knife is going to start to dull and I believe that that would also show in the in the type of cuts and wounds that are on each person are they 100% positive that there was only one weapon that has not been released I'm fairly certain that they are they nothing has ever been mentioned about potentially two types of knives all they ever talk about is a kbar type knife so I'm pretty sure all the wounds are consistent and being one type of knife which would also lend Credence to it being one killer because usually in a knife attack if there's two different Killers there's two different types of knives when we talked about the Scream killing not too long ago those those two kids each used a different type of knife and so they could ascertain who had done which stab wounds based on the knife wounds because they were different now I also would like to point out that for the type of wounds that we've heard about in the type of really horror scene that that that they've portrayed this has to be someone I don't want to say that has a good amount of power behind them but like this ain't no weak that committed this this this was someone who had some muscle some power some stature this wasn't I don't want to say a weak person couldn't do it because that's not right but but this is this is someone who had some thrust behind those that's right in order to continue going through four people at least one of whom fought back it had to a physically fit bigger human most likely a man I agree from the description of the wounds it had to be a very strong person a larger person I'm just thinking that this might not this might not be another teenager or potentially not even another college student just because I'm just thinking the amount of physical force it would take to make this happen not just once but four times right that's that's very possible now there are some current clues that we do have that the police have released to us I have a very strong feeling that they have quite a bit of information that they have not not told everyone oh absolutely absolutely and that's a given yeah one of the things they have asked for help for is looking for a vehicle a white 2011 to 2013 Hyundai Elantra uh this is a vehicle that was seen in the area of the killings around the time of the killings actually when they first put out a notification about looking for this particular vehicle a gas station assistant manager in the area decided she's like I work the graveyard shift I'm going to start going through our security footage to see if I can find anything she said she just had a feeling and she did indeed on that night find footage of a white car going very fast down a a side street off of a Highway uh around 3:45 that night and it's the same kind of car so she's handed over all of that footage and the police have asked if anyone in the area or if you know anyone who has a white Hyundai Elantra between 2011 in 2013 just to let know if I owned a white Elantra and I was in a three-state radius I'd be like come look at my car so you know it's not me [ __ ] right they know everyone who owns a white 2011 2013 Hyundai Elantra in a three-state area and it's just they got to go down that list the other thing I'm fairly certain that they know that they haven't talked about is geolocation I am positive about what geolocation what's that I'm high that means that every single time you bring your phone anywhere oh yeah they can get a warrant and find out where you were where you went so yeah but you got to know somebody you got to have a suspect to be able to do that on not exactly they could possibly get a warrant for a geo location a Geo fenced area within a certain within a certain distance of that house and they could get a listing of every single cell phone that was in that area in that time no [ __ ] really no [ __ ] yep oh my god when I go to my underground weed guy I'm leaving my phone home that's actually a really smart idea not that I'm trying to uh help any criminals here but leave your phone and leave your car at home if you plan on doing anything illegal kids but yeah so they know everyone who is in that area and it's just a matter of going down phone records and making sure everyone who was there should have been there and was where they were expected to be now this kind of takes me back to a point right from the get-go I made so if that's the case I probably should have known that and didn't it if that's the case or I'm just too high and forgot it why why has the killer not been caught by now it's it's been over a month what the [ __ ] are you doing do your job 20,000 Hyundai elantas and probably 10 times that in cellphones that's a big job and if the kill if that car has nothing to do with the killer or if the killer didn't bring their phone with them again very big job part of the problem that we're having here is that first of all profiling is an inexact science there's really no way to tell we can get a good idea right we can look at this scene you can get a rough estimate but nothing 100% because that's actually one of the things I focused on when I was studying that thing stuff in college was profiling yeah you can get a general idea but you're not you know you're not going to pinpoint it right down to that was Leila you know that's right right now my psychic sleuthing self plus we're all like internet web slle nowadays right right so I'm saying this is someone between 25 and 30 probably a former student my guess is most likely is not a current student and was probably kicked out or dropped out with badg grades or that type of thing I do feel that they have partied at that house before enough to know where shanana and Ethan's room was but not enough to know that the first floor had bedrooms I think they thought it was just a basement and that there was nothing there so I think they were familiar enough to know where the the first floor bedroom shanana and Ethan's was but not familiar enough to know where the basement was I do feel that they have never been close enough to the people to be identified as a stalker but I do believe that they knew them because they knew that house would be an easy Mark now I disagree with you and you know why which part I believe I believe the age range I believe current or former student I believe that it is someone that one of the girls wouldn't give the time of day too I feel it is maybe a not not someone who's more of a recluse but kind of and maybe for the first time in their life went out on a limb and was like you're pretty and I like you and they were like yeah whatever someone who'd been at that house to a party before but made an advancement to one of the the girls and was shut down pretty damn quick and then the flip switch you know the switch flip that's possible I do feel that's possible but I don't feel that that person would have been noticeable enough or in their life as a stalk like I don't think if that happened I don't think but removed enough away to not be a suspect that's right maybe they did get shut down but then they were never like seen stalking her again or anything right but in their minds it was like if I can't have you nobody can you know possible know that I'm I'm just thinking it might be a boy that one of the girls shut down in a romantic way and that would make sense for like a a sexual type sadistic killer those types of people they're usually hypersexual uh they fixate on people and they usually kill in a rage they don't usually kill side victims this rage will build up again and they'll have to release it again with another killing to kind of satisfy urge but maybe that's what the friends were possibly so there's two reasons why I don't think it was like a someone driven by You spurned Me and and now I need to get to you and the reason for that is because it was it sounds like it was too neat too well done too methodical and too many victims just in my opinion then the other type of killer that I think it could be is more of like the narcissistic rage driven killer and this person is more they want to kill someone for the power of it and I do feel personally that they targeted the house because it's easy to get to know the layout because it's a party house there's a a lot of victims there they could watch the house pretty easily from the woods in the back of it and even through the windows there's those big sliding windows that the big windows on the bedrooms so I feel like they probably watched the house and maybe has there been has there been any unsolved murders in any type of vicinity there in the land last oh maybe five to 10 years I'm just wondering I didn't even think of that honestly and you kind of really sparked a theory in my mind about the narcissistic killer is could there in theory be someone on the loose okay so just weeks just weeks before these kids were killed one of their neighbors reported that their dog that their 12-year-old mini Australian Shepherd was found killed outside and skinned what with cuts they could tell that it was cut by a knife and skinned by a human so this wasn't like a bear came out of the woods and ate your dog type [ __ ] it was not now the police are [ __ ] crazy in the Hood the police have said that that is unrelated to the murders however prove it it fits the pattern of you know the type of killer the serial killer that kills small animals and practices on animals before they move on and maybe the neighbor's dog was a warning that's right or maybe they were kind of working up the courage to do it and needed to try it out on something smaller first liked the rush that they got and then this house or maybe he got caught by the kids maybe one of the kids saw him you know kill the witness I think it was a last opportunity I think it was right before the holidays Kaylee had moved out and was only back to show off her car to Maddie kind of like a Now or Never thing kind of like a Now or Never plus everyone had gone out they all came home drunk everyone of them was drunk it was in the wee hours of the morning parties were still going on there's a police video at 1000 p.m. in the area that we have and then also at 3:00 a.m. that we have like stuff was still going on so it could be hidden in the noise of every night partying so I think they targeted the house maybe like you said maybe they they had a a minor interaction with one of the girls maybe they just picked it because it was a party house and easy but I think they went in there intending to get a thrill by killing as many people as they could see I never heard about the dog and that's why I asked you was there anything any shady [ __ ] going on prior because maybe this just is somebody on a mission which means they better which means they better get their [ __ ] together and find them because if they do it and get away with it they're going to do it again yeah and I I think this type of killer did it for The Rush and would have killed those two girls downstairs if they had known that that was more than just a basement which is why again I think they came in through the sliding doors in the back and I do feel that right now the rush of killing all those people and getting away with it and all the attention that they're getting is more than enough to keep them saded and happy for a very long time my personal belief is that once the attention of this case dies down with no resolution that's when they'll start taunting the police and doing little things to try to get attention again and possibly committing another murder oh [ __ ] it it's just a different type of killer and who knows either one of those Killers could be correct it could be someone who had they did say that Kaylee had more significant wounds than the other three that could be because the knife was dull and they were tired and sloppy at that point or it could be because she was the Target and the rest were collateral damage nobody knows at this point we don't have enough information and that's the scary part of all of this I can't imagine what the Ames are going through but I also can't imagine what the people in the town and at the school are going through because without resolution how can you not watch over your shoulder every second of every day how do you sleep at night my heart absolutely goes out to these families my goodness Ethan was a triplet oh my God his siblings they must their hearts must just be ripped out he has a sister Maisie and a brother Hunter wow I I I can't even imagine and Madison and kayle's families again they grew up together they were regarded each other as sisters which means the parents and and everyone in the family must have some sort of closeness as well horrible when the kids in those families talk about it they say my sisters were killed I how are these people even fathoming the holiday season at this point I would no [ __ ] given if that were me how do you even give a [ __ ] that it's Christmas you don't you just don't and like you said the whole Community the whole College the whole town this is everyone needs answers and it's it's got to be a time of fear for everyone and I I wish them answers and safety and peace I understand that the police can't put all the information out to the public I get it I understand why you got a job to do but for the love of [ __ ] Christ get the job done do your job you want these people to have Merry [ __ ] Christmas figure it out May all the gods intercede and help bring Justice to this case yeah wow I think I need a hit of some of my freaking grape oh real quick let me just real quick one last guy enan harsh uhuh have you heard of him who's that oh boy okay keep an eye on enan harsh AKA chef busy he's a neighbor he's been talking a lot is he the neighbor that's like I'm just socially awkward I just I just don't like talking but yet you're on the news mofo and he keeps putting himself out there and I get the socially awkward thing I completely understand and more than likely that's what it is but as you very well know in these cases the killer often especially if it's the type of Thrill Kill killer that wants this attention they will talking to the news mysteriously that's right they will insert themselves in the investigation they'll talk to reporters they like the attention so while I think he's probably just a socially awkward neighbor he is worth watching but in the same respect you've got to admit since we both tread lightly on that socially awkward line ourselves yes exactly and I don't want to stigmatize him because of that it is more than likely that's all it is because we surely tread that line yes and oh I also want to address some uh the scream but let me just let me just quick say this he could be so freaked out that everyone thinks it's him that he feels that he needs to be out there vindicating himself so there is that aspect and I get that he could be like oh my God I need to tell everybody on the planet that it wasn't that's right that's right and I need to keep telling everyone so that's we Sur are not pointing fingers him it could just be his socially awkwardness and I get it yeah but watch anyway keep an eye on him if he does come out with these YouTube and Instagram channels where he does his juggling sticks and cooking shows by all means keep an eye right also new information again I mentioned that there was a couple police stops in the area that they have on body camera video from them that show the house I do believe in both of them one was earlier in the evening around 10: p.m. and one was at the time of the murder it was just after 3:00 a.m. and the murders occurred between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. and in what in that 3:00 a.m. video uh people do feel that there is a scream that can be heard enan harsh also mentioned hearing a scream but he also said he didn't hear any scream around that time it could be a scream I've watched those videos and I I don't recollect a scream but I'm going to go back through and listen to them more closely now but some people also say it could be a tire squealing so I don't know but have to see we need to keep getting as much information as we can I do agree uh we we do but I'm going to go back to my original complaint throughout this whole story's that please please please for all of the police and law enforcement just get it done we all have a bad day at work but then the next day we have to get our [ __ ] done will you show up and get your [ __ ] done please and it's all well and good for us to be armchair sleuths and to talk about what we think might have happened but don't go after real people keep real people's names out of it you know by all means post your your theories and talk about it it's scary we need to talk about it and process it and kind of deal with it but don't dox real people and and don't get so invested in your personal theory that you just run with it there's so much more information being put out all the time and also keep the perspective that how would you feel if this was you or your family or friend and the whole freaking world and the internet were theorizing about your family or friend so be respectful as well yep and we'll have some links if you do have legitimate information that you would like to share we'll have some links in the show notes so thank you all and again our hearts go out to the families and everyone in Moscow Idaho right now and we really pray that you get answers absolutely so so yeah yikes wow Christmas present is pretty [ __ ] heavy I guess it was kind of was in the book too right yeah yeah it kind of was that whole thing is pretty heavy I like the Muppets version if we're to be honest I like the Muppets version of A Christmas Carol the rest of them are very scary I don't know which version is my favorite The Muppets or Mickey Mickey's Christmas Carol or he goes the little yeah like so either the Muppets or Mickey's Christmas Carol the rest like the old like remember when we were kids and there was like that 50s or 60s version in black and white that [ __ ] was creepy yeah that's stuff that's scary as hell but you know what I've been finding so much is is I'm looking for my you know I was looking for my Christmas Past my present and and have been working on my future what'd you get what I keep coming back to and all these articles I keep finding is there's actually movements to bring back the tales of spooky and ghosty stuff at Christmas time like talked about a couple weeks ago in Victoria England we should spearhead that movement I am all for it too late Smithsonian is actually spearheading that movement believe it or not we should support the Smithsonian in spearheading that movement right because basically and and you know I did touch on this a couple episodes ago but for those of you who haven't caught up yet but we know you'll go back and listen you know ghost stories were a part of the dark time of the year the time where you're kind of cold and closed in that wasn't just on sa people it was boring there was no Tik Tock they had to pass the time somehow so basically people from from the sa time almost until about imul you know people were gathered around the fire at night you know people were in in inside all night inside early you know dinner time was at dark time which at that you know nowadays I feel like is at 3: in the afternoon all right all of you that are not in sunny Southern California have to deal with how dark and cold and dreary it is right now PL to you but anyway but so you know the the whole ghost story thing telling kept telling those stories and thinking about your loved ones what you don't you don't talk about your past loved ones and try what better time to break out the Ouija board and bring Grandma back than on Christmas I freaking love it I think I'm going to do that this year seriously if you are ever going to call your ancestor why wouldn't you call them at Christmas so much more fun than S s's all serious and and like o Doom and Gloom but we all know I'm not a cook we all know I'm not a cooker and I always try to make my grandma's Christmas cookies and my grandma are those the clch keys please she'd be the type that would come back and be like [ __ ] you did that wrong on Grandma if you're talking about the clotch keys I will eat your practice cookies all day every day please [ __ ] invite me oh my good Gods I want to be there but imagine you've met my grandma imagine her in on the Ouija board and her being like you [ __ ] that up hey if she tells you how to do it right I will write that [ __ ] down but you know why I understand how immigrants to America and and when the people were settling America wanted to cut ties with some English Traditions but why' you have to ditch ghost stories at Christmas out of all things seriously that is a fabulous tradition I love it so I'm trying to think up of some good stories that because all my adult children my grandson we're all get we're all going to be together for Christmas I'm trying to think of can I come up with some good [ __ ] to Intrigue my kids to to get them going on some Christmas ghost stories I don't know we'll see what I find I like it it is tell me how it goes it's definitely becoming an upand cominging thing so if anybody has any cool Christmas ghost stories or any ghost story Traditions hey we have like a bunch of listeners in Ireland do you do do Irish folks still tell ghost stories at Christmas will you email us some because we're like jealous oh and yeah if you're in Poland I heard something about a cat like a really cat I have a cat what are you talking about oh no no this is a big cat this is like a big scary Ule cat that oh my God like a crypted cat yeah kind of yes but if you don't get new clothes on Christmas Day and wear them the cat will come eat you what is this a real thing I need to know email us the stoned Witches Hour gmail.com because that's kind of cool and also very scary I love cats I would worship that cat so what the cat doesn't like like old clothes is that really the bottom line I guess so I maybe that's why my grandmother kept giving me new socks for Christmas every year I don't know does this cat have a name it's from Iceland okay the Ule cat of Iceland it's called Yola Cunin Yola curin Yola curin the Ule cat of Iceland and it's says that the Christmas cat is a monstrously huge black cat that only appears at Christmas Eve when little children are sound asleep and if there are no brand new clothes amongst the gifts that the and the children do not wear them the children are eaten by the uat the hell that's right and no one's sure where it came from but there was a poem by Johan urum who lived from 1899 to 1972 if you don't get new clothes on Christmas and wear them it will eat you you're screwed yep screwed better get your new clothes I guess that's a good excuse I want new clothes for Christmas now man yeah do new shoes count damn I love new shoes now I do want to just point out one one one funny I found it was called terrifying traditional Christmas Legends o okay I could go you know after the story I had please give me some terrifying Ule and Christmas Legends because I need to pick me up okay now there's the this thing called a Bell's nickel a what now a Bell's nickel I I'm probably saying this wrong he try pronouncing the Christmas cat of Iceland for any of our folks in Germany first of all Don't Judge Me second of all if I am saying this wrong will you please just tell us so I am reading it is a Bell's nickel it's a loud guy that dresses in Furs carrying a bundle of birch switches and he visits the children the weeks before Christmas asking where whether they've been naughty or nice and apparently really what is does he use the Birch switches to like smack them upside the head no no just give me coal man if your ass has been bad it's getting switched now here's the funny thing damn there are some consequen is here here's the funny thing it was brought to America by German IM immigrants which later became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch and the reason I find this story so funny is because my grandma used to whoop our asses with a yard stick and all I'm thinking of and then that was my grandma that was from the Pennsylvania Dutch side and I'm like that woman was beating me because I was bad just like the bells nickel but I think she didn't ask me if I was naughty or nice no she could have at least done that I mean damn I think she just made the Assumption wow you're witchy uh Pensylvania Dutch ancestors were not [ __ ] around but AB bel's nickel was actually considered in um in folklore to be a servant of St Nicholas AKA Santa Claus and basically he would go around and help Santa figure out who was naughty and nice real quick before Christmas what he was bad cop to Santa's good cop apparently no wonder we all love Santa so much he had some other guy do his dirty work but some people think that the bells nickel could be the German um interpretation of Krampus so it depends on like the folklore and stuff so there are some people who think that the bells nickel and Krampus are the same thing and as we know Krampus is the horn half goat half demon opposite of Santa well it's only Rel atively recently that we have kind of like whitewashed and like pacified every single fairy tale and Legend most of these are really dark and and have a balance of a light and a dark character or M you know main type character whereas nowadays we don't talk about Krampus we don't talk about the the bells nickel yeah and the bell's nickel basically when when when the Germans do their have festivals to them they do have the scraggly beard tangled hair caped fur deer antlers and often wear scary masks I imagine that those don't sell as well or didn't sell as well when they were trying to get this whole Christmas slash Festival of overspending and consumption going they wanted just that happy fat Santa dispensing presence nobody wants to be the the downer the negative side I mean [ __ ] even the elf on the shelf that we have it isn't really not a watch a threat it's more of a threat yeah but it's a cute threat even our threats are cute but circling back now can you see why when people came to America and started settling America there were certain European Traditions they're just like you know what [ __ ] that and some of this this you how do I say it scary stuff I think they saw as the downer and they commercialized Christmas into the fat jolly man yeah I think you're exactly right wow and then and the ghost stories went with it not only not only did the bell snickel go Krampus went but the ghost stories went with it yeah and it just got it got uh anglicized into just a lump of coal you'll get a lump of coal in your stocking if you're bad yeah the bells nickel Krampus all of that just got lump lumpl into a lump of coal and then we got the big Jolly man who you can do no wrong just give him cookies man and you'll get presents M cookie yeah right interesting you know I can't live my life without throwing a crypted in there yeah that's so true so true queen of Cryptids but I did want to touch on since we are in the throws of the 12 Days of Christmas I found um 12 Christmas stories oh they're basically 12 and and they have no relation to each other whatsoever 12 brief separate things 12 ghost stories of ghosts that appear supposedly every December all right well let me grab my cchf and my cap my weed and my bong and uh let's go I love that your cief in your cab right and settle in for a nice winter snap while you tell me some ghost stories on uh on the solstice you know unfortunately these are these did come um from the UK these are not necessarily the 12 American Ghost of Christmas that's okay like we said we don't really like Ghost Stories on Christmas we won our Christmas sacer and sweet right visions of sugar plums dancing in our heads man that's right I need something dancing in my head right now all right so give me some folklore so in a location called leam greater London and again for all of our UK friends if I'm pronouncing this stuff wrong don't judge me I love you love me back so leam greater London there was a train disaster there um unfortunately in 1957 two trains collided in dense fog and 90 people were killed and aund more than a hundred were injured damn that sucks so this happened on December 4th in 1957 Cries From victims of the leam train disaster are said to be heard every December 4th on the anniversary of the accident oh wow oh that's there is another version that says that those Phantom screams date back to an incident that happened at that same location on December 4th during World War II but the long and short of it is is every December 4th there's a some sort of imprint on that specific location where the death screams of people are heard and like recording is right there there was an event at that location during World War II and then again this leam train disaster where the two trains collided in 57 but either way I I I really don't want to be there on December fourth I would avoid it I would too that would just kind of really creep me out I mean not a good start to the holiday season that's sad and then another one in Hayworth Yorkshire um the spirit of Emily Bronte who is the author uh you may have heard of this the author of weing heights yeah so she haunts the grounds of the Hayworth par AG her ghost is said to return to her family home every December 19th the date that she died in 1948 so every year on December 19th since 1948 this [ __ ] has been coming back oh wow like you imagine owning that house and being like you know I really don't want you here this year no you know what I would do I'd set a place at the table and be like here you go she appears with her head bowed as in deep thought but she suddenly AV vanishes if anyone comes to her close to what are you trying to give her a hug right why would you do that this one this one I am going to see not that it has anything to do with our East Coast West Coast thing but at a later date I want to dive a little deeper into this one because I'm curious this one is in Bishop's Castle sh shopshire I am so bad shop sh shop I don't know how to pronounce it either I don't know I'm high and I'm not good at these things anyway that's okay someone will email us hopefully one of our friends somebody in the UK tell me about this because check this out Lea you would want to go here all of the ghosts in the UK now think of all of the ghosts in the UK I think the whole place is haunted that's a [ __ ] ton of ghosts yeah like every single Corner every road everything all the ghosts in the UK are said to congregate once a year on December 21st what all of them at the striper Stone per and they say perhaps for a ghoulish AGM but every ghost in the UK 21st that's a lot of ghosts what's the striper Stone it better be big and then it listen to this local Legends suggests England shall be ruined if the court site ever sinks into the ground so there must be so that striper Stones must be must be some type of court site and a a local Legend suggest England will be in Ruins if this ever sinks in the ground interesting on one of the tours the Devil's Chair Satan is said to appear every year and speed up the process of the nation's destruction so basically why does Satan care well because Satan is trying to push the Courtside into the ground so England goes poof gone that damn Satan well damn you Satan I guess now Satan is not the same as as Krampus but I have heard of Satan claw oh really well you know it is kind of an easy anagram of that name so let me tell you how big is the striper stone that all of the ghosts in the UK can congregate there on one day and how much court site is there to pull them all in that sounds pretty uh pretty epic and what day is this that on the solstice on on you man damn I want to go I do want to go there I really do and then if every ghost in the UK is in this one location where's their room for Satan how's he squeezing in I don't know excuse me coming through come through there's always room for Satan yes I don't know now this one okay I am gon to kill the name of this I'm gonna call it fogu fogu fogu fiend lower boss cwell Cornwall I'm killing these oh boy are you I can't even see what you're trying to pronounce and I'm I'm guessing it's I would probably butcher it worse than you keep going our UK friends are Rolland their bloody eyes at me right now okay so in Cornwall on the winter solstice they see a mysterious Phantom appear outside of the pendine fogu according to Legend the figure is a woman in white your favorite you always love the women in white I do it's such a classic around the world popular ghost you know what makes her different how so she's a woman in white with a red rose in her mouth oh okay a flower or something red is you know not unheard of interesting so the figure turns and enters the underground like it's like a dry Stone structure so once she's spotted she turns and enters the underground structure and some say seeing her brings Misfortune another common woman in white theme nobody knows what happens if you follow her into the fogu because yeah because people are smart enough not to do that dumb [ __ ] and the few that have have never been seen again I feel like she's like she's like it pulling you into the sewer oh I love it I love it creepy creepy fend okay Cornwall here's another crash like I I call it a ghost imprint um this is in Kempston Manor in bedfordshire there was a Christmas Eve tragedy that replays itself unfortunately every December 24th at the site of a former Mansion a child is once said to have run out to meet his parents as they pulled up in a hor drawn coach oh no in his excitement for the return of his mother and father for Christmas oh no he was hit and trampled by the horse and died of his injuries oh no so unfortunately um every December 24th you can hear the screams and you can hear horses and like almost like [ __ ] like the pounding of horse Hooves on the ground oh no that's a [ __ ] Christmas baby yeah a year wasn't imprinted with it but hor coach you figure that's been replaying for about a hundred years so that's horrible that's awful next is the Eerie in um and bro Derby Shear um this is a Travelers uh rest Pub and it's said to be haunted by a local farm girl who died falling down the stairs oh that's terrible but I love a haunted Pub well the problem is is that the story goes that she was running to escape a drunken um a drunken employee and it was on a Christmas Eve and as she was trying to escape from this man she felt down the stairs and died well that's an office party from hell right a woman in black with a large set of oldfashioned keys is also said to be spotted drifting around at the same time on Christmas Eve now I think the women who were in charge of houses like whoever I forget what their title was but I think they often had a large set of keys like on a ring like the lady of the manor I don't know yeah you know wouldn't necessarily be the lady of the house but whatever woman was in charge of like the running the household very often and had a big set of keys so I wonder if it was like the inkeeper or something like that now here's one from Wales and Legend has it then an oddly shaped Stone on angle SE is All That Remains of a thief who once stole a Bible wait but it's a stone did he like get petrified over a really long time or something it like magic or like did Merlin turn him into stone they don't really tell you they just say that it's the remains of a thief who want Bible okay I buy that sure I'm I'm in I'm 100% in so he steals this Bible apparently and as he carries it over his shoulder he was suddenly turned to rock giving this the name the robber Stone was the Bible turned to rock too correct oh okay does it look like a person carrying a Bible apparently oh wow every Christmas day it is said that this rock almost like comes to life in the mist and runs three times around in a field in which it stands and then turns back to rock again wow I want to go angle see and see this wow that sounds like my worst nightmare to be inomed in stone and only able to run around three times on Christmas they're stealing a stupid Bible this is this is a part that and and you know not I mean if you're gonna turn the Bible to Stone anyway just let the [ __ ] thief have it I mean damn well you know how it's foggy over there a lot yeah like all I can picture you know in Miss of Avalon when the fog descends and like the gates to Avalon open up all I'm thinking of is like the fog descends on this thieves robbers Stone and the guy stands up stretches runs around three times and then crouches back down and turns to Stone I would just take off I mean if someone was like okay you can run around in a circle three times honey i' be like oh yeah okay sure no no problem and then the first time they let me out of that stone I would be gone I'd be so far run around a circle [ __ ] that I would run away you know how much I want to live in in in Buckingham Palace so this one yes it is your desire this one from West Minister great London they say a phantom monk Bound in Chains appears in Buckingham Palace once a year on Christmas day uh was the que [ __ ] yes a queen a chainbound monk [ __ ] yes yes why didn't she kick his ass out right [ __ ] Queen of England get out of my get out of my castle have there been any sightings of the most recently God's rester Soul deceased Queen of England not that I've seen or heard of yet and I've actually been keeping an eye out because I'm super curious if anyone's gonna know you'll know first so right right tell us so this this Fantom monk at Buckingham Palace his spirit is understood to predate the construction of Buckingham Palace now Buckingham Palace I think they started in like 1701 or 1703 or something like that so like you said not something necessarily with that particular building but that goes along with the land it's on I call it the ghost imprint I don't know why I call it that but I do um but also another weird thing about Christmas Day in Buckingham Palace is also they can sometimes hear the sound of a pistol shot on the the first floor office which was is it a duel was it from a duel tell me was it from a duel well all they do know is that that's the same office where Edward I 7th's private secretary Major John Gwyn ended his life so it's probably putting a bullet to his head to be honest oh man that's sad but I have another good one this is my last one okay my last of my my the last of the 12 creepy ghosty Tales where shell is Reviving The Age Old tell Ghost Stories on U tide what's the what's the last one shell well actually it's not it's not the 12th one it's like the ninth one yeah okay oh so I hyped up the ninth one and we still have we have three to go okay so the ninth one better be [ __ ] impressive what is it what is what trains at Christmas time in England like oh I want to go on a train right I want to go on on one of those um Polar Express train R oh that would be cool but here's here's why you might not want to so a train with glowing red lights is said to appear every December 28th at the site of the former Tay Bridge want to know why why because unfortunately the faulty structure collapsed in 1879 during a violent storm as the train passed over it oh no were there any survivors so again a ghost imprint Legend says the scene is Reena acted every year on December 28th of the train crashing into the cold Waters of the fth of Tay below oh so sad that's so sad um another one in the aisle of white an unidentified partygoer is always spotted every year enjoying the evening at the Manor House near kington Gorges the only problem is is that the property was demolished so like there's just a knight on a horseback also seen there so there's a guy by partying in the middle of nowhere because there's no house because it was torn down well I'm kind of happy for that ghost actually but there's also a night on Horseback scene on the same property that always appears on December 31st oh interesting I wonder what their stories are so a night what would that be like maybe 14 1500s sure so my guess they more likely than not were killed there I I would guess I mean or that was where they were the happiest maybe they left there to go to battle and died violently and so they're sometimes the people's souls go back to where they were the happiest or where they had the most um most emotion in their lives or you know the place that made the most impression on them sometimes so maybe he's just he died violently and he's just gone back to where he was safe doing Patrol at that property that could be um I got a I got a quick Jack the Ripper tie in for you okay so this is the one I should have hyped up all right even this guy can't even avoid Christmas so again West Minister greater London so every year again December 31st what's with New Year's Eve man yeah it's another popular one as it's almost time to ring in the New Year there is a phantom that is said to throw himself off the Westminster Bridge into the into the themes below many believe that it is the ghost of Jack the Ripper the unidentified 19th century serial killer but other people so they're saying that maybe Jack the Ripper committed suicide yeah wow on New Year's Eve [ __ ] bridge I don't know why I haven't been able to find Details these are just like St stories wow I like it that's an interesting speculation very cool um they also say that they see a a police officer and a female jumping off the bridge as well into the river temps also correct holy crap off the same bridge and the the way that theory goes is that police officer was called to prevent the woman from throwing herself over the bridge but um for reasons they cannot tell they they both went over it could have been that it could have been that she started to jump and he was trying to stop her and went with her but every year on New Year's Eve you see a police officer and a woman falling from that bridge oh that's so sad that's so sad and what is now my 12th story for okay let's hype this one up woohoo okay what's what's grand old number 12 Ghost Story number 12 I love castles I should have a castle people yes you should if anybody has a castle you don't want you call me send it I was just looking at castles for sale in Scotland not that I could ever get one yeah we could go in on it I want to be real quick I want to be one of those you know YouTubers where let's go buy a rundown castle in Scotland and fix it up and show our whole fixing up on YouTube a haunted rundown castle in Scotland so that's my dream here's my proposition I have a proposition for all of our our UK listeners um if you are in England Scotland Wales Ireland listen to us listen to my plea to you wouldn't it be fun to give a castle to some Stoner American girls and like like see how that works out like I think it would be funny you'd laugh at us we'd laugh at you be great I think it's a great experiment bring Leila and shell to the UK with our families let us have a castle and we'll show you that we can we can acclimate we can acclimate wait we need find out if weed's legal over there first before we start making deals we do need to find that out first or rather than you know if you want to give us a castle by all means do or if you just have a couch to in your haunted spot in Scotland by all means means shoot us an email we'll come visit and check out your ghost Happ you know I don't mean to pull rank here or anything I'm going to Sidetrack for a second I don't mean to pull a rank here or anything but uh my family goes back to Wales Lea can tie back to to some Scottish Roots here so I think I think somehow someway we're related to somebody who owns a castle that's all I'm saying wink wink nudge nudge wink wink nudge nudge unfortunately my husband's family their Castle is long been in ruins in Scotland really yeah they didn't build a new one the Scottish branch of the family is currently in a castle but it is not the family castle from long ago it's just a castle they live in they actually have a big family reunion that people come to from all over the world in Scotland and we say that we're going to go to it all the time and we just haven't been able to quite get up the money to do it but we really want to one of these days well my daughter and I have been doing a lot of genealogical stuff and I seem to have a lot of people that Trace back to snod Donia so I want to go there the [ __ ] is Sidonia it's it's in like the northern is that a real place it actually is Yo cool it's in the northern part of Wales which is now really considered a part of all of that so just think of like western part of England how neat how cool that's very cool I've never heard of snowdonia I love that name it sounds like a absolute fairy tale place I love it princess of snowdonia oh my God we need to like take a road we can't take a road trip because you can't drive there we need to take a fly trip and go to to the UK let let's do a let's do a we should do a Gund me send Leila and shell to freaking the UK we want to see England Ireland Scotland and Wales let's we could do a little road trip around the area go all over do some ghost hunting H wouldn't that be a winter sols to stream come true oh my God and my friend from England could be our tour guide and we would just make him take like a month off of work and just drive us all over the place because I don't think you and I are safe driving on the wrong side of the road or the wrong side of the car probably not oh my God how fun would that be oh that would be amazing all right ring somebody sponsor this dream now spor please we need to go on a trip my 12th Ghost of Christmas Story my final one all right so this one is actually titled a gruesome game so the Earl birdie which was a resident of the Lord scarne Castle was okay told to have once played cards against Satan oh really and lost interest oh no so like the Fiddler he did not win no no golden cards for him yeah so Earl birdie loses card like what is with Satan playing cards is he like a card shark or something I don't know I think he plays lots of games he'll play any game with you for your soul I'm pretty sure so apparently the faithful game is now said to be replayed once a year on December 31st right at the stroke of midnight so basically going from the 30 first to the 1 right at midnight this this game is replayed every year and they say Witnesses beware so the legend goes that in this Castle you can hear the sounds of like two people playing cards like chips um betting kind of things so like poker chips or correct you know whatever betting type chips they were using in the sound of the cards and the dealing corre it's a distinctive sound if you've ever been you know at any type of Gaming table but it says don't pay attention if you come across this at midnight on the 31st because Witnesses must beware it is thought that anybody who tries to watch the game will be transported to hell at the end of the match interesting so if you even watch you lose your soul correct correct that's the game you play for watching that's some shitty rules shitty rules devil shitty rules well I'd be that jackass that would try to somehow like change the result you'd want to cheat and help the guy win at cards break the cycle break the cycle that's right maybe Satan is just trying to keep cheaters out of it that's all so it seems like between December 4th and December 31st there's a lot of activity and again I I could see it and I could see the ghost story for Christmas time thing because when do you miss your family and your loved ones the most that have passed when miss your ancestors the most holidays yeah and if I was a ghosty when would I want to come I want to come see you at Chris like you know what I mean yeah and that's exactly when people's thoughts have power and emotions have power and and when those emotions get high you can summon someone without even realizing you know you you out of the blue start thinking about your loved one that passed away and then that night you have a dream where they talk to you you called them to you you know that kind of thing so it's powerful and and a lot of people are in the same kind of mindset that's why even the air feels interesting around Christmas Eve and Christmas because everyone or at least a vast majority of people are all putting their energy and intention towards the same kind of thing and even though all of these little snippet stories you were were relatively old stories what makes them present is it's like these these these ghost imprints appear every year month of December during the holiday season either appearing to be seen or reliving the tragedy interesting that it's just so cyclical and it keeps happening every year on these dates you know keeps it present and current it keeps it present and and and because I was struggling so hard with Christmas present that's that's what my my tie-in was is that like that one was from the 1800s but but the fact that these ghosts reappear every year cyclically is what's keeping it relevant and present how intriguing that that things just kind of keep happening even like in a couple cases where there's no longer a house there to kind of anchor that haunting but it still happens in the same place right wow right so I have learned something throughout all of this what's that sh I feel that maybe I used to misinterpret the veil opening and closing and time frame I almost feel like the veil is just as thin now as it is at sa it's pretty close and and I think that it's not quite as thin but damn it's still I agree with you maybe if it's not as thin it could be that both sides the ghosty side and the living side put a [ __ ] ton of energy into it all at the same time during the month of December yeah I think you're you're right I think it is still very thin you know maybe not as paper thin as it might be on exactly s or right around s but it's still very very thin and and like you said the the collective energy of people thinking about their loved ones is is bound to draw them here everyday is a school day man so fun interesting I love the ghost stories I want to continue with the tradition of Ule and Solstice and Christmas ghostly Tales because how interesting and telling tales on a on a cold and gray and snowy day how fun is that I mean I love it I want a fireplace I want a fireplace to tell go stories around yeah it would be nice to have a reason to use a fireplace I'll have to take a vacation in the
