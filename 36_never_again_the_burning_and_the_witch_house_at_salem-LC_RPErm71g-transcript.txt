never again the burning by Gail perago Hami copyright 1985 read by Leila with permission of the author it is always the morning of my execution I know they will come for me today last night the Jailer pulling up his trousers sneered perhaps you'll fancy the pole they give you in the morning more than mine stubborn [ __ ] I think he liked it better when I had strength and spirit enough to fight him he is too stupid to lie just to torment me I will welcome death though the dying scares me I was a Healer how long ago oh Gods I cannot think straight anymore and I know that their gross insults to my body Will Never Mend and the pain is constant and they have sworn me that I will go to the fire conscious and aware my goddess I am sick to my very soul with shame at the last I gave them screaming what they wanted mouthed any obscenity they asked I told them what they told me to say my sanity remains only because your names go with me to the py and the grave Beyond and only there oh beloved if I could only see you one last time that your clean spirit's fire could rid me of this filth and fear the crowd gathers now I hear them outside laughing festive God's Grant I will be entertaining enough I wonder if these Pious Souls who in the past have asked my help will mourn me well I shall be glad to quit this stinking cell the rats grow Bolder as I decline oh mother give me strength I hear the guards outside what I taunt three of you all for one small half star wench indeed terrible I must be they have the grace to look ashamed the youngest one grown pale and horrified at the sight of me I delivered his wife of a fine strong son not many weeks ago but now I dare not ask how the child fares nay you must carry me or drag me my fine Bravos these ruined feet will never bear my weight again I fear I danced too long with your good priest in his fine Spanish boots they haul me to my feet in the pain I will not scream again for their Amusement I must go naked then to my death before these fools I would not have them see me so who dance naked for the goddess graceful and free on winged feet without a trace of Shame their avaricious eyes defile me as their Twisted priest defiled my body's Temple there are many strangers here in the square churchmen and villagers from all the country round I am to be a marvelous farf lesson I see they bind me to their stake too tight more Agony the splintering pole claws my raw back my shoulders wrenched and cramping the rough rope burning my wrists My legs will not support me and I sag in my bombs and I fill with Terror as a pitcher with Muddy Water a priest approaches oh goddess must I suffer them even now the crowd protests the cup in his hands he exhorts them gently his sect Bears Mercy towards all malice towards none and might not even such as I be saved at The Bitter End I don't know this one I fight to raise my head to spit in his face for one last shred of defiance mother of all know oh not you here how have you come beloved to trade your green robes for their black your antler crown for their cross surely I dream I dream but now I smell your clean scent and your dear presence cloaks me in peace rage fires in your eyes but your pure love sustains me strengthens me and warms me you brush the hair back from my face the cup you hold gently to my bruised lips lips I gave you at our hand fasting softly you whisper drink deep of Salvation my dear love and your voice harsh with unshed tears rips at my soul and my own tears begin and fully do I drink of your deep eyes and the chalice and the taste of the flying herbs burst upon my tongue badana aconite dark sweet dreams they are coming now with a fire almost you linger too long haunted eyes on mine but as sleep steals over me I see you melt safely into the throng I drifting now I hear my mother singing far away strange she has been dead these many years the pain is gone I am a little girl again I am safe my mother is calling me and I run gladly into her arms but in the room I have left behind someone has been careless with the supper mother they must turn the spit faster where I can smell the roasting meat burning and the dinner guests are shouting I wake in a cold sweat and cannot drink from the glass you bring me oh sisters here our daughters must not dream these dreams we must defend ourselves stand with our brothers and make the arsonists let us be oh sister here never again never again the burning it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi it's 4:20 a.m. the stoned which is our normally it's time for these two best friends living on opposite coast of the country to terrify each other with spooky stories from the east and west coast but guess what guess what guess what guess what for episode 36 we are both on the east coast in Salem Massachusetts hell yeah and tonight we're going to talk about a trio of delightfully Wicked witchery the Salem Witch Trials a haunting poem by one of my favorite witches on the planet super fave and the witch house in Salem Massachusetts that was never the home of a witch I'm your co-host Lea you know I'm I'm high again well I am also shell I am in the east coast I am in Salem but boy what a high night tonight how you feeling I'm Feeling Fabulous I absolutely love being together with you we have not been together in a few years and hanging out with you is just like old times and it we had a blast in Salem oh my God first of all let's let's get into the the nitty-gritty before we start talking about Sal you and I smoke a lot of weed when we're together holy [ __ ] oh yeah East Coast weed I found going through New York I found some of the cheapest weed I have had in forever I am so jealous when you told me what you were paying there like it makes me want to drive back home to New York just for freaking weed Jesus yeah I mean I know that I have smoked multiple different kinds this week but right now I'm smoking on something called jealousy that I got from fault and I'm jealous it is like a 23% THC roughly so again middle of the road but excellent to get done you you know what baffles me what's that I I've spent 40 some years we won't get into the exact number I spent 40 some years living in the great Empire State I've only been in Massachusetts two years you know love them both but very tax greedy places very much you're not going to get any more tax greedy than our beautiful home state of New York New York but we were talking about it the other night we figured it out it's literally half price so how is greedy New York getting half price I don't get it there's no taxes yet what we're going to say we're going slightly gray Market here it's not illegal medical is fully legal and you can buy it in the stores recreational is fully legal and you technically can't buy it anywhere there are ways around it so right now I would say that maybe not all the taxes that are supposed to be added on are being added on so I got this jealousy for 115 an ounce let me give you a little bit of a tax wakeup call here let's say so in Massachusetts we'll say $60 because you know prices are starting to go down love it but the average you're G about 60 bucks an eth I cannot that's a lot no you're going to die add $113 in tax so that $608 is going to cost you 73 didn't we used to pay 75 for like an ounce of brick weed would get you high as [ __ ] that's why I like this Happy Valley and Gloucester love Happy Valley we talk about them all the time sponsor me Happy Valley so you know Happy Valley one of the reasons I like them have great stuff they always are rotating their stock so you're not having the same [ __ ] week after week unless you want to but Happy Valley includes the tax and their price so when they're telling you $60 that's after tax but if I go to another store locally that $60 is pre-tax so one store your $60 e is costing you $73 and at another store your $608 is C costing you $60 this tax [ __ ] a freaking racket I guess it really depends on if they want to eat that $13 or not I just think people are up pricing this [ __ ] so much that they're willing to not make as much money and get the business as opposed to the other stores who are like we're going to screw these people and tax them yeah that that's the biggest problem I think is that everybody's going to do it differently and this this whole system is rigged from top to bottom and unfortunately there's a lot of corruption there and there's a lot of greed there every state that goes legal is going to have a period where there's a lot of greed people want to make as much money as possible before the market gets glutted with a lot of pot and then you end up with like an Oregon situation where how much an ounce was uh Lisa an paying in Northern California something ridiculous that made me cry $45 an ounce some of these places can't give it away fast enough that'll happen it's a weed folks it grows quickly but you know what I'm greedy too I want a bunch of weed for a decent price is that too much to ask it shouldn't be it shouldn't be I want a bunch of good weed I buy by the ounce one thing I did find in New York that was difficult is a lot of places are only selling in eights um hello I I don't have training wheels thank you I need an ounce know what they do here in Massachusetts you can get an ounce but everything is packaged in E they can't package it any bigger than an eighth so you'll get an ounce in eight separate containers so you'll get 88 you're allowed to carry prob at least an ounce right yeah yeah but places don't sell it in an ounce I mean what is that no no no you and I have had this this discussion since podcast episode one okay and now you've seen it with your own eyes you see the packaging now that you know that you can't buy it in one ounce packaging you have to buy 88s in those big old fatty glass jars I love your Ziploc bags you get but we don't sell those here in Massachusetts and you should New York again it's probably because they're not fully legal yet but they sell this is a really nice sealable Ziploc I mean it's ni nicer than your sandwich baggy you know it's the opaque really nice bag and that's all it is that they put your ounce or whatever your order in that and that's all it should be oh my God I just had the best stoner idea ever you and I should run for president vice president in 2024 and then we'll just make weed legal and we'll make it illegal for the weed stores to use the big thick glass jars yes they need to have we'll make it so that all the the companies have to recycle their own packaging and they have to use as little packaging as possible and they have to make it out of hemp whenever possible sh and Lea 2024 there you go win in the world we got this vote for us anyway so what are you smoking on oh my God you are GNA be you're going to be surprised our listeners are going to be surprised I have done something that is so not like me oh what did you do so I'm at Happy Valley okay that's like you that that part's like me I go to Happy Valley and I've really been liking this endgame stuff that they have also like you ended up getting an ounce of it shocker so surprised so then I see this stuff and it's like now you're going to be sad it was like three grams for 30 bucks but ow but they were each packaged in one gram packaging in a variety really no it was only these 12 what's the point of buying a gram is that even a bowl pack basically like one and a half the way I pack it's called Grandpa's cookies but they had 12 of them so there's Grandpa cookies one Grandpa cookies 2 Grandpa cookies 3 whatever so then they have this is that somebody who forgot what all their seeds were like what cultivars they had so they just called them all Grandpa cookies 1 through 12 for real so the deal is is you can get three different ones for 30 bucks now they have these big long paragraphs she's like don't go by the THC because that's not the way you should look at this thank you oh I like your bud tender already so then I'm like well then how do you know and she's like read about each of them well it's a paragraph that's like nine sentences long like I ain't got time to read 12 of those Jesus Lord I ain't at the library I'm at the weed store so I'm like why don't you give me Grandpa cookies number one two and seven [ __ ] it we'll give it a go so I got this one here this [ __ ] so this one is Grandpa cookies number I can't even read it seven did you even read the paragraphs or did you just like randomly pick three numbers I randomly picked three numbers I that's my shell that's like an ADHD thing like I need sitting there paragraphs times 12 [ __ ] that [ __ ] so this one is is Grandpa cookies number seven maybe if you go on the Happy Valley website you can figure out what it means future Lila here with an update I did indeed go on the Happy Valley website glow. happppy valley.org and checked on the grandpa cookies turns out Happy Valley is doing what they call a pheno hunt basically when you breed cannabis seeds together your first breeding is going to produce kind of like cats or puppies you know if you you breed a poodle to a golden retriever your puppies are going to come out looking like some will look like full poodles some will look like full golden retrievers and then you'll have every single kind of mix in between that's potentially what you can get when you breed cannabis seeds together responsible breeders will then take those seeds and they'll take the ones that have the best qualities that they like and breed them back together until they get something that looks a lot more stable once you have a couple F1 Labradoodles lab poodle spread together the babies start to look a lot more uniform and the same thing happens in the Plant World so in this particular case it looks like they are breeding something called grandpa cookies which is Grandpa stash and Ethos cookies bred together so they're trying to find the most popular of the phenotypes it looks like the this cross produces 12 different distinct phenotypes or different looking and smoking plants again you have that pure bread poodle and pure bread lab now you have 1 through 12 of all their different types of babies so they're asking their customers to try these different type of Grandpa cookies and let them know which ones they like the best and then those are the cultivars they will continue to breed so future Lea out but this one is only 23% that's [ __ ] high yeah yeah we've talked about it before that it's not just the THC percentage there's a lot of yeah but I know we talk about it before but I never listened to you you don't you always reach for the highest THC first I do THC is not always an indicator of How High you're going to get we think it is because that's what we've been taught to believe it is you know I wasn't believing you before and I was like yeah yeah ler THC yeah yeah yeah and I'd still go to the store and I'd still get the highest THC well you know what I was wrong I'll admit it you were right I'm high who who would have thought it yay I love that I love that for you I really do because there's so much more Beyond THC so many more chemicals and and so many more things in cannabis that's good for you it's going to make you feel good and get you high so I'm kind of liking my grandpa cookies number 10 who doesn't love I want to try something called grandpa cookies I really do even it makes me think of Willie Nelson or Chi Chin chong a God [ __ ] they're like grandpas now what the hell they're like great grandpas man where the hell you been hiding under a rock apparently smoking too much weed smoking way too much weed all right so now that I got my jealousy going on over here and we're hanging out let's talk this poem never again the burning that I read at the beginning of the episode by Gail perago Hami when did you first learn of this poem yikes holy crap you're taking it back a minute this poem was written let's see I want to say this was written in 1984 or 1986 oh missed it 1985 It Was Written course and I read it first I think I understand you heard it first right I heard it this was actually in the early 90s G had made a cassette tape anybody remember cassette tapes by the way so Gail had made a cassette tape she read this poem it had kind of a I don't want to call it like a musical background but there was like a sound background her that read it or someone else she read it this I would say this would have been been like 19 late 1993 early 94 it shook me to my core hearing that for the first time I don't know like it changed me or it triggered something but like it shook me at the time she was uh in the local Pagan Community we were a part of she would sell these cassette tapes for a couple extra bucks so I'd ended up buying one and I actually would play this when I would do personal private rituals alone every single time very very moving very very powerful very very touch your soul I um I did not have the pleasure of buying a tape originally from Gail uh when I first learned of this poem I was living in upstate way way Upstate New York in skincity and I was working at a thrift store I found this stack of magazines called Green Egg which oh my God remember Green Egg yeah Pagan Magazine from back in the day and this was a good 30 35 I don't know it was a lot of of magazines and I knew I had to have them they were marked at like $3 each I had been taught or heard or read somewhere that you never haggle over magical items that is actually a good point good point to me at the time being I didn't know anyone else who was a witch I I knew no other pagans in real life I really this was before we met yeah way before we met and so I got done with my shift I went home I got a ton of money out of my savings at the time there was no way I could have afforded like or the 70 bucks or whatever for these magazines but I had to have them so I scraped together all my money looked in my couch cushions head back to work and there was someone else behind the counter than when I had left I'm like hey I got these magazines I'm going to pick them up and she's like she's looking through it she's like oh these are magazines why are these all marked $3 I'll give you the whole stack for $3 no [ __ ] no [ __ ] so it went from being like 25 plus magazine so it would have been over $75 I got it for three bucks never had to haggle it was perfect brought them home and the very first one I opened had the poem published never again the burning by that was in Green Egg I didn't even know that it was published in Green Egg I cried I balled I cried like a baby full body chills I I swear I was seeing visions and crying at the same time it just hit me that hard so funny story did I tell this on this show before tell it again so I'm living in SCCY get these magazines get struck to my very Soul by this poem and I move to Southern Tier of New York and I meet you and other people in the community there the Pagan Community oh my God wait you didn't know that Gail was was a part of our community I didn't know oh that's so great that's so great I meet these new witches I'm having the time of my life I show them this poem and they're like oh yeah we know it and what what do you mean you know it they're like oh yeah we know Gail I about [ __ ] my pants I dropped I was like what I remember you were like I remember that you were like a fan girl so fan Girling girl big time and I remember a point where we were like oh yeah she's gonna be it whatever the next ritual that whatever and you were like really oh my God like she's gonna be there like Gail herself and we're like yeah you're all like yeah it's Gail see from my side of it I had met Gail and had been in community and done ritual with Gail prior to hearing the poem whereas you were like a struck by the poem and I couldn't believe it better yet I'm at our local Barnes & Noble getting a book and the woman who's checking everyone out is Decked Out head to toe in Pentacles and gems and crystals and Pagan to the core which if you know Upstate New York that is so not acceptable in our uptight red Republican part of the state like yeah at the time being out as a pagan was not a thing and this woman was out and very proud and her name tag said Gail and you almost [ __ ] yourself didn't you I did but I'm like what are the odds that I would meet the actual Gail randomly here at a Barnes & Noble and then I then I heard somebody say hey Gail Otter's on the phone for you well in Green Egg otter was one of the names of the people who was a regular contributor or an editor I don't remember so I was I lost it I was like this has got to be Gail so I get it's my turn and I'm like um are you Gail Gail Parago Hami and she said yes I could not believe the coincidences that had brought me to this place from reading this poem and fangirling over this person to moving randomly to the Southern Tier and being told she's in the Pagan Community to then randomly running into her at a freaking Barnes & Noble I the coincidences were just amazing you know what I find kind of interesting about your story you know who brought me into the community because at the time as you are aware you kind of had to be quote unquote sponsored correct I was actually sponsored into the community by otter wow wow synchronicity synchronicity and to then be able to do ritual with Gail who despite the pedestal that I still put her on she's human she's a witch she's a pagan she's so magical and I adore her but I didn't have to be so a struck but I still kind of am every time I see her I think and I love doing ritual with her and what an amazing gift to be a able to do ritual with someone who has moved you so much and and not just you or I I mean she's moved between um the publication the tapes um I know she's done it at festivals out publicly she's literally moved thousands of people with that and I almost want to reach out to her and be like hey re-release that it's been what 30 pushing 40 years it because it resonates just as much now as it did in 1985 really does and I am so honored that when we reached out to her and she gave me permission to read this I'm I'm just thrilled and I cannot believe that she she was willing to of course I can she's amazing I believe that she did but I'm very honored it was more of a we didn't feel worthy right we're not worthy we were totally not worthy worthy yeah it's our Wayne's World moment yeah you know she's a very humble and and kind and generous person but it was really more about we just didn't feel worthy because yeah her and her work and her magic are just so overwhelmingly powerful they are and they're just you know power to the Witch and to the woman and to the Wise One in all of us because what an amazing time of year to to read this and to reconnect with this poem I believe you and I both have kind of lost this poem for a little while I lost all of those copies of green egg in a flood years ago and I believe you have this in a cassette somewhere in a in a storage unit prob I do I I have the cassette version in a storage unit I will admit I no longer have a cassette player but I still have the cassette on recording of this and you know again I I what I'd give for her to re-release that because it's it is very very moving you did a great job and and our listeners know you did a great job but there's nothing like Gail there isn't there isn't and it can't be replicated no she's fantastic and you are awesome and you are fantastic you did a great job but Gail does it so well so it's you can tell it's a dream that she had you know and and I even though reading it then and now we know that no witches here in the United States were burned but that's not to say that in other part you know in other parts of the world they were and this poem doesn't necessarily say it's about Salem Witch Trials or a Salem burning it's just that General it's a metaphor I was going to say burning can also be a metaphor I mean [ __ ] what's going on right now as I was reading that poem for this recording I kept connecting it to the Supreme Court and to all the things that are going on right now and all the persecutions that that women are having right now that women trans women all of us it's it's not only scary to be honest with you it's disgusting agreed agreed and and bringing it back to Salem and being in Salem where Witch Trials did happen and we walked some of those same places where these women who were and men who were accused walked this poem is it kind of especially if you ever if you ever have have listen to it with your eyes closed you feel like you're put in that in that situation of the poem so that's why when we wanted to kick off our our October and Salem series with this poem I wanted to take you first to the witch house not that there were witches that lived there it was actually actually the home of Jonathan Corwin who was actually one of the judges for the Salem Witch Trials when you think of that poem and then you are legit standing in one of the judges houses so powerful they did those things real they did and and you know that witch house is is pretty much more or less kind of how it was in the 1600s it's one of in a different spot right it's one of the only structures in salm original to 1692 era by the way and it was 35t ahead of where it is now and it was moved back for ESS Street to be made that [ __ ] energy still kind of resonates in that house yeah and and now as we've discussed it it's definitely more the history of it you know you know what happened there rather than rather than any hauntings or you know any any residual energies although you might feel some you know that's kind of washed away I guess with all the the traffic that's gone through it it's very much a tourist attraction but the the history and the weight of it is still very very present okay a very brief history of the Salem Witch Trials basically there was a lot of crap going on in the Salem area in the late 1600s anyways but Reverend Samuel Paris became Salem Village's first ordained minister in 1689 he was not very popular his daughter who was nine Elizabeth and his niece Abigail Williams who was 11 started having like these fits and a local doctor blamed Witchcraft and the supernatural then another girl an putam also 11 started having like the same kind of fits and on February 29th after a lot of pressure from local towns people and with pressure from the magistrates Jonathan Corwin and John hathorne the girls blamed three women for causing all these problems they said that Tiba who was the paris's slave Sarah good who was a beggar and Sarah Osborne just an old poor woman in the village were all witches and had Bewitched them Osborne said she was innocent so did Sarah good but Tia confessed and said that there were even more witches in town all three women were put in jail and the accusations flew like wildfire around the town for the next few months even to the point where a 4-year-old Sarah Good's daughter Dorcas or Dorothy was also accused of being a witch no one was safe there were dozens of people that were brought in for questioning on May 27th of 1692 the governor at the time William fips ordered the establishment of a special Court called oer which means to hear and terminer to decide and this court came up with three foolproof ways to determine if someone is a witch one by confession two testimony of two I witnesses to acts of Witchcraft so basically you just needed two people to say they saw you do something witchy or three something called spectral evidence which allowed people to use dreams and Visions as hard evidence a person could say they dreamed you doing something witchy and that would be enough to accuse you of witchcraft the very first case brought to this special Court was Bridget Bishop she was found guilty and June 10th she was the first person hanged on what was later called Gallows Hill a place now known to actually be Proctor's ledge a gentleman named Cotton Mather wrote a letter begging this court to not continue using spectral evidence the court of course ignored this request and five people were sentenced to hang in July five more in August and eight on September 22nd 1692 it was only later that Governor fips partly due to Ma's plea and really because his own wife was being questioned for witchcraft prohibited further arrests stopped the use of spectral evidence and released quite a few of the accused witches and ended the court of oer and terminer on October 29th can I just say what the hell that just dawned on me so they're going to start hanging people and persecuting people on mbin well that was the last one actually that was the last group of people but late September seven women and one man were hung as witches on a single day mabin on mabin that's just awful but between June and September of that year they killed a total of 25 people 19 were executed as witches by hanging at Proctor's ledge 14 women and five men five others died in jail and one my man Giles Corey was crushed to death that's a lot Bridget Bishop was the first one to be killed on June 10th of 1692 so that's a long time for people to be freaking terrified I can't even as we were walking through the village we were talking about that because it's the same time period when this had happened you know we're we're here at the end of September and this is this is the height of the the fear how how scared must these people have been when they they first killed Bridget Bishop and that was so bad that judge Nathaniel saltan Saul quit he was one of the people that condemned her and after her death he decided this was not a good idea didn't think it was a good thing to do and he quit you got to remember some of these people were new to America and they were fleeing England and France and Spain and what have you to get away from persecution religious persecution this that and the other to come here to get accused or because there were you know we're talking about Salem but there were wit trials and which burnings and which hangings um all over Europe prior to Salem and these people were trying to start fresh and they come to America to be accused of Witchcraft and that's some [ __ ] that is some [ __ ] that is some [ __ ] and and we walked those paths at that time when it would have been at its most frightening when people are being accused left and right and as we spoke before it didn't end until the new governor Lord fips his wife was accused and so he decided oh yeah spectr evidence is [ __ ] and so he ended it but it could be so simple as I don't like your attitude so I'm going to start telling people that I think you're a witch because you do this and you do that and like nobody like nobody was safe it was like living in fear 247 if you were and Men weren't safe either remember your good your good friend gu Corey men were not safe I think when people think of the witch trials they think that this was a female only thing and that is not the case right and when you walk around those memorials you can see everybody's name and the date that they were hung or killed right but I I I just wanted to put it out there that generally people think witch trials they think witches witches or women not necessarily the case which by the way these folks weren't witches to begin with but right right none of them were witches most likely and Jonathan Corwin actually is the judge that replaced Nathaniel Salan sa when Nathaniel decided you know this isn't isn't such a great idea I'm out he was replaced by Jonathan Corwin this guy lived in this house with his family for more than 40 years so you know him and his family's energy has really resonated in this and like I said it's the only structure still standing that is directly tied to the Witch Trials of 1692 it is the house where several of his children children did die and his wife's children it's also the house where a lot of the accused were supposedly taken from his nephew's house who was the sheriff they were taken from the sheriff's house to his house to be questioned do you know that dick was questioning little kids like under 10 this questioning could involve stripping the person naked and checking them for so-called witches marks which could be anything like moles birth marks or scars they could be poked with like a long thin needle on various parts of their body to see if any were insensitive to pain they'd be sleep deprived and beaten forced to recite scripture perfectly and any mistake was proof that they were a witch and some were found innocent and many were found guilty interestingly a gentleman named George Burrows flawlessly recited the Lord's Prayer as he was standing on the platform waiting to be hung as a witch those present decided that okay he recited the Lord's Prayer perfectly doesn't mean we were wrong it's got to be a devil's trick he's still a witch and they hung him as planned with zero guilt I I want to go back to we we touched on it real quick in 1940 something the house was actually moved 35 feet back first of all move in a house you are stirring up some [ __ ] friends yeah as we've found before any type of Renovations can very often cause a what's might be a minor haunting to turn into a very large haunting or something that may have been dormant before to suddenly come back to life but you you and I had a had a funny conversation the other day I see a lot of you know I'm on a lot of these Salem Facebook pages you know local yolal type [ __ ] a lot of people get engaged to get married on the steps in front of the witch house or worse yet like the picture you showed me on the sidewalk by the road in front of the witch house which is roughly 35 ft from where it standing now where the original house was which is where all this horrible stuff happened why would you get engaged to be married at such a horrible place the beach is a half a mile away folks and there's much better historical places in Salem if you need that I understand being goth and witchy but people died here people were tortured here people RI people were questioned until they agreed to and said stuff that wasn't true including children they would say and do anything any of us would under that type of torture they did all sorts of horrific things to people in that very spot why would you get engaged there it baffles me but you know what I'm I'm gonna throw caution to the wind and say that people are attracted to Salem the witch city which capital of the world I'm not being discriminative but I feel that sometimes people don't know enough about the history of certain things maybe these people just don't know the house was moved maybe they don't take in the horrific things that happened there that is not a place I would want to tie with my future love and happiness agreed there are several sides to Salem there's the side that I reveled in as a teenager going there and meeting real life witches other than myself for the very first time I went there and the magic of the city and all the witches and the paganism and it was open and it was everywhere and it was vibrant and you could obviously buy it for $9.99 right but there was real magic to be had there too and real connections it was a very magical thing but at the same time I was still cognizant that there was a history of people non- witches who had been brutally persecuted and tortured and murdered here and and you there's two sides of it and I think you can't you shouldn't really forget either one right right you know I I understand the touristy part of it I get it I was that tourist here in Salem at one time totally get it but go get engaged at the House of Seven Gables get engaged on the waterfront I mean there's a lot of beautiful places go two houses down to the ropes mansion from Hocus Pocus for God's sakes oh my God perfect spot I loved getting our pictures taken there how fun was that to go to the Hocus Pocus house in the garden out back they were so beautiful if you're going to get engaged in Salem the gens at the Rope Mansion are literally two houses down from the witch house and no bad ju it's the Hocus Pocus Mansion it's gorgeous the gardens are gorgeous there's a little Free Library bring a book to trade and there's all sorts of fun things there how fun why in front why witchy wise I feel like it's a bad Omen I do too yeah witchy wise I feel like it's definitely not not at auspicious start to a relationship I would not think you know this I I will say this for being from the 1600s I think this house was built in around 1640 this house is gorgeous I would live in it tomorrow it's got that lead glass on it I I remember the tour guide telling you something about why the house is black but it's that black house tell me why it's black again I don't remember there's quite a few throughout the city if you see any of the houses that are like this dark coal black and we will have a link to some pictures they look like they look like they're the wood but black yes it's a special kind of paint that helps preserve the wood and protect it against the elements and the Sun and all of that and they'll tell you about it if you take any of the tours which I highly recommend take any of them that you can it does help the preservation society and hell it helps the tour guides tip them well we're going to switch over into our onlocation not sound room Shell's backyard so we'll go more in depth together as we talk uh about the witch house guys this is good stuff you just need to hold on to your seat and grab a pipe because you're about to hear some good [ __ ] and listen closely and see if you can hear any crickets EVPs or dudes laughing in the background or bong hits oh there's lots of those first of all let me take a hit off this pipe before we get into the witch house so what do we have packed in your Silicone pipe shell is this your weed or my weed because we're together I know right so this is my weed this is endgame this came from Happy Valley oh I smell that that smells so good remember like I've talked about this so many times with that fruity flavor but you have had an interesting description of game oh man that's delicious you call it what what you call it it tastes like the old days dad weed it tastes like my dad weed whenever we would light this up when we were on our way to Salem today and we would light this up my first impression was that smells like my dad's house when he'd been hanging out with his friends when I was it very much smells like the wheat I used to get but it's still got that like Fruity taste it does it has today's density and you said you had to grind it up and I see the I see the pouch that you've got it in you have it all ground but do you see now why I was saying you can't really stuff and shove this because you can't it doesn't really smoke you waste it cuz it just doesn't burn sh the first thing you did when you showed me the bag you it looked like a nug I didn't realize you had grounded up because you showed me a compacted back into like nug shape it's so resiny and so crystally and condensed back into a nug it's beautiful and it has that green light slightly gasoline taste with a real sweetness to it it's it's beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful it's like a summer weed I would don't remember I don't even remember what the THC is on this one and it's like it's so good you don't even give a [ __ ] oh I don't care I'm high you're high I can see you're high see high because we're together so let's tell them what we well let's talk about what we did today we went to the witch house we went to the witch house this house is actually called the Jonathan Corwin house Jonathan Corwin was a judge during the witch trials and actually the witch house um the Jonathan Corwin house is the only building in current Salem that has direct ties to the Salem witch chars of 1692 but no witch ever actually lived there no no no it's called the witch house but a [ __ ] judge lived there yeah no he was a judge um he was a jerk holy crap and you saw some of the stuff in the house like not a kind man so before we kind of get into oh I do want to mention backrack backtrack I do want to mention the house was moved 35t right where the house is sitting now is not actually where judge Corwin interviewed every single person who but can you see how the way Salem is kind of put together that if they didn't move it back 35 ft it would be like Street curb front door right absolutely they had to move it back and this was in the 1940s and what happened was the town was going to put a roadway through there and they were just going to tear down this house and some people got together and raised about $46,000 I believe in the 1940s that's a lot of money in the 1940s to move the whole house back 35 ft in order to preserve it and that actually was one of the things that kicked off the preservation Society in Salem well I was kind of laughing because I had told you earlier today you know we had gone there and we're going to talk in a few minutes about the Vibes we got there and and such the guy was not nice he was a judge he persecuted innocent people that house held a lot of negativity and people will go and stand on the front walk and bow down on one knee and ask their sweet love to be theirs forever and ever in holy matrimony and when you think about it can considering they move the house back 35 ft where people are kneeling down asking their sweet love to marry them is like right where this guy must have sat at his freaking Hearth deciding who was going to live and die that day exactly and they decided this [ __ ] on something called ephemeral evidence spectral evidence and what that was was a dream someone could walk in and say I had a dream about my neighbor's wife and she did all sorts of things that only a demon would do to me I think you need to take her in and they would that would be evidence and that's [ __ ] up so I do find it kind of humorous that for as much negativity came from the occupant of that house um the owner of that house and just such the negative connotation that people will Rush right there to get engaged it's just we I mean tourists come on but it was built in the early in the 1620s so it's over 400 years old that and you know when we went in it it kind of has that feel like it does the low ceilings the very wide PL you're short and you were almost you you could reach up to that ceiling I could I am very tiny so I did not once have to duck my head not on any of the Dormer roofs not on any of the doorways that have settled over the years because I am a very very short person however you and your love and my husband are all very tall Amazon people and and had a dock yeah yeah but so yeah these were older houses and they were built to stay warm and they were built very short and and you can feel it when you walk in Jonathan Corwin was a judge who worked for the court of oyer and terminer in Salem Massachusetts at the time of the witch trials which took place between what June and September I think it was9 it was earlier in the spring of 1692 and then it kind of ended when the was it the mayor or the governor of the Town his wife it was the governor and you know it's kind of funny it's like oh you know you can [ __ ] with everybody else's wife but when you get to the governor's wife then hey hold on wait let's stop this right so what happened was that they accused the governor's wife was it lady fips it was lady fips so when his wife was accused then suddenly he steps in and says oh no no no no no you can't can't use the spectral evidence you need to use real actual physical evidence and so that kind of completely overturned what this court had been using and what Jonathan Corwin had been using so he brings all of these accused that go from the sheriff's house where there was possibly torture there right to his house where he interrogates them further to determine if the spectral evidence is going to stick and then they go from there possibly to being hung correct so this house has bad energy and you know I just like like I want to jump into how did you feel what energy wise the minute you walked in that door how did you feel suffocated oppressed is a good word as well yeah yeah I was thinking oppressed I I didn't expect to feel a lot because a big vibe that I got as I walk around the city is that it's beautiful the architecture the history I love it I love the witch Vibe I it's worn out but it is worn out it is touristy and I love it for what it is for the I do love the history of it even as sad and as as horrible as it is there's Beauty and there's interesting things and there's lessons to be learned there you know oh absolutely absolutely and so I didn't really fully expect to I I know people talk about hearing children I mean there were several of his children and his wife's children that died in that house there was a four-year-old child that he interrogated in that [ __ ] house for being a witch how is a four-year-old a witch right somebody dreamt about it oh my God [ __ ] people but I know people hear children there I know they see orbs I know they hear him but I wasn't really expecting to see much of that however when I walked into that room in front of that Hearth just like you said I could feel that dread creep up my legs and it it was that sense of there's nowhere to go I can't do there's nothing I can do and I kind of I had more of a sense and in like I explained to you shortly after we left more like from the kids point of view and it was don't make Daddy mad don't make Daddy mad like that kind of scared tiptoeing around don't want to create any conflict stay in the shadows you know that don't make Daddy mad like it was very much that but also in a sense I felt this very exhausted like this this exhausted annoyance with tourism why are you in my house once I got past that room like when I first came in it was oppressive it was it was suffocating I very much almost like a the beginnings of a panic attack where your chest feels tight and you can't breathe that panicky feeling once I got past that first room I didn't get a lot of anything it was just like this is an old house and it was tired does it it feels like the energy is worn out of it yeah and I wouldn't be surprised I mean the moving of it probably stirred things up and that's probably where a lot of the sightings and things came from but you know how many thousands of tourists go through it every October now I didn't see anything nor did I expect to and that's partially because you cannot go into the house at night right it is a daytime attraction and with all those people right I mean get me in that house 11:30 12:00 at night by myself and then let's talk I mean we were there at what like 10:30 in the morning you know and I think they closed at 4:30 in the afternoon so when are people seeing these orbs I guess is my question I'm not saying they're not I'm not negating anybody's experience but when you're there in the dead of daylight with 50 other people going in and out around you I I just I have to look into it I know that from the research that I did it appeared that a lot of these accounts seem to be older so I'll have to look and see if there's any records of whether they had later times where people could go into them in the past and I have actually seen um online folks that'll go by in the evening hours and after dark because you know I mean it's it's a city you walk around and they will see apparitions looking at them out the windows yeah that I can understand or seeing an orb or on inside of the house house that is not a reflection from a streetl it is not a reflection from a car sitting at that intersection um there is a light from within the house that can be seen through like an upstairs window so that I could believe but there's just no access at night so what are you seeing you know what I'm saying yeah we'll have to look and see I I have to look before this episode airs I will future Lea will jump in here with an edit and say you know whether they used to have later nighttime ones future Lea here I'm not exactly sure about nighttime tours I know there's some that go on at night on the outside of these historic buildings but I can't find any evidence of nighttime tours allowed in the buildings and I can find no pictures taken inside the buildings at night so I don't know future Lea out but not to say that people wouldn't catch those photos during the day or the it could have been workers could have been very well could have been it also could be people like later in the year the sun sets earlier maybe they're getting a darker corner or something right I just I I do think that some of the nighttime pictures that I've seen could lead one to think that they definitely had seen an apparition through the window but my my feelings definitely we seem to have the same ones coming in but you definitely got more of the the children and right and I think you might have gotten more of of the coroin himself vibe yeah or they accused coming in but in the same respect I also feel that the energy there and the vibe there it's kind of worn out you know I agree it's kind of worn out like maybe that Vibe 200 or even a hundred years ago was a hell of a lot different than what that Vibe is today and I think that it has just been saturated with everybody's energy you know but go to it for sure go to it for the history oh my God so worth it so interesting yeah the definitely so much interesting things to see there just for the history of it I mean it's such an old building oh yeah no totally worth it I mean it's like nine bucks for adults I mean you're not going to get anything cooler for nine bucks right how often are you going to be able to walk through a 400y old building with that kind of History exactly and you know one thing I thought was interesting you look out the windows first of all it's like that lead glass that's kind of warpy to begin with you're looking out the same windows that someone was looking out 400 years ago and I even said to you I'm like the view we're seeing is completely different because we were looking down onto that main intersection that's right whereas Corwin and his family would have been looking out maybe on a field but it was just interesting to kind of look out that same window yeah I had the same I had the same impression you know being up there and looking out those windows now the house is in a style where there's very little ornamentation on the outside and the windows are very very small when you're inside particularly in the spot where we had that conversation it's almost like a little study or something at the top of the stairs right and we were looking out there's like three Windows there and we're looking out those windows and the sunlight is like pouring in and it almost seemed like such a pleasant place to have a little office and that [ __ ] probably sat there deciding to then you know what yeah then you know what was actually being decided at that desk yeah and looking out that window you're exactly right those windows are exactly in the same place even if it's not the exact glass someone just like us stood right there and looked out those same Windows 400 years ago that's cool that's wild worth nine bucks worth nine bucks very much so very much so and particularly again I wasn't expecting to get that strong of a psychic Vibe and I did get one and I was I was pleasantly surprised but I don't it you know I I think that sometimes when you have this Vision in your head of oh I'm going to Salem Massachusetts I'm G to go to the witch house you have an idea in your head of what kind of vibe and how strong of a Vibe you might get and it's not it it's it's different it's different than you're going to expect because yeah the history is there for sure it's not that you're not going to have any sort of feeling whatsoever but you're not going to have like some overwhelming experience some people do I remember coming here when I was a teenager and it was wonderful energy and the vibe is so cool no no no I'm talking more about paranormally at the witch house oh yeah oh yeah yeah totally totally two different things good point no I think paranormally at the witch house any expectation you have in your head you should throw out the window yes go with an O go with open Psychic Eye go with open heart go with an open mind and then that's what I tried to do because we know so much like literally we were waiting to cross the street and I'm blabbing about blah blah blah blah blah people so this is funny guys so Leila is going off we're at this crosswalk because you know we have to abide by crosswalk laws and ilila just starts ranting off this like Wikipedia [ __ ] off her head she's like her own walking Wikipedia I was getting like my own little ghost to her to you so these tourists not that we weren't being touristy but these tourists at the crosswalk turn around and are like ooh that's good information and like all like you're the greatest tour guide and we're like yeah we're just here crossing the hi we just do a podcast was funny cuz we actually followed those same people to the witch house we did we did and I continued to spout random facts as we're walking through the house we didn't need a guided tour we had Leila yeah we know this stuff but this this house is I don't want to say paranormally underwhelming but definitely any expectation you have throughout the window and go in there with an open mind and be appreciative with the fact that you're in almost 400y old house yes and for the and and you know kind of feel it out sus it out for the real Vibes that are there underneath all the touristy Vibes and tired Vibes you know kind of be open to what's going to be there because literally walking up the front where okay you're going to have to wait in line to get your Instagram photo right be polite we waited right when you walk up and you look at the house it looks like a witch house it does it looks like someone evil lived there and we are going to we we are going to post uh some photos of our our visit to the witch house um so definitely check out our Instagram perfect for the October Vibe you know so yeah the witch house 19 people hung accused judge Jonathan Corwin kind of a [ __ ] right super dick yeah thumbs down for judge Jonathan Corwin but definitely a thumbs up for if you come to Salem go to the witch house spend the nine bucks totally totally got to do it please do because the money is well worth it it's not a lot if you have to ration which ones you can go to pick which one you want to go to and the money goes to the preservation to continue it going which is also equally important that's exactly the point you know it goes to the preservation society and they're doing such good things downtown there's plaques on everything they're preserving the wood the tour guides are fantastic what was our tour guide's name Katie with a c you rock shell Katie with a C thank you shell was a Wonder ful tour guide at the House of the Seven Gables she had so many facts and just gave it all in a rapid fire yet easy to understand Pace yeah because there's a lot of information there there is and you know that's the thing with Salem is you know you take the witch trials aside and there's still a [ __ ] ton of history in this joint exactly so you know come here for all of it and just kind of soak it all in and definitely but the witch house has to be on your list it really does because even if you're just a history buff and aren't even into the whole WI thing you have to go to the witch house you do go to the go because they they have that's the house that had the poppet right yeah they had the puppet that was created the house is decorated with different period different period displays and a lot of them are from the time period of the witch trials it's a self-guided tour so they each have a little explanation beside them and one of the first things you'll see in the great room when you first walk in on the what you'll find when you first walk in is a puppet and Bridget Bishop this was her puppet apparently Bridget Bishop was the first victim to be executed part of the evidence presented against her was the claim that workmen found poppets buried within the walls of her home so what you're seeing is one of the puppets that they found encased in glass and they say that this particular doll or quote unquote puppet was found within the walls of a first period home in New England it seems to be something that was kind of a thing back then they say that that puppet in particular was found in a New England home so I don't know if this particular puppet was Bridget Bishops or just one like it from the period because she was known for that that was brought up at her trial and that was one of the evidence they used against her but I mean it looks creepy didn't it look creepy very creepy and the from I got not good like I was getting like 1600's Chucky doll like seriously there's definitely whoever made that puppet made it for a reason right and it wasn't a friendly one no and it's still the energy is still there so definitely check out the puppet you seriously seriously weird creepy Vibe check it out I would like to point out that at the witch house there is a portrait of Samuel Seawall he is actually cuz there was a few judges Corwin wasn't the only one but SE wall he was the only one of the nine judges known to have apologized after the witch trials and you know that's an awesome fact to point out somebody had the balls to be like man I [ __ ] up and the court was told at one point to quit the [ __ ] with the ephemeral evidence that that was not evidence that they shouldn't use spectral evidence and they continued to do so anyways these guys were drunk with [ __ ] power absolutely and you know unfortun for they had the power they they had the ability to do this [ __ ] and they got away with it oh yeah they were the wealthy Traders at the time they were the merchants and they gave themselves these positions basically the witch trials were a travesty and in America no one was burned they were hung and pressed correct there was not one witch burned in the United States of America at any time whether it be before 1776 or after all burnings were usually in France Spain and England in America they were hangings drownings impr pressings that's right thank you historian shell I love it thank you all for joining us on this first of our Salem kickoff
