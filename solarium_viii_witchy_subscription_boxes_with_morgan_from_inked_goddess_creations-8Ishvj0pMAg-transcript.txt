welcome to the solarium shell and Lea's herb filled sundrenched Sanctuary where they kick off their pointy toed shoes put up their boms and Holster their cursing fingers instead they reach for a bit of mold cider a pumpkin spice muffin and get together to craft Wicked spells and magical Mayhem it's witchcraft [Laughter] [Music] I'm Leila and today in the solarium we're checking out witchy subscription boxes are they worth it who might want one are they good for experienced witches or only beginners we tested three of the most popular witch boxes we could find actually I had heard about these I went on this weird internet binge like everyone else did during covid honestly that was the first time I had ever heard of subscription boxes and we're going to get into the history of them in a few minutes but they date back a little bit further than Co but something about being home all the time I came across these and I was like what are these I'm intrigued I'm interested is this something I should get and so yeah we decided let's buy some boxes since then they've actually blown up I see them all over online people are always doing unboxings and so to talk about our witch boxes we have it with us Morgan from in goddess Creations welcome Morgan hello thank you for having me I am really excited to talk about this now before we get started just a disclaimer none of these boxes were provided for us we paid out of pocket for all of these so that we could review them for our listeners and we invited Morgan on for her expert behind the scenes witchy knowledge we were on Morgan's show a few months back where we talked about some of the myths and misconceptions of Witchcraft and Witchery so we are thrilled to have you back Morgan this is really great yeah I'm so glad also an interesting fact is every time we were looking up you know you go to the old Google and every time you Google witch boxes you're one of the top one or two every time so you are you're the witch boox lady as far as I'm concerned yay thank you you might not think you're the witch boox lady but Google thinks you are oh good that means that that's money well spent on SEO for the website that's great now which boxes are a type of subscription box and subscription boxes started back in 2010 they seem like they've been around forever but they were really started by a company called Birchbox which is still one of the most recognizable subscription box services in 2010 they basically sent out boxes with trial sizes of their products for people to try out and they started these subscription boxes and they became so popular that I guess they're still worth like half a billion dollars a year in subscription box services so that's pretty good money I guess and these are pretty amazing I I have never really done any type of Subscription Service except for maybe those get like 12 CDs for a penny back in the 90s I still owe somebody a lot of money for that by the way I actually at the beginning of Co I got a little weird and I did one of the makeup ones and that actually because I had done a makeup subscription for a little while that's why I was less hesitant to do the witch boox because I know that there's going to be people out there that are like oh you know I don't know if I want to do this is you know is it worth the money am I going to get something and part of the reason I was just like screw it let's try these boxes is because I knew that the subscription thing was the real deal and there's value in it all right tangent real quick since you mentioned the makeup subscription I was going to mention that because when we were at Sacred Space you whipped out a Tarot deck in the cutest little tarot bag that I had ever seen and it turns out it's from a makeup subscription where they send you these adorable bags filled with makeup every month but they're perfect size for tarot decks was that Ipsy yes yes are they still a thing yes I have so many cute makeup bags from them you can they're the perfect for tarot decks they are they make wonderful tarot bags and I'm so jealous I almost got an Ipsy subscription just so I could get the cute damn bags I know they were still a thing that was like I had it years ago I got it right like at the beginning of Co and I'm like these bags they're for Tero decks yes I am I'm not a makeup girly I mean I like it but I'm not good at it I uh it's not my thing but I do love bags I like things to put things those bags are your thing yeah they really are so when shell and I decided to start doing this we'd heard a lot about subscription witchy stuff shell had done it during Co that's been a few years now and I've heard really positive things and I've heard really negative things some people said they're amazing some people said they're a waste of money there was a few names that popped up every single time we did any research on this ink goddess Creations always got positive marks which is very nice which casket and which's moon were some of the names that we heard a lot of so shell ordered one from the lovely Morgan and what month did you get shell I believe it was June I got what was the theme do you remember I have it because I have the card here sees the magical day that was a fun one that was our like everyday Magic Box okay a lot of these boxes have themes and I've noticed that you know each month they'll have like a different theme which is very cool the witch caset box that I got the theme was calming magic this was for July of 2024 for Witch's Moon I did something a little bit different in a second tell me if this is the same for for you Morgan but the which casket I could only order a subscription I could not order back monthly caskets unless I was already a subscriber for their monthly service so I just signed up for their monthly service it was very easy to cancel after one month they didn't make it difficult or anything but the witch's Moon I could go in and just order any past month that I wanted to or I could do a subscription how is it for uh ink goddess Morgan so we do we have a one-time purchase box so if you just want to try us out but with the current month's theme you can do that or you can start a subscription we have monthly three month and six month subscriptions if we have any boxes left over from a previous month then those will also be for sale on the site but that's never a guarantee like we sold out of August box so we don't have any of those available and I think we finally sold out of July's box but there might be like a random May box or something on the website if we have a few left over yeah you basically have available only what you have in stock still if any yes that seemed to be the same for which casket and witch's Moon only if they had any excess stock was then available as a one shot but which casket you could not get unless you were a subscriber which is Moon you could and it sounds like you can for you as well quick aside Morgan I have to I have to say I've seen a couple unboxings of August box from you and people love it it seems to be very popular box this month so does that always go out the same time every month yes we ship on the fifth of every month and we ship all of the boxes on the 5th so that's I think that was that was actually a really nice review that we got in recently was that you can almost set a clock to you know our box showing up on you know depending on if the post office is nice you know but we ship on the fifth every single month and I literally live half across the country if not a tad bit more and got mine in two days but I did want to add Leila and I had agreed before we did this that we were only going to get one box from each of these folks we weren't going to to set up a subscription and what I loved about your site was Lea had to go through the process of subscribing and then unsubscribing and whether it was easy or not it's still a freaking hassle what I really appreciated was the option to just you're not trying to tie me down here people it was a onetime try and then you know if you like it feel free but you don't have to if you're not obligated or maybe you just don't have the money every month and you're just going to skip a month and do I'll do it when I can kind of thing and you give people that option in a super easy way yeah thank you we also um don't charge differently for the one-time box versus a subscription I I've seen that I don't think that any of the people any of the boxes today I don't think they do that that but I have seen it in the past where they would be like okay if you want to do a one-time purchase box it's going to cost you $5 more or you can just start a a recurring subscription and save the money but I know what's going to happen people will start a subscription and cancel it after one month just to get the discount so I'm like that's dumb for the monthly stuff we just do it it's the same price whether you buy one box or whether you s sign up for a subscription so that brings up a very good point who buys these boxes why would you buy a box why might you want a subscription box for Shell back during lockdown there was a damn good reason she wanted a box every month she couldn't go shopping anywhere and so getting a monthly box of magic dropped right off at your door that's fantastic you know especially then but even now I I loved waiting for these I had so much fun and it was different waiting for the box that I didn't know what was going to be in it as opposed to the box that I knew exactly what would be in it it was kind of fun I kind of liked that part about it well I think there's also an element of self-control because is there is there really I I believe I had the option to get an idea of what was in the Box not what was in it exactly but an idea and I ignored it oh yeah because it's fun to I just wanted it to be a surprise yeah so that brings me to my biggest reason why I would want these is as a gift I would want to give this as a gift like a short-term subscription like a one or a three or you know hell if it's you shell maybe I'll give you a six-month or a year subscription because I love you you know that kind of thing or someone to give it to me hint hint these are fabulous gifts how fun and magical to do that so I think that's my number one reason why or who would want these in my opinion I think these are the perfect way for people to either get a start on things or like our whole theme with this whole Jazz here getting back on the broomstick yeah you know maybe you don't have the tools or the supplies for for ritual or spellwork or or what have you maybe your herbs haven't been used in so long they've gotten a little moldy right or or maybe you keep hearing about this Florida water stuff but you're like how the hell do you make that and what do you do you know this is a good way for folks that are trying to accumulate both knowledge because I'm not I don't know I didn't ask you this beforehand Lea but I got like a detailed card on like everything and like what it's used for and like yeah I got some detailed stuff here so not only are you getting things but you're learning things and that can be invaluable to someone who you know I have the benefit of living in in Salem in which city not everybody does every you know you live in a small town that doesn't have a metaphysical store or in a cult shop or witchy stuff maybe you've never heard of Florida water right right you know maybe you've never been exposed to Green flour talene but you know what I'm saying like yeah this is a way for people to gain more information and knowledge as well as accumulate tools and supplies that they might not otherwise have access to adding the element of fun adding the element of it's a theme so you know you're getting a box full of stuff with a specific theme you know what I'm saying yeah yeah and the actually the three boxes that that you all have between the two of you are they're great boxes I'm not going to lie like all three of them are and I I do lots of research you know so they all um are beautifully beautifully curated um so all of the the products every single month fit the theme and I think like one of the reasons we started it was a lot of what like shell just said it is a lot of people don't have access to uh a store um and buying your stuff trust me I will buy stuff off Amazon all day long but there's but I don't like buying witchy stuff off Amazon I don't either I don't either I'll buy an air mattress for camping but like I feel weird buying witchie stuff on so do I so that's why one of the main reasons we started it is to give people an affordable way to have uh to have supplies but also to think outside of the box like a lot of people may think okay intended but they might think like I would love to try pendulums but I don't really want to go out and buy a pendulum so if you're given one in a box one month then you're G to try it and that's one of the the things about it being a surprise too like we do sneak peeks we do three that's it and so you will know if you want to look you will you can see what three of the items are but the rest of the items are a complete surprise so it's enough for the people that are like I don't know if I want to spend the money but this sneak peek looked really cool so I'll try that but you know some people are like I want the surprise I don't want to know anything that's in it so they don't look or you know they're like okay I only saw three things but we know that there's a a lot more in there I could also see people picking and choosing different months based on theme like I'm interested in this theme but maybe not interested in this theme so I could see people wanting to kind of just like bounce different months based on what that theme is yes and that happens a lot and that's something that like we completely understand and then that's why we do the the one-time purchase because it is something we know that a lot of people don't have the money every month but then there are some themes that just don't resonate with people and we don't expect you know every single month to resonate or every we don't even expect every item in the Box to resonate with every single person you know we try to do a wide variety well you can't please everybody that's you know that's just the way it goes yeah no and the variety of the things in any any of the subscription boxes I think is another pull like you're going to get a little bit of everything in a good subscription box and the aspect of supporting small businesses is huge because the these are a lot of times run by Regular People Like You Morgan and kind of a very fun part of this is we were doing research on these boxes to see what were people ordering what were they liking what were they not liking and I loved seeing your name come up over and over and over again I'm like I Know Her Like I know I know more I know ink God his Creations that's kind of cool and so that was kind of fun to just see that and to see how this is a big popular box like all of these that we got here today they're run by Regular People they're run by witches they're run by pagans they're run by people who really love these things and so by supporting a box and getting yourself a gift or replenishing your supplies you're also usually helping out a small business but in the same respect because it's a small business in a in a in a a local a local witch type person you are getting things that are thoughtfully curated and not just Mass manufactured you know what I'm saying there's some thought and energy put into and that kind of leads me to what makes you pick things so let's say you're thinking a next month's box and I'm not telling you to tell me next month's box we're being hypothetical here yeah you're picking next month's box how do you start how do you pick the theme and then how do you start S what do you do you're just like let me just start random picking items like what's that process there's a there's a little bit that goes into it sometimes it's the Sabbath or the time of year you know so that we take that into consideration usually first so what's the energy like the second thing is what's going on in the world I have a pretty good pulse through social media on whether witches are in a good mood in a bad mood fed up with the world happy you know so a lot of that goes into it and then sometimes it's what I want if I want something for my own practice I'm like well if I'm going to go ahead and order this I might as well just order them for everyone around some of them are selfishly motivated yes now do you plan ahead of time you know like shell and I have a master list of a year and a half of episodes and I think we've stuck to it maybe three times they were great ideas and we'll get to them we will we have a list but we we tend to jump around so we we have a list but we don't always stick to it is that how it works for you in the boxes like how far ahead of time do you plan these out so every like November or December we actually PLL our customers on Facebook usually and we ask them what what kind of themes do you want to see and so we take that list usually in wacky though honestly 100% and it is fun too because I think no matter how many times there are certain subjects we will never touch okay I will never touch anything that has to do with cultural appropriation so like I will never touch Native American I will never touch hudo or Voodoo I will never do that so still have people ask and every every year I'm like okay no cultural appropriation like I'm not going to teach people something about a closed practice that I'm not a part of but we still have people every year that ask for like oh can you do a hoodoo box and I'm like I no I cannot do a hoodoo box but thank you right right so it we start out and then we we do we sit down in about December and we plan out the whole year uh we have never our box has been around for uh six years eight years now 2016 is when started it so that's eight years wow we've never stuck to the list we have never stuck to the list yes I feel validated our people now even in fact right now so right now we are currently we've already planned like October November we were working on December's box and we just sat there we always know like when we sit down to to plan a box if we just if no one says anything because we make it a whole like group effort here and and if we're like okay here's the here's the idea and we all just sit there and nobody says anything we're like okay the energy is not there for this one what do we need to do so we just switched December's box up we're hitting the point where some places we can't order the things that we want because of the time frame and trying to get it in during the busy season so yes switching at the last minute sucks but yet you still do it yes now here comes the fun part I have actually kept my little pause off of these boxes for the most part since I got them so what I would like to do really yeah yeah freaking opened mine the freaking five minutes when it came well don't get me wrong it wasn't easy but yeah I wanted it to be a surprise I was mad at myself because I realized that I had discarded the box and the recycle bin and I had like strewn the stuff all about my altar area this is why were friends we're so different like I kept mine in the boxes pristine perf hers is all over the room yes but luckily with in goddess Creations you provided a sweet little card that details everything that was in the box and its uses so I was able to recollect it for this so I have it all all right all right all right but I don't have the cute box which is actually super cute by the way thank you all right so let's go over them a little bit so people can know what to expect including that they each came in a cute little box actually a casket yeah it does look kind of like a little casket it's got a little lock on it and everything isn't that cute it's a little casket see mine had more like the triple moon on it like my arm yes I know I've seen the box I absolutely love the ink goddess Creations box it's beautiful thank you I just didn't have the forethought to keep it yours is the same style of box as the witches Moon box which I also liked yeah yeah the fold open yeah yeah which casket comes from the UK and that one retails for $39 and mine was I think 35 I believe the witch's Moon box retailed for 55 now the biggest question I know that other folks have had did you have problems with shipping because it was coming from the UK to America the only problem I had with shipping was user error that was your problem that was all me man I I've moved as a lot of you know from way Upstate New York to a mountain in the Wilds of PA I used my PayPal to pay for which casket who forgot to change your address forgot to change my address so I got this very scary email that said that they had left a notice and the box was there or something and of course it wasn't and I was very scared until I realized that they had just forwarded it to my new address so no no problems whatsoever it was only user air came great no problem from the UK by the way my came in two days that's really nice that's great shipping you know I paid attention to that because she she sent emails that specifically said it would go out on the 5th and I'm like I wonder how long it'll take to get here and I was like let's see let's see and I'm like that just like came by a carrier pigeon man now I think I had ordered at a weird time because the subscription boxes are mailed out on a specific date so pay attention to wherever you're buying it from an goddess goes out on the 5th I think it was the 15th for which casket or something like that so I had a long time to wait from the time that I put in the order to the time that I got my first box oh see I did my last minute so I did mine and then the mail date was like two or three days later but if you had ordered it say on the eighth or nth of theth I had to wait yeah right so just pay attention yeah yeah and which casket I was only able to do subscription and witch's Moon I picked it out specifically but I don't think there was a price difference depending on how you did it so and they did each come with a little card that tells what's in it and I liked that because there was a thing in each one that I wasn't sure what it was so it was nice to have the description of what it is yeah which witches Moon did you get I got the Bome box from witch's Moon because how ironic right because I wanted the I really really wanted the witch's broom and I would have to say this was my favorite of the two boxes everything in here is stunning it's beautiful it's beautifully crafted it's well thought out the little brooms you get a random little witch's broom this is an actual miniature witches broom it has an amethyst on it it's very well-crafted and they're all made specifically for Witch's Moon the other thing in here I know we're only supposed to say a couple things that we like show but I also got this box also came with a book it was made specifically for this box it's called the witch's broom and it's by Deborah Blake it's all broom magic and folklore which obviously I'm kind of into there's loose incense there's stick incense there's a beeswax candle there's so much in here granted this is the most expensive of the three boxes that we're talking about by quite a bit right so that is definitely something to think about you know there's different price points for all of these you know you might find some from your local metaphysical shop they might be doing a monthly box you can find some that are organized around sabbaths or different things like that but you have to kind of look and see what price point you want and and what you're looking for we we had talked about picking a couple of things so I want to talk about my my couple of faves from my box from from Morgan and Inked goddess my absolute favorite part of this box I'm not going to lie and maybe it's because I'm a weirdo nerd and correct me if I'm wrong do you do these these cards every box no not the daily energy deck no okay so I got this daily energy deck and I freaking love this thing it comes with an with instructions obviously on how to use them I I got cards for every zodiac season which honestly these have good information good info moon phases uh sabbaths days of the week seasons of the Year Bravo I love these cards these were flipping awesome and my second favorite thing I got cute little wooden box and this cute little wooden box has these cute little tiny spell Scrolls in it and you know at first I was like what the hell am I going to do with these tiny little Scrolls and then Leila's vision of sigils came to me that is awesome yes or a rune you know maybe if you're a rune person you could draw a rune on one or you could do a Sigil on one or just any symbol that resonates with you so I was like these are damn sigil Scrolls and what witch doesn't like something to put things in we all love things to put things in seriously my third favorite thing and this is this is a big thing right now and I never even heard of this until literally a couple of years ago everybody's into Florida water maybe you maybe you don't know what Florida water is or maybe you don't know how to make Florida water or maybe you don't have access to it you sent me 2 O of Florida water water in a spritzer bottle as well as on my card which my card of all the stuff in my box gives me a brief description on what I can use my Florida water for and I thought that was a pretty cool thing because this is definitely a hot thing and okay I know we said we were only going to pick three things but also this is kind of the same tied into it I also got a bar of Florida water soap as well so you have it was almost like you were given the option to Spritz it or do a cleansing bath or like part of a ritual bath sort of thing Bravo to those I loved those thank you I didn't know that we did not know when we were diving into researching I didn't know that you could get Florida water in different things like I've just always used Flor water yeah yeah yeah know when I saw the soap I was like who knew yeah I mean obviously you know Lila and I are only touching on a couple things but I got I can't tell if it's nine or 10 items but there's nine or 10 items in my box yeah that one was good that month that one was pretty filled but yeah we have customers that collect the cards so I've never wanted to change the format because that would that and and you know what and you know what I actually said to Lea um when I got my box I like obviously because this was part of the theme the the back of the deck just says you know daily energy deck but I got a card for the Florida water I got a card for a green flower taline necklace in a white adventuring Stone I love these cards these I said to Lea these are like tarot card cards like I could see people getting a box and like collecting them almost deck like those are yeah the that those are included in all the boxes most of the I will say most of the boxes we try to include The Eclectic witch cards to give you more information and yeah we like you can collect them put them into binders all that kind of fun stuff so yeah I think that this is definitely earned all of its positive reviews online thank you thank you so kind of like Morgan's box that you got shell in both the witches Moon box and witch casket they each came with a list or a booklet The Witch's Moon box was it looked very natural which I liked a lot and it came with three pages of what looked like oldfashioned like recycled paper and it listed all the items in the box and the significance of each one the witch casket one is fancier it's an actual little booklet all in like black and gray and white it's it's like a little magazine there's a little letter from Deb and Ella which is super cute and then they tell you about everything that came in it and now this was the July box and what I love about these boxes is that they very often have like an incense and a candle they'll have you know some type of tool for your altar like the the Bas home box from the witch's Moon that had an actual small Bas home in it a little witches broom that I could use as a tool on my altar along with a wax candle and it had incense and uh broom oil it had a little broom spell this one from the witch casket is calming and it has again same thing it has some incense it has different tools it has these cute little calming card deck where you can pull little affirmations they have a little piece of jewelry like shells came with jewelry this comes with a cute little pin which I really love and it has two things that I think are great a bag a little bat bag and inside this bag is a little tiny felt bat and all the pieces that you need to do a spell where you stuff this bat and put in little herbs and put in the stuff yeah and then sew it shut and the whole thing is a little spell for calming and now you've got your little bat friend and you've got your bag but it also comes with like Shell's came with that cute little wooden box with the Scrolls in it the witch casket also has a little item it has a this is a little metal cup and it has cute little symbols all on the outside of it but it's a very heavy solid steel cup and it comes with little papers that you can write things that you want to release so it's intended to burn things in Little Burn bowl a little burn Bowl yeah so you you put that on your altar and you can just write things that you want to release on these little pieces of paper and put it in there and just burn it and let them go so each of these boxes has different items that I could use you know on my altar in my spellwork these incenses and candles and oils can be used over and over again for lots of different things so these definitely could help build up you know if you're getting back into your practice or if you're just starting a practice this is a great way to get tools that you might not have thought of I do have a funny PSA for folks if you get these boxes what's that I had an incident when my box came oh no what'd you do it wasn't well I guess it was kind of me so when I first got it I ripped open the box like everybody does the minute the mailman brought it and I was like oh this is all cool but then I had something to do so I set the box here on my computer desk I hadn't like read the cards yet because whatever I had to go do something and I was going to come back to it in a while I have two lovely kitty cats oh no Morgan knows where this is going because she created my box I I also got a lovely bag of an herbal BL is that a little goddess and a moon on there it is that's the that's really pretty that's a pretty little bag but I want you to take no of well you can't see it maybe with my background there's holes in this bag I dare you to ask me why why are there holes in the bag shell because I didn't read the card when I opened it and I opened it and I set it on my desk and my C bag of herbs had catnip in it and then I shut the cats in the bedroom and I came in and there's herbs all over my desk and I'm like I should have read that damn card before I freaking left it in the cat's way that's classic the PSA I have for folks is if you do get an herbal blend read the ingredients before leaving it unattended in front of your animals yes that's a smart thing to do my cats love your herbal blend by the way we have had we've had so many customers send us pictures of their cats obsessed with our box just because I mean there's usually herbs or herbal something in it but I mean you know we put stuff together specifically had catnip in it yeah that one had catnip in it so I have to keep it up on a shelf because of the cat oh my goodness yeah and I was like oh I should have read those ingredients couple small little nitpicky things I really love how witch casket has everything all themed like all the little boxes Inside the Box are all cute and they're all themed together and everything and that's great and I really like it but I did not like their packing peanuts I did not love their packing peanuts yeah not a fans those are the devil I didn't even know people still use those I have not yet checked their website and I will correct this future Lila will pop in here if I need to correct this these could be biodegradable ones I know there are some that are more Earth conscious than others I don't know I believe I had like brown paper is that right yeah I had brown paper in the witch's Moon however they had brown paper recycled brown paper and I liked that a lot better their packaging was paper bags and the brown paper and honestly as cute as the witch casket stuff is and it's super cute I kind of prefer the paper I really do so especially if I'm going to be getting these like every single month I would much rather recycle a bunch of brown paper than have this you know this unrecyclable cardboard it's super cute but I'm never going to use this box again it's very pretty and it'll look great in an unboxing video but then I'm going to throw it away because I can't recycle this type of cardboard so those are my only complaints with that hey witches future Lea here I did check with which casket and they said for each and every casket sold one tree is planted this is in addition to avoiding single-use Plastics when sourcing for our caskets which contain only eco-friendly packaging Solutions and ethically sourced products which are cruelty-free and vegan Bravo five brooms up to Wich casket future Lea out there are a couple things in each box like You' said earlier Morgan there's stuff that I probably won't use necessarily as much but overall every single thing in these boxes made me happy I was super thrilled to pull out every little item in the boxes even things that I wouldn't necessarily use all the time are still a lot of fun and still made me really happy and I wanted to mention one small critique I had and it's easier for you Ila because you you're we're not interviewing the people who made up your box so Morgan just just take this for what it is yeah my critique is I'll give you an example I went away on vacation for a week and I came back to 12 emails when was that last week oh oh no we've got so we just switched over newsletter uh platforms on July 3rd beginning of July we switched over to new and I'm gonna they're in the what's called learning period right now to see what the correct ratio of emails is it's too high I'm telling you too high yeah no I've even had to I've had to talk with them like okay like y'all got a lot of stuff going on in there and it's it is we just like that was the beginning of July we just switched over and and hired to help us I understand that that you know these these subscription boxes you are going to be put on an email list with every box and I get that and I I I get the transition I totally get it they just all good information could they compact it all into like one email a week I yeah I'll talk to him but that's my only critique and I think if you are someone starting out in the craft and starting out in your practice or you are coming back to it and getting back on the broomstick I think these boxes even if you do a oneandone or you skip around even if you cannot commit to a subscription I do find Value in these maybe for a more seasoned witch you might want to pick and choose a little more because it might be I don't want to say you might have all the things already or part of the things but that could be the case but for someone who is looking for at least in in my experience you're getting information and knowledge as well as stuff these are badass these are badass I think yeah I I agree I definitely have to say that these are a lot of fun I am someone who moves a lot and so I am building up some things a little bit so this helps with that but above and beyond that these were just really freaking fun to get and to wait for and it's all quality beautiful stuff that I'll be very happy to use but Morgan for you what's your favorite part of putting these together you is there a formula that you use when you put these together or do you just there's always a candle there's always an incense or do you just kind of wing it she told us how you kind of pick themes but how do you pick products yeah we always have a candle just because the candles are generally most of the candles are made for us by a local Candle Maker so we we make sure to include her you know every month I like that even better that's cool keeping everything kind of local and then we try to do like a mist or oil or herb Blend or something like that and then we like to throw in what we call a big ticket item so that's going to be something that's kind of like oo you know right the ooh Factor yeah the o and a factor but other than that it really it depends on the theme so sometimes there'll be a few less items but they'll be bigger but then some months we're like lots of tiny things that that's what makes us happy so it we've tried to stick to a formula in the past and it kind of stifles the creativity around here so we that's why we're like okay we always have to have a candle we try to do the eclectic witch cards but other than that you know what have we not done in a while so yeah you pull the people too right yes and we pay attention to um like we have a Facebook group for the customers and they'll post pictures of their boxes every month and so we we definitely pay attention to what people are saying like oh this this was my favorite or oh I didn't care for this very much and so we have notes we write it all down like okay like this went over really well this didn't and and yeah we take all that into consideration do you have any tips for someone who is contemplating whether or not to get a box yeah I definitely do uh so the the three boxes that you all picked are actually the three longest lasting boxes in the which boxes so far to date um I believe all three of us were started in 2016 16 in 8 years of doing this I have seen a lot of boxes come and go so the three that y'all picked are the three longest running so that's definitely a a testament to the character of all three of those boxes um the second biggest thing is there are a lot of them that are popping up around they pop up all the time look at the about us page if if they if they don't tell you anything about the business there are a lot of them that are run by corporations now right if the about us page is extremely generic that's a red flag you know so look on social media um look to see if they are you know a lot of them like even I will say this like witches moon is a small business okay they're very they're very introverted so you you can't find out a lot of information about them but all of their stuff is legit gorgeous so beautiful blew my mind blew my mind everything in this box is better than I expected I absolutely in love with them I'm not goingon to lie I was jealous about the book not gonna lie the whole thing I mean I know I picked a topic that I'm interested in for this box but exceeded my expectations I loved everything in it yeah and while you can't find out a lot of information about them like as much as you can like witch casket or you know in't goddess Creations um it is legit so so that's the only in fact out of all of of them that are out there now I think that's probably the only one where I think that doesn't fit the rule everybody else is pretty open if you find you know a witchy subscription box just go to the about us page and and look at it because there's there's telltale signs of whether it's being run by a corporation or whether it's being run by a real witchy person if I'm going to spend the money I want it to be something that someone who has the same at least maybe not exactly same thoughts and and opinions as me but on the same realm as me putting and energy into picking out these products that I'm going to use for my practice yes 100% yeah if I'm not picking it out for myself I a witch to pick it out yeah yeah it's it's it's much more fun that way now before we let you go Morgan I have a couple things since I have your ear I'm going to put in my two votes for what I would like to see one is would you ever consider a cannabis Magic Box not cannabis in it but you know related to that and two would you ever consider collaboration boxes like would you ever consider working with you know famous or not famous an author or someone well known or respected in a certain practice would you consider collaborating with them to maybe offer a box not closed practice but for something that you yourself aren't as familiar with so I would say that for both of those answers for a subscription Box level just because of the level that we're at um no just because just because we have to think about the majority of people but with that being said as far as smaller kits or anything because we're not just a subscription box business so for smaller kits or sets or anything yes to both of those okay we have actually we've dabbled a little bit in cannabis magic sets in the past and like during covid and and yeah and then maybe slightly before it they sold out we could not keep them in stock but in your defense you in your defense could be I could be 16 years old ordering your box and you don't know that you have no way to check my ID exactly very good point and then we are actually now we're we're getting ready to partner with a amazing brewha who is very um hoodo based and it is because I don't do that that I went to her and said hey would can we carry your stuff in our shop and she was like yes 100% so it's not going to be a box but it is going to be like certain products in the store because I know that we have customers that are interested and if I can find someone that wants to work with me then yes I'm definitely for that just not on the level of the subscription boxes because we have to do a little bit more generic generic yes kind of keep it for everyone it needs to be more accessible to everyone as opposed to so Niche or you know if it's some sort of rock fairy algae magic not everybody's going to be into that and so you need to maybe keep that a little smaller okay well very cool though I love that you have occasional Boutique boxes that are a little bit different that sounds really fun I like that Lea will add in the show notes all of from all three three boxes the websites the social how to get a hold of folks this was fun I loved the whole process of the boxes and you know calling le la giddy this is what I got this is what I got it was fun it was fun it was now can you give us any sneak peeks on anything special coming up in the next few months maybe closer to Ule or you know sa time something special they might be able to look forward to anything like that yeah we definitely go I will say this we definitely go darker the darker the the as the year gets darker as well we very much flow with the seasons here so our themes as the spooky season comes our themes get a little bit more like witch aesthetic you know but like that darker spookier still functional though so we definitely do that and then thank goodness I will say that our December stuff is definitely heavily fun U tide themed this year sh yes so that is that's going to be a great one for December and we're it's so like we thought really far outside of the box for it and I think it's G to be really fun that sounds exciting how far ahead can someone get a sneak peek of The Box before it's shipped out we do just the three sneak peeks the month while while we're selling the Box we just do we do one sneak peek a week for the month yeah okay okay just gonna have to buy the damn box and find out I guess just gonna have to get the box well maybe if you're good I might send you a Ule gift sh cuz I know how much you like how many Christmas trees go up in your house every year I think the most I ever had was 16 there you go love that I have issues no not at all good thing is is I love ornaments that's the whole problem but in my defense every year at least one of those trees is real because I can't do that many all real come on then so we know she'll be looking forward to that box but we want to thank
