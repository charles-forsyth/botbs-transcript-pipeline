the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to a wheel of the Year episode of back on the broomstick in this episode we'll be talking about the upcoming cross quarter holiday that is celebrated around February 1st called imul sometimes also called MCH and candle mass and it's one of my favorite holidays for a whole bunch of reasons not the least of which the sun is coming back and the days are actually starting to be a little bit noticeably brighter and longer which I love and some of the very very first hints of spring are starting don't lie to us all you have another reason why you love it yeah I kind of do February 1st is also my birthday and happy to celebrate that and talk about the folklore today I'm Leila and I am shell and I also need to point something out here Lea what's that not only is it in buul your birthday but there's something else equally is special and exciting about right now in this time of year and lest you for get there is a one-year anniversary for a certain podcast with M and my best pal oh maybe back on the brck so we are in the midst of what I'd like to call a two week celebration of our oneye anniversary because a day hello even my daughter spends the whole month celebrating her birthday it's a birthday month so for us to celebrate two weeks I think is wow look at us it shell I have to say not only did I not forget I am so excited about our one-year anniversary that I have some special people working on a special present for both of us to Mark the anniversary and we should be getting it before the first and I almost can't stand it I almost want to tell you all about it but I'm not going to all right people this is where Lea annoys the out of me because she does me all the time she will like tease me with like info like that and be like Oh I got surprise for you but I'm not telling you and I am one of those people you can't do that to me it's killing me I want to tell you so bad every waking moment every time I think OFA I'm GNA be like she has a secret that she's not telling me what the could it be and I'm gonna theorize and then before you know what I have this whole like elaborate thing in my head oh it's gonna be that good and and and you just giggle at me well I'm tortured and why do you do this because I'm tortured right now I can barely contain myself so shout out to to the people who are doing this you know who you are I love you I can't wait thank you for the pictures this is so  cool I don't know who you are people but if you're makinga happy then it's got to be exciting right damn you so other than the super special surprise that I am having created to sent to shelle and myself it is also my birthday but more importantly we're here to talk about the Festival of imul one of the what I called a cross quarter day and what that means is it's between almost directly between celestial events the winter solstice and the Spring Equinox so this is like a halfway point across quarter there are people who kind of break the eight sabbaths into like two groups the greater and the Lesser and this would be considered one of the greater with belan sin and llamas and I have a I have a visual for this particular Sabbath I think you'll find it quite interesting when when I think of imul visually I think of the ground and inside the ground a big old pregnant belly yeah that's a great way to look at it I mean the name itself imul means in the belly and the name came about because this was a time of year okay maybe we should back up it's an Irish holiday for the most part it's a Celtic holiday and this is the one of the ones that we know for a fact was celebrated from some very old writings talking about it but it was also a fertility holiday it was an an agricultural holiday this was the time of year when the Sheep started to have their babies they started to have their lambs this is lamming season so the first stirrings of Life were now so this was a time to celebrate that also and I think where the candle Mas piece comes in this is when they could kind of scale back their candle use they were also able to at that point start feeding their animals and their herds before it got dark so it was kind of very much the light coming back you know they say you know on the solstice after that the days get longer sure as they don't feel that way right now okay they do not feel that way right now I know in my mind they are but when I'm live in my life they don't feel like they're getting longer at the moment once you get to that beginning of February you know first week or two of February at least here in in the Northeast it ain't getting dark at 4:15 anymore now you got into like 5 o' and you know then 5:15 you really do notice that the days are getting longer finally not a lot but longer than they were a month and a half ago and in some parts of the country of of America we're talking about here so obviously in this southern hemisphere it's llamas right now right it's lunasa it is we're just talking about the Northern Hemisphere particularly in the United States there's places around the country where the first glimmers of spring are happening some people have crocuses you know you have snow drops you might start to see different birds in when I lived in California I loved February because everything was starting to get green and Lush again it was a beautiful way to to celebrate because you could literally see the beginnings of spring and some people don't celebrate directly on February 1st or 2nd uh some people actually wait until they see the first the very beginnings of the first sign of spring in their area to celebrate imul I don't know I feel like this winter the first signs of spring never went away but you know weird so I think it is important also to mention that there is a a particular goddess um associated with this particular holiday and how she actually got turned into an Irish saint this goddess is the daughter of the king of the tuad Donan which means that she is one of the Fay folk she's one of the she and her name is breed or bridgid we talked about this a little bit before we started recording because when I first learned of this goddess it was all through reading so I pronounced it rigid cuz we're phonetic cuz we're phonetic sure that was the name I knew and then when I met people who other people who were witches and who practiced and I met people who were in particular Irish Traditions Celtic traditions and it was beaten into me that you pronounced it breed you didn't pronounced it bridg it was pronounced breed so you'll hear it both ways breed or bridg I've got some validation for you for this if you actually Google the goddess bridgid in uh pull up the Wikipedia in the Wikipedia and you know take it for what it is it's Wikipedia it specifically says that they refer to her as breed and they spell it b r e d so for whatever the value of Wikipedia is they validate your pronunciation so because of my training you'll hear me refer to her mostly As breed and you'll probably hear shell refer to her as Bridget and both are correct and this goddess she is the goddess of the heart of smithcraft she's the goddess of Artisans she's the goddess of fire she's the goddess of Wells protection of the home a lot of the wells and waterways in Ireland are dedicated to breed and there's some of the Traditions around imul will involve tying little strips of cloth to trees near these sacred Wells and sacred Rivers I love tying sh to trees It Feels So fairy magical otherworldly I don't know it really does and I wonder if it's because it comes from this tradition it's a really cool thing to do if you're looking for a way to celebrate imul leading up to the day or on the day you can take strips of cloth or you can also take I like to take um you can take paper bags or I really love the paper that is inside boxes that you get delivered like packing paper you take long strips of that like really long strips of it that's going to biodegrade the birds are going to use it for nests but you can write out on that your intent for the year your wishes for the year you know something to honor breed or something to honor the spring and then you can go and tie that on a tree and offer that to breed and that way it's something that's not going to harm anybody and you can just leave it outside or alternatively one tradition is to leave clothing or cloth outside to be blessed by breed and then you can use that to make something for the home or for yourself or your family that has the protection of breed in it now I'm a weirdo so I have to kind of make a left turn here and as with all the other four major sabbaths or the other three major sabbaths this is also a time where people seek divination okay and hey I'm all for it cards tea leaves Ouija board let's do this but what I wanted to point out is this is also part of of that divination was kind of forecasting the weather you know they're they're waiting for winter to wrap it up Spring to come I have to bring up Groundhog Day I cannot I can't I can't help it I'm gonna debunk it punks Satani Phil man he's magical he is he has nothing to do with breed or imul if anything it comes from an old German tradition right but I think I think the the the tie-in of weather divination this time of year although Punk Satani Phil and Groundhog Day is from a different culture it kind of Falls in line with the spirit of part of this holiday I feel I agree I I'm going to call it accidentally Pagan and I I'll claim it I'll allow it you know because it doesn't directly come from breed or from Ireland it has more German tradition Roots but it is part of that whole weather divination thing so I'll allow it present day it is what what keeps that first day or two of February in people's minds I think so too I like I said accidentally Pagan or not I think it's pretty cool the tyin is kind of neat it's one of those things where they kind of tried to ride the coattails of pagan things that were already there which happened with breed as well here's breed this goddess this daughter of the fairy King and Christians came in and made up their own story about a nun who had healing powers and again same type of things that breed does but now they're calling her Saint bridgid and she's just like the goddess but she's not a goddess she is a saint so you're Christian for worshiping her whatever keeps the Spirit Alive because you know what present day people to this day still worship St bridgid yes you know and that keeps the goddess alive praise the goddess and that's where the other name of candl mask comes from I believe that was a a Catholic invention again to try and co-opt the day and that's more celebrated to typically on February 2nd so you'll see different dates for imul most of the time I seen it as February 1st and maybe I was being a little selfish because it's my birthday but I will also see it as Dawn on February 1st to Dawn on February 2nd and I think that that is important because I've actually seen it listed online as January 31st until February 2nd or any day in between and I think that does a play on the you know midnight to midnight or whatever you know how I am whatever works for you if I'm busy on the first that should happen on the second or if I'm busy on the first and the second it might happen on the third I've also seen it as the second full moon after the winter solstice which I believe is the 25th of January and the ancient Irish people did not have a calendar so they would not have said hey February 1 is when we're going to celebrate the goddess breed they were going on yeah they were going on the stars and the planets and or the when the first land was born maybe something like that was when so if you miss the February 1st date first of all you should all smoke a joint in my honor please right raise a joint to Leila on that day but also to breed but you could celebrate at any time if you miss the first like shell said from the you could do it on the 25th of January if you need to do it earlier or you can wait until you see that first crocus or Robin or sign of spring in your area and I just want to say to all of our listeners from the great state of Pennsylvania I wholeheartedly believe in Punk Satani Phil I will be watching to see if that little bastard shows his shadow or not I believe in the magic I believe I do love the movie Groundhog Day oh my God right it's so fun but the other thing that got co-opted is is another craft that people do around this time of year you can make corn dollies or little dollies to represent breed because again she's the goddess of crafting and of the Hearth so having a dolly of her to protect which find hysterical little in fact in elementary school we used to make corn dollies at this time of year and you know th those fools didn't even know what they were doing like instilling these Pagan thoughts in our children um but yeah I remember making corn dollies in school the other thing that you might make in school is one of breeds crosses these are really cool and they may have originally been woven for protection like an evil eye type protection they could also have been representations of the sun you know what's weird about some of the raw figurines whether it be the the dollies or the cross breeds cross at least my family and as you know kind of weirdos I remember these being Christmas ornaments my mother had a tree dedicated like a little tree you know me and my my tree Obsession my mother had a tree dedicated to straw made ornaments and that was actually the first time I ever seen as I call it Bridget's cross I know you call it breed cross it was a ornament on my mother's straw Christmas tree and thinking back is this something that maybe went from the solstice to imul or was it specific to this short period of time I think it became a very popular Christian symbol St Bridget is a popular Saint she's the saint of the home and of protection you'll very often see them particularly in Irish Christian homes you'll see a breed's cross just displayed as decoration it did represent the sun this Wheel of Life you know protection type of symbol now were we just weirdos having it on a Christmas tree or was there some connection between I don't know not not that my family ever connected the solstice but would there have been a connection with the solstice to imul In the period in between well I'm going to have to ask our listeners that because I haven't ever heard of anyone else using it as a Christmas decoration but maybe our our listeners have maybe that's something specific to the Appalachian region or maybe my family's just weirdos Bo maybe she had a whole tree hold on I I think we need to go back to the she had a whole tree of straw ornaments did I hear that right now you remember when I've had 11 fully decorated Christmas trees my own house don't don't think I just got that out of nowhere that's like genetic ma'am I know your mom had a couple I didn't know she had enough to have one dedicated to straw ornaments oh was there one of the goats on there the Ule goat I don't ever remember a goat and I never heard of the pickle until I was an adult yeah the pickle thing that that's new to me I did not know the pickle and the spider but anyway we're getting off track off track off track but I think the point with our little offshoot is that you may have some of these symbolisms infiltrated in your life and not realize it because they were christianized and where I live right now you know I I was telling you the other day I was like no we have a silver Bridget's cross here and you're like what and I sent you a picture and you're like no well your sweet love to give away a ton of information they're Irish you know that it's pretty strong there and so I'm not surprised at all but I was like what that's a pagan symbol that's good news for our witches in the broom closet this is one of those holidays that you can celebrate out and proud and people will think you're Christian right some of the things that you can do toell celebrate this holiday are spring cleaning you know she's the goddess of the Hearth and the home and of crafting clean your house make it beautiful feather that Nest put up some crafts make yourself a breed's cross to celebrate the sun and the Harvest and the return of the Sun and people will think it's a cross I got a geek fun fact this time of year is usually when I get a brand new and actually I just got one recently a brand new Farmers Almanac and I kind of go through it to see what what the hell is coming to the Northeast and that kind of goes with the whole weather magic thing and you know that Farmers Almanac they've been going for a couple hundred years they're on to something there fantastic I kind of do like the whole what does the weather bring part of this whole time of year I like for scrying on imul fire scrying this is a time to break out those candles to put a candle in every room of your house to invite breed and her protection and her artisanship into your life her creativity into your life and take those candles or a fire if you have one if you're lucky enough to have an outdoor bonfire and do a little bit of fire scrying very simply just like you would do mirror or water scrying sit very comfortably and relax and use fire safety and then gaze softly into that flame you know when you're kind of tired and you're camping and you're just kind of sitting there staring in the flames you want to have that kind of soft focus and just gaze and and just let whatever thoughts are Visions come in come in and definitely have a notebook handy to jot all that down yep and if you want to say some small chant or something to breed to ask for her protection and guidance while you do it even better but yeah I love your Journal suggestion definitely have a journal on hand so you can write them all down because you'll forget them like a dream very quickly afterwards I think that probably the most favorite thing that I like to think about with this is that vision of that pregnant belly in the ground and almost like the anticipation like what are they called snow crocuses that anticipation of them like poking through the ground because you know that first flower can only lead to more you know what I mean and it's almost like waiting for that burst to come out yes and breed as the goddess of fertility and of you know Midwifery that doesn't just necessarily mean babies that can also mean cre creativity within you waiting to burst out or it can mean getting ready to start a garden or anything that you want to start to begin this is a great time to begin new project whatever it could be yeah I like to bless my seeds not necessarily seeds that I'm going to sew outside because here in the Northeast we have until like the beginning of June yeah before we can plant anything but if I'm doing an indoor weed Garden or something I love to bless the seeds right now or even bless the seeds that'll be planted later in the spring for my outdoor garden and then kind of with the whole candle Mass aspect I definitely do the whole candle grouping I do like a grouping I don't know why maybe because it makes it feel like an inside bonfire I hate the fold I ain't doing no outside I don't like that a grouping of candles yeah now's a good time to make candles if you have the opportunity oh that is so much fun by the way one of our old community members used to cut out paper snowflakes and then write their wishes on that and then burn those in a fire on imul to symbolize the end of winter to symbolize that the flame the fire of the sun consuming the winter time you know a symbolic act well I'm all for that sun coming back let me another favorite craft of mine involves one of my favorite food groups and that is baking bread soups anything with root vegetables soups hearty breads those are all fabulous things to do right now again Hearth and Home man if you're cooking on the stove that's your modern day Hearth right there now we know the The Legend of the Holly king and the oak King and how they do their biannual battle to the death this has kind of been a period for the last little bit where the goddess has been withdrawn and kind of away so to say he is in the latter part of the Crone phase but this is kind of that time of year where you keep in mind that the goddess isn't necessarily gone or or dead cuz like you said the latter part of the Crone phase but rather she's sleeping and this is kind of that first Awakenings of her returning as the maiden in the spring yes another way to look at it is demer the prapan and demer myth you know demer is just now starting to be happy she's just now letting the Earth reawaken because she's anticipating that her daughter pranie will be coming back to her very very soon and so she's starting to get excited the maiden is starting to come it's that Lial phase as the Crone Fades out and the Maiden fades in there's just not like that battle story like the oak K hly King you know I kind of love that's a good point I never really thought about it that way shell I love that you brought that up well it's almost like she's just dormant for a while not necessarily like with the oak king and the Holly King one replaces the other who replaces the other who replaces the other but literally fight to the death that's literally a a mentor and and child you know battling to the death and that's the way the stories always go but they cyclically take each other's place no one no one takes the goddess's place just changes she just withdraws and comes back in her new form as the maiden see I never really thought of it as a withdrawal I just thought of it as a different phase on a circle that's ever she's ever cycling through this circle so I never really thought of as a pulling back just more as she's at a different place on the wheel it just feels like from Ule to imul is like a weird time magically mundane like how many people in the world call the two weeks after Christmas the missing two weeks you know the weeks that never were all of January kind of feels like that too you know at the beginning of February things get moving again and you start getting back into the gro I don't know it's no you're exactly right it's it's that linal phase or magical yeah it's not a battle with the goddess it's not an Abrupt here's the change like it is with the gods with the goddess it's a SL sleeping yeah it's kind of like like the Earth is sleeping so she also is sleeping the Earth is quiet and cold and so she's either sleeping or if you go with a deor myth she's waiting she's waiting for her daughter which is why Y in book is a weird period I guess so yeah it's also a great time to go within this is still a good time to do your journaling do that fire scrying wrap up in a nice comfortable robe get all happy and Squishy in your ritual space light an awesome candle and then just kind of gaze into it you know and be all comfy cozy and and write your scrying for the next year you know clean your house so it's all perfect and makes you feel happy and thrilled to be home just comfortable in your own space and in your own skin bread yeah bake that bread be inside because again in a lot of the United States I don't want to be outside yeah it's too cold and so baking bread making stews ordering in amazing food if you don't want to cook buying grap bread you don't have to bake it if you can't or don't want to but doing those things to comfort yourself surround yourself with comfortable things that remind you of home and of creativity and starting to sew the seeds literally or figuratively of the things that you want to do this year as you're ready to come out of your shell as you're ready like shell said at the beginning to burst up from the ground as the beautiful flower that you are you now you need to prepare for that because you're so much close to ready that potential is right there on the verge of rebirth on the verge of greatness you know your your pranie coming up from the ground getting ready to be reunited with her mother and of course hkat is right there with you keeping you safe but you're coming up from the ground to be reborn to start a new to see the sun again wow this is a thrilling holiday because my birthday rocks man this is a great holiday I I know I mentioned this to you before we started recording but I do want to point out to the people this is probably the one out of the eight holidays that I really knew the least about partially because I really it was oh well that's less birthday but I don't venture out a lot in the cold and a lot of my winter rituals were more by myself or with my small coven because I'm not outdoorsy in the winter man you would think I was born in like Hawaii well you know we are from the northeast of the US which is notoriously bitter bitter cold this time of year sometimes Ule isn't so bad necessarily but by the time you hit the end of January beginning of February it's frigid cold I don't know if you follow football or weather but if you've heard of Buffalo New York they just got slammed with feet of snow and they're about to get slammed with feet more and I live right next door to that on the edge of a great lake and it gets icy and bitter cold here yeah and then that just makes its way 300 miles to me yeah exactly you're right on the ocean the life we live yeah but where we where we grew up as pagans these rituals were not done in that fabulous outdoor space that we all loved and found so amazing they were done a local YuYu church or sometimes in someone's home and they weren't as fun there's no dancing around a bonfire there's no drumming so I would very often go to those but they were much less attended than the others because people are home you want to stay where you're safe and cozy and warm and I didn't attend them as much because I was at home staying cozy safe and warm so I really thought this was a good one because I learned a lot more than even I knew last year for our imul ritual episode or the year before on our previous podcast the stone Witches Hour where we talked about it and one of the other things I want to try I have the pieces of it getting ready to go is I saw the coolest coolest thing now this is a festival of fire and of water because breed is a goddess of flame she's a goddess of Hearth and Forge she's also the goddess of streams and rivers and sacred Wells so I love this you take a bowl right and you put in water and you put in like slices of orange and cranberries and sprigs of herbs and different pretty things like that oh I love where this is going right you freeze it and then you put a little tealight maybe you like carve out a little hole in the center of it put a little tealight in it and now you have this gorgeous ice Globe that's lit up from the inside with a tealight candle I'll put up pictures because I like I said I have one going right now God I'm doing this I'm so doing this and it's such a imul thing because you can make it round like a pregnant belly but it's round it's awesome it has the fruit in it it's ice you put a candle in it you got the fire and I got to do this so I just love that you have both the symbols of fire and water for breed and these really pretty basically candle Globes ice globes that you can leave outside to celebrate imul I I'm very excited to do that this year well you've given me lots of good ideas for crafts I just need to find some straw weave there you go so we will have another episode next week with more things that you can do for imul to celebrate the holiday including some spells and rituals specific for imul and maybe Leila will feel guilty and tell me what the surprise is by then I haven't forgotten by the way if the gods are kind you will have it by then and we can talk about it so we'll see what happens but I'll also put up some pictures of our crafts if if shell makes a breeds cross and I'll show you some pictures of my ice Globe candle holder and in the meantime I hope you all are preparing for your own version of rebirth and all I can think of is that song Here Comes the Sun the sun's coming rebirth is happening my birthday's happening yay oh and it's a leap year how cool is that ooh I forgot about that oh yeah we'll have to talk about some leap year magic as well but all right we will see you next week on Friday for another episode of back on the broomstick in the meantime if you liked this episode please give us some Stars rate US like tell a friend subscribe check out our website back on the
