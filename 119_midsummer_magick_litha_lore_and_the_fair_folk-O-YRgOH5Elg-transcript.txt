welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode we're talkin about lifter the summer holiday Midsummer the time of fireflies and fairies and late-night magic the time when everything is warm and Lush and beautiful and I'm sure she'll and I have famously dubbed with the Forgotten have it it's it's a thing I don't know why but here we are we are not forgetting so I think that this would be a good time to talk about litha to talk about fairies I love fairies fairy magic and things that you can do for Alyssa right now how do you want to start with the vibe of Lissa as one of those if the longest day and the shortest night during the summer solstice which occurs around June 20th or 21st in the northern hemisphere the North Pole of the planet is tilted closest  listen and this means that the sun will reach its highest point in the sky at noon so whatever noon is for your local time the Sun will reach its highest point at noon for several days before and after the solstice and it'll seem to be in the same position every day at noon so it almost appears like the sun stands still which is why it's so easy to observe and why this holiday has been acknowledged by so many different cultures for thousands of years so the sun pauses at noon and that results in the longest day and the shortest night of the year that means that the summer solstice marks the exact moment when the Sun appears that his northernmost point in the sky and it's that point where again it stands still and it's what we call it the solstice because it's two Latin words soul in Statham Statham to stand still and the exact moment of the solstice is on June 20th at 10:42 p.m. eastern time  so she lives somewhere else the time is going to be different you know I have mixed feelings about this because here we are in the Northeast it kind of feels like summer is just starting and then the thought of it just started and now here's the longest day and it's all downhill from here that it doesn't settle well yeah and sometimes it's even called Midsummer and why do we call it Midsummer if it's technically the first day of summer it's also a perspective I think that's because the accounts had two seasons they had winter and they had summer so the summer solstice comes right in the middle of what would have been their summer season right because they looked start of summer so when I think of Midsummer I kind of think it's almost like they're two separate things to me  honoring the Sun the flushness the growth all the things that are new and fresh and they're making me so stuffed up right now that I'm a loser the thickest I think of with Lissa but with Midsummer I think more traveling between our Realm of the fairy realm in the magic this of it and just two separate events in my brain isn't that so I mean Lissa is the fairy realm and it is a liminal space is one of those stickers of my baby and you could you do you could absolutely say lippa is just the day of the event and Midsummer is more of like the season an extended time summer it's kind of warm summer nights I don't know I think Midsummer there's something about the day and the night that I think are drastically different  about about the summer season and maybe that's where I kind of differentiate the two lifts us more of the bright sunlight celebration in my mind and then some more of the evening Night Celebration at the braiding the sun Bell the sun god or sometimes you'll see lose celebrated as well the king of the two audits on in so you can celebrate that energetic go get them grow everything type of power during the day and then at night is that more sensual the fireflies the warm air on your skin you know the lifestyle of a fires in the distance you know that kind of  differentiated by like those have the fairies and that you got over on and Tatiana and talk as long as you're not there a lot of people associate Midsummer with the feelings of that player that movie because that is about people who go into the woods and love affairs triangles I don't know but it's all about that sensual summer magic of the night and that's exactly what I think of with Midsummer where is litha it's about the sun shining and everything being lost you know this is all so I never have thought of it as one of the Harvest festivals but if you think about it  is because this is where kind of the first things are starting to barely starting to trickle in as yeah yeah it is that everything is so abundant the seeds you planted physically and metaphorically earlier in the year are now above ground the rights are flowering they're starting to produce everything around you is growing and so the energy that you can tap into his that same kind of green growing abundant energy that's the god the son that vibrant move forward kind of energy that you can tap into during the day with the sun you're getting those first tastings of the fruits of your labor right so the energy right now is all energy it's all new beginnings it's also a good time I think it's the kind of shed we're at the halfway point as far as the calendar year we're kind of it that six month mark  it's also time I like to utilize to you know I had this planned refiguring things you know maybe where you were magically six months ago is it where you are magically now there's a whole slew of things that can change in six months so I think it's also a good time to commune with Al and talk to those land spirits to see where you're at. Need to go see what you need to adjust it's a great time feet on the ground time is what I like to call it this is the time especially here in the Northeast for we can finally without freeze the ground and so it's a good time to kind of do that 6-month re-centering not just by the calendar but also celestially this is a liminal time the sun is at its strongest it reaches its peak  and now it's going to gradually get less strong it's going to suck some days it's going to go into its waning phase with the strength of the sun will be waning and the Knights will slowly start to get longer this cycle of the son and of the god mirrors the moon phases and the phases of the Goddess it's just on a year-long cycle instead of a monthly one so in the southern hemisphere it's actually you will right now but you know I love you I just don't like the cold world the solstice is a Midway point of the Year midwinter or Midsummer the sun begins to get stronger or it begins to get weaker this is also a division of the Year episode last year we talked about the oak King in the Holly King this is when the power of the oak King is at its height and then starts to gradually Wayne until the Holly King takes over for the  dark half of the year do you have that going on as well as much as I look at it as no voice like the beginning of the end as far as the year goes there's a whole lot of season left this isn't Doom and Gloom and for the southern hemisphere it's the the longest night and now they have that gaining son to look forward to I think that a lot of a lot of things that we do magically go and Ebbs and flows with the season and the easier that starts to come to you the more you get in a groove or you're not feeling the exact idea of what to do when to do how to do and you just kind of feel it when it comes how many times do you do you get into this group with magic where you just kind of feel it as it comes and I think that's where my division you know kind of circling back to the midsummer  I start to feel like that difference in Magic between day and night this time of year is different than Night Magic this year night cycle that's mirrored in the wheel of the year and that's why I love following that type of psycho because if you follow those subtle shifts of nature those subtle shifts all around you you can really start to get in tune with that just like you said to feel those shifts between the Day and Night Magic you can start to feel those shifts of the Earth's natural rhythms in yourself too and be more at June's that you know that can help you be more grounded in your magic that can help you even more connected to your craft and connected to your magical self sometimes our perspective in the Northeast on celebrating the sabbats is a little different with folks in different regions with different climates and different landscapes  quick touch on a message via email from someone at the end of their email this person says it's a little dangerous to be out of the broom closet here and they are from Southeast Texas. We're just going to refer to them by their first initial of K thank you for emailing us it was very very nice email and just going to kind of paraphrase a little bit now K has been on the which passed since 2018 and has been loving our podcast from thank you very much for that and she listened to our 2023 episode on Lyft I highly recommend that we talked about the oak King in the Holly King really really good then y'all two are in Texas this summer is oppressive draining exhausting and we just try to survive the Heat and the drought the grass is brown and prickly and hurts to walk through  scorpions rattlesnakes copperheads water moccasins and black widows are abundant Dusty and constantly being blown into dust devils that hurt to breathe in when the South winds blow the humidity feels like an energy vampire riding on my shoulders she says that even though she's Sun oriented and hates the cold summer means that she's inside shut off from the outside world does not feel magical at all so everything that we like about the summer have the same thing yeah I never been to Texas and boy if that wasn't the most poignant description I have ever heard and I stayed in Texas I have quite a few relatives that live in Texas so I am familiar with this weather now when I first moved to California I didn't know what to do because the landscape  so different than the very wet Forest of the Finger Lakes in New York state that I was familiar with and then I fell in love with it it just took one camping trip to Joshua Tree and seeing the stars and hearing the life and seeing the rattlesnakes and the dust devils and yes even the black widows in my backyard to appreciate that it was a black widow picture is beautiful it's scary and it's different but it's gorgeous and it's powerful and you can honor its power by acknowledging its force and choosing shade shadows and rest work with the sun energy when it's softer in the morning or in the evening or while you're indoors in the air conditioning but work with that hospice acknowledge the Sun as a god of fear  discipline. Just gross and radiant and beautiful summer days he is the god of power but also responsibility of different sides to that season and the serpent 2 is also a symbol of solar power absorb the energy of the sun they coil on themselves they are a symbol of Hecate and so many different goddesses and gods you know there's power and honor in that as well so the god that sun god is an acknowledgment that sometimes power comes with responsibility for finding those differences and what they can teach you is is part of being a witch and I know that Joshua tree is not the same as Southeast Texas but people have been finding magic and connection to the Gods in the desert for ever it is so easy to go out there and feel such a deep connection to everything to feel that Vibrance that life that magic  it's somehow the desert is so full of and even though at first glance it might look dead or empty there's so much are the magic is powerful Jim Morrison being out in Joshua Tree at night with the Stars I mean he wrote really weird crazy magical songs about that because that place is powerful you can feel it in the desert and if this goes right back to how I kind of differentiate by the way the stars are amazing in Texas I would think so I used to say that the sun in the summer time in Southern California was trying to kill us it was not the benevolent Forest go to the attempt you to go to a  bonfire and fool around with them know this guy really wants to kill you he'd like to give you some cancer and maybe you should die  out there cuz I still love it up into that tap into those energies you know learn about the different life that's dependent in the summertime there so you'll have to celebrate the season slightly differently for me in Southern California it's definitely different in Texas but February March April all my gosh the abundance everything is green and growing so things are different there at different times of season so you have to adapt these yes it's still the longest day and the shortest night yes your God your son got a difference in this has been our son God is at the same time of year here in the Northeast so you have to work with him work with that energy differently it's a little stronger so when you make your son tee it's going to be powerful is going to be that heavy angry you know that we've been honestly really angry cuz I don't I don't necessarily think the sun wants to kill you  no it's more like the sun in the desert want you to pay attention use common sense and know your limits just wants to whip you into shape a shape or maybe get you ready for the next season because I know a lot of plants in these places have to get hot some of them even need to burn before they can grow and so maybe the Sun God in your area is trying to whip you into shape is trying to mold you into who you need to be for the next season so work with the energy used where you're at it's difficult for us you know where were talking a lot about where we're at right now but I know just in the United States there's a lot of different environments at this time of year we talked about Spirit of place you know what you're saying totally makes me think of spirit of place that you know you got to connect with the land spirits of where you're at and do you know maybe you're in the burning deck  hell right now and text us utilize that utilize that but you don't work for that Spirit of place I talked to him. He's a little guy like that so yeah it is quieter maybe she's sleepy or maybe she comes more alive at night and you know you can absolutely do any magical working even if it's if it's trying to work with the evil Sun God you can do that at night time it's not that the box was taken away for the night it's just out of your view and just cuz it's one of you doesn't mean it's there when the sun's out of my fee which is totally gone  even if it was if it is when it's much easier and gentler to handle pretty much most places until it gets oppressive but summer nights can be absolutely sensual beautiful wonderful ways to connect with that warm more gentle sun energy that is still is giving that power and strength in abundance it's just giving it from it's dark where you're at and you can't see it thank you I'm so glad that you wrote to us and I'm so sorry that it's dangerous to be out of the broom closet there we hope you have good air conditioning all right so we keep talking about A Midsummer Night In A Midsummer Night's Dream  this holiday remind shell a lot of buffet end of that movie or the play A Midsummer Night's Dream it does we did way back there so we actually did have been Summer Nights theme ritual that that really strikes me the most about the summer nights and the midsummer night is in the nighttime are flies even more magnificent to see the food at least I feel like this time is a good time to connect with the FAE that there are those that are out there claiming that this is when the veil is thinnest between the face  and this realm and I do believe that to be true because especially when I think of the fact I'm thinking of you think of the fact I think of more summer time for this is definitely the time that I especially most associated with that Faye work and being able to make that connection the type of thing I would call Lynn spirit and in the Northeast she'd be most familiar with land that is awake mostly spring through the fall and then it goes to sleep for the winter basically and yes they're absolutely land Spirit Faith at thrive in the winter and the cold but they're not very abundant and they're not very nice so unless you're doing work with them you might not eat  be aware that they're all around you please be careful the FAE could be dangerous folk please be careful I'm not that bad summer solstice with the FAE mostly because solstices are liminal times and you'll hear a lot of witches and magical people talk about different holidays and the veil being thin weather between here and the spirit realm here in the FAE realm will talk about that a lot and the reason is because these are between times it's a time between a time so in this case this again is a Celestial event the longest day in the shortest night it marks a powerful threshold and the wheel of the year it's a pause the sun pauses in the Sky High at Midsummer at the height of its power is a moment when the energies of the light half of the Year shifts it reaches the height of its power but then it begins to wane  add pecans to March towards the dark half of the year so Alyssa is that threshold it's the height of abundance and warm the sun-drenched very Apex of power but is also a Tipping Point is also when the tide turns from that waxing to fullness to waning to the dark half so it's a threshold it's the moment of the sun God's greatest dominance and power but it's also the moment of his downfall you can teams that first whisper the first beginnings of the dark half of the Year this is a cycle this is cyclical it happens every year and that gives it its power that gives it its liminal quality so that makes it very predictable regular it's cyclical and so that makes it a very magical time it's a magical moment so if you wanted to celebrate that exact moment again that's June 20th at 10:42 p.m. Eastern and that's the exact  element of the solstice and there's actually sites all across the world that have formations a lot of a rock formations where they were Play Bill Grill whatever the case may be where the sun goes through a specific area right at the moment of the solstice it's Glastonbury I believe that is one of those spots and I also believe Stonehenge the Sun lines up between two pillars and Strikes the stone in the center I believe there's also something with the pyramids where the sun comes up directly between them on the solstice for 10000 plus years I mean they have evidence of this being at least marked and noted in many many cultures around the world Way Way Back Into history and the  because it is a moment against Leicester moment that you can measure and Mark and it does happen the same way every single year that's what gives it its liminal quality that's what makes it a magical marker in the universe and so that's why people talk about the veil being thin between the worlds because this magical cyclical moment has happened and occurred again and so that opens the world that opens the space and some people the Celts that Irish have the she that you are the diamond fairy folk The People Under the hill and they were here before humans were they were one of the many different types of people that were here and some people say that it was litha it was Midsummer when they had to go Underhill and went off into the fairy realm so sometimes they say that's why they're associated with a lot of lore and Tails associated with the FAE and midsummer  is she here what's out there yes you need to be careful working with the fat a should you be scared of working with the absolutely not but should you use an air of caution well yeah I'd say the same thing using bleach in the laundry we mostly say that basically you should be polite you should always say what you mean if you say you're going to do something make sure you do it well yeah and I'm also a big proponent of when you're working with the FAE bring gifts it's like going to your grandma's for Christmas gifts or another favorite of mine is honey bears like honey  I believe out for Alyssa or for summer time and will also mention a couple spells and ways to work with Midsummer and Faye energy in your practice you know what I did want to read it's it's almost like Silver Thread about his kind of course but it's really because to them they can make bracelets or ropes it was their size I was leaving these little 6-inch silver cords around they were nodding them and saying your wish into the machine. And then tying it on a tree's is often something that people will do to make offerings to Fay one of the things that I recently Learned was about the elder tree an elder trees or the witches tree sometimes it's also called The Fairy Tree by Al & Spirits sometimes called the mother  and if you see an elder tree and you want to take some berries or flowers from it or take some of its wood that you have to ask permission first which we kind of recommend using a specifically you have to ask permission because if you don't she would definitely get her revenge have to be careful that it was bad and she left it blank to let your imagination run wild follow directions we don't find out the bad stuff elder trees have a lot of faith Traditions around them they are sacred to the Fay and if you visit an elder tree especially around left eye you can make offerings to the tree and do that to make wish with the FAE can just make sure that whatever you offer them is worth whatever you're wishing for and that if you give them a gift of words or a gift of something that you'll do make sure you follow through  also I think working with the space gives you the opportunity because you you will be out and you will be kind of cool and while doing so we're good with the Fey are almost kind of doubles is having that connection with the land and that little bit more land like K deep in the Heart of Texas go out to your land and find out what your land is like go out with a son's not trying to kill you go out at night or whenever it's comfortable and walk your land walk it again not 4K don't walk at Barefoot because you might get bit by a snake but you know walk your land try to feel it put your hands in the dirt put your toes in the dirt touch a tree touch a plant or walk the sidewalks walk wherever it happens to be and listen to the land listen to the insects listen to the cars listen to the rhythm of the land around you and really try to connect with that  the nighttime is a fabulous in mid-summer because it just feels magical like there's something about it there's something that just feels different it does feel like that liminal space so if you have a night when the moon comes up in the breeze is warm and soft and you kind of feel that calling go out walk that land and see what it's like see what it says to you and you know I also think another good 20 is so we talked about how Lissa is technically at you know either the 20th or the 21st and you know I even joked earlier about how many times have we actually celebrated with Melissa Houston for that because maybe where you're at your environment and your surroundings aren't conducive for you to do something on the 20th or 21st but you'd be able to be third don't think that that is going to hinder your intentions at all and you don't  have to focus on the so much as that feeling that you have magic coming to you a date is just a date who made the calendar and see when is the solstice is an actual Celestial event I know but I also know that I haven't celebrated on the actual Celestial event and it's been exactly and the point is our old Community would usually celebrated on the weekends closest to yourself some sun tea during the day on the 20th and then at 10:49 p.m. Eastern you want to toast the God would that TV you can deep south so if it is blazing like the ass crack of Satan down there what about an outdoor  I'm talking more of the simmer pot nature not the drinkable nature so you're saying that you're harnessing the power of the sun to heat up herbs like making a potion almost like a son to me but more of a a spell Brew to use an offering or a spell component is that what you're making watches to make my house smell good okay alright I see what you're saying like an herbal potion traded with the energy of the Sun not t cuz you're not going to drink it you know cuz you can make us unto you spell right but you're talking about making a spell infusion beans ass crack of that song spell t h a t spell put your drinkable herbs in there put your mint for money put your chamomile 4-Piece put your green tea in there for power  whatever you need and use the power of the sun to do that or like she'll said try to brew yourself a potion make sun water makes solar water but Infuse it with those herbs put those herbs and things in there that you want in addition to the power of the Sun and then label it and now you've got this herbal concoction of energize some water with all the power and fused of these herbs that you've added to it as well water and you can have your some water please label responsibly just be cognizant if it's something they call that FDA approved so that you're you're not making yourself ill speaking of herbs and making yourself ill I want to take a left hand turn yourself I have been having a lot of fun with me  it's just thinking about it I know I know I was lamenting in an earlier episode that we didn't have any here well that's because we mowed it all down before we reach  we moved in later in the spring last year so a lot of it already before you got here so this year we didn't came up like crazy because it's invasive and put in a lot of places in the United States so I've been harvesting it for a little bit I harvested some early mugwort I've heard some people say that you just harvested before it flowers I've also heard some people say that you should Harvest it on June 6th so I harvested a bunch then but mugwort is a dreaming herb mugwort is a mystical liminal space herb ironic that June 6th is a good time to pick it right before the solstice and it's also an herb associated with the FAE because you can work with mugwort in tea in smokable spell an incense in sachets fresh Drive is wonderful and funny story so I was out walking my woods and I found a huge patch of mud  and I picked a bunch of it early cuz it's a little bit less bitter that way for tea and it's also nice and smokeables a little early as well and holy cow the dreams she'll just from picking it the dreams that I had that night or so I have a bunch of it drawing and then I usually like to dry it just for a couple days I don't want to be fresh fresh when I make it into a smoke bundle if I'm going to be wrapping it into a bundle I like it to be a little on the dryer side like not crispy but dryers but yes the one I took it down after a few days you know what it was ready to be bundled again the dreams holy cow especially in June right around Alyssa if you want to work with a favor if you want to do DreamWork gather yourself some fresh mugwort put the leaves in a little  cotton or linen bag whatever you've got put it under your pillow put it near your bed and ask for dreams do a ritual where you ask for it tell the herbs your intention I want to dream about my future job I want to dream about the best relationship from me that your intentions asked the herbs to help you and then put them next to your bed with a journal or your phone ready to record in this case it's really really important especially if you cross the Hedge if you're doing liminal dreaming if you're doing magical dreaming it can be so ephemeral that can be so fleeting so definitely have something to write down or record your dreams as soon as you wake up hit that record button and say everything tell your sleepy self before you go to bed I will remember to hit the record button or I will remember to  write down everything I think of the only thing I want to know is there are other options besides if you are allergic to it like I am the things I just happened to have an experienced this year with mug Parts I make me want to go and touch you know it already Makes Me stuffed up and I can't breathe just cuz it grows near me to swell rub it and touch it have dreams there's a lot of different stories about how you can see the face and summertime when the nights are magical and the fairies are out is a perfect time it's feels magical skills like fairies are there so there's also a couple different things that you can do one I heard when I was very little was it if you look between a cat's ears when they're staring at nothing you could see fairies interesting I also have a couple different song  because I've also heard that like if you take elderflowers and make like an elderflower you don't even have to make it to staying out of it you can just kind of soak it in the water for a little bit and then just touch that water to your each of your eyelids and your third eye and say a charm you could see the FAE you can also do that with mugwort you can make like at it like I said a little too saying or a little tea out of mugwort cool it down or just soak it in the water a little bit and just gently touch each eyelid and your forehead not if your shell not if you're allergic to it isn't your thing you could take a little bit of cat hair or cat nip along with some type of dreaming herb like blue lotus or Damiana mix them in water also guessing on the intent of being able to see into the ferry or the magical realm and then under a summer moon in under an elder tree for best results have a bit of that water onto your eyelids and your third eye while repeating your intention to have to cite or to see through false Hood Zoar to see the FAE  don't look too deep in the hole of a tree because if you look too deep in the Hall of a tree of fairy will look back out at you know I like that little face looking at me you can also do a spiral fairy wish spell was just a stone and a few leaves or petals strand of grass or whatever find a spot outside and Center yourself take a deep breath and state your wish or your intention and then start to slowly walk in word in a spiral and every few steps just dropped a little bit of the pedals or the leaves and repeat your wish you know whatever it is your intention is to slowly walk this spiral dropping those titles and stating your wish over and over when you get to the center old your rock or Pebble that you brought with you and bury it in the dirt and thank the Earth thanks buffet for making your wish come true then walk back out the spiral and don't look back and don't return to that spot for 3.  and your wishes come true I want to Circle back real quick because you made me tell you what I would leave is a a gift for the FAE but you never told us what you would leave is a gift for the FAE I personally like to leave plants I like to bring some of my plants out there likes me flowers I like to make offerings by working Mile and I guess I like the cleanup Mile and I like to take care of it and in doing that I feel that I am helping to Steward the FAE of my land open cuz I'm kind of up keep their home yeah yeah and sometimes when I make a garden and I will plant flowers in their particularly for the fairies so that they can have beautiful things there but most of the time I okay actually my favorite thing to do is fairy chess and we've talked about this before very chaste is something I learned from a green egg magazines a long time ago there was an article Oberon Zell and morning glories out I believe this morning glory sell who created this game  if I have a stamp or a rock or as a small patch of dirt on the ground and you take other little things not try not to disturb the land's too much you know everybody knows that making those Stone tiles are probably not good for the environment I'm just talking about its wing here at least there may be a little flower that's fall in or stone just take these little objects little things that seem magical that maybe call to you and arrange them in a pretty little shape on that stump or rock or dirt get kind of elaborate or keep it very simple depending on where you're at like here on my land I like to make very pretty signals and symbols and circles and spirals with a different flowers in the grasses and things that are here but that's because it's here and I know that it's getting chopped down in a few days so it's not going to really matter so I can use a ton of it but if you're at a public park or something you might be a little more and make a little pretty symbol for them  or make a little house out of bark and offer that to them now not all Fey are the cute little cymbeline I kind of say a lot of them are large and glowing and biggest people but still making these little offering these little symbolic offerings to the land can be very beneficial in furthering your relationship with them so yeah mostly taken care of and sometimes a little bit so I have a confession. I just I was thinking that same thought the other night actually have a pair of scissors in my car and I politely asked for a couple of roses and did a very nice little slow. That's what I liked about it and are very cool liminal space  I love that you left it on the windowsill because doorways Windows also liminal spaces between here and there so if you want to have a physical connection like a lot of times we talked for like magic a windowsill being a liminal space can help you cross that Faye liminal space to buy leaving an offering in a doorway or in a window that's definitely connects you to do that but you also have to remember you're also at that point inviting them in that's sure to make sure that you recognize that and you understand that relationship again if you make any promises you keep up your end of the bargain cuz you don't want to find out what happens if you don't it ain't fun it's like kind of making your parents mad no fun your litha rituals with the FAE whether it's your land Fae or you're trying to connect with the two aides on in like Lou you can do that by embracing the essential in your life  slowly in the Moonlight where are your favorite scent where luxurious clothing another way is to do a glamour spell you can do that by creating a mask take one of those plain Carnival masks and some paint or markers glitter you can use natural objects like feathers Mosby's whatever you like ribbon charms whatever and have a mirror nearby Center yourself relax and say something like I stepped between the worlds of leaf and light where Faith ants in Beauty site but glamorize and masks reveal the secret self I now am and feel and then decorate your mask color it painted blue things to it feathers make it as interesting cool magical whatever as you like and while you're making the masks three times during while you're making the masks look into the mirror and each time I say something different that you love about yourself gay isn't a reflection sale  you love about yourself go back to working on the mask and do that three times when you finish the mask State your intention which is should be some type of quality that you want to bring out of yourself or honor with them maybe it's Beauty self-confidence maybe it's magic or inner-sight whatever it is and then gaze into the candle flame and imagine yourself shimmering with this glamour breathe in breathe out slowly draw in the beauty or whatever it is that you have created an anchor that into you and it's your sense of self put the mask on look into the mirror one more time and state that you have that quality I am Beauty I am strength whatever it is that you made that mask for look at yourself and say that really feel it and then take the mask and keep it on your altar as a reminder of all those things that your drawing into your life  Brothers deep big fairy two presences and here I am currently a good example of the movie Tinkerbell is a good example of fairies that's always nice and I think that was the misconception I had until I had learned better and I think sometimes I thought is all about abundance and it's about Crossing this liminal space it's mid-summer we're going from the days growing longer to the nights are now starting to grow longer so since we're crossing that liminal space doing a ritual or a spell to help you get into the next phase of your life or to help you maybe the Seas that you planted back in earlier in the year now you've evaluated you seen how they started to grow  now you want to see where they're going to go for the next part of the year the next half of the year so you can focus your energies or your spells in that direction incorporate the FAE by having the spell be something that you create maybe you roll a candle or maybe you make a braid or or some type of not work and so you can incorporate craftsmanship which the FAE appreciate into that as well so kind of you know going back to the Midsummer Night's Dream you and I randomly call upon the faith throughout the year for various things and I kind of look at this is also a big thank you because you know what do you do in the summertime you know people have parties people have barbecues people have Gathering of family reunions it's it's a time of year where people do to get together so it's also kind of a good time or your ritual can just be a thank you thank you for everything that you have assisted with this  past year and for the future assistance and kind of make it almost like a gratitude ritual don't say thank you thank you too much you should say I appreciate your assistance your assistance helps me in celebration of assistance is celebrating their assistance I could go back to that word I can't I could just roll it off my tongue I'm such a people pleaser thankful for abundance be thankful for the energy of the Fey that's in your life you know what is a barbecue a bonfire or you're celebrating fire and summer and that abundance so you don't operate all of that in there I just have these visions of little fairies using little flowers to get drunk off of using them as their little cup people feel the Little Flower cookie cookie  since Falls or maybe it's Morgan theme lyrics called I'm not sure but I tend to see the face like big shining scary people who are very beautiful and very angry and I don't see him like that I see a more kind of a compact figure that is very delightful unless you cross them until I get to that point and I tend to look at the site as delightful and unless you cross that cross that line so you're kind of like Tinkerbell you can have a happy tank and angry tank happy Shaolin angry show celebrate the energy use of the land around you feel the land take this time this is a good time if you have the opportunity if you are able to do the location feel the land even if that is literally going out  bare feet on the ground and has something to say and summer time is a wonderful time of abundance even if the closest you can get to the land is finding a farmers market see if you can connect that way there's lots of different ways to connect with that abundance but don't let it continue to be the holiday that people seem to forgot I think that as much as we're all busy right now we need to remember to celebrate those tickets to the wheel when that wheel turn this and it's easy to kind of pass some of them by to the circumstance but let us not be the Forgotten holiday can out there enjoy the day if as much as you can enjoy the night and the energies of abundance and fertility and the world the light I think the biggest thing especially for us here in the northern hemisphere the light vitamin D  deficiency is a thing so we like our sunlight and into know that we've waited all year for the peak of and here it is do something with that energy you've got the strength and the abundance and the growth so use that energy in your life to find those things and to apply that wherever you need it today there is a light, enjoy it and now you are creeping towards the light however the light is in your half of the Year we hope you are enjoying it and we hope to see you at next week would have another episode coming up for you and maybe a couple Surprises with me now and then I need to get in touch with us in the meantime send us an
