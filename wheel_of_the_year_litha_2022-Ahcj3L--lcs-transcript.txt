so hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to a special wheel of the Year litha Edition of the stoned Witches Hour I'm Leila and I'm hi smoking the Letha weed shell and who doesn't love summer weed it's so good so abundant so green so tasty such high THC content I'm just High that's all I know that's my stuff and shove girl isn't that how we start up every episode I'm just really high that's pretty true I mean we do kind of do every single episode we get blazed first and talk about a lot of [ __ ] and then we remember oh right we have to record and by that time we're usually pretty baked yeah yeah yeah it happens it does it's fun I guess that's kind of our appeal we're just like middle-age Stoner people yeah genx Stoners rambling about witchcraft weed and weirdness every Wednesday wow that's all Ed did you ever notice that I did just [Laughter] now it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft today the stoned Witch is hour is presenting a special wheel of the year episode litha 2022 the next notch on the wheel of the year that's right Shell's next Notch this is Midsummer or summer solstice this is the longest day and shortest night of the year and some people say that this is when the dark half of the year begins the light half ends and the dark begins to get longer and this is when the consort of the pregnant goddess the oak King gives way to the Holly King and so now she's got the she's got the daddy she's got the D she's got the the mature man to be there and she's ready to go into the dark half of the year with someone a little more mature and a little less capricious than the dude that she got pregnant with back on belain I'm just pissed I have to work I don't wanna it's like the longest day I should be at the beach I should be celebrating the solstice but I will be working part of the day is a good czen of the world and then we'll be celebrating after that yeah unfortunately not everyone recognizes the summer solstice as the wonderful holiday that it is should be federally recognized I mean come on everything is so Lush and abundant and beautiful who doesn't want to just go outside it's not screaming hot yet it's not cold it's just perfect I love it and you know honestly there are actually you know we can't always say this about some of the pagan holidays some of the sabbaths but this is another one where like cultures all around the world celebrate it in some form or fashion it's just somehow weird because pagans call it Letha I guess it's one of those big Celestial holidays that's easy to see you know and so our ancestors marked time based on this this is you know again the longest day actually like a big place to celebrate the summer solstice which one day before I die I am doing this and for any of our listeners that are that are across the pond you might think I am crazy for this being like a bucket list thing Stonehedge is the place to be on the summer I have heard that it's not all it's cracked up to be I still want to go I still want to see like the way the stones are set up the sun like shines right through certain points of it so actually there's always every year big huge Gatherings at Stonehedge that's like a big place to be I guess to celebrate the solstice in one I mean this the litha is another holiday where bonfires are a big thing I love fires there's something about fires that I love but it kind of gives that battle of light and dark but fires are also just cool it's true who doesn't love dancing around a bonfire I mean you kind of got to love that it's so much fun it it really is and you know there's there's something to be said for just being high and staring into a fire even if you're not dancing for sure and speaking of I'm going to get high shell and one of the other things that litha and the summer solstice are known for are the Fay yeah I think I might have some interesting stories for you shell and so we're going to play a little game of is it a ghost or is it the Fay and uh oh [ __ ] yeah so why don't you pack yourself a bowl and I'm going to tell you some fun little stories about the place I'm currently staying I'm smoking gg4 this week good choice by the way love gg4 love love love oh my goodness I'm smoking gorilla cookies OH Close yeah close very similar and I don't know what this honey is infused with but I'm also going to be eating this 100 milligram THC infused honey stick that'll be delicious a little honey for summer I always love honey to represent like the sun and the summer solstice and it's just anything with honey in it honey cake I just love it all I figured I'd finish this pipe I got packed right now but then surprise surprise I actually have a one gram pre-roll of Super Lemon Hayes another fave oh so I got this little pre-roll that I'll be I'll be jamming on here shortly as well well happy ch called this oh man what was it we call it a salad they called it had a bad word in it it was a wasn't schores Borg it was something else was like I still say salad so yeah whenever they're done with all their topshelf buds and trimming they take all the little teeny tiny buds that are left mix them all up together grind them and that's what they put in these I forget what they call them joints but they hard hitters really good and very tasty nothing beats of salad really those are the best ones you know I do that with Keef um when I grind up weed I I'll I'll just keep the Keef in a big container and my boyfriend will say oh what's that and I'll call I that's my salad Keef it's a salad I also salad my Keef as my Infamous breakout box that has the KE strainer on the bottom all I think about is the time you dumped it on the rug I know so sad so sad I have not dumped it since then just so everyone knows I do continue to break out my weed inside it because it has a screen bottom and so all the key transfers down to this little tiny tray also held on by magnets that we just kind of pull out and and I don't separate that you know we do keep one type of weed in there at a time but the Keef at the bottom just kind of we just let it pile up salad Keef it's fabulous all right so sh I've got some stories for you do tell do tell and at the end of this I need you to tell me ghost or fairy infestation oh Jesus okay so I stayed here in the uh in this particular location a few months ago for about a week and during that time I had two incidences that kind of bugged me like good bugged you or just annoyed bugged you annoyed bugged me keep going the first one okay so everyone has masks nowadays right oh I hate masks yeah and I have a mask that I was using it's it's a really nice one and I would always put it in the same place with my keys every time take my mask off keep it with my keys well well I go to go to the store happen to be visiting with my mother and my brother at the time and the mask is not there it had been that morning and we go to leave that afternoon and it's gone not anywhere to be found we searched everywhere we looked in the car we looked throughout the whole house we couldn't find it and you're a pretty organ you're a pretty organized person if you relatively organiz it's generally where you know you left it I I have ADHD I lose things so I've gotten in the habit of things have a place everything has a home so I know where it is otherwise my stoned ADHD ass is going to lose it all so I knew I'd put it there wasn't there grabbed a different mask go to the store come back the next morning I go with my brother in his car my mask is in his car I hadn't been in his car at all he hadn't taken it he was just as shocked as I was he's like is this your mask and he pulls it off the dash I'm like yeah it is how the hell did it get in your car no one knows and like you're not you don't have like little kids with you so it's not someone's tricking around with you like you're with all like adults exactly it was just me and my adult family I was not here with my kids who are teenagers also not small children so we're like okay whatever someone must have moved it I guess and forgotten so we go on with our lives couple days later I'm missing a credit card oh that pissed me off I was really pissed off again I knew exactly where it was because again I had have to be organized or I lose [ __ ] so I knew it was on top of the dresser where I had my money I had my money my change and my credit cards because I I don't always travel with all of my credit cards and ID sometimes I'm a stick it in my pocket person that's always driven me crazy about you by the way I know I know so I I have them right there so I can grab whatever credit card or money I need for the particular trip that particular credit card was not there was not anywhere to be found I would been heated I would have been angry I was so angry I thought I must have lost it at the store I had to have lost it at the store that makes you want to like call the credit card company and uh everything was bad it was under the bath mat in the guest bathroom huh I I don't know I don't know that's where it was so that incident the two of them together kind of made me go hm this is a little weird you know this is these are not normal places where you would think if you had lost something that they would end up but where you're staying is a very old place so honestly can you really sit here and ask me for my surprised face no no you can't so and that's why I'm saying it could be ghostly activity this house was built in the 1920s and several people have passed away in it several owners have died in this house so you're currently back in this house what's going on now I'm staying here with my whole family the first incident was I have a credit card that has a very small limit on it and it's the one that I let my kids use if they need to go somewhere shopping and I I'm not going with them it's kind of my SAFE credit card right mom I want something on Amazon right so I give them the tiny limit credit card so I give her my Safe Credit Card she goes over to where her computer is I see her set it on the table next to her computer and I go off and do something else she comes up to me a few minutes later and says Mom did you take that credit card I'm like no I I saw you set it down are you done with your purchase and she says no I didn't get to do it because the credit card's gone and I said I saw you set it right there your sister was there did she take it and she said no she saw me set it there too we can't find it we tore the whole house upside down she was in tears she was so upset that she had lost this credit card because this poor kid is probably thinking that you thought she took it and she's probably panicking yeah she's so sensitive I I trust her honestly I trust her with all my money but she was panicking we looked everywhere we couldn't find it we flipped Furniture up and down we looked under rugs nobody left the house nobody left the house nobody had gone anywhere so it's not like it could have like accidentally gotten lost in the driveway like it's there had to be in the house where did you find it the next morning my husband's getting the dishes to uh make breakfast it was in the sink in the dishes are you [ __ ] me I am not it get there's more I can just see his face right now and I can see him just being like Lea what the [ __ ] holding the credit card wet dripping with soap in his hand what the [ __ ] Lea my husband is a witch but he Wasing back a minute yes he is a very practical very scientific man and that doesn't make sense to him this made no sense did not compute and your kids were probably blaming each other she did actually they don't do that they're like best friends they would stick up for each other if my eldest said that the C had been there and walked off on its own the youngest would back her up 100% Apparently that is exactly what exactly what happened right out from under both of their noses what's next couple days later I am trying to find I wanted to remember the birthday of our we got a straight cat back in December he kind of ran to our house it was one of those few days in California where it was definitely getting below freezing at night and this cat when my daughter came home from work ran right up to her and my husband wanted in he was so sweet and so we let him in our garage for the night took him to the vet the next morning and he had a chip so we were so happy we're like Yay contact his people they never responded they didn't respond to the vet they didn't respond to the chip company oh here he comes now my little sweet boy and for all of our listeners out there if you'd like to go back to episode one and two where Ila talks about this cat and she plans on not keeping it and you go listen to that episode then fast forward to now I would never say that he is my boy I would never ever say that let's take this back to episodes one and two where Lela says this was a temporary assignment I'm sure I never said that never never so they didn't respond and uh that's sad that is sad it is sad but so I had this paperwork from the chip company so that we could transfer the chip without permission from the previous owners because it had been months and we kept trying to contact them they probably changed their phone number to be real there were two different emails and two different phone numbers and they didn't respond to any of them I was trying to be hurtful I I tried that too but I stopped a long time ago and you know hey yeah whatever but he's ours now and he's he's uh the chip is transferred anyway so I wanted I was looking for the paperwork I had made sure when we left to bring it with us because when you're traveling with animals you want to make sure you have all their paperwork right so I'm looking for this paperwork because I know it has his date of birth on it and I was like it's July something so I'm looking I'm looking I go through all our paperwork I go through the table the desk everywhere and I'm like ah I can't find it you know it's around somewhere I'll find it later so my husband starts packing a bowl and he goes hey and he picks up a random piece of paper that neither of us had seen unfolds it opens it up it's the [ __ ] paperwork for my cat there hadn't been paper it it it like randomly appeared on the table we had just gone over every single paper on that table how the [ __ ] did it get on that table I have no idea in front of your face was it did either of you leave the table like did this just appear in front of your face pretty much pretty much it was kind of like his laptop was on the table and a bunch of our smoking paraphenalia and I guess it was kind of I was standing and I should have been able to see it but he hadn't noticed it before until he reached to grab the bong and pack it and he's like oh hey there's a piece of paper here opens it up and it happens to be the exact paper I had just been looking for so it seems like they have up to this point been taking things from you your credit cards your face mask now they're giving you something yes there's a new twist so you said you had one more thing what else happened is this for a take it's both they took and then they gave kind of like with the credit card and the face mask so this particular time the whole familyes were going to go on a a sightseeing Adventure right and so we gather up all our stuff and and one of the things I grab is my glasses so I have my glasses on top of my head I get in the car and we go on down the road and we're talking and go to put my glasses on and they're no longer on my head and I'm like did I take my glasses off of my head did I put them in my bag like did anyone see my glasses and youngest child says yes they're on your head I said no they're not and she's like I just saw them and I'm like I did too but now I can't find them so I search in my seat I search everywhere in the car my bag the glove box the kids look under the seats can't find my glasses anywhere so I figure maybe I dropped them somehow but my youngest saw them on my head I knew they were on my head whatever I let it go the next day I'm unpacked packing a suitcase of things I have not worn since we left California to travel and I'm pulling out some shirts and talking to my husband and putting them away and I pull out a sweatshirt that I have not worn in weeks in the pocket of that sweatshirt that I just pulled out of a suitcase that I have just opened for the first time after having packed it and in the pocket of that sweatshirt are my glasses no [ __ ] no [ __ ] okay I flipped out I flipped out my husband's like well is that the one that it took to make you believe it like yeah yeah that's the one I already have a judgment here all right what's the Judgment I think you have a new friend and I think that friend is of the fairy persuasion because I just I know this is going to sound so silly to people who aren't like witchy people people but I just don't see a ghost following you in your car like they got better [ __ ] to do like your ghost is going to sit at home and wait for you to get back take your credit card and move it around the house okay you could be still riding the ghost line but things are happening away from your house when you're not on your property and I think you just have a little fa Spirit just following you around you got new friend I think this house has a lot of Fay activity and it's that kind of trickster fun annoying you're the type that it's going to attach to I blame that time that I played Queen yeah yep I remember that I I blame that time I oh I just got chills about it but thankfully it does not seem to be bad and I know the rules I know the rules I don't give them my name not my true name just a nickname and I don't say thank you when they give stuff back I'm like oh I'm so happy this is returned or what a wonderful thing to have happened you don't say thank you to the Fay that's one of the big rules are you leaving them anything yes absolutely so we've left we've left weed out back we've let left milk and cookies and honey you know all things that I think that they like now how about leaving them a little squirt of that little infused honey St oh do I H oh now I have to thanks sh I put it out there now I got to put a drop for the Fay I put it out there sorry of my infused honey I'm gonna okay I I have left a little drop here so that might save you a credit card incident right definitely not a ghost and and and the reason I say that is because it's happening when you're like the car incident put it over the edge not a ghost and I also say because of the time of year now I know it was earlier in the spring when I was first out here and there were some things that happened but litha is a known time for the Fay to be out and about and causing all sorts of Mischief it's one of the things that this particular holiday is known for so like shell said maybe leave a a little gift of food outside maybe some flowers a little bit of honey maybe a little bit of what you're smoking something don't say thank you but something to show that you appreciate them you know and that you're sharing space with them and that you're willing to hang out sometimes that acknowledgement is all it takes to saave off some [ __ ] exactly I'm just saying exactly I also think one of the things I love to do you know me I like to Garden not just weed but also flowers and herbs and things like that and I do love to build fairy houses they're a lot of fun you know especially if I have some pottery from a garden thing that I broke because who doesn't break you know your your garden [ __ ] what are those called pot pots pot Lea pot not the word pot garden pots break the ceramic garden pots and use those to make little fairy houses use spark use small little things around the house but they're a lot of fun and my kids and I used to like to gather bark and pine cones and leaves and make pretty little fairy houses outside you're way too crafty man I'm just I like to make things I like to make things I know I'm kind of a dork that way but it's one of the things that I I get solace in I have a lot of I have a lot of fun and it soothes me to make things but also as a Time crunched mom witch wedy woman of the world I can tell you that my litha celebration this year is probably just going to be a barbecue in the backyard and smoking a lot of weed with my hubby under the stars as we watch the longest day finally set because who has time really you know it's it's it's been a busy time um B been a busy time for me I'll probably be doing something Compact and short and sweet as well but speaking of just kind of going out into nature and and kind of having your ritual be so soaking it all in did you see that Strawberry Moon oh my goodness so gorgeous so beautiful it it it was here in Massachusetts it was huge absolutely huge and to watch it rise over the ocean good [ __ ] man good [ __ ] stunning and this is the time of year that I love to be outside at night camping in particular anywhere you can in or even in my backyard if that's all I can manage but the full moon on an early summer night can't be beat it's just lovely it's just fabulous smoke a bowl with your honey hang out with somebody that you love and get high get high on some strawberry Nana Oh my God is that stuff done growing yet almost done curing probably next episode I'll be smoking some straw Nana that sh recommended and I grew oh it's beautiful shell beautiful does it smell good does it look good it does smells sweet it looks green it's fabulous absolutely fabulous I cannot wait to show you you're going to love it see I do have good ide here people even if it's we I have good ideas they don't all all my ideas don't revolve around getting spooked and getting in trouble and getting the [ __ ] scared out of you although a lot of them do just your good ones all my favorite ones do now do you have any memories of litha rituals I remember this was one in our particular community that tended to be sparsely attended mostly because people were going to different festivals and different things all around the country and so our home group tended to get very small and what I liked about these rituals was kind of the the intimacy of it the the warmth you know everyone kind of hanging out and sharing food and and we were small enough that we were just kind of sit in that field around the bonfire maybe break bread and share a little bit of food before we did ritual sometimes we'd come up with it on the fly right there as the you know the Crickets and the birds are chirping and the sounds of summer are just kind of swelling all around us and you know those were really nice I liked those you know I think some of some of the best memories of litha that of rituals we've done really just kind of that not even the rituals themselves but just kind of that spending the whole weekend outside and that warmth and the fireflies that's the that's the one thing you know you you don't see fireflies until really Altha um at least in Northeast east east coast Woodland and that kind of adds to the whole fairy atmosphere too it does it it definitely adds to the Ambiance of it all so you know you're you're seeing those fireflies for the first time and you know I remember uh where the camping field was versus the ritual field there was kind of this wooded pathway and I remember we had like these these we called them fairy lanterns essentially they were just like tea lights and colored cup yeah I think the the red Solo cups only the the clear the clear different colored ones if you put a little candle in there you can make beautiful lights to line a path with very magical you really can and you call it a fairy path and damn it it is it looks like one remember we had mirrors hanging from like tree branches and just kind of you know you're walking down this like colorfully lit path at night this Wooded Path you got this candle lights flickering off these mirrors fireflies just kind of twiddling here and there and everywhere sometimes that right there is the ritual you know what I'm saying I I agree I completely agree just set and setting is so important and I think that's one of the things I love about group rituals because that can you can do so much to really get you in the space and and we've talked before about how you can be very high magic mathematical and precise with ritual and there is a place for that and it it has great power if you want to do it just by the right time and under the correct stars and using the perfect herbs and and drawing the perfect cils but there's also power in intention and set in setting is a huge part of that intention if you can make your whole atmosphere geared towards the fullness and richness of Summer and that that contentment that the goddess who is full with child from belain feels when she's with a God who is strong and steady and a partner to her and able to help carry this burden rather than a young man who's kind of capricious and flighty and not ready for that task you know you feel content in summer you've done all this work and now it's really starting to Blossom people are pulling things from their garden and giving them to their neighbors you're you're eating these fruits of the earth and you feel this abundance and this ripeness sitting in a field making FL crowns and you know things like that like litha is like the no pressure you know you've got your planting season your harvest season you know the winter rough season litha is just kind of to sit back and enjoy every damn bit of it it's the hay our coven did not come up with a litha ritual and we're all gonna sit around and eat good food and pass this bowl around and come up with a ritual and honestly looking back that was [ __ ] kickass that was perfect it was perfect there were times way back in the beginning when we were a little more formal with our coven and but we did that whole Battle of the oak king and the Holly king and you know that was great remember we had him use real swords that was pretty cool we did that was a beautiful ritual I loved seeing that played out it was a really cool thing it was and you know as much as that was great and very memorable and it was a very playaction kind of ual it's the times like walking down that path with those colored lights and those fireflies those are the things that resonate not so much when we orchestrated a ritual and did the actual Battle of the oak king and the Holly King like that was cool and all but what resonated was that walk down that path with those candles and the colored cups and the mirrors and the fir flies you know walking barefoot down that path that's what that's what resonates with you yeah and to get technical that's what sets your brain in the proper formation that's what that's what puts you in a magical State of Mind in order to set your intentions in order to do magic in order to create a spell you need to you need to hypnotize yourself you need to get your mind your body your soul and everything all in all in alignment all in this state of anything is possible and when it's Dusk and you're seeing those beautiful colored lights flickering down this gorgeous path Meandering through a dark Forest that you know is safe and you know is filled with wonderful people and there's happy voices chanting and there's flickering torches at the other end where the bonfire is and don't forget the creek on the side of the path the creek bubbling on the side of the path all these things all these people dressed in beautiful clothing wearing wonderful jewelry that mean something to them drumming drumming the drumming is so Primal all these things put you in a state statee where your intentions mean something the energy you put out into the world has weight and and meaning and that path was always also kind of considered a transition too from kind of normal camping area everyday area transitioning into ritual space so that that you know that path was also that transition but for anybody who knows what I'm talking about just to see and feel and all of this stuff as you're headed towards that was just that's what I think of when I think of great litha memories same and and to recreate that at home right now I'm disconnected from my my normal group and so I can't necessarily recreate that but what I can do is set that in my home there's incenses that I love that can put me in a meditative State because I've used them so many times for meditation or for ritual so if there's something that you love the smell of or if there's a candle that that flickers just the have you seen these new wooden wick candles I love them they flicker perfectly I have they're actually pretty cool by the way they're great know you you get yourself a couple candles you love an incense you love turn your lights off wrap up in a in a blanket or or something soft that you like I I don't know just set set the stage in your own home go to your backyard go to a place where the moon shines perfectly you know set that up a little bit for yourself it doesn't have to be elaborate it can be very small and smoke your weed sit down with your pipe and and do it with intention and and think about the things that you have set in motion earlier this year the things you know you want that hot girl summer you want that job this summer you want that relationship or the things that are going to come to fruition this summer think about those while you're smoking your joint and relaxing next to your candle and yeah and and you know you can also take a little bit of time and kind of meditate on the light in the dark going on within yourself and and around you oh I love that that battle between the oak king and the Holly King the young God and the old God within each of us we all have that fight between between capriciousness and responsibility and for some reason this is like a big hand fasting ritual time you'd think it'd be belane but actually statistically more people get handfasted um at litha I like that because belain is when you're [ __ ] your brains out and you're you're checking each other out hormone are running rampant you're you know you're you're running around you're having a good time and then as the season goes on settling you're you start to settle into it you get more serious things start to be you know hey it was all fun and hormones at belan now it's serious you know in the goddess's case she had she's fully pregnant with a child and hopefully not in your case unless that's what you want but you know the relationships have matured at this point at least magically and also you know not that I'm because this is a whole another podcast but not that I'm an advocate necessarily of some heavy duty love magic but this is also a time where people tend to do love magic I don't have a problem with love magic If It's Love magic flirting If It's Love magic you will fall in love with me then don't do that [ __ ] that's awful that's just as bad as coercing someone which by the way that's super shitty and a lot of levels and it always backfires in your face so the disclaimer is don't do love magic man it's it's just just let things happen those are the real loves do self love magic do I love myself do I'm happy with myself this is a great time to do magic to help find love for yourself it can also be to to put it out there hey if there's someone who is compatible with me and who would have a not a specific person but make a list of what you like oh [ __ ] one Practical Magic remember I'm Practical Magic that movie where she made a list of all the things she wanted in a guy and then there he was and the petals floated down on him when he was a child I L that part that kind that kind of love magic I'm down with where you just you know if the universe will bring me someone that I could totally completely love who would totally completely love me okay I'm down with that but if you're doing rituals to make John Smith make you love you make him love you more than anything in the world not cool not cool I've only ever done two love magic spells in my entire life and one of them I was with you and it was this time of year and the other one I was uh I had just moved to the area it was just before I met you I believe and so I had done this magic spell have you ever seen those origami boxes where you could make like a box out of paper yeah I think it's called like a water bomb or something yeah so what I had done is I had taken a square piece of paper and I wrote all the things out that I was hoping for in a companion and and I tried to be pretty realistic you know and and so I wrote qualities that I was hoping for in this perfect person for me and turned it into a box an origami box and as I'm in this ritual space I filled it with my incense that I had chosen to do my love spell with and one of the ingredients was ground hemp seeds and I had done that because the marijuana plant I think you have a deck where the 10 of Cups it is the the um tarot of herbs or the herbal tarot but yes 10 of cups is the marijuana 10 of cups is the marijuana card and and that was one of the things I was thinking about as I put these hemp seeds in there for stability for earthiness you know for the groundedness of of that and for the Happy Family the hemp 10 of Cups happy family card that's right so ground hemp seed was one of the ingredients in the incense that I had put together and I had this charcoal incense burner so I took the whole paper that I had written my attributes on and turned into an Origami square doing you know ritually the whole whole time the whole night like I said sometimes High magic has a place and so I put in all these herbs that were carefully selected and I set my paper with the herbs on it on top of the charcoal and of course tons of smoke which I had expected and had prepared for and so I'm doing my spell in this whole ritual and it's kind of burning nicely and then all of a sudden that [ __ ] exploded pow pop pow all I could think of was that maybe I hadn't ground the pot seeds enough or something because it kind of was exploding like like seeds in a bowl like popcorn yeah like popcorn and uh so it kind of explodes all over the place and I'm putting out Embers everywhere and I figure well did that spell kind of [ __ ] went up in Flames literally I feel like I know I feel like I know what relationship led to that I wasn't in a relationship at that time I was just kind of looking for maybe I had just ended the relationship you're thinking of so I figured either it wasn't time or something was wrong with the spell fast forward a few years as told in my belaine episode I had fallen in love at first sight with a gentleman that you had brought to our belain ritual love him I do love him he's wonderful so we were going to do all of us a ritual a big ritual actually and to prepare for the ritual we were doing um a sweat so we were going to a sweat lodge on this sacred land and this new guy that I had been with since Bel was with us and you and I were walking down this path and I started picking some blossoms off the trees I got grabbed a few apple blossoms I grabbed a few lavender blossoms I got a couple other things and and as we were walking I started to do a spell and I remember you cautioned me you're like be careful and I'm like I know I'm not doing a spell to trap him this spell is not a love spell to hold him this is a spell if this is meant to be let it work out help us to make it work it was more of a If this relationship is good for both of us and if it's meant to be help us make it work and so I gathered these different flowers and a couple herbs From the Path as we walked down to the sweat and I mixed them together and when we all went into the sweat I put them in with uh on the coals you know with the sweat herbs as we all go through here and so I had done this spell uh and again this type of love spell was not make him love me or make me love him it was if this is meant to be if it is good for both of us help it to work out and so he jokes sometimes that he's still with me because I Put a Spell on him but it wasn't really that kind of love spell and you cautioned me you saw what I was doing and you're like hold on this better not be a love spell and I'm like no no it's not that kind of love spell at all and and I let you go because I figured you know what you were doing but you know I've done the same I I actually same thing I've done it twice and one time I I was I was I'll admit it I was trying to make somebody love me and you said we've all it you said and I remember you saying yeah should you be doing this and I'm like I know what I'm doing and and and you let me go and in the end it crashed and burned and and I think the love spell is probably what made it torturous and last so long yeah maybe if you hadn't done that it might have ended a little little cleaner or a little sooner and that's unfortunately the price that you pay it's shitty when magic Works guys so yeah no I I tortured myself been there done that you warned me I didn't listen but you know good friend you let me run my course sometimes honestly and and I could have worked a little harder to stop you I could have but honestly it wouldn't have worked because we know you yeah there's no way I was going to stop you and so sometimes in order to let shell do what needs to be done you to let her go but I wouldn't be a good friend if I hadn't pointed that out to you we're honest with each other but is that was crashing and burning you know same thing I kind of put it out there to the universe I was just like Jesus Lord could I ever find something is that really the god that you called I mean for a love spell that's your first choice all right I mean supposedly he did have a great relationship with Mary Magdalene but other than that I don't think he's would be my choice for a love spell but no I I I did put it out there that you know it it would be nice for something to actually be legitimate and work out for once and sure as [ __ ] fell right on my lap immediately you know it's almost like but I wasn't directing it towards a person which was my issue the first time the first time unfortunately when you directed at a person you're just gonna [ __ ] yourself in the end people it's like us a Ouija board yes right that's right that's right like you warned your son in our super secret Gavin episode if you uh hold on I'm packing a bowl and apparently I can't do two things at once I'm Stone enough that I need to take all my concentration to pack this bowl of my my uh gorilla cookies yummy yummy gorilla cookies anything with gorilla in it always so hard love that stuff I I've got the gg4 right now which is the Gorilla Glue yum say yum I heard that they call it Gigi now because uh the actual makers of Gorilla Glue were having an issue which I guess say I blame them but I mean oh come on really I mean honestly you're either talking about glue that's going to stick something together for all eternity or marijuana how do you confuse those things right obviously two different things to the owners of Gorilla Glue I do apologize you do have a good product but I like Gorilla Glue weed thank you right exactly so I think possibly what happened to you and I had kind of done something right before I met my soulmate I had done a releasing ritual and I had actually done a lot of work on myself and trying to find that s before s before that beltine I had done a releasing ritual to kind of let things go and work on myself you know TR find that love Within Myself and I think that's kind of what happened to you when you did that spell to bind that person to you and then it crashed and burned you really got down to a point where you were trying to build yourself back up and and you you then kind of went about it you learned a lesson you know and you then kind of went about it the right way and and instead of trying to force something you like I want something that's good for me I want something a relationship that's going to be good for me and that person and no [ __ ] [ __ ] that happened big time and and I think the universe is waiting for us to do that sometimes to kind of do that work to do that soul searching whether it takes me being a crybaby for years and then finally working through that [ __ ] or if ites makes you crashing and burning in a bad relationship to learn that [ __ ] however we learn that we kind of need to focus on ourselves and what's good for us and and not what we think we want I guess and that's something that it you know to kind of circle back to litha that's that's something good to work on in litha the light and dark within you and within your life you know work on that inner balance it is supposed to be the the longest day of the year work on the heaviest Light Within you you know it it it it is that time to just take a minute where are you where do you want to be you know you don't you don't just reflect at the New Year where you're at and where you want to be you need to reflect that throughout the year if you want to make progress you know that's where where these these little ticks in the wheel of the year come in you know you might spend six weeks not thinking about you in stretches spend that one day spend that one Sabbath you know do some inner work think out your inner self for a few minutes you know meditate do what you do do what makes you happy but just do that little work you know everybody's got an hour and I love that too that you brought it back to litha because this is the perfect time of year to do that litha gives you the time to do that because you're you're not working on planting something you're not harvesting this is the fullness this is the ripeness this is the time to slow down and enjoy the beach and and and take that time to kind of look within yourself and and take up like you said the light in the dark parts of yourself and kind of you know just take a little minute we don't always like what we see you know we're not always happy with that and now can be a great time you know everything outside is so easy and full and sweet now can be an okay time to kind of clear out the cobwebs inside you know it's bright enough outside to face the dark within a little bit you know and and it kind of can be comforting to take care of those things like we did a sweat and it was wonderful go into the dark and then come back out into the Light Of Summer and kind of enjoy that nice long summer day or you know if you need to meditate on your troubles meditating about your troubles on while you're laying on the beach it's not a downer I'm just saying and meditating on your troubles while you're watching your joint smoke Trail up into a nice blue sky definitely helps lighten the load and there's something about the Stars this time of year I don't know maybe I just don't like being cold and I don't go out in the cold too much and look up but I feel like this time of year there are freaking Stars everywhere just sitting outside at night and just looking up some beautiful [ __ ] man TR it's gorgeous get out to a park go camping no matter where you are in the country there's got to be someplace close to you where you can get outside in nature a little bit go up on the top of your building see some Stars it's fabulous we love it for litha it's so good and I have a thing I want you to do shell okay what it's a it's a quiz notice I don't even question you I'm like okay you're just like okay what I love that I love that so much about you so this is a quiz nothing nothing scary it's to find out what Goddess you are okay okay so o I'm interested I did it earlier so I'm gonna give you the quiz and we'll see what goddesses we are okay okay okay this quiz is from Soul and Spirit magazine and it's called which goddess are you so let's start off with the all essential crystals which one resonates with you the most shell rose quartz Emerald Moonstone or Jasper Emerald Beau beautiful I think I said Moonstone now pick your favorite element air fire water or earth oh this is so hard because in different aspects I like them all I know this one's so difficult ah shitty I'm gonna go with fire fire fire fire fire fire which of these locations would you find yourself most at peace at on a beach watching a sunset fill the sky with beautiful Hues of pink yellow and red deep with in a forest shrouded by a foggy Mist sitting in a field looking up at the full moon Meandering through a desert with the sun beating down upon you oh why are these such hard choices they are I want to do all of them oh my god um oh the witch in me says the freaking foggy Forest damn it but the beach is so hard Beach foggy Forest H they're both you they're both forest all right which would you say is your most desirable personality trait your huge heart and warm loving personality how down to earth and calm you are I almost couldn't finish that with a straight face my connection and understanding of animals all creatures great and small how protective I am over my friends family and loved ones I'll go with the fourth one yeah protective that's so you yes are you trying to say I'm not Meek and Mild oh shell oh shell Meek and Mild have never been words anyone would describe you with all right what would you say is your least desirable personality trait I'm sure you've got one you have to think about it all right is it your vanity and concern what others think of your appearance oh Lord sometimes acting without thinking about how your actions will affect others well there's that can you sometimes be a sore loser occasionally or your tendency towards a fiery temper oh boy two and four those are hard I'd say I'd go with number four the fiery temper we know how I can get we do we know how you are shell we love it you are you are the best advocate for the people that you love and causes you believe in you are amazing for anything like that you need a bulldog on your side man I got you right right you're right there okay which of these activities sounds the most fun to you creating an apothecary of love potions filled with the most fragrant scents o right see this one was really hard walking around barefoot in nature in order to get back in touch with Mother Earth nice right meditating under a sky filled with stars and a bright glowing New Moon I'd have to look and wouldn't be able to meditate but okay wait a bright glowing New Moon the new moon is dark how is it springing bright okay I call Shenanigans on this whole quiz but we're gonna say bright glowing full moon okay okay dancing to let my mind body and soul feel free and uninhibited I don't know I'm getting a little old and crickety I said all of them I'm like how do I pick all of these if I have to pick one I'm gonna be making potions love that love that all right I just made some potions the other day I made a I made a batch of can butter all right shell pick a spirit animal a dove cat snake or shark a kitty kitty that's your animal for sure I love kitties which scense is the most comforting to you out of the following smelling the gentle saltiness of Sea Mist feeling the crunch of leaves underneath you as you walk through nature these are going to be hard choices damn it right the sight of A Sky Full of Stars feeling the warm glow of the Summer Sun hitting your skin so hard Warm Glow Summer Sun if I couldn't pick the beach before I have to pick something beachy now there you go okay calculating your results shell o oh boy you oh my shell who Am I who Am I who Am I who am i p no [ __ ] really no [ __ ] Hawaiian mythology's volcano goddess p is an all powerful deity and can be utilized utilize P I don't think so no no she utilizes you right right um You can maybe work with her if she lets you for your own magic and spellwork I don't know if you remember this but that's kind of funny because I don't know like maybe 20 years ago or so we did a ritual and I actually embodied P for that rual yes you did now my goddess is Isis oh inter yeah a cult figure whose Legend has survived thousands of years often referred to as the one who is all Isis is a lunar deity also associated with magic and healing now I would just like to say that for everybody out there who thinks that magazine polls are a bunch of [ __ ] normally I would agree with you totally and they're usually just fun but these were kind of spoton these were like totally spoton calculations because knowing these goddesses and knowing how Leila and I are totally paylay in Isis like no joke that was SP and I do find it interesting that these are both goddesses you and I have both called upon on exactly for a ritual and I have not called on P and I don't know you may have called on Isis or Anana I'm not sure um no I think that I think just in that chant that ch um Isis inana estarte HEC demer Kali Anana again yeah that's the only time ever but yeah no the P thing not a shocker yeah no not not at all not at all neither was Isis actually I was a little surprised but thinking about it that's that's pretty true to who I am right now so you know that the thing that's kind of funny is um I actually changed my background on Zoom today and it's a v very like P type environment that Hawaiian [Laughter] beach the summer solstice is a wonderful time to just sit back be good to yourself I guess indulge yourself a little bit and play with a fay play with the [ __ ] don't forget that they're fun play with them nicely and make sure to dismiss them when you're done treat them just like you would Santa Claus give them give them treats there you go give them what the [ __ ] was that my phone oh God that scared the hell out of if I get like one more EVP from your side of the freaking recording I am going to lose my [ __ ] I have two of them I haven't looked them up but I have two different EVPs from you so the one still freaks me out the dude answered scaffolding and it still trips me out well you got to remember you know I am kind of in a very old location you are you are in Salem Massachusetts and I might have Fay around me at this place I'm currently staying I got all kinds of [ __ ] around me you have all kinds of [ __ ] over there so it does not surprise me I'm not going to ask them to say something on the tape because I know they will and that'll just make me ship bricks when I'm editing so I'm not going to do it I do want to just point out you know like some other things that are are related to litha things that I kind of I kind of get into a little bit colors I'm big on colors sometimes you can just kind of acknowledge something or celebrate something with colors so with litha like green and red and orange and yellow and white like all those summery colors you know if you act like the season you'll feel the season does that make sense it really does you know sunflowers there's a crazy thing like I love sunflowers I love buy yourself yeah go buy yourself a vase of flowers like Trader Joe's or Price Chopper or Wegman's or Whole Foods get yourself a vase of flowers sometimes if that's all you can do it is good enough I'm the [ __ ] who loves dandelions I would totally let dandelions grow in my yard oh I totally would because I think they're fabulous and da and daisies yes I am the wild yard person daisies are considered a weed and that has always kind of pissed me off on some weird level since I was a kid no I have no problem with weed of any kind but the other thing that that I'm kind of heavy on is Stones like Crystals and Stones I love your collection yet another collection of shells that we should go over sometime I have way too many collections people but like you know I'll carry like an emerald or a jade or like a topaz or a citrine my pocket or something just little things like that you know sometimes it's more about your intention than about did you do some like big elaborate like High magic dressed in robes ritual sometimes it is going to be as simple as chucking this little rose quartz in my freaking pocket you know exactly I'm going to talk about this more on our next uh weekly podcast but we recently broke down in New Mexico right near White Sands actually I'm not laughing at you it's okay no go ahead and laugh what's the how's that song go 100 bad days make a 100 great stories right it's so true anyway there happened to be a labyrinth right near where we were and at the center of this Labyrinth were stones that had been printed with different words and phrases on them and stuff and and so just doing the Labyrinth was an amazing meditative experience for me but we took a stone and I also bought this little turquoise bear this little guy right here I like that he looks like he's a guy who's all packed up for traveling right he's this little turquoise bear and he's got some turquoise and I'm not sure if that's Abalone or what that shell what that stone is but that's cool he looks like a little bear that's ready to go for travels right he called to me I knew that this was my traveling bear so we got this bear and the Stone from the center of the labyrinth and just like you said those were our Talis for the rest of our trip to to be safe and it really was from that point on things really turned around and started to go in a better Direction I don't think that turquoise has anything to do with Journeys but the fact that he was a bear a little turquoise bear we're coming from California which the symbol is the bear and this one is packed up for a journey just those things were enough to tell me that this bear was my journey bear it wasn't necessarily about the type of stone it was carved out of it was more about the intention that stone and it was being open to that feeling as I walked into this shop in the town that we were stuck in he was one he's tiny he's about the size of a nickel and he was the first thing that I saw on the shelf and out of a whole huge store out of a whole huge store of beautiful beautiful locally made items this one sang to me and I knew that I had to have him and so being open to that energy and knowing that this was a Talisman that I needed regardless of what turquoise means what does turquoise mean anyway at that point in your trip I can vouch for you you needed a damn Talisman I needed a freaking Talisman and people were asking me they're like what can we do for you guys is there something that we can do for you and I said send good travel energy and I felt it we felt it and we sent it we knew you guys definitely did that so turquoise is it's balances and aligns your chakras it gives inner calm and it helps to prevent panic attacks and depression so I guess we kind of needed that at the time but it it dispels negative energy so I guess you could say that for our trip we needed negative energy dispelled but he doesn't really have anything to do with travel turquoise doesn't have anything to do with that so the intention was there because you could just see what it meant and it worked like you always say the intention is really the purpose it's really what need you need to have that feeling if you can align yourself you can have your brain and your emotions aligned for an intention that's the way things will go once you get all of that in alignment things tend to go smoothly intention is 90% of the battle folks yep any parting wisdom on litha I say just sit at the beach make flower crowns call it a day oh I love the make flower crowns part definitely get outside get outside try to do something um go to a local farmers market but find something that has been crafted with intention crafted with someone's hands that makes you happy what whether that be an eggplant that was grown by your local farmer or gorilla cookies grown by your local cultivator or if it was a a cute little piece of jewelry made by somebody you know find something that was locally crafted that kind of makes you feel good and makes you happy I don't know the [ __ ] where I'm going with this does marijuana count absolutely because see my marijuana here is grown locally so technically I'm buying locally so does that count it does totally does yeah so I don't know just find something get out and find something that makes you happy go for a walk go to the woods I don't know I think the key here is just remember to take a minute for yourself you know even if you only got 10 minutes 15 minutes if you've got an hour or an afternoon or a whole day rock on with your bad self but if you've only got 10 or 15 minutes even if you've got to go hide in the bathroom away from the kids just take a few minutes and just kind of think about yourself reflect on yourself for just a minute or just take a minute to just breathe and appreciate what's around you in the moment you know I really like litha for self-love I love that you say that like we were talking earlier about doing love spells and people getting hand fasted and this is a great time for that but it's also a really good time to just pour that love onto yourself like you said go to the beach Because You Love It Go go someplace that makes you happy if that's the library if that's a museum if that's a cafe or a bar I don't know take some time for yourself do that inner inner reflection do a little meditation get your nails done if you're in a big city here's an idea take yourself out for a date go out and have a damn drink and something to eat by yourself um no shame and going out by yourself go out and treat yourself whether you're in a relationship or not take some time for you especially if you're in a relationship take some time to love on you and and just kind of enjoy the slow down you know we work too damn hard a lot of us have side hustles we have two jobs we're taking care of a house and kids and and a relationship and a job or School we're taking care of all these things and we forget to take care of ourselves take a little time for you do something that you love you know be happy in yourself slow down just remember technically it's the first day of summer how can that be bad it is the first day of the rest of Summer I love that and there's so much it's just stretch ing out hopefully maybe this summer will be like the Summers when we were kids remember summer when we were kids when it seemed to stretch out for a million years it was just so big and there was just a perfect time to be lazy and ride your bike and just do fun things and summer felt like it was never going to end yeah but I didn't have to work then I have to work now that's the biggest difference but I I hope everybody gets at least one day that's just wonderful and fulfilling and where you feel happy and you can just kind of enjoy it for yourself so for litha what I hope for you is abundance and I don't know lots of love lots of weed happiness just be happy just be warm think of yourself and I don't know buy a double chocolate chip muffin that day o right oh the stoned witches say you have permission I say buy that top shelf weed and smoke it all yourself it's yours go for it that get that good good that you haven't gotten everybody we want you to stay high stay witchy and happy litha everyone happy litha and we'll see you next time on the stoned Witches Hour peace out later
