opposite I'm so glad my my podcast Persona comes across as having it all together I got y'all fooled I had to laugh because I'm like are you kidding me because I'm usually the one with like all this [ __ ] written down and I got notes and I got you know websites up I've got things planned out five months in advance and then oh yeah Lea's the organized one I'm like yikes We're The Odd Couple sh I'm telling you we're The Odd Couple and I just seem like I'm the anal retentive got it all together and that's why we love you that's right that's right I just pretend speaking of being all giggly and high and silly what on Earth are you smoking tonight I am smoking the best [ __ ] I have had in a while my sweet husband happened to go up to a dispensary in Riverside shout out to Empire Gardens which we love because you know it's kind of a call back to uh New York City New York State the Empire State it's hard to escape it there's no escaping that New York State of Mind right it's a mentality that's right but yeah so he picked up something called black triangle OG which is an indic dominant oh so freaking good this would be right up your alley shell what's what's the T content I got it all are you ready for this one what what what what what this is a mule kick to the forehead drop you to your knees make you start drooling and forget your own name 34% THC and that's what I call a good Friday night I've just started smoking it and it is gassy talk about gasoline you get that I'm pumping up my gas summertime and that the gas smell smacks you in the face I'm pumping up my who P what do you pump down your gas too that's right Pump It Down pump it up pump it sideways I don't know I don't know you get that gas smell in your face you don't know what you're doing but yeah I know it smells it taste like same as it smells um I would not say this is a fruity or a green this has kind of got that um if you want the mule kick you're not getting the good C taste is that what you're saying I don't mind a gassy taste I I don't mind that I don't mind that sharp kind of smell and taste it's not my favorite like this is not one that I would smoke just for smoking just for the taste and Aroma alone I mean I like gas it's good A lot of people like the smell of gas who doesn't you laugh but you know you do so it's it's good um the the I I forgot what were we talking about 34% THC that's about where I'm stuck I have gone back to one that I like I was able to find it again endgame this [ __ ] is good this [ __ ] is good remember last time I did endgame I think it was a two-hour episode because I didn't stop talking and we love the episodes where you keep talking that's fantastic how's it what's endgame like how do you liking it very up I I think I've said this before it's one of those you can kind of manipulate so I'm kind of manipulating it into the upy fashion but once we end here and are done for the night I will probably smoke a whole bunch more and kind of year more towards melting to my bed nice nice that sounds really good and I think that's as the episode goes on I know I'm going to get more and more High because I can feel it already cocooning my body in joy and Bliss I'm I know how you are so I do have to ask is this being topped off with any bubble hash or no maybe maybe it's possible you know you you think with a 34% THC that I would not go bigger go go bigger go hey hey you know it's a good night I'm happy it's yeah there's a little there's a little awesome sauce on the top yes you know me so well oh boy you know it it's sometimes it's hard to switch from giggly giggly to like Paranormal True Crime tonight sh okay actually you sober me right the [ __ ] up because yeah [ __ ] you just I know I'll smoke another bong after this but you just reminded me the topic I'm not going to get into it yet but I am going to put a um a disclaimer out there while we're at the beginning I am doing True Crime this evening and this one's a tough one this one's really rough so I'm going to tell you right now I'm going to talk about a sexual deviant who's a killer and who has also killed children oh so this is a tough one there's a lot to this episode so I'm going to tell you right now you do need a loved one you do need the higher THC weed and and be in be in a comfy space if you're going to listen to this episode for real because it's it's a rough one and as as it could be a total trigger warning for some folks if you have trauma issues related to those topics we would not be upset at all if you ski this episode yep absolutely skip this one you know find another episode we've got a lot we've got a lot that are interesting we do talk about some heavy topics and we try to resp them as best we can and we try to lighten it up and make it a little more palatable as best we can but sometimes sometimes you can't you there's no lighten it up to it to some things no no and I'm not going to sugarcoat something that's serious just for the sake of of a laugh so but yeah skip this one if you need to it's a tough one otherwise buckle up [ __ ] cuz it's going to get absolutely scary I'm going to talk about a haunted bridge little less deep sounds very interesting though I love me a good haunted Bridge a covered bridge even better o now those have gotten quite the reputation I I wasn't there a movie or something that kind of catapulted covered bridges into I don't remember Bridges of Madison County I don't know it could be I maybe I don't know but covered bridges are cool covered bridges are super super cool but before we jumped into the covered bridges and the true crime and the ghosty ghosties and the horrible people of the world I did want to kind of talk about some witchy stuff first yes yes definitely I mean with Salem just Salem I'm so ready to go see you I'm so ready with sa and Salem right around the corner I am so into the witchy things we mentioned last episode that we've both kind of been getting back into our witchy magical Groove this year and I really do feel like it's kind of ramping up I kind of feel that energy now um as the seasons are just starting to think about changing you know that kind of brings up something I wanted to to just briefly discuss tonight obviously we could do like eight full podcasts on this one topic let's talk about covens versus solitaires because you know witchcraft paganism wiah the whole kitten Kaboodle it's exploding every day that goes by it's blowing up even more it seems and there are people everywhere there are Facebook groups everywhere Instagram Pages everywhere about all of these topics some people feel like you're not a witch if you're in a coven some people feel like if you tell anybody and get in a coven you're you're you're know you know you're gonna burn at the stake like let's chat about coven versus Solitaire and and maybe we can touch on how we've faded in and out of both of those Realms throughout our times you actually when you said that uh oh [ __ ] I'm high you said um I have said that people people's perceptions about coven versus Solitaire and that that triggered a um a memory do you remember or were you ever subjected to people telling you that you couldn't be a witch unless you were initiated by a coven or initiated by another witch yes yes and people believe that and people did I think that was kind of perpetuated by like the Garian tradition where they would have a man initiated a woman and a woman would initiate a man big sex let's not go there but there's there's things to that I'm not going to knock that type of tradition because there it is definitely valid that's not the only tradition it's not the only tradition exactly and and that's what we talked about before one of the things that you and I were both attracted to in this religion is that we can express ourselves in in multiple ways and now I am as white as white can be I have zero history like with like I'm not Celtic I'm not I'm not a viking I'm not I'm not a hereditary witch I'm pretty much a mut I have no idea that's right I'm Leila I have no ancestry to fall back on and I have started actually getting into working with my personal ancestors but I don't really have like a a claim to any particular type of religion but I do like them all I do like studying them I like I like learning about them I'm interested in them and I think that being being able to do that being able to to search and to to admire and to honor all these different Traditions is one thing that that we really enjoyed but you know I and and I totally agree with you but there's also the perspective of sometimes it's nicer to just do some of these things with other people it's almost like some people find it more validating somehow it's a crack of [ __ ] if you're doing it by yourself but all of a sudden it's it means something if you're with a group of people and then there's also that that myth that it has to be a coven of 13 like who came up with that you know we could do a whole episode on the weird different myths that we have heard coming up through this but yeah the the idea that you have to be initiated by another Witch is is bunk I think pretty much if you ask almost any witch I'm not going to say all cuz we are pretty pretty varied but if you ask any witch how do you become a witch they're going to tell you say you're one yeah you know if if you want to be a witch say you're a witch repeat after me I am a witch I am a witch there you go but now I was actually formally initiated and it was this wonderful thing and I am very glad I did that was it necessary no ceremony is beautiful absolutely and and Bond memory but was it like a hard and fast requirement absolutely not no by the time I did an actual initiation I had met another person um I was in college and had met another person who was seeking and had just started to to learn about Witchcraft and and we did a a ritual together where we each kind of dedicated ourselves to this path and did an initiation so I did not get an initiation into a into a into the religion from someone else but my initiation is just as valid and just saying you're a witch is just as valid if this is something that you're interested in if you're learning about it you know that's all you have to do you can't say necessarily that you're part of a specific tradition if that tradition requires an initiation by another person I could not say that I am a Garian Wiccan because I have not been initiated into Garian Wiccan Traditions that's not respectful right right you know you should respect the different tradition so so saying that you're a witch is perfectly fine but you know if if the tradition itself requires an initiation that's a little bit different Rando question if you had to pick what do you prefer do you prefer to be a part of a coven or to be solitary yes yes yes um I like them both for different reasons I loved when we were a coven when we were part of circle amarat I loved that I loved that we had a blast and we did great things we did and it it was beautiful it was our rituals amazing magical memorable some of the most fabulous rituals I have ever been a part of were rituals that we did as a coven or rituals that we LED as a coven and the magic of those people I I'm sending love out to them all right now because miss those people I miss those Souls wonderful people and we were a good group we we had a good vibe we really did and so that's a fabulous thing to do and to have and I was lucky we were lucky to have that and in solitary has its own set you can do your own thing you can do whatever you want you don't have to fight with your coven mate about the wording of diplomacy doesn't factor into solitary work that's right and I would be doing our covenant disservice if I didn't talk about all the times we argued right absolutely absolutely in my living room I was there it was rough yeah you were there and you were there and you were there and you were there but yeah that was but that was all a part of what made the dynamic right yes because we weren't just yesing each other we were challenging each other we were asking each other to be better to do better to I don't know to work better together to to help uplift the community and also I think it's it's it's important to point out that our cin was very eclectic so different people brought different Traditions to the table part of that experience was maybe learning about a different tradition or a different way of doing things that you may not have come across before so kind of that eclectic group made us all better it did and and being accepting of that like how often do you see a coven that has so many different Traditions all working beautifully Blended together and what what were we at the absolute most maybe nine or t people that sounds about right I'd have to count and math is not my strong suit at the moment but yeah I would say about that I'd say no more than 11 you know we never had 13 people and we were a Fab coven so that 13 thing Pasha also a myth also a myth so coven has its advantages in that you can tap into the knowledge of the other people into the vast experiences of other people but you're also tied down to a schedule and I think that's kind of what did Us in at the end as we all got pulled in different directions work and family and children and just life in general because it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of work to make a coven work and and we in particular were trying to also put work back into our community to to bring awareness of witchcraft in paganism and bring more acceptance so we were trying to be as loud and out as possible that's a lot of work we weren't just doing rituals we were also trying to be a voice and Advocate as well ultimately and researching for speaking speaking engagements going to different festivals to present you know that it takes a lot and we work together we all worked beautifully together through all of it and and I like to think that we would still we got together oh God wouldn't that be so freaking would that not be amazing if we all got together omat reunion oh amarat reunion oh your voice to the goddess's ears it that would be fantastic write down to bring an up from New York City everyone it would have to be everyone it would have to be all of us now interesting point I would like to point out you would think you moved to Salem Massachusetts home of all the witches of the world you'd think you'd come here and that you would just infiltrate yourself into into something yes I was totally expected a coven to steal you away from me you know that's a myth you're not doing ritual every day on your lunch break well solitary ritual but with other witches no like it's it's very it's it's not you know and if we have anybody from Salem listening to this if you think I am wrong Reach Out by email the stoned Witches Hour gmail.com because I am totally having a different experience if you disagree with me like very closed off and not they don't like Outsiders that unfortunately the feeling I get it's the feeling I get no one's told me that no one has said that to my face but they don't acknowledge you either so they'd have to act actually acknowledge you to say that to your face like it's it's very not what you would think like I almost feel like I had an easier time infiltrating the Pagan community in Upstate New York like how weird is well that Community is very permeable that Community is very welcoming as closed off as they are and as secretive as they are they're very welcoming compared to a lot of them well I'm finding that out and I'm actually kind of taking a back a because it's 2020 and you know we're witches here people get over it and be I am in Salem Massachusetts why is this difficult why how it baffles me I don't know what to say about it I think that would get to another myth that I believe is true covin and practicing groups can be clannish and closed off and I think that's mostly true generally I do find that to be true and that can be for a lot of different reasons and first and foremost is protection I think around here it's a lot of you know if any of you out there live in a tourist town no matter what your tourism is like tourists for the love of God like I feel bad because I was a tourist at one point now that I'm not whoa I'm sorry to every place I've ever been a tourist I'm sorry you know and I think that that maybe some of the closed offness is because of the tourism yeah they have to protect themselves because anybody can be in in town for a few months renting an Airbnb or whatever right right you know and now you get some wannabe joining your coven that's not going to be there forever might not have the best intention I imagine that they've had bad experiences in the past so protection is probably and and also you know I'm in in the situation I'm in how many people not that that's why I came here absolutely not but how many you followed your heart I did but how many people just random mve to Saleem Massachusetts a lot more than you'd think so even because you've just moved here from another area doesn't necessarily make them accepting of you either right right it is it's probably one of those places where you know kind of local Trump ball so Lori cat if you and any of your people are out there listening I am waiting email me I will show up tomorrow let's do this I'll do basic spellwork I'll grind herbs I'll I'll chalk Out Lines I'll write sigils for real for real I'm there call me let's do this I'll do your basic hexes I'll do your little love spells just let me in the door bye but you know we we we had our coven for for a bunch of years and we did a lot of stuff but you know we've kind of a after that dissolved we've probably maybe the better part of 10 years neither of us have been a part of a coven no not at all kind of shocking considering the past and just like after a while some of the Dynamics of a coven started to get old the Dynamics of being a solitaire gets old what I'm saying being a solitaire is the biggest benefit is flexibility I can do ritual anytime that I think of it I don't have to it also can be boring as [ __ ] yes solitary is flexible and that's great in the beginning but yeah it does get old it's just me coming up with rituals I you and I can I just say that we just we we're badass witches together no one can write rituals and spells like we do I'm sure other good people are out there and I am not just doubting other people but you and I are like a step above that was one of my favorite things was being in that group and and everyone contributed everyone contributed but it was always you and I I felt like we were the workhorses you and I hitched together we could we could do anything we could make everything happen we made amazing rituals happen and and just like you said it I love writing spells I love writing ritual but bouncing those ideas off of you and off of our coven mates and everyone putting in their input and suggesting changes we wrote some of the most powerful rituals and incantations it's almost like when when we do it individually it's kind of bland but when we would do it as a group it just like exploded into its whole it its own whole life yeah it adds so much richness and dimensionality to it when you have other people to do it with and it could just be you and your best friend you know you and I could do rituals over Zoom if we wanted to you want to do a ritual next full moonshell oh we should do that we should do that that would be so great let's do that but yeah you can people can do that you don't have to do it by yourself but I I love both they both have things that that are good but I definitely would have to say that maybe we can manifest finding like-minded people other witches who smoke weed other you know ant type people who who also like to do magic and celebrate the earth and the goddess and the full moon and ourselves and hopefully we can find that hopefully that let's try it will manifest it we'll we'll do a little ritual on our next full moon and we'll see if we can pull in some like-minded people damn it where the witches at email us we have good weed I grow good weed sh packs good weed we're fun we like to hang out we do good ritual we do sometimes High I'm not gonna lie oh yeah we'll definitely have to be like-minded people and you know that's another thing back then we smoked weed shocker and it was accepted mostly in the Greater Community and it was very much accepted in our coven even though not everyone smoked right not everyone did and but it it it was okay for those that did and it was okay for those that didn't so it was kind of you know nobody really judged anybody on anything and that's kind of also one of the great Dynamics we had it it was that coven was beautiful to me because we came from all different walks of life we had college students you were a new parent at the time I was just in a new relationship we had people in all different all different places and and like you said from different traditions and yet somehow the Synergy of all that made a truly really well worked really well and I think that's my advice to someone if you're looking for a coven know them you know make one with your friends first absolutely that's a good idea but understand there's going to be fights there's going to be arguments and and try to work with that there's going to have to to be compromised lots of compromise but if you're finding a coven of people that you don't know you know do a couple rituals with them first talk to them have some you know hang out have some coffee have some tea smoke some weed if you're lucky enough and you know see where they're at see where their Traditions are at and see how it feels for you are they people that you would choose to be your friend if you wouldn't be friends with these people you probably shouldn't be doing magic with these people right would you hang out with them out side of ritual right right you know you definitely want people that you can work well with that you can talk to that you can like you because compromise is going to be a huge thing so you have to have that Baseline relationship I think that that you know I one of the biggest things that I'm having a problem with in my new environment not that it's new I've been here two years but and I think a lot of people especially when you're in a smaller City in a smaller town or even a smaller country just getting people to just want to have that cup of coffee or want to allow you to go to that ritual that are willing to give you the date and the time and the location that initial connection I think is the hardest well I think you touched on something inadvertently shell the last two years we're in 2022 2 years ago was 20 [ __ ] 20 hey it's it's we're having a can I join a coven right this world think about it that way it's not just that it's like right now the even two years later the world is a fundamentally different place people interact differently you know we are not as we are not as Keen some of us to jump right into a stranger's house and 12 other people for the coven right you know and and so people are a little more leery I think but I also feel like people are craving connection so it's this really strange you know I want this and yet I'm pushing it away kind of feeling I do I don't I do I don't I do I don't very much so and and I don't know maybe maybe Zoom like like we do our podcast maybe maybe some type of virtual thing is is the way to do it I don't know but I want festivals so much I want Community I'd love a coven [ __ ] if you and I could have a Coven together again that would be the best all right so we need to hunt down we need to get you up to Salem in October and hunt down a public ritual on sin here in Salem damn it oh oh I like that have you so one place that I've looked for pagans um and is Meetup and I haven't really had too much terrible luck with it you know how did we find the bpc I think I stumbled into a group of people in college and I I don't know if if that doesn't happen again I don't know actually how I got in in into that group was um my ex-husband worked at a retail location and someone that was a part of community came in got chatty next thing you know were invited to a ritual so yeah I I it wasn't something you know that connection kind of just happened it wasn't I didn't have to like go out and solicit a group to practice magic with like I feel like I need a business card here in Salem right maybe maybe we're just not looking for it magically maybe we just haven't put out those magical feelers I'm not sure but yeah so solitary I like because I can do pretty much anything I want and no one's going to judge me true I can draw my circle in my backyard or wherever I happen to be and I can go skyclad which is totally naked and I don't have to worry about anybody at all but in the in the same respect you can also do it in your sweatpants and your pajama shirt and no one cares you're a solitaire or I can dress up in the most fabulous ritual Garb that I made for one of our rituals back in the day you know head to toe cool dress and headdress and the jewelry and have the wand and the staff and look like some sort of Green Goddess [ __ ] right out of the the woods and and feel fabulous and I can do whatever I want and I like that so I mean I guess the moral of the story is both are good they both have their great points they both have their downsides the best I can hope for any witch out there is that you get to experience both sides of that coin being in a coven and being a solitire because they are both very valuable experiences and I didn't even realize I guess I did not I didn't love our local community enough I should have loved them more oh my God ever since I've been here all I've thought about was you know at the time but now in retrospect I love those [ __ ] I miss them I should have appreciated them more and I I I I I I should have appreciated them more we didn't know what we had I had we did not know how rare and precious that was gone yeah yeah not everybody gets to experience a local community where different soli and cins and family TRS and different groups all get together it's now that I'm away from that I am surprised it like I guess I was naive and thought that that was everywhere we were lucky to have some random 300 strong Pagan community in rural Upstate New York because much to my May that's not the case everywhere it's not it's not and I'm so sad we definitely had a good thing going back then and you know one of these days I'm sure we'll be visiting New York we we should go we should go have to we have to because my heart craves the fairy path with all the lit candles of different colors going down it heading from the camping field to the rual field y and alal Enclave where where the where the Labyrinth is now yeah I I missed that and I I I definitely would like to go back for a visit but you know that's not a long-term solution is I'm hundreds of miles away and you're a couple thousand miles away have to be a special case but boy I would love to do it but yeah I mean it's it's definitely a struggle to try to infiltrate yourself and I didn't realize that unfortunately until now who knew 30 years later not I'm having a problem infiltrating into the witch Community y who the sun it sounds like we both very much for the last couple years have been wanting that kind of connection and it's been ramping up again like we've said the beginning of this year very heavily and Co kind of screwed us because you know our hey let's get back into being public and community and doing things with other people hey go lock yourself in your house for two years coincided and so I guess that's uh Murphy's Law or Karma or something I don't know something I don't even know but so so yeah that's that's kind of what I just wanted to chat briefly I say briefly we are like a half hour later but but now I kind of want to talk about um our stories and I want to go first because I know that yours is more of a stressful story okay so I want to talk about this Emily bridge this oh yeah oh it has a name Emily okay 's covered bridge in Stow Vermont so I decided I do a lot in Massachusetts in New York so I randomly picked Vermont and and found this place it it's you know it's one of those old wooden covered bridges you know what I'm talking about yeah the ones that are super common up in the New England area yeah yeah they're totally famous in New England oh there super aesthetic they're beautiful they are but Emily's Bridge has more mystery than charm I find Mystery Charming but you know hey that's just me I think this uh black triangle OG is trying to kill me it's trying to hurt me shell love the black triangle I do I love this black triangle it's such good [ __ ] so you're saying covered Emily bridge is full of mystery it's full of mystery love me a good mystery it definitely is and this was built in 1844 going back to my original theory for like the last 10 episodes like what is with freaking ghosts in the 1800s they seem to be everywhere maybe it was the spiritualist movement maybe all these mediums running around we're calling Spirits willy-nilly and I D you Lily Dale damn you when was Lily Dale founded we need to do a trip to Lily Dale oh my God different episode people okay different episode for my birthday different episode people okay sorry I'm so [ __ ] high go on Emily Bridge mystery not my birthday not Lily Dale gotcha Spirits 1839 go 1844 oh [ __ ] 1844 I thought I was doing so good I'm like I got this I'm high but I know it's 1839 you're like no 1844 [ __ ] so 50 foot wooden Covered Bridge okay okay now of course there was a young woman named Emily Emily because it's her Bridge it's her Bridge so this bridge was still fairly new um apparently around the 1844 time period see and this is this is what I don't understand and this is what I hate sometimes about history because I read a few stories that said specifically around 1844 when the when the bridge was built like right down to it tells you that the wood was still new smelled a fresh pine creaked when the H drawn wagons crossed it but then when you go look at other instances of this bridge it says sometime between 1849 and 1949 okay are you talking a year or a hundred years because let's just say there's a difference that's a pretty big gap that's a very long time period to be like we don't know exactly when it was built no oh no I'm talking about the girl they don't they know it was built in 1844 but Emily when was when was Emily there they don't know there's a hundred-year time period where Emily could have been there correct so the legend the legend says and actually it's not it does have like an official official name and it's called The Gold Brook bridge but nobody really calls it the Gold Brook bridge to be honest they all call it Emily's Bridge wow whatever happened there to Emily was enough that her name imprinted on it so she was a young girl and again who the hell knows was she wearing a white dress no no okay well it was a shot I mean there's a good chance yeah this is not a woman in a white dress story but so sometime we don't know when 1849 to 1949 she fell in love with this guy that we'll just say he kind of had another girlfriend oh damn those jiggalo she was insistent that they were going to be together and that this was going to be some wonderful thing and they were going to get married well her family not so pleased with the situation and they were very much against any communication between Emily and this guy oh was he like of lower station or something cheating wasn't you weren't supposed to be the girl and a they knew so everyone knew that he was involved with someone else correct oh okay now you know how Society is if a guy cheats you know hey good for you bro but if a girl cheats you know hey [ __ ] [ __ ] yes shaming happens burn her at the Stak so Emily's Family basically said if you go with him we're done with you so she decides to tell this guy meet me at the covered bridge at such and such day in time and we're going to run off and get married tells her family you know look I don't give a crap what you say I'm G to go marry this guy whatever so they say if you leave don't come back she goes to the bridge guess who doesn't show up no he didn't show he like left her there h no show Joe we'll call him no show Joe what a dick yeah no show so as you can imagine because not only her broken heart obviously she was brokenhearted I mean yeah that's [ __ ] sad you think you're GNA run off and get married and you're kind of stood up the freaking Bridge she went against her family she went out there followed her heart and then the [ __ ] stood her up right so then guess what who wants to go home not Emily I hope she took off to California basically kind of the whole who wants to go home to the big fat I told you so you know no please tell me she ran away sh please tell me she ran away to California well she did not run away to California she ran away to Colorado nor did she run away to Colorado [ __ ] she ran away to [ __ ] Florida that's a bad State don't go there no what she did was she stayed at the bridge no come on sh and you know how wooden bridges have all that like what are they called the beaming on the inside yes yes I do makes it very conducive to hang your sh sh did she did no over a [ __ ] cheating [ __ ] yep because she was em basically because she was too embarrassed to go home and be given the big fat I Told You So ouch ultimately I don't know if she hung herself more so because of the broken heart or if she hung herself because of the embarrassment and how she felt that she could not face her family right oh wow that's heartbreaking as you can imagine her tormented soul is probably still there that poor thing unfortunately Emily is vengeful oh she's not like oh boohoo sad me she's like [ __ ] You dudes you're coming down with me and she also apparently has long fingernails well they do say they continue to grow after you die so she's a jilted lover anybody would be but she takes it out on passing cars no she does she started slashing cars passing over the bridge leaving like basically it's been described by people as they look similar to uh scars left by Wolverine from X-Men like in their car like scratches in the car correct and even pedest even pedestrians Crossing Emily's Covered Bridge aren't safe either have had marks on their backs oh she's like a scratching Poltergeist of the bridge she's a [ __ ] scratcher now does she just scratch guys or just indiscriminate she's just going to scratch everybody I never found anything that was specific to men only so I think that she's just everybody the world yeah now these sightings started getting recorded in the 60s and I'm wondering if that's why they're putting the time frame anywhere from 1849 to 1949 that she died because the s in started getting marked in newspapers and such in like the late 60s now is there any obituary that's a time when there should have been like an obituary or a story done on it I would think now there's been a problem finding something under the name Emily but they were find able to find someone under the name of emalia and they think that Emilia could potentially be Emily that would make sense but again that was kind of more later towards the the 1949 date so I'm not sure where the 1849 stories are coming from it just seems like that's really more around the time the bridge was built as opposed to the time the girl died what happened to emalia no one knows they just said they found a gravestone that was a gravestone in town they were able to find with a similar name I wonder given the nature of the story it's I suppose it's possible that if she had killed herself maybe closer to the beginning of that hundred-year span that there'd be no documentation of that right there might not be any documentation especially if her family was shitty enough that she'd rather kill herself than face them then you know suicides weren't allowed to be buried on hollowed ground you know you had to they would go to I don't know what they did with them but I know they weren't allowed to be buried at the church and people were pretty religious at that time so it's possible she went to an unmarked grave it's also possible that the family just didn't want anything mentioned because it it's shameful she wanted a guy who was engaged or with another woman and she ran away from her family and then she committed suicide so it's possible the family tried to bury it as much as possible so you know there are people who try to debunk it by saying that they they can't find evidence showing anyone died at the bridge by that name but again it depends on what part of that hundred years span you're talking about if it was in you know 1949 yeah you'd find a record if it was in 1850 you're probably not going to find a record you know what I'm saying so right right I mean there should be a record even in 1850 but I can see scenarios where there wouldn't be one I want to read uh an excerpt to you from someone who had a personal experience here okay grab your blankie oh boy okay hold on I got this is my bong which is which is blanky enough go for it clutch the bong the pitch black darkness smothered me the Rushing Water of Gold Brook 10 feet below me echoed against the wooden walls of the roof of the Gold Brook covered bridge in stove Vermont it filled my ears so that I could hear nothing but the vicious Rush of water over the rock in the reverberating off the old wooden walls but I could feel and what I felt was the slightest sensation of something just barely brushing up against my left arm just barely I was the only one of my team inside what the locals call Emily's bridge probably the most haunted place in Vermont I had taken over the bridge shift and someone else that was there prior to me also reported being lightly touched by something so there are two people that were there within the last 10 or so years they actually happen to be Ghost Hunters by the way wow that felt that they were touched but the guy went on to say that he was happily that Emily hadn't become violent so she just touched them she didn't scratch them a light touches what they both explained wow creepy that would be so creepy and although it is you know honestly folks true story it is extremely rare for a ghost to attack people but this ghost apparently has claws why do I always pick this stuff with like Claws and [ __ ] you like to pick stuff that hurts people it's so scary you're trying to scare me I don't even know how it works out that way how I end up with like that I get the strangest stuff I got the creeps when that when you said that one investigator went in by himself I don't know if I would go in by myself that sounds really [ __ ] spooky but but then he finished it by saying he went back in towards the edge of the water on the bridge and again felt a slight sensation of something brushing up against the edge of his coat he spun around and through the pinkish purple Hue of his of his screen he actually saw something he saw it in the camera but not with his natural eye so he turns around with his natural eye he's on the bridge alone when he replays the camera there are orbs in there I know you loveing a good orb story I do there's orbs all around him yeah oh oh that's great I want I gotta find this photo and then he ends it with I looked at my watch and it was 1 am and according and according to Legend Emily Emily died around that time supposedly 150 years prior oh well they know the time she died but they can't find her [ __ ] headstone here's the thing you know and this is where I think sometimes local Legends make stuff up no say it's not show you don't know who it was you don't know if it was between a hundred years span but you sure as sh know she died at one o'clock in the morning like what's going on here I call Shenanigans I have got the best continuation of this you're oh good it's been awesome so far tell me more you're gonna love this so there was a paranormal group there way back in I think this was mid 70s and at that point it was still called The Gold Brook Bridge Okay so they go there with a Ouija board no you've said why don't they not listen to you shelle they should they should know even from the 70s they should know shell says around and find out man [ __ ] around with a Ouija board and find out you always do they did didn't they okay oh I got [ __ ] a what happened you know in the 70s Ouija boards were making their way back around into the Social Circles so I'm not surprised they actually reached out to a spirit via Ouija board and asked the spirit who were they um and what were they doing there and it was the spirit who told them their name was Emily and that it was called Emily's Bridge oh okay it sounds like the name Emily and Emily's Bridge actually came from IGA board a 1970s group of people with a Ouija board on the bridge well hey that's pretty I think that's pretty reliable as far as ghost stuff goes I'm down with that I would listen to a Ouija board right but people have reported orbs with with their own visual eye I'm not talking about cameras they've noticed blurred spots in the trees surrounding the bridge like your eye goes blurry for a second I want to go there I want to take some pictures we should go sh I love ver we should go to Vermont in the fall how pretty would that be and take orb photos at the pretty Bridge oh my God how pretty would that be they've even seen faint images of a face or a woman's figure faint flashes of light in various areas of the bridge have also been reported oh that's cool that's fantastic and then some things that we're we're well experienced with equip malfunctions like a fully charged battery dead within a few minutes love those now so what you're telling me here is like the the Emily story is okay the Emily story has kind of a not so great lineage it goes back to a Ouija board in the 70s which you know may or may not be truthful probably not but the legend around it is backed up by everyone's experiences here these things are happening and they're happening to lots of people that go there right I mean they actually literally do call this one of the most haunted places in Vermont they're all the most haunted places they they're all the most haunted I know right but yeah so so emiline is supposed to be I guess the name of what this girl was and and like I said they did find a headstone in town that had emolene on it emalia or emilene emilene e m e l i n e and that person 's grave was dated 150 years ago so again that could be where the time range comes through but the Ouija board didn't name the bridge um and give out the name until like I said 1970 yeah the the very beginning of the 70s so it sounds like it was haunted prior to this but they didn't know by what or by whom until this Ouija board gave them a name in a story right but they knew it was active now you know could the Ouija guy have made it up who knows but there are stories that date back about people going over in horse and carriages and the horses refusing to cross the bridge and as you and I know know yeah so you know if if an animal doesn't want to cross a bridge I sure is hant gonna try to make it exactly if my dog doesn't like a person I have issues with them just imagine if you were crossing a bridge and had like freaking Wolverine scratches on the damn outside of your car when you get to the other side like I [ __ ] let's go I want that I want that on my car let's go do it what do you tell Geico ghost did it yeah they have a talking they have a talking gecko they'll understand a ghost this is good weed by the way just saying so I do believe it's haunted because there's been a lot of reports over the years even before again the Ouija board incident in the 70s you know that the horse and carriages having issues people seeing orbs and the the scrape feeling like nails are going over the the roof of your car when you're driving through that I all buy into orb photos orb photos I cannot wait to go I have got to go there that I all buy into the story of Emily I'm not 100% sure just because that particular part of it cannot be cooperated but the experience lie they lie yeah and so the experiences I believe the backstory I'm not so sure yeah I like it it's an interesting back story you know it fits in with a lot of typical local Legends it follows the same kind of pattern so more than likely it's not true it's probably just something that whatever energy was in the Ouija board made up at the time but the experiences are there there's something there but if you remember one of one of our original podcasts I don't even remember which one but it was somewhere between one and five folks go back and listen let us know I did a cemetery and I want to say it was like I don't know like in udica or something in New York and it was kind of the same thing you know what is with a jilted lover hanging themselves and then scraping their body their ghosty body over cars right again this follows like the lady in white which this isn't but like that type of Legend This follows a similar pattern any town is particularly small towns in America you can find these types of ghost stories and legends about local places and a covered bridge is like one of the best spooky places it totally has that Sleepy Hollow Vibe exactly and if it's already one where paranormal things are happening for whatever reason maybe it's overwat maybe it has some Limestone there so you know maybe it it's one of those energy places that seems to hold things and so there's activity there's orbs there so some type of activity why they your car why do they have to scrape the car I don't know but I love that I would love to go do an investig there this is one I want to go I want to go I want to go well I'll have to see how far away stove Verma is from it's probably pretty far we'll have to check that out hey Google how long will it take to drive to Stow Vermont from Salem Massachusetts by car thep from to is hours 22 minutes traffic 3 hours and 22 minutes with light traffic oh [ __ ] that's how long it took us to get to Mount Washington so there you go see no problem we can go yeah so that's how that that would be fun let's do it okay we probably won't but sometime we should but isn't it just weird and and this is one thing that I think is is kind of interesting you start looking into a lot of these ghost stories and paranormal stories like we've been doing for the last many months of this and you're you start to see a lot of the same similar stories with just some of the fine details different and the locations different yeah there's these areas that have paranormal activity but to explain them we've kind of fallen into the pattern of these these common archetypes that you'll see over and over again you know I love it I love to see the differences and I love to hear the the similarities it's it's just it's cool I like it I love these stories as soon as I heard about her scraping the nails over the cars all I could think about is one is one of those first couple episodes that we did I believe it was a guy same thing was hanging through a tree and was scraping cars oh so scary I you know I talk a big game about how fun this would be but the second Freddy Krueger right the second we hear those scrapes on the car when we're going under the bridge I'd start screaming screaming like little girls screaming like little girls and we better hope like [ __ ] that you're not driving because you have a lead foot and drive like a maniac and so we would be there Man Zero to 120 in two seconds we'd be gone you need a NASCAR driver I'm your girl that's true maybe we do want you to be the driver so you got us I'll take the orb photos you be the getaway driver right right that's that was always my lot in life I am your getaway driver man perfect that's perfect I believe there's paranormal activity going on like I said I'm just not sold totally on the backstory so that's my story and I'm sticking to it with Emily's bridge and stove Vermont I love it that is a fabulous story shell all right so before we get get into my shitty story I'm going to lighten the mood just a little bit cuz I'm really high can you see my eyes they're like all GL no I can't see your eyes that's the problem that's I know I know so what eyes what eyes all

redis your story before you start so we do have a uh is going to give us a a True Crime Story we do have trigger warnings this is definitely sensitive topic if you are sensitive to sexual assault or violence against children this might not be the true crime story for you if you are sensitive we will not take it personally if you stop listening right now go ahead dip out we do not mind we will not take it personally all good so from this point on you've been warned all right Ila give a damn time buckle up grab your weed for sure make sure you got your loved ones cuz we're diving in okay so I am definitely smoking more pot and I'll probably take some weed breaks through this because this was a hard one to research I I I was very interesting um but very [ __ ] scary so you ready you know unfortunately I I think that there's a misconception you know we're not the only podcast out there that talks about True Crime it's it it is a Hot Topic right now but I I I think that there's a misconception that true crime is all you know fun and mysterious and and there's a dark side and we're going to kind of talk about that dark side tonight it's it's all a dark side I mean there there is no fun side to this I no I wouldn't say there's anything fun here but um all right so all right I'm just going to dive in I'm just gonna dive in just start from the beginning so I'm talking about a killer that started in the early 1970s and at this time in America we didn't have the term serial killer that hadn't been invented yet also in this same time period again the early 7s five of the most prolific killers in our history were kind of doing their murderous [ __ ] all over the United States and those killers were John Wayne gasey Gary Ridgeway who was the Green River Killer Jeffrey dmer Ted Bundy and the killer I'm going to talk about this evening who is called the BT K killer now a couple of those are familiar to me a couple of them I'll be honest I don't recall the name or the incidents and and BTK killer I don't I don't recall that one honestly you know Ted Bundy I remember but but I don't remember this one now BTK is a name he gave himself and I'll get to the point where he does that but it stands for bind torture kill and that's exactly what he did seriously seriously what a whack oh oh yeah and oh yeah you have no idea so we're going to start again so this is a time when there's no surveillance cameras you know nobody has a cell phone there's no computers the the police stations don't have a database that they can access with just a few keystrokes it's the 70s it's the 70s so a lot of these killers happened at that time because people were traveling people were out they had no concept of serial killer and these killers had nothing really to stop them no way to be found right they could kill and go to another town kill go to another town right and there's no fingerprinting there's no DNA evidence you know there's there's none of that files half the time paperwork was just crammed in some some guy's drawer in his desk at work I don't even know if they had faxes back then no I don't think they did um I think the Black Dalia was one of the first times that they used a fax machine to help solve a killing and I don't remember what year that that was but I do remember that fact but anyway so I'm going to start with the first killing that the BTK killer was responsible for and this happened January 15th 1974 in Witchita Kansas this is hard is this where is this where he was from it is actually but we no one knew that at the time oh okay January 15th uh Charlie a young boy named Charlie Charlie Otero he's 15 he'd gone to school early that day because he had some tests that he need to study for and he comes home from school and his two siblings uh Carmen and Dany are yelling to him from inside the house the first thing he sees is his dog in the backyard which he thought was unusual the dog was usually inside the house at this time and his two two younger siblings are yelling at him to come in the house they're saying that Mom and Dad are playing a game and that he needs to come in and help them very 70s like yes okay as soon as Charlie gets in the back door he said he could smell the fear and he could tell something was wrong and he gets into he gets into the room where his parents are and he sees that their hands have been tied behind their back they have bags over their head and lies around their neck and he can tell that they're deceased oh my God imagine that at 15 he immediately gets the younger children out and they go to a neighbors and call the police and while they're waiting for the police that's when it hits him that he doesn't know where his two younger siblings 9-year-old Joe Jr and 11-year-old Josephine he doesn't know where they are he didn't he didn't get them out of the house with him as far as he knew they weren't in the house and it's a good thing he didn't go looking for them because and who was yelling his name it was the other two children Carmen and Dany oh okay okay there were five children in the oot family uh 15-year-old Charlie and then Carmen and Dany and then 11-year-old Josephine and nine-year-old Joe Jr okay gotcha so they don't know where the two younger children are and when the police get there uh they find the family and then they find Joe Jr in his bedroom he was in bed and a bag had been put over his head his hands were tied behind his back and a ligature of a rope had been put around his neck and they could tell that the killer had been sitting in the chair opposite the bed and watched him die oh my God what did he hang him he strangled him with a bag over his head with a cord around his neck and then just laid him in in bed while he suffocated to death oh my God the family knew that 11-year-old Josephine was still unaccounted for and they didn't see her in the house and then they realized that the house had a basement so they go down into the basement and according to oh no oh I oh [ __ ] according to the investigator that went down there he said it was very dark and he couldn't see anything and he brushed up against something that he thought was like a a heavy bag like a punching bag hanging from the ceiling and it was s when he turned on the light it was 11-year-old Joseph oh my God she had been hung from a sewer pipe and stripped naked and there was a puddle of semen at the floor beneath her what a [ __ ] dirt bag so at the time DNA was not a thing at that time but one of the agents at the crime scene had the foresight to um to cut up uh a sheet or a pillowcase and use that to collect the DNA evidence on the floor uh beneath beneath Josephine So what had happened was in the Killer's own words he said that he had targeted them and that he didn't plan on Mr Otero being at home just Mrs Otero and the and the younger children he cut the phone lines got in through the back door and he said he was really nervous that day because it was his first time and the dog kind of scared him he confronted the family when he went in and he pulled out a gun and he confronted Mr Otero and told told him basically that he wanted to steal the car that he was hungry and that food was all he wanted he told the family to lie down in the living room and then he realized that the dog was going to be a problem so he made Mr Otero have one of the children put the dog outside and then he took the entire family back to one of the bedrooms and he tied them up while holding them at gunpoint he says then they started complaining about being tied up and so he kind of loosened their bonds a little bit and tried to make Mr oot as comfortable as possible he said Mr oo had a cracked rib from a car accident and he was trying to keep him comfortable which is really weird considering what he was about to do he even put a pillow down underneath Mr otero's head they were trying to tell him that they didn't have much but he was welcome to take whatever he had and that's when he realized he wasn't wearing a mask and that they' already seen his face and so that he made that decision then that he was going to have to kill all of them strength them I guess he says so he put a plastic bag over Mr otero's head and put some cords around his neck and started tightening them after he strangled Mr ooto he did the same thing to Mrs oo and he said he didn't know how long it was going to take or how hard he had to push oh [ __ ] and the children were still in the room while this is all happening and Mr Otero came to and tried to get loose and the whole family's panicking at this point so he finishes strangling Mrs oo and when she passes out then he strangled little Josephine and then he put a bag on the little boy's head he said Mrs ooto came too and she was really upset and so that time he strangled her to death with a cord around her neck and then he went back over and made sure that Mr ooto was dead he says that before Mrs ooto died she had asked him to save her son so he'd taken the bag off of of the little boy's head but after he killed both Mrs and Mr Otero he took the little boy to the other bedroom and put a bag over his head and then a t-shirt over that and then watched him while he died then he went back into the other room where little Josephine had woken up and he says that's when he took her down to the basement and he said he cleaned up and took a few things and then he left oh wow so they had no idea who to even look at to go after they had no clue the the police originally thought maybe it was a drug deal gone wrong or something uh but that just didn't fit with the family they had no idea no idea where to even start to look and people had been in and out of the house one of the police officers that went into the house I guess had actually made himself a drink or something and left ice out on the counter and they said that um because the ice was on the counter maybe that meant that the killer had just been there or something but this was a very daring crime you know the killing had taken place in midday there was a dog there uh the family was there there were there were you know multiple people there it was a very high-risk killing to what end did they ever find a motive I will tell you that 31 years later the DNA collected from that puddle was very important serious seriously worked after all those years and B they actually kept it they kept it they kept it so that's good right it absolutely good it's really good so I take it this isn't it this isn't the end he's done this again I would imagine three months later Katherine brigh 21 was coming home to her apartment with her brother Kevin where same city okay okay they get into the house and the BTK Killer's there with a gun and he tells them to cooperate and he'll let them live lies he tells the brother Kevin to tie up Catherine and he does and then he marches Kevin into the bedroom and ties up his hands when he starts to slip a bag over Kevin's head that's when Kevin said he realized that the guy had lied he wasn't getting out of there alive and so he fought back the BTK killer shot him twice and left him for dead oh my God and then went back to Catherine but Kevin woke up at this point and came out and the BTK killer instead of strangling Catherine resorted to stabbing her multiple times in the abdomen before fleeing oh my God the police came and they managed to save Kevin who was never or something both of them did give details of of what the killer looked like to the police but it was pretty vague and Catherine unfortunately died of her wound shortly after they did not connect that to the BTK killer at the time because it was two very different OS well they were two opposite types of killings really yeah exactly both both seemingly random now here's where it gets kind of interesting in October of 1974 so that same year a young man confessed to killing the oos he said he and two friends had gotten Wicked drunk and had killed them while the police are investigating this lead the Witchita newspaper the witchat eagle got a phone call an anonymous phone call and the man on that phone call said that they should go look at an engineering book in the witcho public library for what a letter so the police went to the witch public library and in that engineering book was a letter from the BTK Killer and he wrote a detailed description of the unsolved Otero killing with enough evidence to prove that he was definitely the killer because he knew so he was showing off he was showing off because he thought that someone else would get credit he was mad that someone else would get credit and said so in the letter he said he alone had killed the otos and that the three were just seeking to gain publicity from his actions the letter read in part quote I can't stop it so the monster goes on and hurts me as well as Society it's a big complicated game my friend the monster play putting victim's number down follow them checking up on them waiting in the dark waiting waiting at the end of the letter he describes this Beast inside of him and says that the Beast has already chosen the next victim or victims and that he himself will only know it in the morning when he reads the newspaper but it's going to be too late for those people by that time and he says quote since sex criminals do not change their MO or by Nature cannot do so I will not change mine the code word for me will be B them torture them kill them BTK you see he added again wow what a narcissistic piece of [ __ ] yes so you've met him yes exactly yeah [ __ ] complete [ __ ] so so what so what are you saying that he would open the newspaper and see a name and that was the next person like maybe he definitely implied that he stalked these people and chose his victims before he killed them damn it was apparently enough for him at that point in 1974 killing those four people in the Otero family and killing Katherine brigh and then sending that letter to the witchat eagle kind of seemed to his crazy yeah seemed to satisfy those shitty urges right for at least a couple years and then March of 1977 he struck again a woman named Shirley vien aged 26 she was sick at home with her three children still in Kansas yes this was in Witchita Kansas all of his killings were in Park City and Witchita Kansas home in bed sick with her three children home and one of her children answers the door and he let in the man that was dressed like a detective the BK killer he parked his car at a Dylan's grocery store according to odd stops on East Lincoln Street and he had been looking for Shirley vien kind of targeting her he finds her house and knocks on the door and her son opens it and lets him in unfortunately the BTK killer is not a nice dude and he tells Shirley that if she cooperates he won't kill her kids wow yeah so she says okay and she helps him put some blankets and toys in the bathroom and he locks the children in the bathroom one of the doors I guess locks and the other door is tied with some sort of like rope to the door handle and then to like the pipes of the sink so that it's closed but I guess there was a gap mhm the killer stayed in the apartment for about 40 minutes and during that time the BTK killer raped vien and then still trying to keep her calm gave her a glass of water and a cigarette and one of the children stce wiford was only 5 years old he's the one who says he let the killer into the house and he was able to see out through that Gap and he recalls seeing that his mother had been stripped naked and her hands were tied behind her back and a bag put over her head and then the killer tied a rope around her neck oh my God and this little boy says his last vision is of his mother being strangled on the floor all of her fingers on one hand broken oh my God oh my God the killer then turned his attention to the screaming children that were trapped in the bathroom fortunately for them the telephone rang and the BTK killer got spooked enough that he left he was afraid that someone would come so he took off and it's the only reason that he didn't break his promise to Shirley because he fully intended to kill those children the children say that one of the brothers escaped through a window in the bathroom but the other two kids couldn't fit they did manage to break the door down but by the time they did their mother had died and and the killer had fled the scene then in December of 1977 Nancy Fox 25 she was found strangled and bound at her home and this time the killer called the police called 911 the next day and reported the killing himself why cuz nobody found out oh good guess sh very good nobody's really sure but it's thought that maybe because this killing was a little different I believe Nancy Fox was killed in the evening and the other killings that had been attributed to him were all during the day so this was like where he was veering off the norm a little bit yeah maybe he was just looking for more attention not that not that he shouldn't have stopped but why did he stopped for two years or three years whatever it was at the time they didn't know I take it you're going to get to that okay just one month later in January 31st 1978 the killer reached out to the witchat Eagle Newspaper again what a narcissist he wrote a poem he fancied himself a poet and this one started Shirley locks Shirley locks wilt thou be mine the mail clerk thought it it was you know it's right right before valent 2 weeks before Valentine's Day the male clerk thought it was a Valentine and forwarded the letter to the classified department they didn't know that it was referring to Shirley vien this killing had not yet been connected to the BTK Killer and so he was trying to make sure that they knew that guy got fired that day from the newspaper I bet right and then February 10th 1978 this time the threat from the BTK killer is made public because he writes another letter and he wrote it to the witch Witchita TV station and he said how many people do I have to kill before I get my name in the paper or some national attention then he started listing a whole bunch of suggested names that he should be called like the BTK Strangler the Witchita hangman or the um April 28th 1979 someone narrowly missed becoming his next victim oh he chose and stalked a 63-year-old woman named Anna Williams and he laid in wait for her in her house this is odd because weren't all the women really kind of younger and it's an older one they were they were 30s 20s and now a 63y old woman I they I don't know if he really had a pattern or a type he would just find someone stalk them and then try to kill them I guess random so he's in Anna Williams house waiting for her but she was held up with friends and didn't get home until way later than she expected to so the killer got bored stole a few of her things including a scarf and left less than two months later Anna Williams learned that she narrowly escaped death because she got a [ __ ] letter from the BTK Killer along with her scarf and a poem titled oh Anna why didn't you appear and in the letter it says be glad you weren't here because I was and it was from the [ __ ] BTK killer oh my God can you [ __ ] imagine oh my God I wouldn't go home right I would move immediately immediately move so she lived thankfully but his next victim was not so lucky Marine Hajj 53 was found in May 1985 the BTK killer had strangled her with her own panty hose it was later found out that he took her body to a church Christ Lutheran and he posed her in multiple bondage positions and took photographs of her dead body that sounds familiar to me I feel like I've heard that story before and he dumped her body in a ditch so that's quite a long time like she was 1979 to 1985 that's six years yeah and his next victim was over a year later September 1986 Vick Vicky werly 28 the BTK killer pretended to be a repair man please people check credentials just because they're wearing a vest does not mean that they're unofficial make sure they say they're from the gas company ask to see their ID they should have one and they should have no problem giving it to you so he said he was a telephone repair man and asked to come inside as soon as she let him in he pulled a gun on her and then told her what he was going to do he tied her up and strangled her with her own panty hose while she was unconscious he arranged her body and her clothes again in lots of different bondage positions and took pictures and when she came to he strangled her again and killed her so wagerle reportedly had a 2-year-old child in the home at the time oh jeez thankfully he did nothing to the little boy well that's good Jesus when Bill wagerle Vicky's husband came home he found the 2-year-old sitting alone at the table and and his wife dead in the bedroom oh my God so of course unfortunately because it's usually the right choice he was a he was a suspect for a while before they connected it to the BTK killer so his final victim was uh Dolores Davis 62 and she was murdered in her home January 19th 1991 this one was kind of messy he threw like a brick or a a cement block or something through through her window and then when she came running out the door he he kind of overpowered her and forced his way in so he seems to be getting more Brazen as the years go on yes and and this victim he put in the [ __ ] trunk of his car and carried her around while he ran errands oh my God then he left her body under a bridge and it wasn't found until Weeks Later by a kid walking his dog now did he like have a job or anything like did anybody know he was like a little off yes and no so after that 1991 killing he stopped for 25 years well that's good right what what the hell brought him back did he finally get caught is that the DNA evidence thing he didn't get caught in 2004 January 2004 the witchat Eagle Run Like A 30th Anniversary piece about the BTK Killer and oh yeah because that's good news [ __ ] they interviewed some uh school kids I guess and none of them had heard of the BTK killer nobody knew who he was and so they talked about how people had been terrified in the 70s I mean his name struck fear into everyone's heart in Kansas because people were terrified when he was going to strike next but now he kind of faded out of memory got yeah and then later in 2004 America's Most Wanted did a show on the Otero family and Charlie ooto remember the little boy who he and his siblings found them M his life had gone to Hell afterwards he'd gone from being a great student to being a shitty student everything sucked oh that poor child he was angry he was hurt and he turned into an angry hurt adult so he was in jail when he saw this America's Most Wanted peace on his own family and he had kind of tried to avoid it for years but he reached out to America's Most Wanted and and contacted the show and and he started to appear on TV and newspaper articles once he got out and it's thought that those two things the witchat eagle piece where he's forgotten and Charlie ooto going more public uhuh brought him back out oh the killer got really upset that Charley was talking and he contacted the police with a letter and asked them to stop so now he enters into kind of a weird cat and mouse letter game with the police he asks them to stop yeah to stop talking about it I guess or okay could you stop killing people right so March 19th 2004 the BTK killer announces his return by sending a letter to the witchat eagle from Bill Thomas kilman and in it is included his name no oh okay in it is a copy of Vicky werley's driver's license which had been missing from the scene of her murder oh [ __ ] photographs of her body and the btk's distinctive signature which is a I don't know what that means maybe he signed his name a certain way oh yeah yeah said BTK bind them torture them kill them whatever his deal was right so they know for a fact it's from the killer he has her stuff and pictures so basically he is just this is really probably not all obviously he's got other sick twisted things going on but a lot of this is really it seems very attention seeking it very much is it gets worse he starts to send like Puzzles this one's mailed to that same TV station that he had contacted before it's got a fake ID for himself some sort of manuscript for a book about his biog the BTK biography find the word type puzzle and it's got uh prowl and Fantasies um interestingly later like much later some internet sleuths are kind of like going over this whole letter and they they discover on there the last name of the killer like his real last name and the numbers of his address were hidden in that puzzle so he was almost trying to out himself is that what you're saying no he thought he was smarter than the police don't they all he thought he was playing an elaborate Spy game an elaborate some sort of cat and mouse game with the police and that and that they were in this type of back and forth of Mastermind criminal and and the detection you know so then February 2nd the TV station k a ke same one he's contacted before gets a postcard from the BTK killer it's the second one they'd gotten that week and both postcards pointed to a um a location he started leaving seral boxes around town this one was on a a rural road in Sedwick County up against a sign it was a seral box and on the front of it the letters BTK were printed and inside this box was a was a Barbie doll that had its clothes taken off uh and it was hung from a pipe what the holy hell so he was trying you know call back to Josephine's killing right and and he he left multiple Cal boxes maybe the term serial killer now in the 2000s is a thing so maybe they think this might be a joke haha serial killer these cial boxes and he's also thanking the the TV station for their quick response and for their efforts and getting his his name out he's this one postcard the return name is s killet and it has the return address 83 North Edgemore which is the same address the ottero family lived at and he numbers each each letter that he sends and this one's number seven of eight I guess and they've sent all of them to they send all of them to the FBI for analysis but they're not finding anything so one of the letters written to the police department this one I don't know one of I guess one of the serial boxes was found in the back of a truck or something and there was a letter and in it he asked the police department if his writings could be traced back to him if he used a floppy disc like they'd tell the truth smart right so they post an ad in the witchat eagle a big full page ad and say of course not we're not going we can't track you through a floppy disc totally safe to use so on February 16th the BTK killer sends into the TV station a floppy disc with a letter and some information to the police now by 2005 can I just say technology has advanced a lot since the 70s is this guy dumb well he's been killing since the 70s so he's probably our parents age which means he doesn't know technology very well thankfully thankfully so what happened is of course they could trace him this idiot had used a floppy disc that he had erased from his work so in the metadata the words Christ Lutheran Church and Dennis come up are you telling me that this guy was a part of church so they did a simple Google search and the name Dennis Raider came up as the church's president Christ Lutheran Church the president is one Dennis Raider oh my God literally this is kind of circumstantial but they're pretty sure they've got their guy so what they do his daughter was in college wait he has kids he has two kids and a wife he has a daughter and he killed kids so who's killing this guy real quick so his daughter is in college so the police get a warrant and they they get a Pap smear from her last checkup and they check it for DNA oh [ __ ] then they match that DNA to the 31y old swatches of back from oh yeah from underneath poor little Josephine's body that's not the last time he left DNA evidence crime scene they had it though they had kept it though they had kept it and they some of it worked and they were able to get match DNA and so they knew Dennis Raider was the BTK killer oh my God married father of two president of the church a Boy Scout Troop leader and an Air Force veteran what what the actual [ __ ] happened to this guy how do you go from all of those things to this thing like I I got no words there's nothing shell in most serial killers now serial killers and killers in general tend to follow a lot of patterns they have a shitty childhood they've been abused there's sexual abuse there's torturing animals other than torturing animals he had a perfectly normal childhood totally normal did they ever figure out where this is all coming from in his head oh yeah he'll tell you so I'll tell you march Dennis Raider was born March 9th 1945 in Pittsburgh Kansas United States of America he had a totally normal childhood perfectly normal family no abuse no nothing but he says he knew at a young age that he wanted to hurt people one of his first sexual gratification memories where he knew he was different was he saw his grandmother tie up a chicken to make for dinner she tied the legs of this chicken and then chopped its head off and when all the other kids ran screaming he got a [ __ ] heart on and he said that's when he knew he was a little different than other kids yeah good observation very accurate yeah and also you know kids play Cowboys and Indians back then and when he would get tied up by the other little boys he said quote found the experience of being utterly helpless erotic oh my God he says he never looked at porn but he did keep what he called slick ads he had code words for all sorts of things and he would take index cards and he' cut out pictures of women and put them on these index cards and draw like nooses and gags and other sick [ __ ] on them and he'd carry them around and look at them and get off to them wow one of the things that he does have in common in his childhood with other Killers is that he did torture animals and he got off on it he he hung a dog and he hug a pet dog and a pet cat he liked hanging so he called his dick Sparky well if that isn't a a very expressive statement I don't know what is no wonder he had issues and he called getting turned on by bondage and torture Sparky big time and to him an orgasm was the Big G I'm not sure why so the reason why he said he did this is he said he had a demon inside of him and the demon would make him do things he also said that he had some sort of factor x this mysterious component that made him want to kill and he he thought he had some sort of uh he thought he was special he had some sort of aberration so he used this whole code he thought he was some sort of great spy partly because of this elaborate fantasy that he had that's how he was able to keep his serial killer Persona separate from his I'm a family man president of the church Boy Scout Troop leader have a daughter and a son totally normal dude Act was because he he compartmentalized it he had this Fantasy Life and then he had this other life they were totally opposite totally opposite oh one of the things that really liked and you should look into this for a future episode have have you ever heard of HH homes and the Murder Castle no let me write that down yeah HH Holmes is is considered to be America's first serial killer even though that term wasn't applied at the time he murdered somewhere between 20 and 200 people he built a hotel specifically to kill people in Chicago oh my God and ra was super impressed with HH Holmes and he loved the hotel and he fantasized about building his own Murder Castle and he wanted at the bottom of it he called it the DP dtpg room death to Pretty Girls sick [ __ ] but he loved women's lingerie and he did break into houses as a teenager and stole women's laundry and would dress up in them and would what he liked to do is dress up in this lingerie and then tie himself up and pretend to be one of his victims to the point where that's how he was able to maintain so many years between victims is he would take these Trinkets and these pictures that he had taken and he would dress himself up in their stuff and then tie himself up like the way I'll put a link to some of the pictures in the show notes it's really creepy wow W what so who these guys drank the Kool-Aid or something he would hide all these different trinkets in different places he called hidey holes all around the city and he doesn't even remember which ones he has but he would dress himself up like he'd wear a woman's face mask and women's clothing and he'd tie himself up and take pictures of himself and then he'd masturbate to those pictures and he swears that his sex life with with his wife was totally normal and that was he was completely faithful to her where is the wife and all of this did anybody talk to this chick yes she moved out as soon as she found out she left nobody knew she had no idea no nobody knew nobody knew he is one he truly kept everything a secret and when he'd go to on business trips or out with the Boy Scouts he would try to like seclude himself he sometimes he would call them Motel parties and he would put himself into these women's lerie tie himself up self asfixiate with bags and then masturbate and he said he preferred to suffocate a partner but he didn't want to involve his wife in it so he just did it to himself and other people yeah so he would kind of relive these things by looking at the photographs of of them and himself and using their clothing these photos are so sick he says he almost got caught one time because on a Boy Scout camping trip he made up an excuse to leave for a little while and went out in the woods to hang himself from a tree wearing lingerie and he was gone so long they like went looking for him I guess and he almost got caught oh wow yeah but his daughter she says on a 2020 interview in 2019 she swears they had no idea this I feel so badly for her and for her family they had no clue that her dad was a serial killer during the trial for him he talked about these killings he described them in detail you can you can listen to them and he there's a book my research there was a book called confession of a serial killer the untold story of Dennis Raider the BTK killer it's by Dr Katherine ramsland and it's it's she's not a ghost writer or anything she pretty much just lets him talk and he does and she says she knows some of it's probably not true because he does have an overinflated S of himself but he'll he'll tell you all about it why he did it what he did it's it's gross it's sick but he's in jail is he still alive he's still alive why because the murders were committed before the serial kill uh before the death penalty was instituted so our tax dollars are paying to keep this guy alive correct yes he's serving 10 consecutive life terms in prison for a minimum of 175 years without the possibility of parole oh and I heard a funny story I don't know if this is true or not I saw in a comment I think of a YouTube video so take that for what it's worth but it's a funny story nonetheless so someone apparently knows someone who is a who works at the jail where Dennis Raider is imprisoned and apparently uh Dennis was looking out a window and some Gardener flipped him off and he got mad and so he filed a complaint you know oh poor you and so they got on the loudspeaker of the jail and they're like uh whoever flipped off Dennis Raider please don't do that again he really doesn't like it like over the loudspeaker to the general population of the jail how many middle fingers do you think that [ __ ] got after that I you know I'm surprised with with what I've learned over the years about the the jail systems in America I'm surprised he's still alive to be completely honest I'm surprised that he somebody hasn't got him being honest considering he did kill two little kids and that's usually a death sentence in jail so I'm actually surprised that he's still around so he was just he just to The Bitter End was proud of himself then yeah what a piece of crap absolute piece of [ __ ] just piece of [ __ ] you know on the bright side he was caught yeah he's caught he's serving his time and he'll never get out I was gonna say 175 years is a long time good luck buddy and he was caught because he's a dumb [ __ ] I mean I'm glad he's a dumb [ __ ] narcissist he's a narcissistic [ __ ] and yeah I'm really glad I'm really glad actually I just you know did the floppy disc I get baffled by like legit dual personality [ __ ] it baffles me like and the fact that the wife had no idea the church had no idea the Boy Scouts had no idea his his government job had no idea like how the photographs they found in his little Treasure Chest included pictures of dead women posed in [ __ ] bondage positions in the church inside the church now I got a lot of problems personally with the church but that's taken a little far and and I hope that that church got raised to the ground after that I would not want to celebrate there I definitely would not want to celebrate there imagine being that congregation and finding this out like some that's like some legit horror to these people these are some God-fearing people down there and they their world was probably rocked just knowing that that man was a part of their congregation like how [ __ ] the president he wasn't just a member of the congregation he was the president of the church I don't know what that means to be honest I don't either I don't either but it sounds important president sounds more more important than regular congregant right and a Boy Scout leader and imagine all those parents think you know he was their kids Boy Scout leader imagine the terror and and just the terror oh I cannot imagine his poor wife his poor kids she divorced him that same year which good on her but damn that's hard how do you that's got to require a lot of therapy I hope she's gotten it I hope they I wish them peace and unfortunately they have to live with the association because you know unless they've literally changed their names yeah they gotta live with that Association so he didn't he didn't only murder all of those people and and change the lives of the people who were able to get away throw his down the toilet but he also dragged his wife and kidw them and that is just selfishness in its purest form yeah yeah [ __ ] what a [ __ ] so there's my story I'm going to eat more chocolate and pretzels and smoke more really good pot I just got to say for the record I'm totally this is an East Coast wind because your story was just a downer Debbie and not not that Emily's Bridge was a light and love and lovey story but you know good ghost I agree I'm going to go with you your story definitely wins I want to go there this is a that was a fun ghost story I'm spooked I'm I'm chilled I'm titillated I want to have scratches on my car and the BTK killer is
