welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and this is another episode in our quest for a powerful spell craft summer beaches in bikinis have a Carefree Vibe but that's certainly not the feeling of this summer so we're looking for something with a little more sex appeal and by that I mean boundary spells and baneful magick because nothing says it's stress-free summer like energetically evicting toxic people from your life and reclaiming your piece one curse at a time and I'm sure she'll and I think the best thing I've heard all day is energy ejection AJ that's right you know I wanted to definitely bring this to folks attention because we're living in some crazy times and we need some boundaries set and you know sometimes it's hard right now to find a safe spot for yourself and your being and so what we want to kind of help you create a safe space for yourself and and kind of give that back off  to those who need it and with the Itchy ass hole spell being as popular as it is we also want to give you know those who needed a little extra each this summer magic can be use to help you clean your piece magic can be used to help you have a stress-free life and sometimes to keep your peace you might need to do a little bit of baneful magick may be a little hex maybe a little curse As a treat sometimes you need to set those boundaries in a very powerful and strong way now let's talk a minute because there's going to be folks that are going to go my gosh you can't do that so let's talk a minute let's talk about the rule of three people will bring up the wiccan rule of three or the law 3 or sometimes those talk about Karma no I just want to point out something that you just said that that may just kind of fly over people but the  he is really kind of a Wiccan thing so I think the biggest thing I want to point out first and foremost is folks that are Wiccan don't necessarily follow the rule of three cuz it's a weekend thing that's right at the wiccan rede is a verse it was written by Doreen Valiente in 1964 and it is eight words the wiccan rede fulfill and it harm none do what you well and that it was written in a longer form by Lady gwenne Thompson in the early 70s this is been around for a little while and it's basically the idea that what you do for bad will come back to you 3 or 10 times as strong it's kind of loosely based on the idea of Karma and you know like the boomerang effect but I got to stay Leila there are times where I am okay with what comes back around absolutely and I don't necessarily believe in the rule of three we  I'm done an episode on this we both do believe that what goes around comes around and that for you know I might not believe in the rule of three but I do believe in Newton's third law hahaha which is for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction that's mess science thank you very much and I do believe that that applies in Magic and just like in science it's not exactly a hundred percent true because there's things that will affect that there's friction there's gravity those Mass things will prevent it from being equal and opposite same thing is true and Magic there are things that will prevent your spell going out from having an equal and opposite Boomerang effect fate towards their magic your magic the time of day the time of the year there's all sorts of things that could prevent that well let's talk for a second about what what would you tell I I've got my own answer but what would you tell someone who says but does that make me a bad person or bad witch it was a naive  for setting boundaries hell no setting boundaries is important taking care of yourself will tell you to set boundaries protecting yourself is important and I very strongly believe that if someone hurts you you have every right to handle that shit in any way you see fit or you know I also apply that rules to my children oh yeah absolutely people that I love if someone comes at you you do not need to turn the other cheek that is not always the right response you don't want to see the other Gemini side of me and while I am very much I go along and get along with their our line and the people yeah and you do need to process your anger you do need to process your heart and people do need to get in trouble for what they have done and sometimes that involves making sure that they get what they deserve and just like when you punch somebody in the face or someone punches you and your face Justice isn't always linear and it's not always perfect but we work with what we say  we're just staying going around on Facebook and I love it so much have the days that you deserve that is a beautiful hacks I love that and if you deserve great you get if you deserve shit you are getting a heaping pile a steamy shit in a lot of the magic that we're going to talk about is Magic that is definitely fueled by the recipient by the recipients actions curses and hexes part of their power comes in the belief of them by the recipient part of their power also comes from the actions of the recipient a lot of these are sour jars or mirror spells or have the day that you deserve spell which is like a mirror spell it basically bouncing their own energy back to them so they really do kind of get what they give out absolutely and you know just because you are are setting boundaries and creating kind of a safe little bubble for yourself that doesn't make you a bad person  and putting it out to the universe that you want someone to get what they're putting out back that's not making you a bad person because you're just asking for them to get what they are putting out if they're putting out some shine and Roses they're going to get that all day long it's up to them what they get back and if you have been wrong then you decide you need to be the dark goddess of Revenge and Vengeance rock on with your bad self man that's fine if that happens to sometimes that's necessary now most of the time again hexes and curses the way a lot of practitioners will use them as more like we've said is boundary setting is protecting themselves and a lot of these are you know how they say look at an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure set up your protections and that's why you should kind of practice your Wars and protections even if you don't need them back to studying circles. Just setting boundaries practice talking to the energies around you for protection  Ashley when you don't need them cuz you need to learn to swim before you're drowning kind of thing exactly and you know I think I think one thing that I kind of like about this is this time of year especially with what's going on in the world right now especially you know we need to kind of all create our own little safe spaces and that's how we're going to stay sane through this all right so you said safe space and that kind of reminds me I have a little story for you oh my god Layla's making a left turn again I do it again you taught me well turns out what does this is on topic I promised many years ago my mother worked in an office that had one person in particular that was very disruptive to the whole group so this was a group of about 10/12 people who worked in one large room no walls are dividers or anything and it's one particular person cause everyone to have bad days regularly that talks  so my somewhat witchy mother came to me and said is there anything that you can think of that would help this person leave because she didn't want a promotion she didn't want to move job she loves where she was she had been there longer than anyone else and often said she would never leave that office so mom wanted to know anything we could do I said this is the perfect opportunity for some hot foot powder powder mostly comes from who do Andrew twerk its folk magic so you'll find it in all sorts of different American folk magic traditions and basically the idea with powder is to have somebody get up and go either they can't cross the hot foot powder to get to your house they just feel restless and need to leave or if you put it this is a type of foot track magic so you put it in where their feet go it will cause their feet to get hot and itchy and make them want to move along so I can buy in a little bit of hot foot powder with a little bit of Road opener it with the idea being  that this person needs to leave where they're at and go someplace else where they'll be happier when should you know there's nothing wrong with that perfectly fine you are not harming you are not putting any bad shit out to someone you just get up and move along my friend so this is still a hacks this is still light little curse but the idea is to bring peace and Harmony to the office so this worked what my mother did is with the help of other people in the office for 3 days before this person came in they sprinkled the hot foot powder under her desk where her feet go I loved your mother so much wouldn't you know it by the end of the third day at job was posted in another building and this woman was so excited the woman who vowed never to leave this office jumped at the chance to take this job in another building and got it and left now it works so well that people in the office decided to come and ask for more hot foot powder and of course I kept working  next person I believe it took about five days and their spouse got transferred military spouse got transferred across the country so they left as well so it worked beautifully work wonderfully I have a question that's killing everybody there any repercussions back 100% And I won't warn my mother of these consequences shortly after this happened I moved several hours away from my mother in the same state and then very quickly after that I moved across the country coincidence or consequence to what my mother was putting out the magic that she was putting out there do you know maybe there is consequences of the other point to this is also that just because something is a curse doesn't necessarily mean it's going to hurt someone there's no magic that you did or magic that she did to help someone move along to help someone not only help the office be more harmonious and peaceful but to also help  person find a place where they will fit in better and maybe they will find more peace and Harmony in their life with a ton of toxic people they didn't fall and Brilliant that's perfect so yeah so these types of magic doesn't always have to necessarily be painful and I think that's a good point because I think when people think of hexes and curses they're thinking some deep dark horse things that aren't necessarily the case you know like with with our summer spell that we're going to talk about this is really it's not about harming anybody when I tell you to harm anybody we want you to set boundaries so that no one harms you write some of these other types of magic that our boundary setting magic our findings and we'll talk about good and bad for binding freezer magic freezer spells that's a type of finding and I guess there are some people that would consider that to be a tie  text or a curse also spell jars and jars yeah you know you put some some broken glass to do this but I think it's important to talk about the consequences as well because there are times when the consequences they're worth it like let's just say for example that you ended up moving to California because of helping your mother with hot foot spell I hated it I was I was very angry but you moving to California for a few years was actually good for you and your family right exactly exactly so it might be hard mother and I  you're right back to me right back to the east coast now before you do any type of baneful magick any types of hex word even though the quote unquote less harmful kinds like I did with a hot foot spell for my mother you really need to do a lot of self-reflection you know a lot of times we do those quick hexes and curses without even thinking about it somebody steals your parking spot and may you have the day you deserve her may you step on a Lego or explode you know lying is a sin in some religions show  so we do those people do those little hexes and that's another good reason to have your Wars and your protections and then do regular cleansing cuz you know those little icky things accumulate even if they're not rational but if you're actually going to do a real working it requires reflection you need to know what you're doing you need to fully accept what you're doing and you need to be prepared to put out that type of energy so definitely start off any type of curse or baneful work figure out why why are you doing this another good point to make is these aren't the best things to do when you're at your peak of anger right if you are really upset and you are really angry and you are really hurt you need to take a moment take a step back maybe you need to meditate in Layla's famous words Journal but you don't want to be doing these things with a shit ton of anger in your heart because you're going to be the one receiving the bad end of that stick if you  you can be upset you can be hurt you can be angry but you don't want to be doing this when you're like at the height of those emotions or you're really not doing yourself any favors and will most likely be projecting that back on yourself unfortunately yeah and then you need to be brutally honest because there's been times in my life when I have been extremely angry and it was my own damn fault so you're pushing out there this bad energy and you're the one at fault you really want to be careful with that so calm down reflect be honest if you were going to do the spell out of pettiness out of Cruelty those are not the reasons to do a curse or baneful magick because then you are going to be the one at all to mately going to be directed back at and we keep saying that and I just want to point out that a lot of times yes that works and sometimes it doesn't because shit happens and the universe is weird and so sometimes you'll have bad  what happened to you for no fucking reason and sometimes bad people will have good shit happen to them for the same thing and we don't always get to control that so just understand it just like there's people in the world that we might want to do baneful magick against right now that aren't getting consequences for their actions sometimes no matter how hard you try magically bad people don't get consequences for their actions then you know I think I agree with that but I also think that everybody gets their karma in due time and it's not up to any one of us to decide when that dude time is so you know what if there is anybody out there in the world anything that's kind of orange the karma will come around Karma will come around but here's the other thing you don't want to focus all your time and attention on just doing baneful magick you know you can't you can't change the collective mind in my opinion  okay let's let's back up a second we've talked before about doing magic against large entities politicians insurance companies the mood whatever you're trying to do magic again weather magic is one that I like to use as an example have you ever taken any type of science class and heard like about friends like a storm front moving these huge masses of yeah I don't know the numbers off the top of my head but I learned that pushing those takes an incredible amount of energy to push a large wall of air is insanely difficult so people who say that they can do weather magic or either extremely extremely powerful or just getting lucky with their weather magic because being able to move something that large takes a lot of energy and so if you're going to spend all your energy trying to hex up politician or a person who has a cult behind them a cult of energy they have a ton of energy from people that like them appreciate them thank pause  hopefully about them that's very difficult to fight through your potion that train uphill right so you might better be putting your energy towards small things you your local place people around you you know your area put that magic put that energy into making those things better because you can very often have a much more powerful reaction and those collectively add up to very bigger reactions a hundred percent agree with you but I do also I just want to mention that I do also believe that let's say for example you were in a large group of witches which he minded people and you collectively as a group we're trying to do something then maybe but but I think we're specifically talking about individuals and please do it I mean if you want to throw your energy that way absolutely people should work towards what they want but I'm just saying that don't be surprised  can you put all this energy into it it doesn't work immediately because a lot of times there's other like we said earlier in the episode there's a lot of other forces that you have to think of think of it it with science there's friction is gravity is mass you got to worry about all of that isn't necessarily changing the collective or that old Ozzy Osbourne episode where he's trying to build a bonfire on the beach and the Tide's coming in and he's back ocean back you can't fight the tide sometimes as much as you might want to say I feel like I've argued with the ocean before so I totally get it and everyone needs to have their own argument with the ocean and succeed or fail and figure that out for yourself because there's some time when tilting against that windmill is 100% worth it to you absolutely just just remember that you know you are going to sometimes get back you know you're going to have the  you deserve as well and I think that just because you're doing any baneful magick or any type of hex work if it's warranted I wouldn't be so concerned about the boomerang effect because if you are coming from a place of pureness you're good man adding on the end if this comes back to me made it only come in wisdom and strength or something like that or me this energy me the energy I put out only returned in Beauty and power expecting everything to fit perfectly from the shoulders to the to the ways to the app so I can help I mean that intense can help build a little barrier around you it's certainly can but it's not the end-all be-all you should do before you cast baneful magick before you cast a curse or a hex what should you do what type of things should you do to cleanse or protect yourself or ready or space  now I definitely I feel like any magic that I do I just always kind of do that ground send you no ground Center cleanse I think it's almost kind of ingrained in me that's kind of a given for me but I think after that actually let me rephrase that is a precursor to that you have to decide what you're going to do how you're going to do it and gather your tools and materials and if I'm going to be doing something like a boundary setting spell or even the even a hot foot spa or something like that I'm going to ground Center cleanse my space and cast a circle because I like that little extra protection and it's part of my routine and ritual makes me feel protected and in a safe space now if I'm going to do a working I'm going to do a curse like if I'm going to do something serious I do more than that there have been times when we have done some pretty hefty magic together and the wards and things that we put up around the house first  solid right and I think that anytime I'm doing this kind of magic I always use mirrors and even if I'm not using mirrors in the spousal itself or the working itself as a like you said kind of creating my little container of space so I kind of like to set up that mirror type blockage to anything this coming at me go right back to you anything this coming at me go right back to you I'm rubber you're glue type of spell beautiful mirror spells and bounce off me and hit you spell are fabulous because part of that if it takes all the work out of it all you have to do is maintain your Wards maintain your mirrors around you and they do all the hard work but there was a time way back in the day were you and I did some very powerful baneful magick that was a different situation I literally sealed  I'm warded all of my windows my doorway is all of my pipes my TV I even worded everything as a conduit to come into your home and so because that was like a super serious someone was wrong in a family member of mine and and I I had to handle it so I went the extra step you know the salt on the windows I even did the the choc sigils over my doorways I guess what you're doing how you're doing and who you're trying to project it to May dictate how much you want to secure space another thing like you were talking about stealing your space and portals and that's goes back to the mirror thing if you're using mirrors intentionally in your spell any mirrors or reflective surfaces around you that are not part of the spell many people in many Traditions feel that those need to either be sealed like she'll did with a Sigil or award or literally covered so that  can't be a portal to come into you that that doesn't allow your magic to escape before you're ready it doesn't allow the spirit world to spy in on you can be a sign of respect for the spirit world for that liminal space some people also say that it's so that you're doing a baneful working you don't see your own shade while you're doing the working there such thing as I think people forget and I have such a funny story from literally yesterday I am now at a part-time job which is freaking Fabulous by the way I love it so much we're going to wait a little bit before we say we're so I'm I'm at my fabulous fabulous new part-time job yesterday and my boss comes in and he's like there's something really important you need to know and he's like this is the most important thing above all and you know I'm going through the litany in my head in my car at you know we need to keep things clean we need to vacuum you don't be polite to people no in the buildings at the  top is in there is like typing all through the ceilings and the boss said that the most important thing and he's going to die giggling when he hears this the most important thing is to keep the lid on the toilet closed so that things don't come in and and then talked about how he had all the piping warded and I'm just like you know even the shiter can bring you shit sometimes you know flowing water is actually a conduit for energy so that kind of makes sense so it is his biggest thing is keep the toilet lid closed because you don't know what I thought was freaking fabulous alright well in the vein of you know toilet cleansing magic let's talk about my favorite way to set up a ward my favorite way to practice award this is the soap bubble method  nope we're going to go we're going to go to the cleaning part we're going to go with soap bubbles so what I like to do my favorite way to practice warding and to make sure that it's strong enough is all about visualization they're going to find a comfortable spot and it's summertime so hopefully in your part of the world that means picnics and Outdoors and kids playing with soap bubbles cuz who doesn't love you know are south of southern hemisphere friends right now or like ready to curse us were talking about summer Pines and imagine a beautiful summer day and playing with soap bubbles and then picture one of those soap bubbles at your very center your solar plexus like a couple inches above your belly button and imagine that there is a beautiful perfect so far all right there once you have that picture in your mind whether you can see it or think about it or describe it make it get bigger make it get bigger and bigger and bigger until you're almost like Glinda the Good Witch inside this  and Crown let's not forget the crown so get the soap bubble that you're used to in the summer time and when you're sitting inside take a hammer I like to use mall near Thor's hammer from the outside and swing it against that so football and smack it and now it should ring like a bell and stay solid if it breaks or pops you have to start over again when I finish realize this cuz you would have done this for years when I usually has the hammer just bouncing off in the whole bubble going to leave I should not break and if it does break start over it at pops for any reason Friday yet if it did that's right and just keep doing that until you can hit it with a hammer and it doesn't break it might be easier to  just make it big enough to cover your body first and then gradually make it bigger and bigger and bigger so you can make it as large as a full 13-person coven Circle without breaking and that is a beautiful war that is a fantastic War to put up around yourself before you do any type of working or you don't want energy in or out right now once we've got ourselves kind of kind of kind of in that safe bubble then what years were the magic comes in here's where you do your actual work in the biggest part of that shells going to say what would you say the biggest part of a spell is I think it's both of us saying the same thing as slightly different way your energy your intention you have to say what you want and then you have to power it that's what we mean by intention and energy say what you want  push the power into it so what you're saying is there steps to this yes Step 1 create your safe space step to Heather your energy I swear you're going to make me start singing New Kids on the Block you got to stop with the steps or we're going to start singing new kids but there are when you're looking at the steps you want to have everything you need prepared and ready prior to creating your little soap bubble I'm so that once you're in your soap bubble now you are ready to kind of plot and plan how am I going to execute what I need to execute yes now for back to fuck off type spells for the spells to protect your peace and protect your boundaries the ingredients are surprisingly literal if you know what something does sympathetic magic will tell you what it does magically so that's why when you see sour jar  hotfoot spells and things that are designed to keep people away you'll see a scotch bonnet peppers Chili Peppers of all types you'll see garlic you'll see gross things bent Nails nasty Nails urine blood spit dirt bike stuff that's right because you don't want to be around Yucca stuff makes sense. That's why these things have all those nasty things in it because you want to repeal someone you want to repel their energy push it away another thing I like when I'm doing this type of magic I always like to use something and I know you talked about the rusty nails and in the broken glass but I always like to use some type of for lack of a better word at the moment I met a natural thing that's pointy whether it be stinging nettle or a rose thorns or whatever the case may be kind of like that in my mind it's like I use those things too  create like a prickly barrier around me so that you can't get close enough to me or you're getting stabbed yep that's why you'll see brick dust sometimes in these because that's part of building a barrier building that up so I love that you said Layla bit like your ingredients want to be the things that aren't necessarily enjoyable or I am you want these people to stay away give them every reason to not want to be around you right I love that you brought up a couple different types of things that poke and prick you because you're going to want to use different things depending on the reason for the spell if this is an ex-lover that you need to back off rose thorns if this is a friend or family member maybe you want to use metal something a little more familiar something a little more but you might use for healing or soothing with the you might think his to me Leo you know you kind of make those correspondence is and we'll have another episode where we talked about correspondences and things but that's very very important when it  comes too painful magic let you know I goes back to my famous last words your ingredients combined with your intention is going to equal your results so if you want someone to literally shut their mouths maybe you'll grab a cow's tongue and use that and you'll put sharp Pokey things in that or maybe you literally so it up I'll be honest with you I can't do that freaks me out I can't even look at it was weird though she'll might take a lemon so sour and sharp to cut it like a mouth on the lemon stuff it full of baneful things Pokey things and while she doesn't she'll stay anytime you speak against Me Maybe acid rise in your throat and may the word sting like Metals until stuff at all. It shut and as you so it should say me your lips be sealed as the skin is sealed and I'm buried in rotten fruit to I would I would also suggest rotten fruit as well that's an excellent thing again the idea is things that bush people  if you want them to get away from you but gross stuff in it keep them away now that I am I relocated to a more ocean environment I've also done a couple of things with writing something is on paper putting some intention into paper and then putting it in the water when I know we're on the brink of being pulled away from the coast and you've written something is on paper and put it in the water at that particular time and then have the ocean just pull it away from me I love that because that's another example of letting the mother take care of a problem for you you're basically saying hey Mom I have this issue could you please take care of it for me and so putting it in the water writing it on a lease and burying in the dirt depending on how you get rid of it is going to determine how it gets taken care of if you burn it you want something fast and quick and hot and Powerful you put it in the water you  but I'd seen that you wanted to go out and change and be transformed the same thing with burying it that's going to transform it slowly and maybe make it grow into something else so depending on how you get rid of it how you let them take care of it that Association lends itself to your spelling gives it a little bit of that energy to me ten years ago didn't trees I was told this recently that and I love this so much when you are using the restroom and you're having a moment to yourself in the restroom think about the fact that the person or the thing that you're looking to get rid of while you are handling your restroom business and then as you are using your toilet paper wipe that person away and then flush him I've seen where you write the person's name on the toilet paper before you  I was going to stay home tonight after I get him out of your life throwing them in the garbage throw the spell remnants in the garbage because that's where you want that person where that energy to go I so think of what you what it means for that correspondence Peterson more like protector space energy like putting someone in a freezer or finding someone in one of our episodes not too long ago she'll you said something that one of our listeners asked about and that was you said I don't want to be bound to everyone don't do a binding all the time because you don't want to be bound to the whole world that a little bit you know  never been big on binding spells because maybe it's just the way I think about it but I feel like it create something that I don't want to create it creates a tithe and I don't know why the hell would I bind you to myself if I'm trying to get rid of you was talking about is when we were taught about binding spells this goes back to consequences of your actions and consequences of magic now when you buying someone very often in the spell you were literally tying them in the Practical Magic uses I I bind you from harming yourself or others I find you whatever your name was from harming yourself or others and you're wrapping the cord around it and tying it there is a very strong belief and if it fits with the energetic magic with the sympathetic magic that when you tie a cord to find someone you're literally binding yourself your energy to that person so what shall means if you do a binding to prevent some  from harming or or whatever your binding them from or two I feel like I'm tying myself to that person you have now bound at least a little bit or a lot of bit of your energy to that person so you are now bound to them for good or for bad and in some way and so right and do a lot of witches won't do bindings for that reason unless it's really necessary we'll do some other type of magic to keep their energy separate and that's definitely how I feel because I have always been of the thought that why on Earth would I buy into believing a tiniest little piece of myself just freezer spells are similar because although you have Frozen them and stop them they're still in your freezer if you ever move or you need to clean out your freezer or you need a new freezer now you got to do something with them so that's not getting them out of your life as a friend of pausing things for a little bit to me or more for a pause when you need something to cool off when you need something to wait for Al  while while you would handle something else or get into a better place and then deal with it it's not a forever thing you have done for us on family because sometimes you like they're your family and you can't get rid of them but you need them just to shut the hell up so yeah I'm all for freezer spells on family but I also I wouldn't do for you to respond with some random people for the same thing I'm trying to get you don't get those things out of my life not keep them literally in my fridge yeah I tend to do freezers bells on certain family members every Thanksgiving and then I told him out after I've had to deal with them then I saw them out sometimes I don't even go to Thanksgiving the other one that I see a lot of people do is the candle cord-cutting spell which you know not really a fax or being full but it is protecting your peace Magic  but a lot of times they do it very much like a binding instead of cutting the cord and being done with it they obsess over it to themselves for longer that's right how did this burn what does it mean what does this wax mean why did it do this why did it do that everything has a mean and not everything happened because of whatever sometimes it just it is and more importantly when you cut the cord you're not supposed to obsess over the wise and the house and what does it mean you're supposed to cut it and be done and just get rid of it not think about it anymore that goes literally back to my whole thing out intention so if you are focusing like oh my God the wax looks like a bird or you know you're you're focusing so much on this cord cutting are you really cutting the cord you really binding it to yourself exactly so when you do these things be clear on your attention know exactly why you're doing it and make sure that what you're doing in the spell follows the intent  because of your intention is to do a cord cutting corn to be done with it but what you're doing in the spell is still thinking about them and talking about them and asking about them that's that's not really a court Friday so make sure that what you do in the spell make sense with your intention and I think that goes right back to you need to take that time prior and kind of reflect and in, there's from a place of clarity and not a place of hurt and out of place of anger or or what whatever this this is where you do with the whole meditate on it think about it you know virtually plan this out in your head before doing it so that you're not being contradictory in your magic and sometimes doing the spell can be a way to come to terms with those feelings maybe you have a lot of anger and fear and rage build up and you need to channel that energy in a better direction to heal yourself and to take care of yourself  so you can direct that into something you know say You're really upset over the way a court case turned out and you don't know what's going to happen at some issues at work what you really want this promotion your boss has a complete douchebag and is constantly on your case and you want them to back off for a little bit until this promotion goes through so maybe you make a puppet of this person they're constantly on your case they're mean to you they say belittling things you and you really need them to back off so you make a puppet of this person and you channel into that pocket all of your anger with them all of your frustration maybe you stay to them all the things that you can't stay at work and tell them to back off and leave you alone and then pin their hands together cover their mouth with a little bit of tape so that they can't talk against you I was literally just thinking duct tape duct tape their feet so that they can't walk across your path and cause problems put all of  anger and that energy into that say what you need to say get it all out and then throw it into the garbage which is where their negative influence over you belongs in the garbage away from you that can help you keep the boundary that can help you keep your peace at work and that can help you put up a wall between you and that person to try and prevent their energy from affecting your energy and doing that can also help you from not obsessing over the issue and being counterproductive to your spouse exactly if you're constantly worried about what this boss might say or what they might do at work that's going to create an unhealthy energy for you and unhealthy feelings at work so you can Channel all of that into a spell just like she'll said that'll give you much more peace of mind at work and I think that when you do something like that don't you know I love popits they're super fun but then there's always the end now what when you are making things  spell jar or a sour jar whatever the case maybe there's the end then what and now what you know how do I dispose of this how do I get rid of this make that a part of your spouse with popits I like burning them I make a papa I do what I need to do with it and then I kept it all off with lightness shit on fire I think the last step up vet is the enzyme what are you doing with either your papa or your jar or you know the piece of paper you've written you know it's it's the invent what I think burying things burning things I love burning things that you said that because so many people wanted will what do I do with the remnants of the spell you should have thought of that before you spell I like it to match what I want to happen like we we talked about a little bit earlier if you're burning it that's making something happen fast  putting it out to the universe you know that energetically it's destroying it very quickly maybe something needs to die in a fire and that's your energy or maybe it just needs to be consumed then go to the university pens on your point it might just be things that just need to be burned away maybe it needs to get thrown in the garbage like your stinky asked needs to get thrown in the trash because their trash it if it's a jar spell it could be something like you know what I just need to bury it be done with it some issues in your life you just need to bury and be done with it rocks it turns into something else and very often it can turn into something better that can help you all good things so make your jar out of an egg shell with all your stuff in there so that way you don't have to worry about bearing and it can actually compost to become part of the earth and transmuted so if you need Transportation energy if you want whatever this bad thing was to be change slowly over time into something good  . if you needed to be pulled away and washed in the ocean put it in running water because running water will move something along move things forward or move it away from you put it in the toilet again if you need that running water to pull it away from you but it's also kind of shity put it in the toilet to get rid of fire and if you make a jar jar like an actual jar at those are supposed to be long-term spells if you're burying an actual jar jar that's usually something on your property that you're going to be Steward for a long time not something you're just going to put willy-nilly out in the woods and also jars are mostly for visual spell she put the spell in there to have a certain look to it so that whenever you look at it or someone else looks at it reactivate Andre powers that spell it was really no other reason to put a spell in a jar but again like I said you know you want to make sure that you're doing the inventing what piece of it  I know you don't want to be doing any sort of baneful magick and then keep that you do on your Fireside mantle for the next two years but again like you said you know these are things that you need to think about prior to the spell not like okay I did this a week ago what do I do with this jar now and also make sure that you're ready for the energetic requirements of doing a spell in the freezer spell doesn't require a lot of energy you know you put their name in there you can put some energy into it with your intention and you toss it in the freezer and it's done but some of these bigger working somebody wronged you and you need to make sure that they get out of your life and don't hurt you or anyone else ever again energy and that's not usually something that are beginner is ready for or capable of so do smaller spells first practice get used to handling that energy get used to the feel of that energy before you  price to a bigger working going back to our episode on energy work you know you really need to you need to be able to work with that energy and if you are new then you need to maybe focus a little bit on energy work first before you start jumping into two baneful hexing needing safe space all of those are part of baneful magick but they're all part of all magic and try practicing those parts will get you stronger for the rest of it and it kind of goes back in the beginning when we said like preventative protection magic is important even if you're not being attacked right now because you don't want to have to learn to swim when your drowning you want to have those skills now when you're safe before you need them you know I have heard this I think since Pre-K and it's not wrong practice makes perfect you know practice creating a little soap bubble practice putting up your mirrors in your wall  words and all of these things because like you said you don't want to have to be floundering when the moment comes where you need these skills yeah and a lot of us have one co-worker or that person in the lake group or the cooking class on Wednesday night so whatever there was that one person that constantly has negative energy and is shooting daggers and you just need them to back off put up those energies practice putting up those mirrors and those Wards to bounce that energy back to them and protect your peace protect your space so I actually came up with a spell I was thinking of kind of a kind of you don't along our theme of just kind of backed the fuck off man I need a stress-free summer and you're killing my vibe so what I came up with to put in my egg shell I've got garlic  now because some of what I what I would maybe do this for could potentially involve a family member so I do have rose thorns so I got garlic rose thorns cayenne pepper cornmeal blacks all but I also put in an obsidian Stone in a rose quartz with black salt is the rose quartz has me intrigued because like I said this this kind of involves you know this isn't just some Joe Schmo off the street you know a little more family-oriented so the obsidian is repelling negativity at the Rose Court is to try to kind of Foster and create a more loving atmosphere so these are ingredients not to banish this person from your life but more to get rid of the negative and and Foster more positive rose quartz loving energy if I had to name this spell I probably be able to stop you  douche man  describe within that alright keep going I love it also with it you know everything I do of this nature I always include me or so there's a mirror involved and either a red purple or black candle now the red in the purple eyes again it kind of like what the rose quartz you know I'm not trying to like make this person go away forever I just need them to kind of take a step back and be like huh you know I'm kind of an asshole and you should stop being that way I would say red would be for adding a little extra power black would be for a little extra protection and neutralizing the situation and purple could be for sovereignty for you having control of the situation and for that person being more chill and that's what I need I need for this person to be a little more chill so that's why for my particular one it might seem weird that I'm using rose quartz as well as rose thorns make sense can also replace those things with say stinging nettle or  you know I love you backs because they like stick to you they're prickly and stick it to you so it's like that love keeps on giving great if they need to learn a lesson and have it stick exactly the Saudis are kind of components that I I came up with specifically for for the type of thing that I'm looking to do but if you do you can kind of replace anything out with something that suits you or your need a little better just because I'm using the the rose quartz in the rose thorns you might want to use no stone is it all and all stinging nettle maybe you want to use sulfur you can use match head sulfur to you can use any type of urine cat urine particularly cat poo and Cat Noir and I find a lot in baneful spells you can use vinegar vinegar is another one to get rid of somebody I've seen people make a like almost like a tea out of heating up vinegar and  baneful herbs which the sounds awful before I've used Windex not going to lie clean them right out of your life was perfect but anything's better mustard seeds screws Licorice and graveyards are a lot of people talk about using graveyard dirt quick disclaimer don't take graveyard if you're not allowed to be there like please don't go to Salem and start scraping up graveyard you going to get in big trouble like big trouble right but graveyard dirt from an ancestor is wonderful protection there's all sorts of different reasons why you might take graveyard dirt and why it's really good but it's very powerful and you should do all sorts of things before you take the graveyard dirt but instead of graveyard I have two different things that you can use that are a little less potent but sometimes you might want that you tell so you can take a little bit of dirt from a dead plant still living right now by the way  graveyard dirt can be substituted with dirt from a dead plant or can also be substituted with dirt that is under or near roadkill oh that's a good one I never thought of that as well as I had one time I had this ex-husband still like pee outside all the time he was a weirdo I don't know can't explain it and I have actually gone out before I dug out in the backyard of my house dug up some of that dirt that had Layla really been peed and and you just kept moving on  watching where you leave your tag like people so those are all sorts of wonderful things to put in the Shell so so what else would you Rochelle spell show the last piece of it was writing and I had shows and you know me I do not ever right and blacking but for this type of magic I would write in Black Ink on the white eggshell it might be a name they might be a phrase like it's an eggshell you it's not like you're writing out a whole spell on an eggshell here so just something that's kind of pointed to that spell for me it would particularly with the name but you can doctor it anyway you want and then literally just bury it in the yard with all of those things in it now of course you're thinking to yourself while you know you don't want to bury stones and then there's a copy out with the candle to this stones in the candle what I would do with that is not necessarily put it in the shell  what I've done before is I have buried the eggshell and then you know replace the dirt Yerberia to the dirt back over at your back to flush land again I have burned the candle above where it was buried had kind of a Stones placed around the candle and when I do this type of thing I do not cleanse and reuse the stones I do get rid of them I like that you put the name on the shell in the lot of these spells you want to add something called at a Glock and what that is is something that identifies the person that the spell is intended to hit so I named their name names are very powerful if you put their name in there that works if you don't know their name right everything you can think about them like an optional most concentrate on that person concentrate on what they did concentrate on following energetically back what they did to that person and write it down as much as you can that's enough of a tag lock if you've got their hair  spit bodily fluids blood skin all of those things work threads from clothing that they wear regularly makeup that they use all the time at their favorite pen you know something that is intrinsically associated with that person is a padlock and so you can use that for the spell to directly go to that person know if you were doing this type of thing what would be some ingredients that you might use and how might you put them together a lot of them I'm very literal and end for spells like this I tend to use a lot of Chili's and a lot of get away from me Tech stuff I don't tend to do a lot of this type of spell because I'm more of a put the mirrors up put up my Wards and walk on with my life I have too much going on to worry about some petty-ass hole so I put up the mirrors they get whatever they put out doesn't affect me that's actually let's talk about that real quick that's actually a really good point because a big part of this magic is accepting it or not  you said that before part of it is has you believing in it and if you think that if you totally believe in it or not that's going to affect the spell I have at most confidence in my words and my protections and my cleansing so I seriously doubt you're going to get past my ancestors my Wards my spirit Guardian so I'm not too worried about it but if I was and I felt that I needed to do some baneful magick towards someone I do like peppers I like hot I like stinging I like it to leave a mark and I like it to make a point so I will put a lot of pointy things in there at your house the one thing I have done in the past with someone who particularly needed to learn their own lessons is I've done a spell like this with the peppers the vinegar the nasty T the cat urine the spiky things and I put it in a spell  directed it towards them we totally need to do an episode on how you collect cat urine cuz I'm curious. Clumping litter you send that energy out to them but like you said with the Burdock's you want that to stick to them and have that kind of follow them around so I like to put that energy into an Edgar car into a spot form sometimes it's a dragon sometimes it's in the other entity and that follows that person and it's almost like a angels and Devils on your shoulder, back whenever that person does anything negative or does anything negative could come back to me or whoever I'm trying to protect the egregore will send the energy to them and make sure that the energy returns to that person's right back to them they're very rare times when I felt the need to actually bury somebody 6 ft under no I think it's also important to note that not every person  is attacking you not everything is some magical plot against you and sometimes it just is are the evil eye kind that you know somebody cut off in traffic and you shoot a little negative energy their way or you cut someone off in traffic and they shoot a little negative energy your way most of them are kind of that small can still hurt can still cause problems but to do a big purse or a big working it require sustained large amounts of energy and you've got to decide whether or not that's worth your energy because honestly sometimes you're so caught up in the emotion of it in the moment that you think it's worth it and it's just not if you're giving them your time and your energy you're also feeding into what they're doing so it's it's the same exact thing you know you want to kind of put out that people are going to get back what they put it you but in the same respect you don't want to feed into their magic or  get into your own fears or feed into your own fears absolutely because that is something that magic is going to help you with and that goes back to the reflecting you know why do you want to do this or why do you think someone is doing that to you go through that bisects that see how you can handle it right sometimes the first spell that you need to reach for is a restraining order and not magic yeah yeah unfortunately sometimes not always where I need to worry about doing big painful magic I am lucky enough and privileged enough in my life right now that I keep my words up if I take care of everything I don't really have to worry about it I'm pretty good so that that might not be true for other people of your situation in your life is a lot more volatile that's going to be different so I think that the biggest thing is always I always go back to this it's it's your intention and  you are energetically putting into this put in that energy decide what you want out of it what is the result that you really want you really want them out of your life or are you looking for reconciliation is this person really shity or maybe do you need to respect boundaries a little better you know or maybe it is all them I don't know but think about it and then keep your piece set up your boundaries it's okay to do that s good to do that you should set boundaries it is okay to be angry it's okay to be mad it's okay to feel these things and to work through that however works best for you you just need to decide whether or not it's something you should be lashing out or working on don't have anyone in your life that needs to be hackstore banished but if you do we got you got you got some ideas for going to have more spellcraft summer episodes coming up including a three-part  series on spell word correspondences writing spells and how to power your spells are so excited I love summer magic time I feel like it's the most magical time of the year it's also a wonderful basketball time of year oh my God I can't wait I cannot wait for us to go see you soon is finally here that means camping camping and this year not only are we possibly going to go to a pagan Pride somewhere on the East Coast we are also both going to be at Brushwood folklore Center for their Sankofa Festival know I know that you've been on a little Facebook Hiatus and we all understand and it's okay but I just want you to know we have at least one listener coming to send and I will also be there for the week following for the serious Rising Festival giving lots of workshops shell and I are also going to be doing a radio show together with we will put the link so you can listen in live to the  still radio show I need a DJ name  for what are DJ name should be or what the theme of our musical to our program should be email us at back on the broomstick at gmail.com or go to our Instagram Facebook or web page back on the broomstick I just I just want a DJ named people give me DJ name something good.
