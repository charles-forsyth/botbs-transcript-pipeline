it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 72 of the stoned Witches Hour no [ __ ] 72 it really is 72 shell can you believe that crap oh my God okay keep going where was I oh right 72 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends separated by way too many miles get together to smoke copious amounts of the best cannabis they can find while telling each other creepy true Tales from across the US OFA and today getting ready to interview a local paranormal group I'm Lea and I'm shell and I miss you I we're doing this like every other week's summer thing and I miss you and I miss every and our listeners and I'm just glad to be back today me too it has been far too long we apologize for the long Gap but you know summer is here and we've got festivals going on we have our other podcast back on the broomstick we're doing workshops and classes and covin and coven interviews and we're a little busy but we've also been talking to Paranormal groups so today we have guests yay we're going to chat with a local par normal group um but first before we dive into that what are you smoking my friend we haven't chatted weed in a couple of weeks you know you could probably guess what I've got in my pipe today I have a trio of yep Trio of gelato I am smoking powdered gelotti a gelato 41 and what do you mean powdered oh wow do you want to see what I mean by powdered I'm sad that our listeners can't see this but when I say powdered it looks like it's covered in powdered sugar it's literally white I'm gonna open this up and show you let's see if I can get a nug out here and you can see it oh wow okay listeners I am gonna climb through my zoom camera and lick this weed this is fantabulous looking and you would be absolutely right and proper to do so because this weed is fantastic it looks like sugar it tastes like sugar it it smokes so sweetly you know I love the gelato because of that fantastic flavor s it's so sweet The Taste is like fruits and sugars and dessert and not only does it give me [ __ ] high but it tastes fantastic so I love me some gelato and you're getting something off the food pyramid how that's right how healthy now I like these three gelato because they're at three different price points and I would have to say they all three smoke about the same so that's kind of funny well that's annoying then why is there three price points if it's the same [ __ ] God Bless America it is three different types of gelato you know three different cultivars that have been you know interbred with other things I'm just looking up to see what this powdered gelotti was because it was pretty expensive so this is about a $350 ounce holy holy crap that's wow I've paid a lot for weed and that's more than I wow yeah so that's about $112 a gram are you getting what you PID for though absolutely the high is really really good The Taste is fantastic however I'm also smoking this gelato 41 now the powdered gelotti was $112 a gram okay this gelato 41 was $5 a gram okay what's the difference well it's not as pretty it doesn't look as pretty it doesn't taste quite as good but the high is is about the same just about the same then then what what's with this $12 a gram [ __ ] it looks prettier maybe that's why and the jet fuel gelotti uh was about middle of the road it was probably between those two I would say it was I think it was like a eight or9 doar a gram roughly and that one also tastes really good it has a little bit more of that gasoline taste to it um along with the sweetness maybe that's the jet fuel in it but I didn't mind it it almost gives it like a like a minty like a minty flavor along with I love my weed like I like my whiskey burning and gasoline tasted there you go then you'd like this one because it tastes like a dessert with whiskey and it gets you really really high so three different price points all very very good but you know you don't always get what you pay for sometimes it pays to get the slightly less expensive kind but I'm loving all of them and I'm very very high and very happy so what are you puffing on over there shell okay went back to something that I've smoked before because I have a tendency sometimes to like I don't know it's like you're the brains of the operation but I'm like the weed connoisseur who wants to try something different every time absolutely but I went back to something what you got now first of all I we're we've had this conversation before this was cheaper because it's what's called mini buds oh you and I love the smalls or the mini buds we like that deal popcorn popcorn nuggets so it was a little bit cheaper because it's mini buds to begin with but this is banana pudding Tang I just love I just love the name it doesn't taste like banana nor does it taste like pudding but I love it but this [ __ ] is rocking at 34% that is some damn good THC right there it was still only so would you say that that powder came out to an ounce 35050 okay so I got an ounce of this and I got it after tax for 188 and it's 34% THC love it and I think it was cheaper even though it's a high THC content because of the whole minib buds thing I don't give a [ __ ] if it's big if it's small if you ground it for me and already prepackaged it ground I don't care it smokes the damn same I'm not into Aesthetics I'm into the smoke yes you have always been into that THC that high heavy hitting punch whereas I like to go for a good high but I definitely like the flavor I want the taste as you are aware I'm getting ready to go on a camping trip and so I got some stuff to do I'm a little busy got some packing got some sorting and this this is definitely something you can smoke and get [ __ ] done like I've been getting [ __ ] done all day today smoking off this stuff and I'm still ready to go so if you're looking for like that couch pass out melt into things this is not it whato ever you know that's what I'm liking about these gelato crosses is that I have an excellent High going on I've got a great body buzz but I'm also very very productive I also packing to Camp I have two weeks of workshops coming up for Pagan festivals over the rest of this month and so exciting I love summer me too it's it's a busy busy time so definitely having you know something that will help me with pain management and also help keep me focused while not having me couch locked is necessary this time of year and don't worry folks we'll still be here bi-weekly despite our vacations this summer so stay tuned one thing I got to ask you what's up this labeling thing we've talked about the lack of consistency oh yes so if they're gonna tell me everything under the damn Sun why can't the label say whether it's an indica or a sativa if you're telling me everything else why can't you just tell me that it's one line there's extra empty space on the label why not some do some don't some places are starting to move away from that a little bit as we're finding scientifically that those labels of indicia and sativa that we kind of slapped on these plants willy-nilly isn't really holding up once we look at them genetically so things that we have historically said this is all Inda we're finding that that's not necessarily true I think some places might be kind of trying to get away from those designations even though they're very familiar to people man this changeing stuff is going so fast people like me can't keep up like I can't keep up I think you're keeping up just fine shell it looks like you're getting some great weed at great prices all the time so I don't know if you have much to worry about other than an abundance of good weed I don't know the science I just want to smoke just give me something that I can get high with and smoke I don't give a sh [ __ ] about the science behind it exactly now actually I'm going to use your little science comment as an abrupt segue into into our main topic this evening but we're going to be talking to some paranormal investigators who are using science to try and find ghosts and to quantify Paranormal Activity we have the pleasure this evening of having Rob and Melissa come on from Monroe County paranormal investigative group and we are so excited to hear all about this group Rob himself has been on over 500 investigations holy mackerel Chester New York is surprisingly a hub of activity and Rob is even has a theory on why that is but Rochester New York is home to the fox sisters who were basically patient zero for the spiritualist movement in the United States and also this area is home to a plethora of folk stories such as the white lady ghost story which we debunked on previous episode and supposedly it's also the burying place of a potential person who could have been Jack the Ripper Western New York is like the place is just crawling it's just crawling with the ghosties it is a surprising hot spot of Paranormal Activity and again we'll ask Rob why because he does have a theory on what's going on here because uh the other thing uh Lilydale the spiritual center is also in Western New York Western New York's great I didn't realize some of the reasoning behind why Rochester itself could kind to be a hot spot and I kind of got a little background knowledge of that before today's episode you know for living in Upstate New York I really didn't look into that and probably should have but now I know and and I'm excited for these guys I'm excited to hear about all their exploits and you know like you said Rob over 500 investigations what has this guy seen I want to hear about it like I just want to know obviously there's been times where it was probably debunked and and and we totally understand that but I want to hear about the times where the guy was ready to [ __ ] himself me too and hopefully we'll get a chance to talk about I know you and I have done some very amateurish Ghost Hunt ourselves maybe we'll get to talk a little bit about some experiences you and I have had you know and see how they compare and what he thinks about them now I do know I'm just going to give you guys a little bit of a teaser we're not going to talk about it this evening because Rob is a sensitive and I don't want to give away anything about my house but he will be coming to investigate the house that I'm currently staying in later in August and will'll be having that investigation for all of you as well after it happens so we won't be talking about any of the strange experiences that we have had here uh because he doesn't want to be he doesn't want to have any of his information tainted he prefers to go into investigations having zero knowledge of anything that has occurred there these are the kind of people that I prefer because you know dating back to the beginning of the spiritualist and psychic movements in America there has been scammers and I actually prefer the people who want to go in cold turkey no knowledge no conversation because that just makes me kind of feel a little more confident you know what I'm saying not that I doubt anybody and not that I'm trying to be rude or nothing but the L you know the more confident I am about your results that is one more clue if you're having someone do an invest tigation for you if they're pumping you for every Last Detail that could be a red flag so having someone come in as a clean slate you know that really helps to lend Credence to any evidence that they do find and you know kind of an example of that real quick is um when we did our our our amateur investigation of your father's house in very haunted house in senica Falls Al yeah I was going to say also at Upstate New York you know you had told us stor and we kind of I don't want to say we kind of knew what we were getting into but we kind of had some expectation and I think that the adrenalin of those prior conversations may have fueled some of our experiences so I love the I love the Blind Eye approach to that that they take I agree I agree and that way you know again you can you can trust it a little more you know if they already know that there's the spirit of a little girl here and they come in and they're like I feel the presence of a young female child you know yeah but if I if I'm sitting there thinking that I'm having some chat with some you know hot and sexy succubus and they come in and telling me I'm chatting with like some 90-year-old demon you know you might just be in the badroom of the Stanley Hotel right right but yeah it's good to go in as a blank slate I think so that's definitely one thing that they do that I really enjoy but let's get into our interview with them and see how it goes welcome everyone thank you so much for joining us today we have Monroe County paranormal investigative group joining us today we have Rob and Melissa please introduce yourselves ladies first oh uh my name is Melissa I've been in the group for about five years now and I'm a case manager with the group and kind of a PR uh I would put it kind of run all the text stuff for Facebook Instagram little bit of everything then yeah deal of all trades yes I I feel that Vibe I I I have the same tasks yes it comes with being the youngest person in the group so always got to rub it in wow I can relate to that yes rub it in I know and uh my name is Rob I am the founder whatever else you want to put title after that of mcpi um I founded the group in 2002 so I've been at this for 21 years with this group now Rob when I was kind of getting some background information I read on one of the websites that you've done over 500 investigations we're at we we are at 1,070 oh wow update that yeah that is a lot the website we're talking about is Monroe ghost.com correct yep yeah we have a lot of updating to do but what it boils down to is just um you know it's just longevity in the field you know some cases are consults over the phone some cases are internet consults um some cases are in-person investigations and things like that so but 1,70 cases now do most of the cases and most of the correspondences you get from folks is that pretty much from either Monroe County New York or Upstate New York in general or are you getting contacted from all walks of the world um Melissa where have we last few have been kind kind of all over um we've had Florida I feel like there was one in Missouri there's a lot of Monroe counties in the United States yeah gotcha so I think that's where some of the confusion comes in but we'll try to connect them with the whoever's local to them we try and help them if we can I've most so far this year I've done one from Australia one from France and two from England yeah I think yeah okay real quick I I know Ila has an agenda but I'm always all scattered all over the place how are you helping people outside of New York state are you doing investigations over Zoom are you just listening to their experiences like I need to know this okay so we we will gather as much information we'll have them send photos videos um we'll try to hook them up with people close to them and if we cannot then we will try and you know Source solve over the Internet like the cases that I had with France and and the the guy in France apparently this is not a big thing over there they don't really have paranormal investigation groups and it's not something that you can just reach out and find so it was a lot of back and forth with okay here's what I have going on okay can you get me some pictures can you get me some video and then it's kind of sitting here going through everything trying to is it really something that's going on is it just a natural occurrence is it something that you know is uh that we can handle via you know Skype or Zoom or whatever you know the case may be um we don't in we never want a client to investigate their own home so we never try and do an investigation type thing over the Internet investigating your own home is just a way to make things things worse yeah I saw that warning on your website yeah so that's pretty good advice I think now Melissa can you tell me what a case manager is what what does it mean for you to be a case manager she babysits Rob heard of it's babysitting Rob um keeping him kind of in line uh I kind of call myself the mom of the group sometimes for me but usually someone will contact us either through the website they'll call us um we get Facebook messages too we get emails um and then they'll you know say hey we got something going on one of us I'm one of three case managers we'll set up a call um get some more information do some preliminary research have them send us whatever they've got um and then usually we'll do either walk through or we'll actually just go set up an investigation and we'll figure out a date and time that works for them so you kind of are the the organizer of all of the details yes now what is the radius you guys will go are you only willing to go within Monroe County New York or will you go like what's your radius of physic going physically going to investigate first one was like an hour and a half away yeah I would say you know if we can do it within two hours we're good if we can get there within two hours we're good and I would even say if it's someone that needs help outside of that 2-hour window if we can plan it ahead of time enough you know we could probably stretch to three okay so people you know if somebody needs help in the area you will either be able to physically help them help them over you know digital media somehow or even find people in their area you know another group who could help them so you have like a network of paranormal investigative groups is well what we do is um it's not necessarily a network um there used to be well okay can I I need to start at the beginning go for it yes when I started investigating there were 2,000 groups in the world the world wow that's not a lot no I I started inest investigating five years before Ghost Hunters ever aired their first episode nice once Ghost Hunters hit the television and then all these other shows starting popping up at one point in time there were over 3,000 groups in just New York State wow so what was happening was as people were going oh I've seen it on TV I can do this so people were getting these groups that really had no idea what to do or how to do it and they were creating more problems than they were solving well it doesn't help when you can get some of these uh tools and and devices that you use right off Amazon yeah that's where we get them yeah but you know what you're doing and you know you know how to handle these things you don't just go buying random stuff off Amazon right and then so what we do is if we find you know we have made some great contacts in some of the other Monroe counties and other states we'll go online we'll look at the website and be like we are not referring anybody to these Jokers right you know or we will you know we'll research the groups before we send a client you know to someone in their area now in New York state we have some very good friends that you know if it's a Syracuse thing or east of Syracuse we have a really great friend that does some work with us um that we do some investigations at Fort Ontario with and um you know she's got a fantastic group she's been doing it a long time so I have no problem you know saying listen I think she's going to be better for you because she's only an hour from you I'm two and a half hours from you you know that kind of thing um we have a group in Buffalo that we trust pretty well we have a group down in the Southern Tier that we trust pretty well so we have a network but it's not like you would think it's not like we all get together and chat it's more along the lines of you know we we've kind of worked with them in one way or another or at least spoken to them and feel comfortable saying hey we would love to help you but these guys are closer I love that I mean your group has been around for several decades you have made quite an impact in the local area when I moved here one of the first things I heard about was Union Tavern and the Union Tavern hauntings and your group doing investigations there and when I started looking into having you guys on the show you just seem to pop up everywhere you were doing a talk down at the Spirit Room you know you're you're doing a talk over here and investigations at these different houses and on your website you do have several events coming up where you allow the public to come in with you and go on some of these investigations and from what I understand they sell out pretty quickly they seem to be pretty well attended now do you find that having um just regular people come in with you on these does that tend to lessen what happens like does more stuff happen does less stuff happen like does it affect your you know ghost hunting in any way is it harder to investigate if you have a group of people with you I'll go first Melissa and then you can because I know what you're thinking I know I can see I can see it roing around in your head um so I think what happens when we do have groups come in is I think the investigations are in places that one we know pretty much what we're going to find okay and it's pretty repeatable so that with each investigation we can repeat the findings so we know that it's happening and I think I think it was Melissa that said that we do these investigations and every time we go we add another sentence to the story so when we're investigating a place like the Union Tavern yes we've investigated it quite a few times so we've got two or three paragraphs of information written down but every time we go we get to write another sentence you know in the story and that was your quote right yeah okay so see I knew that was what you know was rolling around up there yep and you know it's I think it gives people an insight into what we do it gives people an opportunity to to try it once and say oh I I I like this but I don't think I would want to join a group or H that was interesting but I got that out of my system or you know whatever the case may be I think I think it's very um educational because we we don't do the investigating we hand over all of our tools to the people that come in and we coach them on how to use them we coach them on how to a ask questions we coach them on where to investigate you know what to do what to say and let them go now have you ever had anybody like totally freak out like they heard or saw something and had just a melt down I think we pretty good I'm trying to think back we've had because it's public and people go to dinners and stuff especially at Union Tavern so we've had people that have gotten into their own minds beforehand and maybe had a couple drinks um and it doesn't always go well so we've now put in there hey try not to get drunk before you start that's pretty smart think the only time we had something like that happen was at Fort Ontario out in the cemetery oh what happened and um I it was just all right it's just a spooky area too you got to remember that you're out in the middle of nowhere and you're in a cemetery that has Graves from all the way back to like the late 1600s or I should say gravestones because there's a whole longer story to that um did they just cemeter yes the cemetery was located in a different place and they moved the cemetery that never goes well yeah that's such a New York thing they but I mean they're very good people I know for a fact that they got all of the human parts out but what happens is is like sometimes they do find a headstone that rises up after freeze and thaw or a little piece of one right it just happens but so this Cemetery has got unknown sold from the Revolutionary War unknown soldiers from 1812 unknown soldiers from wherever and we were out in the cemetery and I'm an idiot I like going out there around midnight when it's like and I'm like all right who wants to go to cemetery at midnight you're our people you sound like us so um you know and Caroline the person that runs the events at the Fort she's super awesome such a great lady um she might be someone you guys would want to talk to in the future too absolutely we can hook you up with her you know she's like yeah go out to the cemetery at midnight so we had a couple people out there and it's a cemetery there's no natural lighting around you're a hundred yards from the shores of Lake Ontario so there's wind and waves and noise please tell me you saw orbs please tell me you saw orbs please please orbs aren't ghost damn it don't say that she has an horrible Obsession I love them I don't want to hear it la la la la la la just but what we heard was what we actually heard was whistling and it was a coded whistle like like um it was like a I can't military whistle kind of thing was like um it was like two short whistles followed by a long whistle and then about kind of like Morse code well is like someone was trying to Signal someone else like a call and response right yeah and then about 50 feet or so down the Hedge R we heard a response whistle and there was nobody there I know because I was out there and ran into the hedro there's nothing I love that that screams Bigfoot to me totally screams big foot as I ran into the hedro I turned around and two of the people that were out in the cemetery with us were on their way back to the to the Fort they were they didn't want to play with the cemetery anymore wow wow now now this this kind of leads me to my technique question question because you're talking about being in a cemetery at midnight Leila and I sometimes do things that aren't recommended to most because we're that those types of girls have you ever as part of your investigation used a Ouija board never never NOP okay we we have I am so anti- Ouija board it's not even funny oh tell me why talk to me I would love to hear this just we want to hear the perspective Melissa what would you say the cases are the percentage of cases are that yeah when we start getting into it and there's things going on and there's all kinds of crazy stuff happening that at one point or another we hear well we did use a Ouija board I'd say about 80% there you go yeah so a lot of [ __ ] around and find out happens is what you're saying yes we've touched on this before and we understand it's the whole you make your bad and you lie in it you know you are kind of bringing these things in we usually recommend people [ __ ] around and find out just saying that's all yeah Rob's got a great analogy though too like when we talk about Ouija boards in our talks that if you stand in a doorway and Rob even mentions he's like hey I'm a really tall guy I'm 53 so it doesn't really work for me too much but you have things coming in around whatever person you're trying to talk to right you have no control over what's coming in yeah I'm 6'4 I'm like 260 pounds if I stand in a doorway I take up a good portion of the doorway but stuff can still through right what about all those empty other spaces yes that can sneak through the open doorway and then you know we've gone on CA like we did a case once where the lady was like yeah we did a Ouija board and then we found the Ouija board in her home and in the middle of the investigation we went out and dug a hole in her backyard bound it in red and buried it for her just to close the board it was a weird Friday it was a weird I'm saying very good job as a witch I approve good job absolutely you know it's just so no we do we we try to avoid those kind of things like we will use I I do use dowsing rods on investigations I do use pendulums on investigations but I feel that's more personal and controllable just real quickly I want to say that any tools in my belief any tools that you use to try and contact or interact with Spirit are going to open some type of doorway and depending on what type of tool you use you're going to make a small doorway some of them make a very large large doorway Ouija boards to me seem to be it started out as uh talking boards F the fox sisters you know different different people like that and and then it became a game but it's still a way to open a doorway and I think people don't understand that they're actually using a tool to connect to Spirit yes it's a game by Parker Brothers but it's still a tool and and I think people forget that and Ouija boards are I agree I find them very difficult to control that doorway whereas with dowsing rods and things like that it feels much more controllable Wards are much more open yes yeah not out here I agree as as an energy worker I can feel the difference between those tools and I think people need to remember to to study what they're using and pay attention to that because like you said 80% Melissa yeah of of Investigations that you've done have said they've used one so that tells me that there's something there and to kind of expand on that um Melissa could you tell us um other than what Rob just touched on briefly could you tell us what other tools you guys use yeah absolutely um so I actually do kind of we have group people in the group that do more spiritual side like Rob um I do kind of a spiritual technology um and then we have Straight Tech so we'll use um one of our investigators our Tech manager has like the ghost box if you've seen that that goes through the audio what's a ghost box ad explains it a lot better than I do because he built it um but it runs through radio stations at a very fast frequency oh I've seen those that's the one that kind of it the idea behind it is that Spirit can manipulate energy a little bit better than they can you know to make sound so the Box itself they're kind of manipulating that energy to land on Words that they want to say to you and talk through yeah so it's kind of a step up from the old listening to static and trying to to listen for them to manipulate the static is it is that what it is like kind of a step up from that type of box um yeah a little bit so it'll they'll communicate and if it's got longer words that go over multiple frequencies then we kind of consider that uh to be evidence and if it's intelligent we'll use K2 meters actually going right here just happened to have one not far away you know how stupid it is that we have wait a second time out you know how stupid it is that both of us are sitting at our desks and we both have ghost hunting tools at our desks Within Reach flashlight got they are each just grabbing right next to them different items and showing them to the camera I love this I love this now do you guys use um I I've seen on some of these shows because I I was one of those people I watched every ghost show there was from inception to current present day um do you guys use any of that infrared where you can like see the outline of a body SLS yeah we just we we just got our first SLS because we weren't sold on the technology for a while and over time like I wasn't sold on the technology for a while and then we finally started seeing like some actual results with it that made me believe that the technology could work so we just got so you do get results from it then yes absolutely do you have any favorite results anything that that you know you can talk about that you know something anything that happened that really said to you this this place is really haunted something's really going on here uh I think the SLS at Union Tavern was the one that sealed the deal again Union Tavern is a very old building in in Rochester in the Rondo area I believe that it goes back to the 18 early 1800s and it's believed to it one time been a hideout possibly of a pirate is that true yeah the original owner of the Union Tavern was a gentleman by the name of Woodman and he was a great lakes pirate and that is people laugh you know Great Lakes pirate well there's actually a museum for Great Lakes piracy in Michigan I love the Great Lakes Pirates I am absolutely fascinated by all of it so how cool that there's a Tavern right here and so this guy you know built a house in the location and he built the house in 1819 um the foundation is original from that house the wooden structure above is not it come that part is from 1856 through 1860 still very old and it's been a lot of different things in its Inception it um you know we love it there we love the owners Kelly and Don are super great people they're both really into what we do and they're both they like the fact that we come there and we expose their building to Outsiders so this is rank upon this is rank among Rochester's most haunted places would you say hard to say I don't like the word haunted I believe the word haunted carries a very negative un I don't know unfair connotation what's your preference active Okay I like that active one of the things that um shell and I have talked quite a bit about now we've been doing this podcast for a little over a year and a half now and discussed a lot of places around the United States that are very active and have a lot of paranormal activity and we have come across repeatedly Stone and water every time there seems to be a place that's very very active we find Stone particularly lime Limestone or quartz and running water and at a talk that I was very lucky to have gone to by you guys at the Spirit Room which is super cool uh through the brainery it was the brainery that puts those on great group do a lot of cool classes and you guys do quite a few with them but at the speech that you did Rob you mentioned something that had me sitting right up in my chair you talked about Stone and water and that the correlation of that here in Rochester possibly being part of why there's so much activity here and also I I just want to point out um for our listeners that aren't familiar uh with Rochester in Upstate New York Rochester is located right on the shores of Lake Ontario which is the first great lake um in the way I look at it in order of them the first great lake in Rochester not only is it I call it Rocky I'm sure you guys have a better more scientific word for it um but from that area to like the Niagara Falls area there is a [ __ ] ton of salt mines so there's the salt mines there is the Rocks there is the water does this have anything to do with the activity level in Monroe County all right this is my theory my theory based on years of doing this and based on a lot of research Lake Ontario feeds the St Lis River very rare does not happen a lot the other thing that Lake Ontario has is North flowing river the genese river flows north really I didn't know that the genese river flows north so you take a North flowing river over an area that has hundreds of lay lines back in in you know underneath the Earth with deep Granite Resources with Deep Rock Resources and I believe that that's part of what makes the shores of Lake Ontario and particularly Rochester towns like asgo who also have a smaller River even I mean we have talked before about the fox sisters and the whole spiritualist movement that came to the United States a lot of that started right in Monroe County right in Rochester area and I think that because of this activity because of this type of battery attractant I'm not sure what it is in this area the word battery yeah I like that it very much seems to be like that I'm I'm surprised at the amount of activity here even going back into history like I said back to the fox sisters although we also are the home of a hoax I I loved listening to your white lady talk because we do I love white lady ghost stories I very much almost as much as she orbs yeah I know orbs I I know don't don't tell me about orbs I don't want to hear it I absolutely adore them I know all the science shush but still love them don't care but white lady ghost stories I I love the legends of them and I love seeing the different iterations of this archetype across the country across the world you know the Wailing lady the gray ladies the white ladies and so hearing that there was a white lady ghost right where I happened to be staying I was ecstatic so happy to delve into this story and imagine my disappointment when I could find no shred of truth to it whatsoever and they all have one all of these Legends have a kernel of Truth there is a woman who died there's a someone who drowned someone who was killed in a car accident they all go back to some type of Truth and this one just didn't not only did it not go back to any type of truth but it was all fake and I could find no one who had even had a secondhand encounter with this Apparition just Fifth and sixths hand basically stories every time you hear somebody that says oh the white lady's real it's my brother's nephew's cousin once bought a dog from a guy whose nextdoor neighbor friends brother's sister once had a boyfriend who had an experience oh you read my research notes then right perfect exactly that's exactly what happened and every time we try and pin someone down to a story about it Melissa it always comes back to the same thing well I heard yeah right it it's just a lovely local legend that I think what you said in your talk Rob not to give it all away because people should go see it but what you mentioned is that it it just seems to be a um a morality tale people took this GH story and turn it into a morality tale to stop people from going to make out Point basically I was it's funny you mention it too because uh Adam Bellow actually just put out a they put a plaque right there about the lore and it's it's Legends and lore and it's kind funny because he actually put on the plaque that you know it was a uh what did he say it was a fable or something it was something along lines of it yeah it was oh a uh oh gosh I think it went back to the murder the woman with the murder thing no no no well that part was there but what he said was it was actually a uh uh commissary oh yes for the zoo yeah the hot dog stand I loved it the hot dog I was so sad so sad but I mean we so you know we like I've been doing this for a long time I'm an old I'm an old hat at it I love talking about this kind of stuff because if if we can get you know one person convinced that you know it's a natural phenomenon you know then that reduces our number of ridiculous phone calls by 10 but do you get people who call you and or or contact you and you get their information and and you start digging into it you assign a case manager um you potentially go investigate and you find out that these people are just I don't want to say giving you [ __ ] but kind of giving you [ __ ] and there's no truth to their claim yeah I mean there are people out there that oh oh I'm going to call the ghost group and make fun you know those are easy to weed out yeah we get pictures of people you know like they like we don't know that there's apps on your phone that you can add an apparition to your photo yeah oh look it's Abraham Lincoln that's the trouble of Our Generation we're not hip to all the apps yet well I mean I mean I see all that stuff but we've had okay let's just run this down real quick we got a call from a guy who was possessed by the ghost of Tupac Shakur impressive we got a guy that um called us that his room at the Motel 6 was haunted and he'd been staying there for six months and my response was I don't think that it's your room as haunted is the problem I think that you live at the Motel 6 is the problem yeah um we've gotten oh we we got the one phone call on our voicemail this was my it's still my favorite one thank you Universe um so this woman calls us and says I don't know how long a voicemail thing o in the phone is like two minutes right Melissa yeah said two minutes okay so she starts off the phone call with um you guys need to go out to Montana okay we're in New York but we need to go to Montana and we have to do it on a stormy night when there's thunder and lightning and lots of rain and we have to go to the specific town because the specific town There's a church and in that church the people that go to that church hunt human beings but only on stormy nights when there's thunder and lightning that's hard to plan you had me until the hunt human beings part oh it get better it gets better there's more and she's telling us about you know the church has this hidden room where they have the heads on the walls of all the human beings that they've hunted and there's hell hounds that guard the church and um and and she's going into detail and she's likew you have to go there you have to you know go on this you know blah blah blah and she's going through the whole thing and she's rolling through this message and she's just telling us all this stuff and right at the end she goes and by the way the hellhound it's a doxin and then the message cuts on he was just about to tell us that the hellhound was a doxin well now I believe her honestly because doxins truly are from hell so that whole thing is probably true all I got to say is it's people like that that make me miss living in New York this we have no idea where this woman was from no we did she never gave us her name a phone number an email nothing but she was frantic through this whole message like she really believed this I hope she got help yeah wow but at least she gave you the gift of the recording there at least is that now speaking of help so you get to somebody you do an investigation you find something legitimate then what are you just like yeah you know you got a lot of activity here sucks to be you gotta go like what's the next step once you find something how do you how do you help people maybe deal with this or or get rid of it or or what have you what's the next step once you actually have found something is there a Next Step oh there's always a next step um we do not a client of ours is a client for life um we never we've gone back to some locations three four five times to continuously help people nice um we do have plans we have um generally what will happen is we'll get together at the end of the investigation Melissa and the other case managers and our Tech manager will kind of sit down we'll go through whatever evidence we got we'll go through it and boil it down and then we will come up with a plan to help them and you know there's a couple of plans that we use on a regular basis just it's been uh Stacy and I have been working together for 23 years and it's something that we developed about 18 years ago one of the plans and it seems to work nice so you have a method like a proven method that you go through very nice and we don't ever just leave anybody out in the wind you know and not only do we not leave people out in the wind if we don't hear back from a client in a month or two we'll call them and say how's everything going nice you know did what we tell you to do did it work and like without fail when they do answer oh yeah we're fine now everything's cool whatever you did you know whatever you told us we did it and it worked now I'm intrigued what about the times where it doesn't work have you ever had to like bring in like the next level like if you ever been like dude you need to call a priest you need to call your Rabbi you need to get someone big time in here has it ever come to that um no awesome I'm happy and sad I'm not going to lie I'm happy for the people and I'm sad because I was hoping for this like big Exorcist real life story I do have those um I Stacy and I were consulted on an exorcism case really um here's the deal people think that you just call the he Catholic Church I have a problem send an ex no no that's a process yeah there's does that go through the Vatican or something and you need 10 years of documented activity yeah so no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna call a priest because they're just gonna say nothing I can do I'm gonna call Lila long before that 10 years is up call yourself a high priestess that's what you need that's who we generally call yeah believe it or not we have in the times that we've had to bring someone else in we have a couple of people that are very friendly to us in the wiccan community and we have turned to them for help because they tend to be able to make clients feel very at home without the Pomp and Circumstance of the you know of the churches it's more earthy it's more you know it's more relable for people it's it's not so much you know praying and bl it's more you know communicative and and I find that that makes people feel a little bit more at home um it makes them like and and when we do that we say listen you know here's what we're going to do we've tried our method but I have a friend that might have a different method and um you know we try to tell people you know don't try and Sage your own home um you know I know how to do a saging I will not do it because I would rather have it done by someone that has the knowledge the the foresight to say okay let's restart let's change let's do this let's call an audible in the middle whereas I might just plow right through it because I didn't notice something small or catch something small so when it comes to stuff like that I'm much rather have someone who's skilled in it and yes we have called other people in for help I have no problem with that I love that you guys have a team and I also want to point out that from what I've heard in in my investigations and and correct me if I'm wrong Rob and Melissa but it doesn't really matter what religion it is that you are using to help fight this or or to help correct you know this energy this activity in your home it matters that you believe in it it matters that it's something that is close to you uh it that's much more powerful than saying this is a a priest of of whatever religion if the religion that you follow is Meaningful for you that's going to be much more strong in your situation than you know say a a Catholic priest that you might see on TV or something like that have you found that to be true or do you find that there's a specific way or religion that seems to work better um I I feel like I'm dominating this Melissa jump in when you when you no I I agree with that too and it's tough when it gets into religion I'm not a very religious person personally um but we've had a case I think Robbie were on that one with me with all that salt and the holy water but she was more of a Wiccan background and she just thought okay I can holy water at it and'll make it better but because she it probably didn't purchase into it yeah it didn't um and the salt didn't help either I mean the salt worked because she believed in that but just in a negative effect of keeping it in rather than letting it out so now I I do have a quick question now you said that people should not investigate their own homes and I completely agree you know you don't want to rile things up particularly where you're sleeping um but is there anything that you would recommend to someone other than reaching out to a local group is there something small that they could do um that would be safe for them to to maybe protect themselves or maybe to calm things down in their home I I leave that one or should they just reach out and and cut put their head under the pillow Michelle likes the blanket she keeps her feet under the blanket she finds that very effective but you know Lila and I kind of do see it from a different perspective because having spend a lot of time being uh Wick and high priestesses we kind of were like yeah well we'll smudge our house but we have the background to do that and that that that background knowledge to do that so we kind of have a different perspective um I left Upstate New York and came to Salem Massachusetts and and Lea came over the fall last year and we took a Ouija board up on Gallows Hill where where these folks where these folks were were hung for witchcraft but I see the disappointment on Rob's face right now we have that but we have that background that background knowledge to kind of keep that under control and keep that handled and and and speak to that quickly I think that's why we got almost nothing Rob I think we kind of bound everything and like closed it off so much we we were like we're going to protect this and we're going to like seal it we're gonna do this and we got too much of a steal yeah but but we kind of you know we kind of take it from the perspective that we have that background knowledge to do it you know you don't want these folks to kind of just open these doors that they can't close so what can someone do personally if I call you and I'm desperate what could you tell me that I could do until maybe you or someone you know could help me communicate yeah communicate with whatever is in my space not don't yell don't scream don't fight don't get out of my house none of that stuff because if there really is is something there and you're screaming at it it's going to scream back so kind of talk to it like that nosy neighbor that knocked on your door that you really don't want to deal with right just say what busy right now gotta go can't talk but we can chat later see you my is very close to that would be my advice would be along the lines of okay um you're you're frightening me a little I I recognize that you're here I recognize that you're trying to get in touch with me but you're frightening me can you just stop frightening me communicate don't go out it if you all right schoolyard fight if you know we've all seen them it always starts with no you're ugly no you're ugly and then you go at them fingers point and you're getting that right back at you what you give is what you get right and and I'm a firm believer in in the three-fold law TR firm believer that if you give it back you're going to get it if you give it out you're going to get it back three times so if you come at something already with a little bit of attitude it's going to come back with a bigger attitude so I like to tell people I get it I understand that you're frightened I know that you're nervous I know that you're scared but I will ask questions all right how long has this been going on a year okay it's had plenty of opportunity to hurt you if it was going to has it hurt you no okay then we can start from there then just start with listen I'm nervous you're making me frightened can you please stop just communicate that doesn't always work but at least it's a starting point and I'm I'm hesitant to go deeper into it because I don't want people just no they should reach out I think I think acknowledgement is half the battle because I I do believe that that these things have some sort of higher Consciousness and you know is is a a normal person if you acknowledge me that's half the battle acknowledge that exactly yeah I think that's what people don't realize because I'll say that to people at work too they're like what do you do and I say hey we acknowledge can you watch the cat thanks for watching the house when you come home and they're like but it's this thing and it's like no but it was at one point a person and if you ask a person hey you're scaring me they're usually going to be like Oh I'm sorry I didn't realize that because their goal is to get them in touch with you so it's definitely what we try to do is say okay yeah try this but definitely reach out to us have us you know come into the space look at it because every time I've heard it so many times Brian Stacy have heard it so many times every phone call starts with this is going to sound crazy and we're like you call the paranormal group we've heard it you're used to it y now what you said um both of you said resonated very strongly with me because shell and I have helped in situations where someone's moved into a space that that had some activity and and one of the first things we tell them is to set the space make sure your emotions are in check make sure there's not a lot of arguments going on in the home make sure you set more of a tranquil space and try to you know first of all relax and and kind of chill out in that space and set the energy to be a little bit better and that goes a long way from what I've found in my limited experience that can go a very long way into helping the situation be less chaotic until someone who knows what they're doing can get there and help settle it I I am a firm believer um in crystals as you can see because they're all around me on all sides of me and I am a firm believer in getting into a space where it's non-confrontational that it's not overpowering like don't buy 5,000 crystals and jam them all into one room I mean you can do I mean you can do that to be happy but what I'm saying is if you're trying to counteract something that might be going on right don't you know don't throw the kitchen sink at it let's go in steps let's go in baby steps let's buy a couple of crystals and if that seems to help okay then we can expand on that let's you know go with um you know just basic communication of I'm not please I'm a little frightened if that seems to help a little great baby steps from there my biggest thing is that um when you get people to like oh my God you know so I went and got holy water and and I you know I sprinkled my whole house with holy water well I always tell the joke tell me why the holy water didn't work Mrs Rabinowitz you know it's all I could think of is you know like I said you kind of treat you you treat these entities like neighbors all I can think of is you walk into some imagine walking into someone's house and then they just throw start throwing water at you like what the hell like okay I know that you know some of these shows and you know they they thrive on drama and drama is what sells the TV show but like one of the clips that we play at one of our presentations is um a certain musclebound Meathead wearing his little sister's t-shirt screaming at an entity going were you murdered because that's what you say to people when you meet them I mean you know that's just you walk up to somebody in a grocery store and you're like hey cool t-shirt were you murdered you know that's offputting yeah yeah and I I I think that you guys's approach is fantastic because I mean it kind of goes along with with you know some of Lila and my beliefs just talk to it just talk great you know hey you're freaking me out you're scaring me you're in my bedroom could you not be in my bedroom you want to be in the kitchen be in the kitchen not my room you know something I think you've had that conversation with a GH before sh I had to have that conversation you know and I've had to have that conversation with my grandfather and that's why I I I think you guys's approach is great because I've done that before I'm like look you know Grandpa this is my room and I feel like there's like a line being crossed here and after that never a problem he stands in my bedroom doorway but you know different situation we still we still would want people to reach out to us and not try and handle it on their own because there are times that that will lull people into a self a sense of you know false confidence right so yes it's a great beginning point but it's always better if you can to have someone that knows what they're doing um come out and take a look you know you I AC quite normal investigators to say a plumber you are not going to have all your pipes plugged up and rip that [ __ ] apart in your basement on your own no that's not your Forte you are going to call a plumber if your pipes are clogged if you've got [ __ ] in your house you are going to call a Paranormal Investigator because why would you do that yourself you don't fix your plumbing yourself you call a plumber you don't fix your paranormal issues yourself you call a Paranormal Investigator I love that you said that Melissa you know exactly what I'm about to say yep at every presentation what we do on the Paranormal I say never investigate your home on your own just because you've seen it on TV doesn't mean you know what you're doing I have seen every episode of mash I have seen every episode of er I've even watched some Gray Anatomy I don't want you cutting me open would you like me to remove your appendix relatively short no no okay no one ever says yes perfect [Music] been about an hour we can end here Rob will always keep talking I'm a firm believer in I will tell you what you want to know and you know we can always do a part two to this if you want you know down the road love that and Lea hang on before you go we have we have an event coming up in August at Union CERN but I I wanted to invite Lila if you're free to Be Our Guest at that I would love that I would absolutely love that definitely and because I'm GNA be in New

prepared but ilila and I have on both her side and my side have on occasion when we've been recording picked up voices that were not like right now I'm recording I'm home alone there's no one here to

to get we would like to get those clips prepared and maybe have you guys listen to him and chat about that sometime yes absolutely yeah yes we were talking about the wh house I'm sure you're familiar with the wh house in San Diego which I did when I was living in California I was able to go there and jealous it was wonderful and when I got home we were discussing it on the show and we were talking about the people that had been hung there in that place before the the house was built and I was saying they either used a scaffolding they built a scaffolding or they used a tree there's a man voice
