welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick today we'll be talking about ostara and just kind of a few things that we remember from our past what we like about ostara couple things you might want to do what you can look forward to for the spring and of course when all else fails beautiful beautiful you and your lovely Book of Shadows you know how can you not like this so right here page three is where I explain what ostara is oh let's start with page three what is OAR shelle before I before I talk about what I've pulled out for our southern hemisphere friends it is actually it's the fall equinox that's right but here's the thing because it's Equinox guess what we're all equal day and night 12 hours of Sun 12 hours of dark so we're equal with our southern hemisphere friends today very nice it was roughly 545 is give or take Eastern on the in the northern hemisphere yeah East Coast Northern Hemisphere yeah rest of the world I'm not really sure about I don't know yeah just as far 545 is Eastern was when the Equinox was so day and night equal time it's a great time of year to talk about balance to work towards balance and of course Spring is New Beginnings and freshness you know and actually that was we're going to talk about spring cleaning that's actually a thing it's actually it can be a ritual so for our southern hemisphere friends you're celebrating the Autumn Equinox but for us folks here in the northern hemisphere it's What's called the vernal equinox like I said nights and day are equal and I think the best part especially for East Coast folk uh Northeast folk is spring Winter's over the dark period is over here in America we still do daylight savings time uh which we just quote unquote celebrated a week or so ago you know it's getting to be light still at 7 we're going to be what is it 90 seconds a day we gain light right now is that correct yeah that is definitely one of the better times especially in the Northeast you hit it exactly it's all that extra daylight and all that extra sunshine and I know for a lot of people on the East Coast things are still gray you still have snow in a lot of areas it's definitely not warming up but you're going to start seeing those little little flowers start poking through the ground you know the birds and the squirrels are going to be out you know you start to see all those first signs of spring and in California it's like spring all year round over it's spring all year round but it is even in places like that it does change and and New Beginnings are happening all over the country and that's really what this is all about it's those first signs of life that life coming back to the Earth you know I think a very common way that folks like to celebrate is planting this is kind of the beginning of planting season and I know you and I talked about you're planting a garden today actually yes and just just real quick why don't you tell everybody why is the equinox or why is spring why is this time of year the best time because honestly you know me I am the worst Horticulture person on the planet plants come to me to die I've planted things in like the first week of June what makes now good right now both of us are on the East Coast so we'll stick with East Coast things planting things now and starting them now is best inside particularly in the east coast because you do have that extra light to grow things and you're going to want to germinate your seeds and start them now because you get that energy of the Equinox of that light changing over to being longer and stronger and it's the whole idea of Life returning so if you start seeds today indoors you have a couple months now where you can take care of them and grow them inside before you transplant them to outside you know so you kind of like relate that a little bit to your life now is a good time to start new things to germinate new ideas and things that you want in your life because this type of energy is going to help those grow it's going to help those seeds germinate and crack open and have those brand new just beginning phases that are able to start I sent shell earlier today some pictures of cannabis packets that I'm starting because this year where I'm at I can grow outdoors legally for the first time and so it's something to start now indoor so that things are stronger by the time summer comes around so you have to wait to put things outside you can't rush into things you have to kind of start it nurture it and then you can put it outside once the the last fear of frost is over and then you can start things outside and go from there I I wanted to just kind of circle back you know I said something about cleaning spring cleaning that is an age old oara ritual if you will like I said when is over kind of out with the old in with the new literally and figuratively dusting out the cobwebs letting those first breezes of spring in you know everybody has their Windows shut up sometimes in the Northeast people plastic over their Windows you know it's kind of letting everything out that's been stifling all winter you know it's time to start UNH hermiting we all kind of hermit all winter you know you kind of hibernate just like bears hibernate we all just kind of hunker down just like the seeds in the earth kind of hibernating in the dark me personally I am not a fan of being a chilly person I don't like being cold so I am indoors and I am I I'm locked in for the winter so this is where you start opening those windows you know you start ripping things apart DUS and sweeping cleaning kind of just refreshing everything this is the time of year when that prapan and demer story really hits home from me pranie was the daughter of demer the Goddess demer the goddess of grains and of harvest and of the Earth pranie was beautiful and Hades the god of the underworld fell in love with her and so at the dark half of the year he comes up and snatches her pranie from the above world and brings her down with him her mother deer is so sad that pranie is gone While She searches the Earth for her everything dies deer doesn't take care of anything anymore so demer lets everything die the earth goes quiet and and plants don't grow everything gets cold and quiet while she's searching for her daughter and six months later on the Spring Equinox pranie emerges from the underworld and her mother is so Overjoyed that things return to life that plants return to life flowers bloom Grass Grows the sun gets stronger and the Earth returns to life because demer is happy we're just like pranie we're kind of dark and quiet we go within we go within to the Earth and then when spring comes we feel much better that sun is shining and we want to come out we want to grow we want to take what we have learned from going within and kind of really bring that out into the sunshine and grow that for the rest of the year and this is a perfect time to set those intentions you know planting seeds is not just you talked about you know you're planting some caned Lal literal seeds but there is the figurative seeds to plant right you know exactly what intentions do you have some some people think that they look at the calendar like this is the new year because we're emerging from that dark period you and I kind of more follow the tradition that sin is the ending and the beginning of the year but there is a population that feel that ostara is the new year new beginnings Mak sense it absolutely does so this is where you set your intentions whether it be mundane magical whatever whatever you're looking to get out of the year but the thing I I I think really pops out at me the most is the egg maybe it's because I loved coloring Easter eggs as aid but but it's the perfect symbol because it's that seed so to say hasn't hatched yet but it's in there and it it's it's percolating it's germinating it's that brand new life that's in a waiting state right and that is the kind of the epitome of ostara to me is that egg and the state that egg is in yes it's that it's that potential it's so much is possible in the springtime everything is ripe and ready with a new life there's a reason why people say like Sprouts like veggie veggie Sprouts are super nutritional like all the nutrients are packed in that brand new little tiny seedling it's such a powerful force and it's all around us right now and to tap into that magically all you have to do is open yourself up to it walk outside a little bit Barefoot put your face into the sun you know smell a new flower and you've already got that that energy that magic of newness of beginnings of possibility all around you as soon as you do those types of things you know shell talked about eggs and decorating eggs and that's not a Christian thing at all that's a very old ancient way to to express life to express spring and thankfulness for the the new beginnings all around us and so decorating eggs with your friends with your children with your family giving decorated eggs is a beautiful way to kind of pass on that you know that that that possibility that that potential of newness and of Beginnings can I just say I have a ritual written out for every single holiday we've ever done six times over I have five belain rituals I have like llamas rituals till I could die not want AAR one really you know I wonder if the reason why you don't have any ostara rituals is because as interesting as it is and as nice as as ostara is if I remember correctly oara was the last indoor ritual you are right you are right and we were just too itching we were too itching that's the best way explain it because that's the least that that is probably the ritual I least participated in honestly in the community the Pagan community that shell and I were involved in several decades ago in the Southern Tier of New York it was a pagan community that consisted of soliar covens family groups Trad groups all sorts of different pagans near and far several states away that would all come to a private plot of land in that area that had been used for for a very long time long before you or I ever set foot on it decades had been used since I believe the 60s or the 70s by people as a pagan worship place and so people would go there and we would gather on the sabbaths however only from belain to sin the rest of the year the rest of the holidays were all done indoors usually at the Unitarian Universalist Church in town sometimes at someone's home but they were all indoors and oara was the last one right before belain and everybody looked forward to belain so I have to wonder if maybe we were just kind of like skipping this one or doing things with family too because it is so close to the Christian holiday of Easter well and also you know I know for me personally it was again a time to kind of clear out and and get some stuff handled it was kind of the last hurah you know who wants to be dusting off stuff in mid July when it's 80 degrees out you know so it unfortunately spring is kind of the last hurrah so to say for doing all of your hermy tasks I think so cleaning yeah and and I think too by this time you know we're tired of being shut up we're tired of being inside and the thought of one more indoor thing is just so unappealing yeah you just kind of want to be outside and do outside things I think astrologically the whole maybe that's not the word for it I think the other point to look at is the equalness of this time you know we we mentioned the the newness the new beginnings you know setting intentions but there's also something about that equal day and night and kind of knowing that you're making that flip the days getting longer the night's getting shorter just kind of you know the same thing with the Autumn Equinox it's like that mental flip that the nights are getting longer and the days are getting shorter one thing that I have found very interesting that I just started noticing where have I been just how different the stars and the planets are in the sky at different times of year I have noticed recently that where I'm located in Massachusetts I'm now starting to be able to see the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper which I have not been able to see pretty much since maybe not so much the Equinox but maybe more like uish the literal Earth shifting like it's like it's it's visible on different levels of how we're we're making that shift the changes that you can start to see in the sky and the changes you start to see on the earth and and just in the light of the day is it's significant this time of year it's very noticeable it's not like Ule to imul is pretty much kind of the same you know that the weather is not that much different things aren't that much different lith Al lamus things aren't that much different right but oara the Spring Equinox it feels different I mean the same with the Autumn Equinox same thing it's it's it's it's a different shift yeah it's a different kind of shift you know I always I'm famous for saying another another tick another notch on the wheel of the year but this is like a notch you feel yes this is this is this isn't just a like a little uh this is like a uh you know a big it's a big one yeah and and that equalness that balance I maybe because I'm not so good I'm always striving for balance so you know when things are balanced you really feel it you know things feel great and so it kind of a good feeling Oar and I think it helps that we're kind of entering into like you were talking about the stars and shifting we're into Aries season we're into that fire that energy that let's go get them season and and you can like you said you can feel that fire you can feel that energy this time of year and it's so easy to see and and that helps me magically when I can see a candle or see incense that helps me get into the mood of doing ritual so when I can see green grass and flowers outside and sunshine I can really feel and get into like springtime you know not to mention you can feel yourself wearing less clothes and you know you're not wearing that hat and gloves you know right that's also very appealing but I think that this is definitely a time of year that doesn't get its due credit you know everybody's all for belain everybody's all for Ule you know this is the the sung holiday in my opinion we've talked before in our other podcast the stoned Witches Hour we do have an oar a 2022 recording that you can go check out I'll make sure to put a link in the show notes but we did talk then a lot about spring cleaning because it's it's such a magical thing to do right now it's such a you know we talk a lot about like for like as far as magic goes energy likes to be the same it likes similar things that's why you use um sweets for spells where you want someone to like you you know you use roses and things when you want to attract someone to you you know like for like anyway so cleaning your house cleaning your space realistically and physically can be a representation magically of cleaning yourself and cleaning your energy and so it's a very easy spell to do if you do it with intention and we talk a lot about that in our other episode I think the big takeaway um that we want we want to definitely get out there is this is a good time to plant your seeds whether it's physical seeds you know whether you're getting ready to start planting that Garden or or plant your seeds for your intentions whether it be for the next couple of months or for the whole year they say reap what you sew well here's the time to sew for sure oh I love that that that's so true that's such a good way to put it and write them down you know write them down on little slips of paper and roll them up like an actual seed they even make some biodegradable paper that has literal seeds in it if you want to get some of that and write your intentions down roll them up like a little ball and then plant that literal seed paper with your idea in it that's a an amazing way to literally put your words out there and have them grow actually what I an alternative to that and something I've actually done before is um you can write out whatever whatever it may be um write it out on a bay leaf a bay leaf is you know kind of large enough for you at least to write a few words on a bay leaf is a good alternative um because that is absolutely something that you can just bury in the ground without worry yep another fun thing I like to do in the spring is chalk I love chalk outside get yourself outside if you have a nice big sidewalk if you have a nice big street something that you can draw on especially you know I suppose you're not going to want to write a whole spell in front of your neighbor's house on the street but you can write some symbols that mean something to you on your sidewalk or on your steps in chalk and it's not going to hurt anything but it's a great way to draw sigils to write spells and to kind of put that out there in a spring timey way pay no attention to the Pentacles on the sidewalk yeah I I I think my most favorite um fun tradition is definitely the coloring of E eggs I don't it it was something that just fascinated me as a kid and I just even at this age have not gotten over it was always a fun thing with my kids I'm I'm anticipating my grandson to be old enough to color eggs uh so I eggs are the thing for me and and flowers that's the other thing you know snow crocuses I love them so much I I I do I I wish our our listeners could see I actually have snow crocus that's your background my background but for all you flower lovers this is the time where like those first Sparks come out and you got to think of yourself as a flower you are being sparked out into the world again I love that sparked out from hibernation it it's just a good time to kind of just feel renewed good time to kind of you got a new slate it's spring yeah brand new beginnings everything is fresh and new and starting poking up out of the Earth all reborn all ready to go perfect season for all of that it's just ready to go and beautiful so I think I think to wrap up I think we need to just kind of end our oara episode with what's your favorite candy chocolate Easter Bunnies oh I love peeps e gross love peeps no Peeps are an Abomination actually they just came out with fruit punch peeps and let me tell you that was panie herself bringing that with her I mean gift from the gods people ambrosia in peep form is that what you're saying yes Wan punch peeps genius that's all I got to say h just give me some good dark chocolate high quality good chocolate bunnies and I'll be happy all right well hope you enjoy your ostara it's a nice easy holiday because it looks hot like Easter no one's going to give you if you got your colored eggs and your chocolate bunnies out and flowers or your peeps ew if you have to I'll give you crap about the peeps the rest of it no one's even going to care so if you have to kind of be an undercover Pagan oara is a good time to you know go all out with your witchy self because no one will be able to tell
