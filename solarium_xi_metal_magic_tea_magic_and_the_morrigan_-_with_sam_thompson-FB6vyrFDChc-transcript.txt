it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi and welcome to the solarium shell and Lea's warm and cozy herb filled Sanctuary where the tea is always hot the herbs are always spicy and the conversations are magical I'm Lea and I'm shell and on this episode we'll be talking te- spells metal magic and the Morgan to make things more interesting we are joined by Sam Bo Thompson who's a pagan a past president of Triad Cups he's Head Metal Smith at Ravens keep Forge Chief tea Pusher at Grove Botanical tea shop and author of the book metal never lies most importantly you're forgetting a cool dude definitely a cool cat except maybe when he's around on the forge well what a mean welcome Sam thank you thank you thank you for being here we appreciate you coming on good to be here we've been very interested in you ever since we met you at Sacred Space earlier this year it was this year wasn't it yeah wow now Sam I had never heard of metal magic until I met you and some people say that it's a lost art what do you say about that yeah most people have it anytime I hear long lost I I tune out you know I just kind of shut down I'm like no I don't know um it's just I think we just have misremembered oh I like that you know because you know I'm I'm kind of Irish Pagan lack of a better word right because I am a priest of the Morgan so I kind of focus on that area you read a lot of the old lore and it's full of it you know it's just common place for for everybody and then we end up you know getting you know Advanced and the more advanced we get the Dumber we get I think sometimes you know blacksmiths at one time were considered to be magician wites but it was considered good magic to take ore out of the Earth turn it into molten metal and then craft useful items out of it was seen as very magical at one time even if we don't necessarily notice it now well when the the Industrial Revolution happened blacksmith became less needed right because in the days of your I always try to find a way to stick that word in because I just like cool every town Village you know small place whatever right all had a blacksmith because there wasn't anything in town that the blacksmith didn't touch he was very essential right from the kitchen to the battlefield you know to your your shipes to your Farmers everything through the Smithy you know I mean needles you know I mean they just didn't grow them things right you know well I guess it kind of did but dep you know anyway and so everything came through there um so I guess he's kind of like the ultimate Shape Shifter right I like that there are some episodes in some of the Lord where he is can be a very nasty individual because it was considered magical to create that stuff you know now you are kind of a a magical dude again we met you at Sac space and you shocked us a little bit when you first met us we were walking down the hallways and we saw you sitting at a table and you said hey are you Lila and shell and we're like yeah and you said Byron Ballard wants to talk to you and we were like it must be a different Lea and you introduced yourself and we talked a little little bit about your book and we talked a little bit about Byron and it was just a very surreal moment to meet you and to to talk about that to be recognized I think was a little odd represented yeah yeah I I've known Byron for about 30 years right we go we go way back you know we just call each other cousin because we just know each other you know like like I think I told Michelle that you guys were Mountain cousins yeah it's not one of I'm not a name dropper right it's just that I know that she on our write up so we wrote up together you know she's like I want to I want to want to talk to these folks I like okay well if I see them I'll pass a word on I'm good with not being known I'm I'm cool with that really you know because a lot of the more known you are the more responsibility you have you know and if nobody knows me I can be an idiot and nobody cares you know you know let me be a bigname pagan across the street you know wrong and you know everybody's on you right now you're in North Carolina and just a few months ago you guys had some devastating weather in that area people are are still recovering how are you and how are things going for other people in the area where I am at as as we're speaking today which is you know middle middle of November um I we're we're okay where I'm at I'm up close to Virginia kind of in the middle of the state Mount Ary anybody knows where Andy Griff is from it's Mayberry that's Mount Ary um fun fact so if you ever get that on you know jeopardy I want to cut um in in Byron's more from where I grew up which is in the way western part um my my town my area you know was Fally got a little wind damaged but but wasn't bad you know but they're still seeing a bad one you know where where Byron's at um I mean they still don't have drinkable water yet and I know that the mother Grove Temple mother Grove goddess Temple is still accepting donations I'll put some links in the description so that if you want to help donate I know they're doing a lot of good work with local people and donations there everybody I mean I've been amazed with the outpour ing of Civilian Community right Pagan Community I'm going to be honest I'm really kind of myed because they haven't really helped a whole lot as big as it is well I mean it's not it's not in the news now you know the news Cycle's gone everybody's mad about something else we are with um the the Tua and myself we're doing a fundraiser on first uh week of December and 100% of the donations are going directly 200% is going to um beloved Asheville which is a nonprofit that's got a great great Network and we've got a lot of people you know I probably misspoke a little bit cuz there are some folks within the Pagan community that that do care um and they've donated either time or resources to help us put on our our fundraiser and it's nobody's getting a cut right um Stephanie Woodfield is is doing it Amy Blackthorn is is giving us a pre-recorded because it's going to be a live and then there's a bunch of folks that's giv pre pre-recorded classes they're going to be just for the people that donate you know wow basically to to get look at and whether you are there on that day or not you still get the whole recording you know the live day plus everybody else pinac um giving us a class um I just got confirmation from Torne Coy she's going to give us a class I've got some others I'm kind of in the work for but I mean there there has been some folks that have you know hey yeah we'll we'll we'll support however we can you know you know if you can just kind of spread the word you know absolutely yeah that would be great because I think just people just don't know about it really because we're trying to grow it you know organic you know I'd rather have that than spend people's money advertising stuff that nobody ever sees put the money to the people exactly and this sounds like a great value for people they get to give money to something that's going to help and they also get all these wonderful classes from some amazing pagans amazing classes and some of these classes are classes you can't get anywhere else that they've designed specifically for this and it's by um by donation right so it's um there's a minimum amount for for donation which is not very much and then it's you pick a price after that do as you can so yeah do what you can you know we want you everybody to to be able to to be able to right I didn't want it to be a point to where nobody you know it priced people out cuz I'm I'm Rural right I'm in those areas that aren't uh profitable so but I wanted those folks to get on as well as people you know that could afford more to afford more and we've had some really cool donation amounts I'm very pleasantly surprised wild wild Hunt put us out this week on their notes as well so it's it's I'm pretty I'm pretty happy with it that's fantastic I have anything to do with this but it does you know because it everything you know everything's connected we are all a community yeah thank you and that's what getting back on the broomstick is all about is connecting community and trying to get people connected in ways that they might not otherwise be able to see so we're going to put that out as much as we can thank you I appreciate that welcome I think people really enjoy that so in addition to this amazing fundraiser that you're putting out you also have two websites one is Raven keep Forge for your metal smithing and one is a tea website where you're the chief tea Pusher and I'm drinking some tea right now it's not one of yours sadly but we also saw you a little bit at uh Shell's tea workshop and we got into some good conversations with you about tea and you have a tea shop is that correct I am the tea Pusher yeah it's my myself and my beloved own it right she is more in charge of the herb she's a actual trained herbalist nice threeyear apprenticeship not one of those that I read a book now I'm an herbalist kind not if there's anything wrong with that it's just that she's she's done a lot of work and this has she's gone through intensive training and this is 10 years ago so and she's continued to learn um throughout and and she'll tell you anybody else that does it they don't they don't know everything anyway so she does a lot of the herbal stuff um and I do more of the the te's you know because history of the tea and the actual Camila tea um she does all the Rus and the herb stuff and I just do stay in my Lane right now um do you come up do you come up with with different magical Blends or do you kind of focus on just flavor Blends yes okay okay that fair enough well I mean where where we are um is we're rule right so it's not like we just want to kind of hang a INR on on our door right so right right people that are around enough know they know we know right you know um I make all our all our incense that's in there I do do handr incense that we have in there but you also have to appeal to the masses yeah you know I mean and we don't we don't want to be exclusionary right I mean if people want to come in there Sunday after church and get a cup of tea okay you know I mean it's not about you know who you are we're talking you know once again we're building community and it's not just for our specific group right I mean everybody brings something to the table everybody loves too yeah you know and I think I think we've gotten into this thing to where if if you don't believe like me we can't have Association and I think that's really negatively impacted talking about Community it's negatively impacted us because we're stupid right and I don't I don't okay I do mean that because what happens is you become you know you don't grow cuz everybody thinks like you you know and you challenging your thought processes or or or new information or old information even you know you're just if you don't think like me you know that we you don't you're wrong I think that a big part of being a witch is learning and growing and being open to new things and I think that that's something that we really do well personally I especially nowadays will not tolerate intolerance y but I think that's kind of what you're saying that the hard part is actually getting people to be open and receptive to hearing something different that might challenge old beliefs and creating space for that conversation is important no matter what you're discussing whether it's climate change or or your favorite tea blend right you know I always kind of you know operate with what's the object of the exercise you know and it's to get people to to to discover that there's more out there than liptin you know and then once they start that then I can work on you know well let's look at at if you're liking tea let's look at ways we can add in some tea meditations you got to have a gateway drug right I me yes you know start adding your intentions yeah you got to you know and I've got you know there for a while before I had to go into intensive Medical Care um you know I was doing a Saturday morning tea meditation to where we would come in and just try a different tea you know classic non-flavored just tea you know and and experience the tea for what it was not for whether or not you liked it that's not on again it's not the object of the exercise it's like what can you taste you know what are you experiencing how's it making you feel you know just try to with herb itself yeah immerse yourself in what's going on versus scaling it on a scale of yes to no sounds like what I do with whiskey but I'm definitely going to try that with tea see I drink whiskey without well I used to without the eat I was a very bad I was a snob I I was bad but I don't I don't drink anymore no no tea is definitely good now I have some here and I will say you mentioned um you got to get people started with what you like and know for me when I started with tea I think I liked more of um I think it's technically shell helped me out here it's not a tea because it didn't have any of the tea leaves in it I like more infusions infusion yeah and the tea I'm drinking right now is black tea of some sort with rose hips and cranberries and I think there's a little bit of orange peel in here and I'm not sure what else it's a it's the Crimson Lake blend from witch's Moon and I absolutely love it sounds a very that's very ulie you know it really is it's very red it's very delicious it's my current favorite I love it still drinking iced tea but that's what really was kind of my entryway into teas was more herbal infusions I really liked those um particularly rose hips cranberry Citrus I like that a lot yeah I think just adding flavor you know it's more than anything else I think you know being experimental find you know you're not going to find out what you like till you find out what you don't like yeah you know and finding out what you don't like is not a bad thing you know you just learn you what you don't have to do anymore you I've tried that I don't need to try that anymore we don't have to like everything it kind of goes along with that don't be afraid to get dirty and don't be afraid to fail because it's all part of the process yeah I love that it's part of the human experience I don't like green tea there I put it out there well you just haven't found the right one that's all that's what I tell people that's what I tell people you know I don't like tea you just have we because we have about 70 different tees plus our herbs um that we have and I just tell you just haven't found you haven't found yours yet you know let's take some time we'll find I also focus on black tea because I do not like coffee and folks please do not email me about this but I do not like coffee at all um and tea has always been my source of caffeine so I always tend to lean towards the black tea or a black tea base because I'm looking for The Zing in the zoom well and and the good thing about tea is that you get all the health benefits with it you know you get your polyphenols and you've got your um antioxidants with it I mean in Europe in in the UK not Europe in the UK they recommend five cups of tea a day right I love that to for you should bring it over here and tea shell and I have discovered is one of those things it's very easy to incorporate into your magical practice because you can add all sorts of different herbs into it uh to change your intention or you can just sit with the flavor of it and just experience it like you were doing your Saturday morning meditations just kind of experience the flavor the Heat or the coldness you know and just be there in that moment the ritual of just drinking it making it like I've always gone back to those Japanese tea ceremonies the act of putting it all together and making it and then consuming it for hours right right said for hours I mean it's a thing wouldn't that be a lovely Saturday afternoon I wish I had that time I know you just haven't made the time you had the time made the time you are right now something I have made time for Mr Sam listen to this I don't know if this is your fault or what it is it is blame it on me I'm here I'm gonna blame it on you I have started melting metal and playing with metal magic oh and I made this worry stone I made this on the last full moon aluminum yeah yeah it's made out of aluminum what it looks like uh but working on molding it um it's just a primitive little Forge in my backyard uh using Charco do it I teach it literally I have a class where I'll teach it and we literally dig a hole in the ground I love that with wood I mean we've been doing this since before the copper age because they actually found in up around Michigan um First Peoples were actually uh doing Forge work with copper before the copper ow they dated it you know but I mean we've been doing this for a long and we have changed right I mean it's one technology that doesn't change you get it hot and you hit it hard that's you know we've changed how we're doing it right you know but for the most that's it you know there's magic in that and it's amazing how long people have been doing this um you know we talk about the elements air fire water and Earth and all of that is in a forge in molten metal now you've been a pagan since the '90s and you've been a primitive metal worker since like 2012 is something like that yeah so um paganism sounds like it came first oh yeah oh yeah did you always incorporate paganism in with your forging or is that new no I I knew I knew there was always something with it you know because I think I think any craft anything you do with your hands you can incorporate I'm trying to make sure I say this correctly I'm going to piss off the least amount of people I I don't have I don't have separate parts of me okay I don't have a I'm I'm a pagan here and I'm you know mundane over here or you know I don't I don't have that you know I'm just I I'm just me you know and I'm always trying to look at ways I can be more me right the ways I can always incorporate and have whatever it is that I'm doing as part of my practice and I think the more that I can incorporate that the more I stay in touch the more I stay plugged in the easier my life is you know so I I think once I started doing that it didn't take long to figure out oh wow look this is all Elemental you know and then there's the spirit of the Smith which is me so it wasn't long for me to to do that how the book came about was because nobody else had anything on it because I looked I looked really hard you know somebody surely somebody's doing this right and I ended up having to write the book because of it you know it wasn't Dam the people well it it wasn't them the people I don't really give a about be honest with you I don't mean that ugly but you know my you know my goddess would you she she she determined otherwise so now that was a question I wanted to ask you because I feel like you got a bunch of things on different spectrums how do you incorporate being a priest of the Morgan being a metal Smith and being a tea magician ultimately I know your wife calls you a tea Peddler but I'm calling you a tea magician okay the the the metal work in the Morgan's easy that's you know because I remember everybody would say well why don't you that that know the Irish mythology you know why why aren't you with Bridget right she's the Smith right you know why not why not gvu cuz he was one of the four Craftsmen right of the Tua to me it was really easy cuz I asked the same question like okay yeah why you know and it's the the etymology of her parents name is basically forged forged in fire forged by fire or in a death by iron or iron death so that's blacksmithing yeah I'm like okay I mean they absolutely do go together because blacksmithing is intimately tied to tools of War and the Morgan one of her many aspects is as the goddess of war but she's so much more than that really you know I mean that's just so you know that's what everybody kind of jumps on yeah everybody because that's you know what everybody talks about but that's just you know we we're a war of people so OB obviously that's what we see right I mean when have we not been in war somewhere in our in our lifetime you know I mean I've been in it right because I'm a I'm a combat vet but you know now uh isn't she also a godess of shapeshifting they call her the shape-shifting goddess it's your shape-shifting metal so it's not a goddess of she just is that right yeah so that that all kind of works together I mean she's you the great Queen you know so I we can we I can be here all day talking about I I get a five month class on this you know so we could we can be here all day talking about it um because I'm very passionate about her uh CU I just think I think she's known and unknown you know misrepresented a lot and there's so much more to her you know than War you know CU she's usually at the edges she's more of an instigator than anything else interesting you know she's inciter that's what she does she incites battles you know it's like okay let's just rip that scab off and let's get to let's get to it you know get to the point now do you ever find a way to incorporate metal magic and tea magic together um I've made um I've made my wife spoons spoons for her to stir with ooh there there's there's some mixed metal that that I have done we have copper bowl that does about about a tablespoon that then I put attach an iron piece to O So it's mixed metal it's really kind of cool and then I do small ones where I've just hammered the spoon out of the steel itself I have to say I was looking through your website uh Ravens keep Forge and I was very intrigued when I got to your full moon forged binding knot and I thought that was pretty badass yeah they are that's now that's some pretty heavy magic right there can you explain that to us me and Superman tiing knch and metal that's it you know right yeah it it is very much binding I I work with the mm so I can add M to them and I've had people do them for using a lot of different reasons for them and then I heat it up to where I Lally tie a knot in steel all right so it looks like 10 12 in of a 316 inch steel bar like a rope think of like a like a 10 12 inch rope but made out of steel he then Heats it up ties it into a knot and then flattens the end now that's a pretty rough powerful binding spell that's that one pretty that's pretty permanent you know I've had people I've done them for they' felt unsafe where they were so I did some work with them when we tied the knot and they hung it in the tree you know as a boundary marker which you know gandal get you some of this right now I have a question as well about product I was pretty bummed about this product you do on occasion specialized things that you work magically certain times and you offer those out to folks on your website um which Lea will post links to the website you made Raven feathers copper is it the copper ones you're is that the ones or the steel ones that I just did copper on a community forging with the copper ones the ones you did in October that was a special Fortune my first question is do you have any of those left because I was poor as you don't even know what when you were doing the order and I was so angry with myself do you no damn it I do once a month I do what I call a community forging that's what I was going to ask you that was my next question do you do the do you do these types of special magical forging regularly okay every month I'm either on the full moon or dark moon whatever I'm kind of getting a Vibe on needs to be done the feathers were special because I hadn't made those out of copper in about four years um because I reserve those because if you do it all the time it's common nobody ever sees them right but I did those as a fundraiser to send to Western North Carolina right you know donated money to both mortalis and the mother Grove because they they needed it right right and I did that as a fundraiser so I brought that one kind of out of hibernation cuz that's a that's a very special one the steel ones I have fairly regularly in stock you know if you want to get a steal one or you can commission one and we just have to kind of talk about it what you want why you want it so you do do commission orders as well that's about 80% of my business is commission work okay between the t- shop and forging those are my vocations once a month so I'll do these once a month it's a pre-order right so here's what I'm doing if it speaks to you you know here's how much it cost you go ahead and prepay it and then I do the forging it sits on her altar overnight and then I ship it out the next day so are they they usually have some sort of intention much like you said whatever you're what vibe you're feeling that month yeah you can go back and look at my blog and I'll have writeups on each one why I'm doing what it is I'm doing okay and then there's a link from the from the blog right to the to the piece you know because I mean not all things are going to speak to everybody I get that right you know and I'm not you know I don't have a dog in a fight right because this just what I'm doing if it speaks to you here we go sometimes I have extras and I'll have you know listed in there you know I think I've still got some nals from a couple of months back which was a copper piece for healing cuz we were kind of needing that at at the time and I did make some extra because of it usually it's you know I make a couple extra just for our Postal Services they lose stuff from time to time and I want to make sure that if you bought something you're going to get something right because you can't I can't make those again right and everybody is just made out of the same piece of metal so if the two of you got something during that time all three of us would be bound by that piece of metal so everybody's kind of getting that intention but everybody's kind of pulling the rope in the same direction if that makes sense you know so we're all all working on that specific intention so I think it adds to it I love that do you have any spellwork or rituals that you do before you go into these special pieces or while you're working them I do um pretty much anything I do down at the forge is always ritual it's all sacred forging once again I don't have a a me and a not me if you've seen pictures you follow me on Instagram or whatever you'll see pictures of from the for to my Shrine for the Morgan that's usually part of my end of my start if that makes sense right it's you know honoring her you know cuz she I get her last and that's you know cuz I look at her and she looks at me there's there's a line of sight there anybody that gets anything from me it'll be sacred for it you know I I do have a ritual that I've kind of designed and it's on the the four treasures of the Tua Tua DNA so yeah it's it's juicy I I love it working magic I mean all the time as a job you get to work Magic how sucky is that if you're lucky enough right if you're lucky enough to be able to just make everything magic yeah well my forg is a little different cuz I Forge with charcoal I don't use coal because my granddad had a black lung and you know them right I'm not using coal for Jack so I I make my own charcoal so I go get is it because wood doesn't burn as hot charcoal doesn't burn probably doesn't burn as hot as coal but it's a a natural reoccuring resource right because I get wood that's already fallen cut it up split it dry it put it in the kill make it charcoal and then that is what goes into my Forge so I I touch everything that goes on and 90 probably 95% of the metal that I use is scrap so it's all repurposed so it's you know it already has a life which is cool because it's got all that energy already built into it now I found this probably a bad idea but I also take herb mixtures and will add them into my metal as I'm melting it obviously it doesn't stay because the metal is much too hot but I kind of stir in tension and spellwork like that have do you ever add anything into the metal I I don't um I usually do it afterwards is I'll Infuse make herbal infusions and use that as what I call tribute because to me I'm an animist and once again redem the lord it's all in the book If you read the book it's kind of I give examples um to where Metal's alive you know and it's so you know I I give tribute to it you know that way cuz and other thing about how working with iron is it rust so you have to you know if you don't take care of it it'll not take care of you that's why people used to swear their own swords because it was what held your your binding it was your your guarantee right it bore a witness because if you broke your oath your sword would break that was was the belief at the time now I'm also an animist and I do feel that metal Stones certain crystals metal in particular holds energy very very well it can duct energy well it can hold on to that energy so I'm not surprised to hear you talk about like people swearing on their sword because it would remember in my mind that sword that metal would remember that oath that's the same with any sort of Talisman you know a ring a necklace a bracelet what what have you anything out of metal honestly not just swords once again I think it all goes back to your intention you know you'll you know and and with it you'll the more you do it and the more you work with it the more you'll you'll notice it you know I I have w around my property made out of steel you know and I'm I'm good not really worried about I can't wait till I'm able to go to Lea's house next time and have her show me this because I'm actually kind of jealous and I want to I want to me metal and make it into things well and I have not worked with aluminum I only work with four you know I work with copper bronze brass and and iron steel or the four that I work with aluminum is the only one I've worked with so far but I'm very much looking forward to working with computer and copper I think I want to try my hand at making some Aluma brass well brass is a brass is a form of of copper it's an alloy of copper um it's got uh zinc and copper is what you get for brass which is cool because we have both of those elements in us that's kind of the whole premise behind the book is that you you're already connected to the metal because it's already in you you already have iron find me somebody that don't have any iron in her body I don't have as much as the doctor says I should but I but you have it I have traces apparently you know you got to have copper because that's what enables your body to absorb the iron right um you get cold first thing that people do is they give you zinc right they boost your zinc levels up right so copper and and zinc right it makes brass and bronze is tin tin and copper make bronze and you have a Trace Amounts of of tin you get most of the stuff from your vegetables it's not a large amount I mean that's why the Romans wanted Britain was for the 10 humans don't take other people's territory unless there's something there they want I guess I guess I realize honestly and this is like I learned something new today I didn't realize that we actually had all of those Metals within us now don't go around licking copper and thinking you're gonna you know don't be a tin licker you know but but it's it's just the same as as that you know we are made up of earth air fire and water as well I I guess I didn't realize we were made up of all these Metals exactly and that was the big realization that I started working with you know and that's why the book is titled metal never lies cuz it has that guarantee it just it just is you know it's one thing cuz there's nothing out there on what the metals are you've got these blips you know and I think one person copied from everybody else you know cuz no matter where you look it's all the same and it's a lot more than that that I have found out through through my work you know I could totally be wrong but the way that I look at it and have experienced it you know is a lot different I work with them according to to their personalities you know it's like everything else there's a big difference between you know working with passion flower and and and working with Tulsi I'm a big believer on a lot of people find their own interpretations for themselves and what might mean one thing to me might mean something different to you and a third thing to Leila I think people need to just take the time to work with things and like you said find the personality of that whether it's metal or or an herb work with that personality and then you will become knowing what it means what it means to you make sense yeah totally and I think the key key thing here is is work it's just not something people want to do now you know they want to get a download or they want to get you know give me the give me the down and dirty quick and it doesn't work that way in the spirit of what you just said talk to me a little bit about what are your suggestions for people who would want to maybe start dabbling in metal magic aside from getting your book and reading it then what what can they physically start doing a lot that's the cool thing about metal magic is you don't have to be a blacksmith to do it I mean it's you already have it in you right you just need to figure out how to get that connection you the book does help because it kind of walks you through it's a workbook it's not just a me giving you those are my favorite types of books workbooks it it is a workbook you know so you can kind of come to your own conclusions on things you know and I can kind of give you this is how I see it but you know you do you right but I mean you can do simple things like use a nail as a candles strip you know but don't just use the nail become aware of the nail you know right learn learn the nail first you know have it be an ally in your magical craft versus just a tool right I think I think so much times you know CU I'm guilty of this I'm you know I'm not I'm by far not perfect but there you know I would gather gadgets right tools cuz it was cool you know and then I would put them in a my my magical box and put them away until you know eight times a year I pulled them out to do my you know High Mucky muuk stuff um I don't do that now you know all my my my my altar is a working altar that's a good way to say that yes it's a it's a living altar yeah very much so but having relationships with those tools and see we don't know how to do relationships anymore you know we got caught up in the pandemic and we don't know how to get along with folks it's just easier just to block them and get done with it I'm going to talk to somebody that speaks my language instead of working through you know when you're stuck on the bus with somebody you're gonna have to figure it out yeah you know um so I think you know learning how to have a relationship with your tools whether it be metal or wood or whatever that is if you want it to be an ally you want your practice to be all-encompassing you've got to have a relationship with it and the only way you're going to do that is to spend time you know um I cannot spend five minutes a month with my wife and expect me to have a deep relationship right right that's a good way to put it relationship with relationships you know I mean if you're wanting that type of relationship get a goldfish that's a great thing your your point applies to so many things because I've said similar things about herbs you know you you've got to kind of commune with the herbs if you want them to start working in your favor you know and so this absolutely makes total sense to me that that and it sounds like you don't have to forge metal no to perform metal magic and that's a good thing because folks like me I can't forge metal in my location but I'm intrigued by metal magic yeah and and and there's there's a lot of different ways that you can do it you know I think your your imagination is going to be your limit you know being able if you have a task sit with it you know what what do you want what what do you need you know how can I do this and just kind of work through it I mean that's how I do most of my stuff is like all right how am I going to do that you know some things come down the down the line when I get to that point where I need it right because I'm I'm a world's worst chess player right I want to know have everything I'm a Capricorn all my shit's got to line up in both directions all the time you I got to know everything possibly that could go wrong so I already got the answer fire yep that's me and I am so not like that anymore you know because it I spend a lot of a lot of needless energy on things that that that never never come to come to pass now metal is not only in our bodies but it's on our altars it's in our home it's in our buildings it's in our cars it's in the gadgets that we use you mentioned four metals in particular that I think are relatively common and they're the ones that you work with a lot you said steel copper bronze and Brass bronze and brass can you tell us anything about the properties just a little bit about magical properties of those we'll start with copper it's been really kind of eye opening experience for me with it is because the mundane uses are actually the same as the magical uses it really doesn't change a whole lot right um so if you start with copper I always kind of looked at Copper as kind of like the blood of the Earth because it's the softest of those three Metals right um very much way to to send energy right we have it in our walls conductive right for electricity carries electricity right so I mean it's you know it's very much having energy it helps energy go from one place to another perfect right and it can be shined up new it's really bright um but so and and I think it's natural property is healing you know it's antimicrobial right so that's why hospitals use it you know in certain areas because nothing hangs on it I have copper pipes water pipes in in my house because it's a that's what they used back then MH okay so that's that's that um if we go into brass I I love brass brass is like I get the feeling it's kind of like my my my favorite uncle you know very utilitarian right I like that yeah you know it doesn't it doesn't rust you know it doesn't you know it's it's you have to sh in the Army we shine the out of it right it was bright um but it if you look up at at the nautical your your bells are made out of brass right a lot of the propellers are made out of brass because they don't rust you know they're very they're very tough um in a lot of manufacturing areas to where you you can't have a anything that causes a spark you know you'll use brass hammers right and that sounds like the properties could be more kind of resistance or or protection or morph you know one of the things that I noticed as I was doing my studies as I walked through the house and you'd be surprised at the amount of brass I had in my house that I I forgot it hides it just kind of Blends into his surroundings you know you probably got um brass candle holders all over your house and you don't even know it well you've forgotten them you know they just kind of just Blended in you know they they don't stick out anymore right but they're there doing the work yeah you know and they're just kind of hanging out even door hinges um you still can find door hinges that are actually not you know brass yeah brass um you know bronze is you know uh very reflective right cuz the Romans used it they would shine it up as that was where they got a lot of their mirrors and stuff from you know so the high-end people could afford that that's why they took over Britain for the 10 to make the bronze right um Bronze Statues right so they hold their shape well um you know there's a there's a a sense of of value right because it's a bronze medal right looks like a little gold yeah um and it's brightest brass has probably heard that term cuz it shines up to where you know almost gold looking to me it's like l i just it's just that kind of everything you mean like um the Celtic god L the king of the tuad gold box flying you know and I am Lou guy standing up on the top of the you know I have no idea what Lou looks like but I just kind of picture you know standing up on top of a mountain bright and bold and Majestic and it's very Majestic um whereas copper is kind of wi you get that gentle wisdom it's kind of like a grandparent you know kind of kind of wisdom to it you know and then you get into into iron I use iron steel inter changeably um because steel is 98% iron and so it's only 2% of other stuff that makes it Steel part of it being carbon and they get that they got that back in the day just from the forging process because you've got carbon and a forge and it just automatically makes it steel and there's like 3,500 different grades of Steel and though at me I don't know all of them I'm not a Myer just I'm a blacksmith but steel to me is very rigid right so it's focused has that laser that laser like lcus strong we build buildings around steel steel is the bones of your building the foundation of things yeah you look at the 1950s you got these guys walking around these skycrapers and they're just they're just steel beams right so they hold up these magnificent buildings um you know and it's it'll hold an edge it's a great tool but you have to take care of it you know there's a there's a re recept reciprocity thank you you're welcome that word it has that I help shell with them all the time I got you so I mean it's just there's a lot with steel that I like because it'll take care of you if you take care of it you there there's a lot of relationship with that was that too too much not enough that was perfect it's a lot like herbs oddly enough it's a lot like everything the the form and function of it is also how it acts magically if you know what it does in the mundane world you can have a darn good idea of what it does in the magical world and what it'll do for your practice I love that and if you'll notice a lot of the steel that's on my sight I tempered that's what gives it the colorful and tempering um when you temper steel this isn't tool steel for most of it that I use I do make aamis that that are tool steel so it holds an edge right but when you temper it it it it locks it in to a certain aspect right I'm sure you've heard don't lose your temper yes growing up right and what happens is if if it gets too hot right because you're hotheaded it gets too hot it loses the temper and it will no longer hold an edge so I do that with most of my steel because one I think it's pretty two it has that magical essence of it's been you know this is its perfect it's locked in if that makes sense it does now I have one last question you work with the Morgan and she is part of the Tua Donan and from what I understand the Fay aren't real fond of iron or Forge steel okay how does that how do you how does that work I don't really have a lot of relationship with the Fay it's because of all the iron well see I don't around here we call them the cousins the land Spirits more right yeah I I do have a a lot of I mean it's all over the place right um it's in the soil where we live cuz I got two iron forges from back in the Revolutionary times where they would get iron from the soil to make Canyon balls and stuff Pig irons what they call it anyway so we have a lot of it naturally you know you can go down to our Creek and you can see the rust line along the creek where you know it just kind of rusts so I don't know you know you have to ask somebody you know diimler you know how all that works I don't you know I don't have that experience I have a lot of activity around my Fords I don't know if it's a fay or not because I'm just I got other things that are on top of mine you know but I know they don't seem to mind it I think here in America in particular on the East Coast here through the Appalachian mountain ranges you know we do have a lot of metal we do have a lot of things like that in the soil I think the land spirits and the Fay here in America probably don't mind too much they're just used to it yeah well you know I I we we have an agreement that you know I take care of everything and you know they don't they don't mess with me much you know I'll leave them milk you know so they're have that reciprocal relationship you know what I mean once again you got you know you you have your stuff I'm not going to mess with it and you don't mess with any mine before we let you go Sam I want you to remind us of where folks can go to donate for folks in Western North Carolina and I want you to remind us of your website and socials okay the donate it's on my website

things that you can find here it's just a treasure Trove I absolutely love probably not black salt I give you the ingredients for it because everybody makes it different perfect I've got mine but the the charcoal that you get for me um now i' I've kind of upgraded of upgraded my charcoal so what I use now for um because I do have the Anvil dust right which is the the what I call the shavings right so pieces of metal that that fall off from the forging and you mix that with charcoal is part of your and whatever that makes your black salt the charcoal that I use now is what's left over from the forge fires o charcoal that didn't get consumed mhm so it's been through a forging and still there so that's kind of stout stuff if you ask me so I now that as the charcoal um that goes out for black salt your DIY black salt love it I've got a a recipe uh YouTube thingy where I tell you how I make mine you it's like a big I don't have any secrets I'm not into that yeah you know no gatekeeping here
