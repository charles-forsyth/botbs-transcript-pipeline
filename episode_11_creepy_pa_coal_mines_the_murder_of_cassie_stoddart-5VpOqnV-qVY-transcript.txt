fullon confession I am not doing an asylum today it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi and welcome to episode 11 of the stoned Witches Hour it's 4:20 a.m. and I'm Leila and I'm shell and we're high and we're High I looked up the independent state mental hospital and it's [ __ ] I found the same blurb paragraph about hauntings and screams identical on 15 different websites and I could find nothing else no firsthand accounts no nothing just kind of like that blurb advertising their Museum and their like old wi so I'm pretty sure it's [ __ ] kind of like how the episode where I ended up almost debunking Amityville Horror right but even with the Amityville Horror there's a [ __ ] ton of stories you could tell like people say they had stuff or this experience or this happen with this one I couldn't find any firsthand accounts I mean I found that line that said people had them but I couldn't find any right so I ended up it killed me but I I ended up dropping it I put in so much time researching and it and I could but anyway I think tonight where I'm going to take us is we're g to we're going to talk about the uh the coal mines in Pennsylvania so welcome everybody let's get ghosty and this evening I'm going to take us on a True Crime Adventure I know I said I was going to take us to an asylum I lied I am instead is it that you lied or that you were high and forgot it's actually because they suck so while I was looking around I I stumbled Upon A True Crime Story that I really wanted to tell it it's kind of recent which is not as you know I like to go a little further in the past but this one happed in 2006 and we're going to explore the the scream murder of Cassie Stoddard in Idaho in pocat telli Idaho oh well it it sounds like we uh we've got a A good episode coming up we'll go to Idaho we'll go to Pennsylvania we'll get high how can you go onong we'll smoke lots of good weed oh yeah so hang out with us witches while we smoke enough weed to kill a rhino as

to take down large mammals your your pot Bowl twin flame my pot Bowl twin flame there you go I wonder if he's a stuffer and a shover shell don't don't don't we're we're talking about shafts enough this evening let's not go there we do have a not safe for work on this podcast but we should also let people know that we have the humor of immature 12y olds yeah but you know in the with the spin of late 40s early 50y old females there you go yeah so completely inappropriate is what you're saying Okay so you know how I always say that I am old-fashioned tried and true glass pipe blah blah blah glass pipe that's your answer to everything glass pipe my my glass pipe uh Theory here so I was at a store yesterday and happen to see some stuff catch my eyeballs you know that that new fangled trend of the silicone pieces so I picked me up and let me tell you part of it was the price 9.99 you can't beat a pipe for $9.99 wow that's a that's a good price right there that's an excellent price I don't care what it's made out of wood ceramic uh glass whatever for $9.99 when you need a pipe rock it take what you can get for that price so this is a beautiful green and and it has a lid oh how cute it has a lid oh I like a lid lid a lid is nice you know I think it was between the fact that it was green and black and the fact that it had a lid that half sold me right there and then after I got it I'm like oh my God it's got a carb this thing is like rubber and has a carb no I'm impressed so this this is what I got yesterday and I'm already in love I'm already in love how easy nice and easy to clean you don't have to worry about it breaking in your bag or your pocket it's got a cab well and also when I put it in my pocket I don't have to worry about oh [ __ ] did I get it all the way out am I gonna [ __ ] burn a hole in my pocket lose my half half my weed that's in my pipe right exactly or then have stinky pocket the lid the lid I was like the lid and I thought when I saw this I was like you know I've always wanted to try it their bong is good and it has a lid I love the lid how often do you want to go like hiking or something and you want to bring a bowl but where you going to put it you can't bring packed bowl with you but if it's got a lid that's nice well that's what I'm saying you know if you if you pack a full tight Bowl which we all know that I'm a super Packer like I'm an overacker I'm like a stuff and you know a stuff and shove you're all dainty putting it in there and I'm just like stuff and shove stuff and shove so when you got a big fatty packed and then you need to put it in your pocket you're not going to you're not going to lose a flake because I'm a Wast notot want knot and I telling you if I drop a tiny little flake I bend over and pick it up and put it back in same unless it's carpet well as we know yeah you oh that hurts me that still hurts me but so so yeah I I I'm very happy with my my new my new silicone piece I love that silicone pipe I am uh talking to Wazoo The Grand Wazoo of wazu glass to replace my my uh Woody pipe my Gandalf Woody considering that he's a [ __ ] amazing artist it's it's awesome I cannot yet afford to get one of his bubblers though so that's on the list someday I will get a bubbler but we are definitely replacing the Woody because that is my favorite pipe of all time it's perfect I I like his style better than the typical like Birchwood looking pipes you see he definitely puts a better flare on it oh man it looks fantastic I cannot tell you how many times people saw that pipe and we like what kind of wood is that like nope it's glass glass y y and he makes them with cute little mushrooms on them you know little caterpillars and little bugs stuff foresty they do they do they're so great they look foresty I love them everyone should have and they smoke fantastically the way I really like the long Gandalf because it it gives it a little bit of um you know it helps to kind of cool the smoke a little bit when it has to kind of go that far that's why I like bongs helps to kind of cool down the smoke when you're taking big rips or off of shells big stuffed bowls and uh so you need you know you don't want that smoke to burn your throat so much so it was nice having that extra stem so well to all of our listeners out there today today's Public Service Announcement brought to you by shell is if you smoke anywhere outside or off your property you need a silicone pipe with a cap because you can't go wrong with a silicone pipe with a cap you will not you will not break it you will not lose your weed like win-win people winwin people so CL I am so impressed the glass goddess is suggesting silicone that's that's an endorsement right there now we are gonna have to do an update just an update indorsement once I get to the point where I need to clean it because that's the true test how easy is it to clean and and you know the store clerk said oh this is so easy and he was like showing me how you can like squeeze it out like you'd squeeze the rest of your toothpaste out oh damn you're telling me this I'm hearing this but I need proof of the pudding when it is time and I am physically trying to handle that [ __ ] on my own is it easy or is it not easy you are resonating that pipe Fast and Furious you know how I am I know how you do oh yeah so we will we will have an update endorsement once I've had to clean it oh I'm curious all right cool you might even get me to buy one stay tuned for the cleaning silicone episode all right I'm down don't pay attention to that [ __ ] but I feel very accomplished and I feel very um 21st century pop smoker now that I have getting something all new and different and like updated Beyond give me a glass pipe so I was gonna talk about the Pennsylvania coal mines today those are just scary on their own yeah well I know that I I I know that this story isn't going to be necessarily something you're going to love because your fear of confined spaces yeah thanks for that sh the definition of a coal mine is a confined space underground yeah I see what you're doing here uhuh do what I can do what I can but you know in in Pennsylvania if if folks don't know this back in in the 1800s a lot of what fueled America at that point in time was coal you know we we didn't have natural gas or didn't have the the natural gas that we're using now the the oil production we have now um we relied a lot on on coal didn't like the trains run on it the the ships the steam ships and everything and people would use it to heat their homes as well people would have you know coal buckets and they'd have to shovel a couple scoops of coal in before bed to heat the house overnight oh yeah and a lot of the more rural places in New York and Pa you still have like the coal shoots in the cellar yep yep so you know coal was was a big thing and a lot of that you know I'm no geologist obviously any of our listeners who who've been following us since the beginning know that I am definitely no geologist but I feel that the majority of Pennsylvania is has pretty much got coal mines under it it's like that state was built on top of a big nugget of freaking coal right and they're just honeycombed all over the place and they and that's the thing the whole state is one big freaking honeycomb and actually probably the majority of the mining is not too far uh from from where where you and I are are are from about an hour down in the Pennsylvania in the wilberry Scranton area lacana county is the uh probably the most famous well there's a couple famous ones but for for our our eastern part of Pennsylvania the most famous on was the lacana coal mines actually as a child and I know I've told you this before and you thought this was the creepiest thing on the planet you can actually go and do tours of the coal mines and as a child my father used to take us down to the coalmines um and then when I your dad's idea of fun and everyone else's idea of fun are like so far different and then when my CH when when my children were small did he take them too my father took my children to the Pennsylvania coal mines and lacana your father should be stopped the man's a monster you get a certificate saying that you made it out of the coal mines like a live yeah yeah yeah that's hey kids if you make it out live you're gonna get a certificate woohoo yeah you know at the time you think it's cool but as an adult looking back you're like wow you know there's a good vote of confidence I get a certificate for living through it right but it was cool it was it was very cool there actually is a a coal mine that caught on fire I want to say in like the 70s or something oh yeah it's still burning still burning you can still go there now there's houses the place is so creepy and what it looks like is it looks like almost like smoke is just oozing from the ground it is but it looks like that and it's creepy yeah it's like some sort of something out of a dystopian future nightmare film and it's just randomly happening in Pennsylvania yeah there's nothing they can do about it they say that it's going to keep burning for like the longest time basically until it burns all the coal you know we could have probably heated America for 20 years on that freaking burn that's a good fire yeah that is some kind of fire so as you can imagine you know for decades and decades and decades and decades and decades there are countless people that worked in the mines dug the mines were mine employees and you know back in in the 1800s we're not talking there was no OSHA there was not safety Cruise you know so to even sit here and try to Fathom the amount of tragic deaths that happened in each one of these coal mines is I I can't even no I can't even either I mean one of their um methods of one of their SA methods back then was literally the canary in the coal mine literally a bird in a cage to tell them if the the breathing if the levels of oxygen had gotten so low is to be unsafe that was that was their idea of a safety measure but I mean it and and because of that you know I mean it's it's impossible to say uh with any degree of certainty how many people literally have died in those coal mines for for whatever reason cave in um lack of oxygen uh explosion fire whatever even today you're still today hearing about miners getting trapped or killed in minds and this is now with all the things that we have now I can't even imagine how danger it was back in the 1800s I mean I I know there's been a couple more um I feel like there was one more recent in in Asia that I'm forgetting but you know a few years back that big one in Chile what was it 22 coal miners or something like that they made a movie out of it I think the the more recent one as well too yeah so I know there was the one in Chile and then like a year or two after that was one somewhere in Asia and why is this [ __ ] happening in in this time in society yeah Ju Just the astronomical amount of deaths I mean we could just sit here and talk for a hundred years about ghosts in the minds I mean just imagine if every single day when you went to work it was essentially a staredown with the Grim re her that's what these people face I can't imagine and and you know my fear of enclosed spaces just the thought of having to work in an environment like that I mean they put children in small people and I'm a small people down in some of those in some of those enclosed P places and I I couldn't handle that I mean it's definitely not something I don't even like thinking about it um but the the things that the way that they kept these people practically indentured and the way they treated people was was terrible awful and they're still doing that I mean and I don't know I'm going to admit that right now I don't know but do we need coal like do we even need that anymore aren't there other things that we could use that not only would cause less loss of life but less be less damaging to the environment why have we not corrected this yet because we're greedy oh there you hit the nail on the head shell ding ding ding ding ding on that note I'm going to pack a bowl and cry about capitalism anyway I mean that's that's that's definitely one of those instances um ask a stupid question get a stupid answer kind of no you're right I did I asked a stupid question and you gave me no the perfect answer the very blunt honest answer because we're greedy it's because we're greedy you're right but you know there's there's a lot of of shafts that are are standout shafts for hauntings one is called the and and you know you you beautiful folk from Pennsylvania if I am pronouncing these towns wrong and you probably will none of them are pronounced the way you think that's what that's what a high shell does it's all about phonetics not proper pronunciation we're from that area and I bet we'll pronounce half of these incorrectly because you're like oh that should have the French French pronunciation right no no it should not it should have the Pennsylvania pronunciation right right you know being of Dutch origin let me let me see if I can get a grip on some of these names there you go so you know one of one of um the the shafts that because you know basically if you think of a honeycomb all around the state there's there's these specific shafts end points as you want to say I'm not gonna make any shaft jokes I will stay away from those as much as I can I'm trying I'm trying not to make any shaft jokes I'm I'm I'm not I'm just high enough I'm not so high that I'm gonna do it so there you go okay okay so I want to talk about the nanic shaft there we go see and now I'm not even giggling at shaft I'm being so good and it is located in the nanic township which is in Lawrence I'm sure if we are saying n shanic incorrectly we'll get an email I'm sure we will um maybe from one of our good friends like Tom and Mike yes please do Tom Mike if we are saying the shanic incorrectly shoot us an email check out their podcast Story Time with Tom and Mike they're two lifelong friends who entertain themselves and you with stories of their lives crazy theories and general idiocy we'll be on their show on March 25th or Tom's going to be on our show here in a few weeks so you can correct us then correct prce on our on our Pennsylvania Dutch names so um in the fall of 1898 so just about hundred years before um my son was born it was reported uh that there was a ghost of one of the miners haunting that particular mine now you know these people go to work every day um in in life or death situations to feed their families you know these are hardworking folks this ghost that that they they see um would enter the mine with his pick in his lamp every night and he would work the mine his little ghost self would work his little ghosty ass off and work the mine all night so even dead he couldn't get a break from the mine he had to go in there every night with his little pick and mine Some Coal yep and then he would emerge from the shaft each Dawn and then Vanishing in thin air wow spend your afterlife working your shitty job at the time U miners theorized that it was the spirit of Elijah boow Walker a worker who disappeared inside the mine a few years earlier and just he went to work one day and that was it poof gone what they didn't even find his body they don't know what happened never found his body he just went in the mine one day to work never came out never know what happened to him because you got to remember they didn't they might have gone in as a crew but you know Joe Blow is 50 feet that way and then this guy's over here like they weren't there was no buddy system yeah so Elijah goes down the shaft and he goes off on his own to go mine coold and no one ever finds him again they never found anything poof gone when did they start seeing his ghost a few years later but here here's here's the [ __ ] for some reason they believe that he was murdered wow wow so not just a disappearance but possibly potentially a murder so it doesn't necessarily and they and they have they they were never able to to kind of pinpoint either way but because there was there was no known explosions there was no cave there was no body you know it's not like he just lost oxygen and dropped dead and was like there like poof Gone without a trace which is what led them to say well you know maybe it was murder because you know no caveen no explosion no flooding you know no dead from you know lack of oxygen whatever you don't just po you don't just poof gone although I have my own theory that you know the dragons came and had them as little snack and then like kind of burrowed back into their little corner yeah so that's my theory but you know different episode there you go hey it's as good as any that would explain why no body was found you know crunch crunch gone exactly exactly um but here's the crazy thing to this day to this day there are many people who believe that the Summit View Drive in nanic Township is still haunted it is kind of situated along abandoned uh mine entrances that were first obviously built in the uh late 1700s early 1800s and one of the local Legends is that near the mine entrance in the mid 1900s uh like about 1950 1960s is group of kids playing in front of the entrance and all of the kids it wasn't just one kid heard this they all heard blood curdling screams coming from the mines and when they went and told their family um who then you know how towns are rural towns you know you tell one person the whole family the whole town Knows by dinner time before they got done telling the story neighbors three blocks over knew so everyone theorized that the children were potentially hearing the anguish cries of Elijah balker being murdered oh wow so the think you know we've talked before about traumatic offense kind of being a movie that replays over and over again so they think maybe those kids heard that ghost print right oh wow because because you know if you're talking 1950s 1960s right you're talking you know anywhere from 50 to 70 years after after Elijah disappeared so you know you're not talking like five years later kind of thing um you're you're talking decades later so it it's it they they feel that it could have been a murder based on never finding him and then these ghostly blood curdling screams they think link to him and the fact that it could have been murder and not a work-related death might be an interesting case of a ghost helping solve their own missing person's case but you know that I I think the thing that that grabbed me you know it's it there you know I'm going to talk about a couple other mind Minds down there but this particular snippet story caught me because every night you see that ghost at the entrance with his Lantern and his pick going in and every Dawn you see see that ghost coming out of that entrance and Vanishing the thin air that guy doesn't know he's done working man you're done you know have you ever done something so often that you can't get it out of your head you're constant day and night you're just thinking it and and that's what he's doing you know it must have been that kind of job and maybe he died so suddenly that he's just doing that same thing over and over and over again his his soul his Spirit never broke the cycle between life and death and I I feel like this poor guy's Soul feels like all right it's morning got to get up and go to work yeah and now and he's just stuck there wow but then it then it seems like once he's in there the town's people are hearing him relive his murder every day with those screams oh wow wow what would cause someone to be trapped like that that's sad you know and it could be that that horrific instant out of the blue death right right so so surprising like you said that he doesn't know he's dead yet right you know he still is just going to work and he just happens to be going to work on his last day every time right like Groundhog's Day GH oh like the shittiest coal miner Groundhog Day Ever yeah so you know I want to hop over um to to bellw shaft um another shaft uh this one's in Scranton about an hour or so south of where where we're from so you're saying p psylvia has multiple shafts lots of shafts they're long they're very long shafts now now listen listen to this [ __ ] up statistic so so again we're we're bouncing over to Bell viw shaft and Scranton during the 19th century the minds of the Wyoming cold Fields experienced an average of five fatalities each month five fatalities a month five a month I'm not going to work got those odds no that's an unacceptable death count how can you be like oh that's more than one a week that's more than one a week well you know these These are people that that was the main industry in Pennsylvania that was their only source of income I I don't think a lot of these coal miners would have chosen that job I think that job was chosen for them I need money I have to go work in the coal mine where were they going to go you know their family their their father their father's father had worked the coal mines they didn't have enough money to go anywhere their family was in debt they had to to help support the family there was no way for them to go anywhere they were kept in a cycle of poverty well and you know Pennsylvania is is is a lot it's made up a lot like New York State you know if if you're not familiar with Pennsylvania you know everybody's heard of Philly and you know and and and Pittsburgh and Scranton wilbury but you know what what people don't really realize if they've never been there if you are not in the Ws Spar Scranton area everything Beyond City Limits is like desol if you are not in Philadelphia everything outside of City Limits is desol like dense forested land farming like Pennsylvania is not California if you did not live in a big city there was not a lot of opportunity industry opportunity um you know you kind of had to do the job that was available in the little small [ __ ] in town that you were that you were born and raised in and so a lot of these people coal mining was their only option their only option of employment the education was bad there the opportunities were bad there they they were pretty much kept there but the coal mining was good yeah for some people so you know five fatalities a month that was kind of they just accepted that that's just the way it was they just accepted that wow and Records showed that in 1872 there was 67 fatalities Now 52 weeks in a year 67 fatalities that's well more than one a week yeah yeah and in 1877 there were 40 um in 1879 there were 59 wow this is and this is all just in this one shaft that's awful that's awful that is not a good shaft this is not in in all the the mines in Pennsylvania collectively this is just in this bellie shaft in Scranton o wow and death death did not discriminate by age um records show that the youngest victims to die in the mines and and I I feel bad even telling you this because I know your heart's going to break they didn't you know when your family needed money if your father died in the coal mine and if you had a son that was physically able he just went there somebody has to feed the family so some of the youngest victims to die um one in particular was a 10-year-old Evan Jones oh that does break my heart oh Evan he was killed November 1st 1879 there was also a a John Murray uh who was 11 um Joseph narie who was 11 these these people those poor absolute babies those poor babies there was a a Mor a Noah Morgan who was 12 and died in a m on Christmas Eve oh no oh that poor baby so um you know these weren't just these weren't just adults these were children as well yeah again that little people they I think there's a predominant number like you said if if the if the primary bread winner died they would go to the next able-bodied male very often and and the smaller the better to be honest they liked kids because they could fit because they could fit that's right and and and you know we just talked about about the guy in the other shaft Elijah there that like you know he might his his his Spirit was so shocked at the death that he's still there right imagine being a 10-year-old boy who doesn't really they don't even understand the gravity of this job no no with all those children dying um you know over those couple years I mentioned we're talking at least off the top you know there's just that shaft alone over over you know a short spod of time less than 10 years a couple hundred people died in that shaft alone including a bunch of children the sightings and the voices and the apparitions got so bad that in 1872 the Scranton Republican did a report on the hauntings of the belly view shaft and according to the miners the ghosts seem to be roughly six feet in height they kind of were made of like a white Smoky vapory substance oh wow your traditional like ghosty Misty Vapor ghost ghosty ghost like your typical atypical Hollywood style ghost and what the Scranton Republican reported in their newspaper article they quoted miners as saying pistols were fired at them and although many shots pass through him he seems un vulnerable to Pistol balls he has frightened the mules and driven the men from their Chambers threatening individual persons and produced a general consternation among the workmen so basically there was one particular ghost who was basically trying to scare people out of the minds terrorizing people and they shot at him is that you know I hear all the time about people from Florida trying to shoot at the tornadoes and or that the H trying to shoot at the hurricanes and everything is shooting at a ghost kind of like trying to shoot at a storm I know I'm high but what do you think you're going to accomplish shooting a ghost right I mean doesn't everybody know but even back in the 1800s everyone knew that ghosts were not corporeal like there was no body there why would you shoot at it I don't know I don't understand the logic there I also am high and I still don't get it I don't know maybe that's why I don't get it maybe maybe they weren't high enough maybe they weren't high enough I mean I I regularly see white Misty clouds floating around me and I don't shoot at them you know I I kind of look at you know if you if you if you look at it from a witchy point of view which is obviously not the point of view these folks were looking at it from right but if you look at it from a witchy point of view when I hear this little snippet Story the first thing that comes to my mind is someone was killed in that mine and it's trying to save people from going in and it's scaring them away trying to scare them out no kind of they get out get out you know don't come in here this is a dangerous place back off yeah whereas um a a good non- ghost believing folk are looking as that as a threat because it said right in the article they they found it as a threat to their individual person I'm not sure I believe that Twist of the story I almost tend to think that that Spirit was trying to warn them off from working in the minds you might be right you might be right you know and they just took it in the opposite cont took it differently yeah because it does try to sound it does sound like it's trying to get them to go away you know it frightened the mules away it dri and it it said you know driven the men from their ch ERS he was trying to scare them out of the Mind Chambers so I my take on it from a witchy point of view is that that Spirit was actually trying to help them and their interpretation was it was threatening so then you know the Taylor mine in Taylor Pennsylvania in 1906 miners refused to enter portions of the tailor mine because they were fearful of ghosts described as hollow-eyed white robed illumination forms of men bearing light that had no flicker interesting interesting like the different variety of ghosts that people see here the different types right several miners attempted to approach the ghost but it was said it would disappear every time they got close well that's better than trying to shoot it at least that makes more sense right over in Taylor we got the Peacekeeper Ghost Hunter miners but yeah they were they were actually eager to try to get to the bottom of the The Haunting mystery in Taylor and a number of the miners stationed elves around the perim perimeter of the Haunted chamber because they basically wanted I don't know if they thought they were going to like capture it and have a conversation like we're surrounding you ghostly figure like I don't even know what the what the end game was with that one but the ghost did appear floating around the Ring of Miners and then vanished and again this was also reported by the Scranton Republican and according to the Scranton Republican the doubtful ones were now convinced and fled the mine in Terror forever interesting so maybe this one's trying to scare people away too right and then and then you know we kind of bounced over to the the black diamond cery in lern uh in lern county and this one these miners were definitely more fearless and they kind of had the if this is haunted we got work to do you know you ghosties do your thing because we got some coal to do so there was a minor that ended up being confined to his bed after shock from seeing a ghost because part of that fearlessness was disbelief oh right so they were like this isn't really happening and so this guy walked up to it and got so scared he ended up being like bedridden where you know some of the other shafts you have you have these ghosts that are terrorizing the miners and driving them from the shafts this guy is like you do your thing I'm going to do my thing because you're not real well that didn't work out for him so he ended up yeah being confined to his bed because he was so in shock when he for himself saw one with his very own eyes so all the towns people then assumed that it had to be a scary ghost if big old Mr rough and tough got scared into his bed yeah yeah right scare the biggest guy in town and a lot more people are going to believe you and his name was Anthony steny and this was in 1912 and he again he worked at the Black Diamond cery but he was found UNC ious on the floor of the chamber and he later claimed that he seen a ghost whose fingertips glowed with fire what the hell oh that sounds like a coalmine ghost for sure and they called it the Flaming Phantom and it scared so many workers at the mine that they actually shut down for a day because no one wanted to see The Apparition that stunky had seen so skeptic steny sees this flaming finger Apparition but he's not the only one other people have seen the same thing wow and then the then everybody got scared because if they didn't see it for themselves they were freaked out by the fact that Mr Ruff and Tumble steny was freaked out yeah the skeptic sees it and is scared so scared this rough and tough guy is bedridden that would scare me I'd be scared but isn't it kind of weird so you know some of these coal mines are you know we're we're kind of bouncing around shaft to shaft here but you know one of okay on the next episode of shell and Lea go to Pornhub I have been so good I have been sitting over here smoking my bong beans so good every time you said shaft I just grinned to myself and I said nothing I said nothing and now we're bouncing shaft to shaft okay sorry all right I I've now put the uh the Adolescent boy in my brain in timeout go ahead so you know in in in one chamber how about we'll we'll move to chamber we'll call them Chambers but everybody appreciate that everybody knows we're talking shafts you know one is a is a minor who goes to work every day one is a ghost you can't shoot through one is a flamethrower what is going on down here is there something I mean I guess it makes sense but not every shaft is seeing the T same type of visual apparition you know there's a difference between a coal miner ghost going to work every day and freaking fiery fingertip guy you know what I mean yeah I do and and there there's also a difference between that and like your average you know rocking chair in the Attic bedroom ghost I mean right I mean coal mines themselves kind of look like the depths of hell so is it that is it the environment is it the abuse these people went through what is it that makes these these apparitions so scary so hell likee well in 1913 bouncing over to the Chickasaw mine in kiding Pennsylvania in the Pittsburgh Daily Post on March 10th 1913 the article read men refus to work in ghost haunted mine apparitions frightened Miners and runs trip of loaded cars to entrance I don't blame them these things were happening so often in every single shaft across the state right it was making it into the things like the Pittsburgh Daily Post the Scranton Republican like this was actually making news at the time it was happening enough that it was it was disrupting work and it was causing work stoppages and and you know that itself would be news and then to find out what's causing those work stop which as I mentioned it was quite the sensation so you know here at the at the Chickasaw mine they would get loaded car loaded you know the little coal cars on the little coal train they would get the the cars loaded with coal and then all of a sudden they would just randomly tip over and all the coal would be dumped all over and this listen to this listen to this and and this is why I'm fascinated the chicka saw mine what was printed in the Pittsburgh Daily Post was men rushed from the mind with terrifying stories of an apparition of a half man half beast carrying a luminous a luminous dinner pale and going chamber to chamber ordering them to quit work wow the men did not seek a second warning and were reported to have dropped their tools and fled on the spot well [ __ ] I wouldn't wait for a second warning either I'm sorry a ghost with a glowing lunchbox comes and tells you it's time to quit work you [ __ ] quit work now we're we we we move to a different shaft and this guy's half man half beast carrying a dinner pail I'm just fascinated that the ghost stories from every chamber across the state they're seeing such visually different apparitions yeah groups of rough and tumble coal mining guys who from coal mining families are seeing a half man half beast and everyone that was working that day described the same thing that's wild right this isn't like one guy crying wolf or nothing this is like groups of workers towns people right they're like the guys from Armageddon right yeah these are badass [ __ ] getting scared to death no wait those were those were oil drillers sorry coal miners but are they all called rough necks or is that offensive I'll have to look that up before I put it in the podcast I don't know I don't know but you know I I just there's more mines there's more shafts um there's more stories there's more hauntings but these particular ones I wanted to talk about today because you know like I said the fact the these particular ones drew me in not that they were long spook spectacular events but like the variation of what people were seeing I just wanted to I I wanted to not only kind of convey that to you but I wanted to convey to our listeners the vast difference of the type of paranormal activity that is happening to this day across the state of Pennsylvania where these M shafts are located you know you're talking about the differences but I can't get the sameness the similarities out of my head you know the so many people would see the same weird Apparition they'd be able to describe it they all talked about what what it said what it looked like you know what was going on and and it just blows my mind that even though each particular mine may have had its own Apparition its own flavor of ghost that particular ghost was seen by so many different people even Skeptics that were so frightened that they would stop work right then and there or were taken they were bedridden because they were so scared that that's kind of interesting but you know I mean I just I I I think that that every coal mine um every shaft every chamber in the state of Pennsylvania in my opinion has to have some sort of however minimal activity based on the mass quantities of fatalities that happened in every one of those shafts and Chambers yeah that's that's wild and and just because you know there's there's a lot of different theories on uh types of stone and and things in the earth and you know just digging into the Earth like that has to like you said it's honeycombed what type of you know what type of vortexes or what type of things have we created there that might trap energy or might hold energy there right right right absolutely or or have released like that Dragon movie we were kind of talking about like what did we dig into that we didn't understand maybe you know we talk we talked a little bit at the beginning and I didn't necessarily focus on that um for my story today but there is also the shaft that's still on fire I can't even imagine what that town is like because that town had to be abandoned it is abandoned I think there are still one or two people or families one or two houses that are still um occupied but I believe most people got bought out and and had to leave it's just too unhealthy but I I just I I get the vibe of almost like an East Coast Ghost Town very much so I think they they try to keep people away from there now yeah for health reasons yeah yeah you can find pictures online there's all sorts of things that were painted on the roads and stuff like that people's tires would melt on the roads it's crazy it's just wild air there is is borderline toxic yeah but you know I I definitely think it's a cool place I I I've always been fascinated by the the Pennsylvania coal mines due to my father taking me there when I was a child yeah due to your dad's interesting idea of a good time I have my certificate of authenticity so yeah you know if if you're a East coaster if you're from the state of Pennsylvania the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania check out the coal mines man if you're if you're looking if you're in for a good spook and if you do if any of our listeners do go to the Pennsylvania coal mines if you have an experience shoot us an email I'd love to hear a a personal experience from one of our listeners from the coalmines because I'm I'm very intrigued by the variety of apparitions oh gosh yeah maybe for our next you know it happened you know it haunted to me I love that it haunted to me it haunted to me you know maybe on our next uh you know listener Stories episode we'll read your haunted ghost tunnel shaft ghost Coal Mine coal mine shaft I don't know your haunted Coal Mine story so yeah send them on in if you've got them if you're gonna ask people to send in stories about their haunted shafts Then I then I'm gonna ask for stories of your haunted boobies yes we want all of the haunted stories send them in I actually went to my most favorite store yesterday oh what's the name of your most favorite store my most favorite store is called Happy Valley oh I like the name yeah and actually love that they have I don't know if you see this no you can't see oh a bag I see the bag oh the key look at that cool pink key I love I love their key logo that's their logo for Happy Valley like that old like a skeleton key oh that's cute that's different that is you know it's not a tree or a leaf or a planet it's different it's the key to happiness it's the key to the Happy Valley I love it the key to happiness they're weed so anyway went to Happy Valley yesterday and I love these folks they have sales I got some White Wedding which is always a good standard you always love the wedding and I got Super Lemon Haze I love anything lemon and here's the thing I would like to say about the white wedding in the Super Lemon Hayes currently they are the High Times Cannabis Cup of Massachusetts 2021 first place winners both of them so they're both a good a good strain a good what's that tpine turpine trying to use my good words they're they're a good uh cultivar they're a good cultivar good cultivar they're good cultivars both both of them um in different categories one was a I think one was a sativa and one was an overall basically like a hybrid but they both won first place very very nice then I got some Dog Patch oh that sounds like fun I like the Dog Patch you know me I go for High T Dog Patch is a high THC yeah so I actually had a really uh successful trip to Happy Valley I left the valley happy nice you have three different cultivars right correct do they look different do they taste any different like have you tried all three well here's the thing you know the Super Lemon Haze always has that stronger Citrus taste very yes that's one of the things I like about it and it has that Citrus smell now the thing that frustrates me about Dog Patch is I feel like it smells like fruit and then it tastes like weed nice to your nose not so much to your palette it's not that it tastes bad but the smell gives you an expectation of a more fruity sweet hint and you're not getting that you're getting I am smoking weed I think that's kind of like coffee you know you smell coffee and it smells so good and then you taste it and it's different and it's because the molecules are so delicate that you're the acids in your mouth to destroy them so you can smell all of them but you can't taste all of them I wonder if that's the same for TP beans in in the bud so you can smell that floral but you can't taste it here's the thing with Dog Patch it's definitely more condensed and more crystallized so it's it's good I ain't knocking it but the smell and The Taste do not mesh which one is the crystallast which one looks the frostiest probably the white wedding out of the three honestly yeah I'm not surprised with the white in its name usually they tend to be high triome producers that one that one's 32.7% THC 32.7 nice you know the the Super Lemon Haz is got that I don't want to say like that yellowy green but definitely more like a lighter green whereas whereas the the the Dog Patch more like that plant green the lemon haze is the kind green and the Dog Patch is the swag green right right okay and then and then the white wedding is the so crystally it's hard to tell what kind of Green Oh I like that yeah nice and crystally so you got it sounds like you have nice little variety there a little shakery Board of uh cannabis well you know I I like to get variety when I go to the store I'm going I'm going with this mindset productive smoke and melt into the couch smoke because you know right now I I might want Mountain to the couch smoke but you know tomorrow afternoon I might want productive smoke I always try to have on hand both options productive high and drooling High I agree I think I I actually do the exact same thing I again I grow my own so I have quite a bit on hand of I usually try to grow two or three different cultivars at a time because I don't like being stuck smoking the exact same thing for months on end I do often get delivery from my favorite place the gas station um little shout out to the gas station serves the Inland Empire but I when I when I look for something I do look for the same thing I want something usually for pain management um and relaxation is a big one and so are do you try to go for like like a more equal amount of THC CBD then no actually I for CBDs I like to get um you know I'll get CBD separate I'll get a a full spectrum CB dabbable powder that I can either put under my tongue to work fast or dab it and smoke it oh so you are smoking it I thought you were GNA say that you're not smoking the CBD I do both um I will put it under my tongue uh to eat it in larger amounts and I will also dab it for quick acting um but then I'll also do dabs usually of a high concentrate THC that's um more of an indicia variety that's good for pain and so I like to keep something like that would be more your melt in the couch kind of thing and then I I like to have a lot on hand because my husband and I work in the same office and we both work a lot online so we'll sit here and we'll pass a bong or a bowl back and forth all day long uh so we like to have something that's an up high like the like a jack hair strain like we have that blueberry Jack hair that we're almost out of so we like to also have like an up productive because we are smoking quite a bit all day you know it kind of I have ADHD I'm I'm highly distracted so you know it's nice to kind of have something to keep me on an even peel keep me focused exactly but keep me productive but today what am I smoking today we did get a delivery so yeah I'm smoking my um Jack hair quite a bit that's my kind of like main all day smoke and then when I want a little bit of uh you know a little pain relief evening wear evening wear that's a nice way to put it I go for the abusive o which I got from oh I've never heard of that oh it's a nice one it it might be just Californian I'm not positive uh it's a combination um you know some people say were kind of uh developed out of OG Kush but this one's called abusive OG straight indicia nice high THC I don't honestly know what the percentage is but nice high THC and uh for me it helps with the pain but you know I stay steady for for someone who's not an everyday user I would go kind of slow on this abusive OG um You probably would recommend the same for some of the stuff that you smoke you know just have have a a hit have two hits depending on you know what your tolerance level is you have to remember give a second to see what happens before you smoke more you can always smoke more you can't unsmoke it yeah I'm gonna use my mother-in-law as an example yet again if she wants to smoke sometimes for relaxation to help her sleep she takes one hit or maybe two hits and that's really it that's all she needs there's no problem you're going to have a lot more fun and you're going to be a lot more comfortable if you try just a little bit at first try one to wait a half an hour wait an hour see how you feel then try to you know keep some CBDs on hand because that can help you a little bit if you do overdo it go slow I guess is all I'm saying there's there's no this is an a race I wish I I wish I could get that here in Massachusetts because that sounds like something that would that would do my back problems up real nicely if I was having a flare up Yes actually it does help and and you know cannabis does help a lot with inflammation so that's why I like to to eat it as well as smoke it because the smoking makes it happen faster but once you eat it there's a slightly different reaction um and it does help your body lower inflammation and a lot of times even if it can't help with the pain itself it might help with the inflammation that the pain is causing and that can help give you some leave right right that sounds like that would be that would be a good one for my back definitely well I'll make sure to have a store of it for when you guys come out and visit right I just think I don't understand well I guess I do understand it because you know people are doing a lot of their own grows and as things legalized um that wave of legalization just keeps going across the country but you can tell that there's a lot of stuff that we can get the same and then there's stuff you know that that I can't get that you get and that you can't get that I get and you know like on our last episode I had that straw Nana rocking good stuff probably not something that you could get your hands on out there it's not I had to order seeds in order to be able to this abuse of OG just sounds right up my alley as far as uh pain management and I will probably never get to put my hands on it until I go to California but it's just it's just kind of weird how you know you you I guess people don't always realize that what you can get on the East Coast isn't necessarily what you can get on the west coast and I think one thing that people don't realize is how much prohibition hurts people I I am a huge proponent for smoking just for smoking sake but I'm also proponent of using it for all the vastly different things that it can help people with and prohibition right now is preventing you from getting this amazing really strong indicia strain that that's fabulous for pain and you can't get it because I can't get it to you to Massachusetts from California and that's because of prohibition and that's [ __ ] we should be able to pass that [ __ ] back and forth there should be zero problems with that it should be as regulated as an ear of corn right but you know we're getting there we're getting there more every year SL so slowly every every year another state goes legal another state goes legal another state goes legal it's soon I hope but anyway I got a story you ready for a story sh what do you have today what what are you talking about I mean I don't know if mine was scary per se because I don't live there I mean if I was dealing with the finger thrower the fir flamethrower I'd be [ __ ] myself but what do you got yeah I'm not sure what's more scary the one with the Flaming fingers or the or the half man half beast with the lit up lunch boox yeah out get out saying get out and and honestly kudos to the coal miner for listening because how often do you see on a movie or something where a ghost tells people to get out and they're just like and they stay oh I'm just gonna have dinner and maybe I'll redecorate what the heck get out something ethereal tells you to get the [ __ ] out you get out did your mother teach you to listen to your elders and by definition and by definition a ghost is your Elder just by definition a ghost is your Elder listen to your mother more than likely an ancestor listen to your ancestors people yeah yeah all right so what I've got today actually I'm going the True Crime route today so we're going to go with less paranormal and more just how shitty sometimes people can be so this one should be good I'm intrigued I'm intrigued I I actually am because you know I People Are People Are People man right so um I did not do the Asylum not because I hate asylums but because the particular one I picked sucked dear listeners she hates asylums I do hate asylums I think they're awful but that's not why that's really not I swear that's not why I didn't do it I did not do it because it sucked there was nothing to find it was very very boring looks like an interesting hospital has a very interesting uh historical Wing that has a museum in it go check it out anyway so what I did do was true crime I found the it's sometimes called the scream murder have you heard of this sh like the movie Scream just like the movie Scream is that is that that the one with the the the ghosty face yes that is the one with ghost face okay I I'm following you I know what movie you're talking about now ghosty face okay so this movie or this movie uh so this case is sometimes referred to as the scream murder and it takes place in pocatella Idaho back in 2006 and it it's very sad I went back and forth on whether I was going to use the names of the perpetrators of this crime and and I am going to I'm going to use their first names um they wanted Fame they they decided they wanted Fame and anyway we we'll get there but I'm going to use their names because they're around all the place anyways so 2006 pocatella Idaho there's a young woman 16 years old high school student named Cassie Stoddard she is by all accounts great girl straight A student she's really nice she's friendly to people very responsible so this is September it's a Friday morning Friday September 22nd in 2006 and it's a typical high school morning for Cassie she's at her locker getting ready to rock another straight a day she's gonna make out with her boyfriend of five months Matt Beckham and then later she's going to house sit that weekend for her aunt Allison and Uncle Frank you know total girl boss [ __ ] right she's got this sounds like a normal kid right exactly very normal everything's great at 8:28 that morning Cassie is filmed by her classmate Tori adamic and Brian dra as she's getting books from her locker Tori and Brian were aspiring horror film makers from school and they were friends with Cassie and more so with her boyfriend Matt later that night Cassie goes to her aunt and uncle's house which is just a few miles away from the house that she shares with her mother her stepfather her older sister chrisy and her younger brother Andrew so she's not that far from home and this is a nice house and and like a two acre lot her her aunt and uncle had actually moved from California to Idaho just like a year before this and this was like their dream home and they decided to go away for the weekend with their 13-year-old daughter and Cassie had often babysat for them so they asked her if she would babysit the house if she would house sit for them and watch their animals in the house and she's super responsible so they felt very safe having her take care of the house so while she's there she had gotten permission to have her boyfriend come over as any teenager would do and so her boyfriend Matt comes over and brings his friends Tori and Brian they decide they're going to watch some movies Tori and Brian were kind of looking more for a good time they were hoping maybe there was going to be a party or something they don't want to watch Kill Bill Volume Two they decide they're going to leave and go to the movie theater and watch a a movie Pulse I guess in the theater so after a couple hours you know you know they'd arrived they had a tour of the house and after a couple hours decided they were bored and they left so a little bit after they leave Cassie and Matt are watching the movie cuddling on the couch and some of the power goes out not all of it there's a few things on in the house but it's like the power goes out to the house like like intentional or there was bad storm they're not sure you know it just kind of seemed weird they had been hearing some strange noises you know like occasionally they'd hear a crash or something and the dog was acting odd it kept growling at the the door that would go down to the basement so they were already a little on edge and then when the lights went out and it just seemed to be a few lights in the house they were really freaked out this is you know around 9:30 10:00 which is getting close to Matt's curfew so because of this they decide to call Matt's mom and ask if he could spend the night there Cassie is scared and he's trying to be chivalrous mom of course says you are 16 no but if Cassie really is scared she can come to our house and stay Cassie says no I told my aunt and uncle would stay here you know I really can't Sherk my duties I have to stay so she decides to stay and um some of the lights came back on and things seemed to be quiet so around 10:30 11:00 Matt's mom came picked him up and they left as Matt's leaving with his mother he called his friend Tori to let him know that he was leaving Cassie and to see what they were up to maybe they could come over later tor's Whispering back and says they're busy and Brian or Matt asks Tori why he's whispering and Tori says it's because they're still in the movie theater so the next day Saturday morning uh it's the 23rd of September Matt goes over to his friend tor's house so he and Tori are hanging out spending the day together Matt's trying to get a hold of Cassie he's calling her he's texting her there's no answer nothing and so he's getting increasingly agitated is she upset with him because he wouldn't stay like what's going on and he asked Tori to drive him tor's the only one of the friends uh that has a car or license and Tori says no he can't drive him out there because he doesn't have much gas left he's barely out of gas and he needs it to get two and from school and two and from work so he he really can't understandable right so nobody hears from you know he doesn't hear from Cassie on Saturday unfortunately I'm about to tell you the reason why Cassie never answered the phone on that Saturday so after Matt calls Tori and says hey you guys want to come over and tor's wh spring and he's like no I can't come over I'm in the movie theater then he leaves and Cassie goes back to the couch and keeps watching Kill Bill then she hears noises in the basement again there's like a couple crashes and the lights go out again and for whatever reason whether she was sleeping or she was too scared to go check she never goes downstairs and then a short time after the lights go out two costume figures wearing masks holding knives come up from the basement and they slam a door trying to get her attention and then they go into the living room and they brutally attack her the crime is quick it's violent and when it's over she had been stabbed 29 or 30 times 12 of the wounds would have been fatal on their own and the wounds all came from two different knives and 11 of the killing blows came from one of the knives and one killing blow came from the other one so there's no way to tell which which would have been the one that did it and she was left there in the floor and unfortunately you can find pictures of that online too if that's wow Sunday September 24th the aunt and uncle return home from their weekend trip and their 13-year-old daughter heads into the house and she's at first a little weirded out because the door is unlocked but you know nothing she doesn't think too much of it and goes inside when she gets to the living room she is the one who sees the body Cassie's body body on the floor a of the living room laying in a pool of blood that sucks and she had been stabbed 29 times oh my God I actually have recording of the 911 [Music] call let me get your order medical stay on the line oh God oh my God oh my God [Laughter] oh my God she's called you want do you want to start CPR okay how old is she 17 wow so that was her aunt um wow and so when the when the 13-year-old cousin saw her it was her screams that alerted her parents and they came in and called 911 so in the days after that her body was found uh her boyfriend became the prime suspect he was the last person known person to see her alive and you know the significant author is always the first person you know statistics show it's like something like 50% depending on what you look at that when a woman is murdered it's her significant other half the time so obviously they looked at him but they they ruled him out pretty quickly because he had been picked up by his mother he had no blood on him you know he had a lot of he had an alibi they quickly ruled him out then they looked at Brian and Tori because they had been there that night as well you can actually see there's quite a few documentaries and there's there's a lot of clips of their um interviews online you can see them you know if you look them up at YouTube that kind of thing so then the next day that's when Matt's hanging out with his friend Tori and getting increasingly agitated because he can't get a hold of Cassie and then Sunday Sunday is when her aunt and hcle return home from their trip and their daughter sadly finds her body and calls 911 so Matt became the prime suspect and was found innocent um well he was he was determined to not be a suspect any longer right right and then attention quickly turned to the two other boys that Cassie had been with them at night Brian and Tori and you can find footage of the questioning that happened uh they were questioned over the next few days they were first interviewed that Sunday the 27th the same day that Cassie's body was found and at first you know they were like no we spent time we left it was boring there we were expecting a party party didn't happen so we left and went to the movies and they said they went to see the movie Pulse and that's where their story started to unravel they didn't know what the movie was about they couldn't remember anything about it and then their story started to differ and 3 Days Later Brian LED investigators to the area where he and Tori had taken the items they had used to disguise themselves and to kill Cassie and burned them and buried them wow and it was shortly after that that they they got a confession from Brian and told Tori what had happened in the pile of items that they had discarded were the weapons there was several knives there latex gloves black clothing red and white masks a written plan they had written out was burned so it was only partial um but they had written out what they were going to do if Matt had still been there they were planning on killing Matt too you know they they had a whole detailed holy [ __ ] a whole detailed written plan and a videotape and on that videotape you can see them the day that they recorded Cassie the day the morning that she was killed that Friday they had recorded her in the hallway you know they have videotape of the boys talking about the murder I'm going to play a clip of Brian and Tori talking about their plan to kill several people that night perf can you get like holy [ __ ] just thinking about it oh yeah so we're gonna [ __ ] kill her and her friends and we're gonna keep moving on I heard some news about Kieran she's gonna be F on from 6 to S so might kill her they dri over to Cassie s Scar the [ __ ] out of so they were planning on killing this other girl Kirsten and then leaving oh my God leaving there and going over to Cassie's house and killing Matt and Cassie if Matt had still been there they went to Kirsten's house and they actually drove around and walked around her house quite a bit but she wasn't home alone and on some of this video they talk about other times where they had tried to kill classmates they had a whole kill list they had a whole plan they wanted to kill as many people as possible and they videotaped themselves talking about this and this night was going to be their night of Rampage but the Kirsten thing didn't work out so they went back to Cassie's house and what actually had happened was they said they were bored and they were going to go to the movie theater and instead they left drove around the block parked changed into their [ __ ] costumes and then went back into the house when she had given them a tour of the house earlier Tori unlocked the door from the garage to the basement and so they came back went into the garage and then went in through that basement door wearing their stupid [ __ ] masks in their costume and carrying their knives and they created some noise hoping to get Matt and Cassie to come downstairs where they can then kill them in the basement when that didn't work they flipped the switches the breaker switches to try and scare them again because they loved the movie Scream they loved horror films they wanted to cause Terror they they f themselves some sort of filmmakers themselves smarter than the FBI you know they were going to commit the perfect crime no one came downstairs and then they heard Matt leave when he got picked up by his mother and Matt called them and they were Whispering because they were in the basement of the [ __ ] house Cassie was in and they didn't want her to hear them so then after he leaves they start making noise down there again trying to get her to come downstairs and when she doesn't they flip the Breakers and go upstairs slamming doors trying to get her to be as scared as possible and these are what 16-year-old kids 16-year-old boys these are two 16-year-old boys and you know the signs were there they were obsessed with horror movies not that being obsessed with horror movies or crime necessarily makes you a coldblooded killer you know but there's a difference between being interested and wanting to emulate correct you know and so they have all this videotape of these boys and what they had planned on doing and I would imagine um that that these kids are still in prison they are and I'll get to that too I'm going to play another part of the tape for you is 950 September 22nd 2006 unfortunately we have the gring tast of kill our two friends and they are right in that house just down the street we just talked to them we were there for an hour so that's them saying that they're going to they're getting ready to go in and kill their friends they documented this whole thing wow yep so they had left it unlocked they went in so after they go up and kill Cassie and later spend the day with her boyfriend and then are brought in by the investigators when they are finally cornered Brian did confess Tori didn't and his parents to this day insist that he's innocent but at this point their stories differ quite a bit of course they each say the other one was the instigator or made them do it Tori says that it was all Brian's idea and that he thought they were just going to go there to scare or prank Cassie and Matt Brian says that Tori charged up the stairs at Cassie and began violently stabbing her and then told Brian he had to do it and that Cassie was already dying I don't know if it's true or not but in some of the interrogations with him I saw it was implied that he would had only stabbed her once lightly like some of the stab wounds weren't as deep as others and it was possibly you know he'd only killed her once you know it was just the one stab wound that he did that would have killed her and the others were kind of you know not as deep so well that's what I was going to say didn't you say there was at least 12 different wounds that were that were fatal in and among themselves correct correct 11 from one knife and one from another so even if he is just the one he still did it but you know so he's trying to say that it was all Tori Tor is trying to say that it's all him you know the evidence shows that it was two different knives that killed her so they're both definitely responsible 16-year-old kids killed a 16-year-old girl with everything ahead of her for fun for a movie for something I don't even know I'm G to do one more clip here's where they talk after the murders stay tuned just killed Cassie we just left her house this is not a [ __ ] joke I stabbed her and throw I saw her lightess body just disappear dude I just killed Cassie that was Brian so the one who said I killed Cassie that was Brian wow wow now I've watched some interviews with them you can see there's one called team Killers life without parole there's another one called uh lost something I'll have to double check and see or you can see them in jail so um and and how they act afterwards Brian now does admit to responsibility he does admit that you know poor decision poor impulse control bad idea Tori still says he's innocent and Tori's mother has even written this really not great book saying how innocent he is and how he got screwed over by the system what happened was uh they were both charged obviously because of this overwhelming evidence they were both charged uh Brian's trial because of the brutality of the crime and the fact of how premeditated it was they were tried as adults Brian's trial began in the beginning of April 2007 and tor's began May 31st 2007 they both had the exact same charges one count of Murder in the first degree and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree wow so Brian's trial was over very quickly April 17th 2007 Brian was found guilty of first-degree murder and first deegree conspiracy to commit murder mostly because he had already confessed and he's the one who showed them where the stuff was the video yeah yeah quick overdone yep did it tor's trial took longer because again he tried to say that he didn't do any of it it was all Brian's idea total innocent babe in the woods and they did read transcripts of some of that video that I played for you and you know obviously did not go over well so they were both found guilty same charges June 8th 2007 Tory was found guilty on the exact same charges Brian and Tor are both incarcerated in the Idaho State Correctional Institution in Kuna which is in adaa County Idaho and they've both tried to appeal their sentences for being too harsh now on the one hand 16-year-olds I do completely get that a life sentence without the chance for parole might be harsh and and current wisdom said they don't usually do that anymore however again because of the overwhelming evidence because of how brutal it was how premeditated it was they these guys aren't getting out and they've they've tried and I I guess some people think possibly Brian may have rehabilitated himself and and may possibly be a candidate for them that or someone who they might consider I don't know but Tori definitely not again his mom wrote that creepy book uh he says he's innocent if you watch some of the mannerisms between him and his parents they answer for him they talk over him it's really weird it's not great wow as for Cassie and Cassie's family her aunt and uncle still own the home they can't sell it they've tried no one will buy it they redid the living room but they said they can't go in there well yeah even I saw um an interview with the Uncle Frank uh was was done in October of 2014 it was in the Idaho State Journal and he says that their dream home had turned into the world's worst nightmare they had thought it was going to be perfect and instead just barely a year after living there you know this happened to their poor need and his wife lost her job afterward she became depressed and was on a lot of medication his stepdaughter the the 13-year-old girl who had found poor Cassie's body she had a breakdown she attempted to commit suicide she I mean how devastating for this family and well you got to figure you know this was only what 13 15 years ago 2006 is when it happened yeah 16 years ago yeah my heart goes out to that whole family and her brother um Cassie's brother his name is Andrew he was just a year and a half younger than her he said he always looked up to her they were like best friends they'd always been close and he says it's still hard and he was featured in an interview as well um just a few years ago and he says that it's not something that they've ever really gotten over and he says he will never forgive The Killers you could I I I couldn't I could no I couldn't either there's a quote a couple quotes of his one says Andrew says quote again from the Idaho State Journal he says we love her it's always going to be a part of us it's not like it's ever going to go away it's always on the back of our minds but we focus on keeping our family strong instead of focusing on the bad we focus on the good and when she was still around nobody should ever have to go through it it makes you appreciate things a lot more he said you never know how fragile life is you never know how easy it is for someone to be gone the next day nobody expects that you never how could you know yeah yeah I mean geez yeah that's my super sad true crime story of Cassie Stoddard who by all accounts was just amazing you know had so much potential all 16-year-old kids really goodness and could potentially still be in that living room I did actually I was not looking for this nor did I expect it but in that interview with her Uncle Frank um he does mention that they've all had experiences in the house and they do think that she's still there I would I would almost expect it based on the circumstances I would almost expect it to to yeah absolutely yeah they they never go in that room even even if it's just the Spectre of memory you know that's that's difficult but you know they um yeah he says in that article it does say that they've all had experiences um seeing her in the house so I don't know if that's good or sad the whole thing just it just sucks it just all sucks well there you go the scream murder so [ __ ] those dudes I almost called them [ __ ] and [ __ ] for throughout the whole thing that is pretty that's pretty shitty and you know it hasn't in the whole grand scheme of a life sentence you know after 16 years they think that they've fulfilled their penants you know what I mean right right they're still here and one of them hasn't even accepted or you know for someone who wanted to have Fame and wanted to be known he sure as hell is avoiding it now exactly exactly and and I get the fact that they were kids and sometimes kids brains are different than adults brains that's why we try children differently than we try adults but damn really especially if even after 16 years he can't accept responsibility for the [ __ ] up [ __ ] that he did no no he deserves nothing nothing yeah yeah time does not heal all wounds unforunately [ __ ] that and this is Def this is definitely a case where time does not heal all wounds especially 16 years he hasn't even been in jail the well he's been in jail now about the same amount of time that that she was quote unquote allowed to live on this Earth and and that's just that's just not enough no you wanted your Fame you can have your Fame in the Idaho state prison system exactly I I'm with her brother Andrew I mean seriously [ __ ] them no forgiveness yeah but at the same time look forward and and remember how precious life is hug the people that you love tell them you love them
