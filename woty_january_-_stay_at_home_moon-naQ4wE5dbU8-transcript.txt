it's 4:20 a.m. so what we've decided to do for 2023 hold on we're not done with the introduction no I'm trying to come up with an introduction for you it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hello to all our stoned witches new witchlings and hi priestesses welcome to a special wheel of the Year full Moon episode of the stoned Witches Hour for 20123 we've decided to do something a little different instead of covering the eight sabbaths of the wheel of the year we're going to be covering a full moon esps no more notches in our wheel no more notches or maybe if you want to think different ticks this is a different tick in our wheel we're like taking the shift and then ticking with that shift for the next cycle the moon cycle so for 2023 what we're going to do is we have completed the full cycle of sabbaths so now we're going to move on and complete our wheel with going through the full cycle of espit Welcome to the wheel of the Year espit Edition of the stoned witch's hour and bringing you some witchy knowledge I'm Leila and bringing you some witchy stuff from the witch City I'm shelle oh oh that's right shell over there in Salem Massachusetts the witch capital of the world and it is so the witch capital of the world over on the east coast it is super super cold this time of year we're in January and this year the full moon is on January 6th and just as a tidbit for those in Eastern Standard time it will be at 608 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the 6th so it's kind of an early evening full moon as far as the peak Peak full moons are important to witches and wiccans and pagans and all sorts of other Heathen type religions because Farmers too Farmers too to everyone to Sailors the tides are ruled by the full moon ER doctors police a lot of them will say anecdotally that on the full moon there are more calls and more visits to the ER and you know people say that the wild comes out out on the full moon and we all kind of feel that energy it's very easy to go outside on a full moon and to look up and see that beautiful silver light and feel some kind of way you know it's it's funny because you know we've discussed before I have two adult children I have tortured these children their whole lives you know Sports and different activities other than that and no matter where we're going even if I said it yesterday the day before and every day for the six months prior kid kid look at the Moon look at the Moon like to the point where they'd be like yep and they wouldn't even look like kids look at the Moon yep yep whatever Mom yeah I'm still that Mom and now they find it funny and endearing but there was that point really the moon again mom it was the same Moon as yesterday and I'm like but it's not that's something that so many witches and pagans have in common we all kind of have that love and that adoration for the moon in her full goddess form and it it's something that draws everyone I think it's hard not to feel magical when you're outside looking at that full moon kind of shining down at you I do find it interesting that the almanac if you ever read the Farmers Almanac not witchy or Pagan related whatsoever very Moon focused as far as you know crop planting and things of that nature it isn't just kind of that Pagan Community or that witch community so to say that find a deep importance in the moon in those Cycles people all across the land love the moon how could you not well a lot of pagan rituals and sabbaths that we just went through last year when our wheel of the year series are based on mostly farmer cycles and livestock cycles and and how people harvesting how people had to live very close to the land and the moon cycles are the same thing just kind of on a much smaller scale and so we kind of go through that waxing where the Moon is getting Fuller and bigger and then that waning cycle where things are are getting smaller and slowing down until they're gone and that kind of follows a whole magical cycle that way of building up to the full moon and Gathering that energy and building it to the full moon and then releasing it at that culmination and then kind of going within and doing maybe vanishings or or more looking within as that Moon is waning and going to the dark one thing I found interesting is for those of you who don't know it there is a like a a quote unquote Associated name with each of the moons here for January this is what is called the full wolf Moon which how can you not love a pretty silver wolf howand on occasion you look at that full moon and all you can think of is howling at the moon I I actually hear like legit here over this past summer in the year 2022 we have a neighbor boy cute kid probably I don't know between nine and 12 maybe he will actually open the window and lean out his second floor window and Howl at the Moon and I find that so endearing yet hysterical all at the same that's great I can't say I blame him uh but you know where these names come from and and I do want to touch on that each month as we as we discover the names of each of those the wolf Moon drives from this is the time where wolves kind of create that communication amongst each other it's so cold and so chilly um they can travel uh their their their howling Communications can go further and they can communicate with their pack sometimes it's to protect their territory sometimes it's to communicate they're basically very active because of being able to communicate and needing to communicate for various reasons due to the climate yep and there are a few other names for that wolf moon is the most common one that you'll see for January but also other indigenous people had very similar names for January's Moon usually relating to the fact that it's the middle of freaking winter so like the cre people called it the cold moon or the frost exploding Moon uh the algonkin called it the freeze up Moon uh the Dakota called it the severe or the hard Moon the Canada Goose Moon the Great Moon the spirit moon or the greetings moon but mostly you'll just see it referred to like shell said as the wolf Moon I would like to point out it's the first moon and the first winter moon is not always in January fun fact the first moon of winter is actually whenever the full moon is post Solstice so the first moon of the winter season still could be in December this year it just happens to not be in December so this is our our first winter Moon some of the things people like to do on full moons typically other than you know if you're lucky enough to have a Coven or a circle or a group of people that you can do ritual with you can do your asit which basically just means a meeting of witches it can be a ritual it can be a meeting it can be a time to get together to do a spell it can be a full moon so that's all espet really means but if you're lucky enough to get together with a coven or a group of people to do a full moon ritual that's great but if you can't there are still a lot of magical things that you can do on the wolf Moon it also especially for folks like you and I we kind of hermit this time of year so true I don't like to be cold I don't like to go out I just want to be warm and cozy so for those of you like us you know there's a lot of a lot of good things you can do solitary that are equally as effective if you don't have a a a coven or group to go to or just have no desire to leave your house in these temperatures one great go-to you know I mentioned this before we started recording we have done this and it didn't even dawn on me until I was mentioning it to you before we recorded we have been doing this for Lord 25 years the Crystal Cave meditation always a great go-to it's it's like the OG of getting you into that reflective yet calming space in these winter months I look at like the January and February moons especially is kind of like that introspection so to say it gives you kind of a good opportunity for deep self-reflection maybe it's because well you're not leaving the house what the hell else are you going to do besides figure your own out for once because I ain't figuring my out during the summer because that's I got fun stuff to do yeah this is a great time to do meditations and particular longer meditations or self hypnosis type meditations and you can find those on like YouTube or Spotify Apple music I mean you can find the guided ones but you can also I mean kind of the way we did it you just you do it enough that you just almost have it memorized and just kind of put yourself there and relive that medit ation in your head without needing to be guided but there are great recorded guided ones on like I said YouTube Spotify wherever you can absolutely find somebody else reading the meditation and just have that playing in the background for you you can also record one for yourself if you're interested in that if you want to write your own script and write your own guided meditation and then record yourself doing that if you can't find something um that's perfect that works as well too but meditation is fabulous this time of year like shelle said going inward is something we all kind of already do in the winter time so doing it with intention is definitely a really great thing to do on this Wolf full Moon Stones for this month I like quartz just plain clear quartz hematite and obsidian you know dark colors protective colors colors about going within I have one of my children is January baby shout out to the boy his birthstone is garnet oh I love Garnet this time of year yeah so so you know that to me you know that January Vibe is that dark deep blood colored garnet I I do like all of the other Stones you mentioned absolutely I'm sitting here with my hematite ring right now when I think of January I think of that Garnet I love all of those stones together particularly for January you know you've got that blood red you've got the the dark silver gray of your hematite you know you've got your black of the obsidian and the white of your quartz which is all goddess colors which is all it's the dark of night and that blood red of the Sunrise it's it's definitely what I think of when I think of January so those stones for sure to me particularly this time of year I like to charge and make sure they're all kind of charged up for the winter time and you know as far as incense you know again I'm more of the make my own as opposed to buying the sticks you know this time of year I'm pulling exactly what you'd think I'm pulling you know those piny birchy very cedy winter smells but yet you know that on the on the opposite side of that that cinnamony nutmeggy Apple I love these simmer pots I'm cutting up these oranges I'm cutting up apples and cinnamon sticks and just burning that thing all day long that's a ritual in and of itself sometimes it's all about the comfort and the The Hearth and Home and and being cozy shell hates to be cold but she likes the smell of the Winter Woods while she's cozy with that cinnamon and Nutmeg I like it when it I like that feeling but I like it to be 70 degrees ah camping season cannot wait oh blink of an eye it'll be here I can't wait I have a really good habit as well that if you use magical tools good time to cleanse them whether it be your alter tools your Stones even tarot cards good time to cleanse how do you cleanse them see that can depend depends on my mood my motivation sometimes it can be just as simple as getting them somehow some way in that Moonlight whether it be you actually Take It Outside or window sill you know going back to Shell doesn't like to be cold sometimes a window sill is just as effective long as somehow some way that light touches it I feel like I'm good to go whether it's through a window or just out in nature you know obviously in the summer time I like to have my things outside and and such um but in the winter time I am just as content with window S I agree as long as you can get the item in the Moonlight itself I feel like that's a key component Moon bathe your tools what I like to do particularly is I like to charge Moon water on the full moon I also like to cleanse and charge my crystals what I'll do is I'll have a spot either in my yard or at a window sill if I don't have an already consecrated spot just go to a spot that's going to get a little bit of Moonlight and cast a small circle just basically visualize light in a circle around you acknowledge the directions East South West North Air fire water and Earth acknowledge Spirit EnV Vision that this is dedicated space that this is Sacred Space for you and then you can put your tools or your chalice full of water or sea shell full of water or crystals in that space and if your intent is to charge them you can leave them in that space and know that as the Moonlight shines down on them over the night of the full moon they're going to gather that energy and collect the energy in a safe and sacred place the next morning you can go out or go to the window sill and collect your items and thank that space and just kind of Envision it waiting there for the next time that you need it and then you've got your charged water and now you have Moon water that you can use in spells and rituals for the rest of the month and you know I'm glad you mentioned for the rest of the month real quick got a question for you how long do you feel in your wise opinion how long do you keep moonwater for for ever well I was reading I was reading something online the other day where where there are some people that believe that every full moon you have to dump out the previous and start a new and like that's a waste I I've been there I've done that I've I've had times in my life when I've done every magical ritual to a tea and and there's times when that is certainly applicable and I do feel that if you're renewing your moon water every month yeah I think that's going to be a little bit more powerful but how much more powerful really really if it's water that has been blessed by the moon I don't feel like that's something that goes away in my personal opinion but I do see that some people in their practice might feel that they want it to be renewed every month and so that's a good idea and there's certainly something to be said for having a regular practice where you cleanse your tools and your alter space with smoke with sea salt with moonlight every single month and kind of cleanse and renew that energy and that's one of those cyclical things and doing it regularly and in a cycle like that gives it power and can give it magic so what you're saying is you do believe Moon water has an expiration date no I'm saying I don't believe moonwater has an expiration date but I am saying that if it means enough to you to throw it out or to re cleanse it or reconsecrate it every month I can see Power in that but I I don't think it's any better personally in my practice remember a couple years ago like two three years ago there was a super moon that was a Blue Moon yes it was like a blue super moon yeah I still got that water I ain't giving that up I don't think C and I don't think that that would ever lose any kind of charge if I was going to be doing a spell a very powerful spell and you offered me Moon water that have in charge last month or Moon water that was from your supercharged Moon a couple years ago I probably would take the couple years ago water so that's what I'm saying right so can Moon water go stale sure absolutely can that magic drain out for some reason absolutely but does it usually not in my opinion no I'm just thinking in terms if you try to equate this to Catholicism I'm just wondering if there's someone at the Vatican who is tasked with nope that Holy water's expired nope can't use that holy water anymore well you can use that holy water but I don't know how that's G to work out for you but I also do believe in power of belief and if you believe it still has that then it does and if you believe that it has lost it it is weaker than it is so I do believe part of it is also power of belief I agree here's another cool thing that I wanted to talk about something that I like to do for rituals full moons and other rituals as well we've been talking about Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs and sigils in particular lately on our regular podcast and I got to thinking about the way that I was taught how to do sigils now I love the thing with sigils and one thing that I've done in the past is you know sometimes when you're a mom you got to kind of multitask get stuff done do things in bulk the full moon is a good time to take some of those sigils I was always a fan still am of carving them into candles I love candle magic so I would take those sigils and you know maybe I needed to do something on the new moon but on the full moon I would create those sigils carve them in the candles charge it under the full moon and then tuck them away and then use them on the new moon because leading up to the new moon I might have Mom activ ities and I didn't have time to do that so I would do those things like preemptively on the full moon so that they were ready and magically charged by the new moon basically sigils are just a type of symbol that you create it's a magical symbol it can be created from other well-known magical symbols that you use and charge with your intention or you can create one very personal to you and one of the easiest ways to do that is write out your intention say you want to have the intention of my podcast is wildly successful so you would write that down on a piece of paper and then you'll go through and cross off any repeating letters then go through and cross off any vowels take the remaining letters and then write them on top of each other one on top of the other make it decorative if you want make it fancy connect them in ways that look good or feel good to you and when you're done you'll have a symbol it won't look like a letter it'll look like some type of symbol that's your sigil that stands for the intention that you wrote down you can take that sigil like shell said and then carve it on a candle and then anytime you burn that candle whether it's at a full moon or a dark moon or anytime whenever you burn that candle with the sigil that you created on it it will help to release that energy and to move you closer to that intention and if you create that sigil on a full moon all of that energy all of that power of the fullness of the culmination of energy you can pour that right into that sigil and have that energy there as if you've already completed the intention that you wrote down well and that's kind of what the universe is doing at the time of the full moon it's kind of inviting us to take pause and ask ourselves what are we manifesting or what do we want to manifest in our lives so you know you take that that sigil that you've come up with whatever way you do it you can do it the way that Leila mentioned or maybe you want a horse for Christmas so your sigil is a horse whatever however you come up with it but you take that sigil and you kind of use that in whatever way works for you whether it's candle magic or written magic or if it's just something you know like a symbol that you just visualize in your head you use that to manifest that that's what the full moon the universe and the moon are inviting you to do what do you manifesting what do you want to manifest and charge your sigil with that as you're creating the sigil and drawing it make sure you're thinking of all those things that you want to manifest and pouring that energy into your sigil creation and then draw a circle around the sigil to hold that energy in just like the Moon is a full circle you need to draw a circle around your sigil to kind of gather that energy into it you know another thing I just thought of I've also written them down on a little square paper it maybe a pretty marker or colorful depending on what it was and like carry that in your wallet or your purse or your pocket for either a full moon cycle or or or you know maybe a partial cycle depending on your intent and what you're trying to manifest but sometimes just continually focusing on that sigil you can also create a Sigil using the write it out letters method and made some sort of design at the end that really invoked that intention then take that and put it on a perfume bottle or put it on a bottle of uh oil like say you want to say you're trying to draw love into your life and you write your intention you create your sigil and then you put that sigil on a bottle of rose oil right and charge that under the full moon and then use that oil to draw the sigil on your skin with your perfume or with that oil it's yet another way to kind of bring that energy in but it's all been charged by the full moon and by the energy that that full moon invokes think of the full moon I always think of the full moon as like a pregnant belly belly as that pregnant belly is getting bigger till it's at its complete fullness you know you're trying to you're trying to grow stations yeah grow something put things into action you don't need to be fancy and you don't need to have a lot of tools and and things like that you don't need to have a Coven or group of people um you just need you and the moon oh I love that that's a very beautiful sentiment and those are some of the times I think I have felt the most magical is when I have been by myself or with our coven out in the woods under the full moon and just reveling in that light and in that fullness of being together or just being by myself me and the moon together and it it's just it's primordial maybe something's so magical about it I think both of them are equally magical that doing it with your with your posy and then taking it all in by yourself oh my gosh I agree there's something special about both of those you know here's an interesting thing I would like to I would like to interject here and get your opinion well I kind of know your opinion but I'm going to force you to tell the people's your opinion the full moon in my opinion is really a three-day event basically it is it totally is and then basically it is again kind of thing is how I look at those three days I agree so let's say for example pulling this out of thin air that the full moon is on a Friday night you're busy Friday night the kids have a concert you got a babysit the dog whatever you got a hot date hot you got a work party that moon is still full on Thursday and Saturday just as well so I kind of look at it as I really when it comes to terms of Full Moon I give myself that thre day window so like this full moon you know January 6th for me it's like the fifth sixth and seventh I agree both in our Circle amarat coven days and in our regular days regular days in our any tradition that we have learned and or been a part of it has been pretty pretty widely accepted that the the full moon and even high holidays you kind of have that window I I like how you explained it it it almost is it totally is and it still kind of is yeah yeah and so you can you can work with that that's workable if you're doing High magic obviously the exact the day do if you're doing High magic you're doing it at 6:08 p.m. Eastern Standard Time January 6 people and you're in your robes you have your sigils you have everything marked out and I love that there's Beauty in that but if I'm doing the Crystal Cave meditation is my full moon ritual solitary I can do that on Thursday night at like 1100 p.m. no harm no foul do your Crystal Cave meditation put your crystals in the window that gets the most Moonlight put a chalice of water there do your blessing do your meditation and go to bed and you know and then go party Friday night that's right right Howl at the Moon in a different way right right so you know that's again going back to some of the the things I love about about Witchcraft and and paganism is that it's okay that I do it on Thursday and no one's damning me to anywhere that's right it's all what you want to do what works for you and that's that's what the beauty is of these Pagan and Heathen religions is that it's all about Flow It's All About Cycles it's all about working with the rhythm of yourself and your spirituality and not against it or or not with someone else's schedule your schedule your Rhythm your cycles and if we haven't learned anything else in the last 2 and a half years we have learned flexibility right so I be doing a solitary ritual on the full moon at 6:08 Eastern which is middle of the freaking afternoon in California but I'll be doing a ritual at 6:08 and I know shell will be doing something so let's all of us go outside even for a second and howl at the full moon on January 6 all of our little cyber coven here our stoned witches but
