is a simple meditation to help connect you to the energies of the earth I would first recommend that you find a quiet place where you can sit comfortably and you won't be disturbed about 10 minutes if it's possible for things that remind you of the Earth around you maybe it's crystals or Stones maybe it's sticks or maybe it's things in Earth colors with Browns and greens maybe have some plants but whatever it is the most important thing is to be in a place where you're comfortable sit or lie down and feel the floor or the Earth beneath you if you're lucky enough to have your bare feet on the ground sit in the grass or just sit in your favorite chair or lay down and be comfortable  when you're ready close your eyes  take a slow deep breath in through your nose in your belly  exhale gently through your mouth  letting the tension slow down we're rolling away from you and sinking into the Earth down away rolling away into the Earth  again in Hell selling your Valley  exhale releasing letting go  with each breath you are settling more deeply into yourself into the earth into relaxation  relax and noticed your breathing  you're breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide in harmony with the trees with plants in the green life all around you you breathe in and they breathe out  you breathe out and they breathe in  remember imagine or Envision a tree the rustle of leaves the warmth of the sun on branches the scent of bark just breathe and remember the tree  now bring your awareness to your body to the rise and fall of your chest breathing in harmony with a life around you  breathe deep and strong into your chest and down to your belly down your thighs down their legs that are routed to the firmness of what is supporting you down to the earth below and beneath you and down and down  let your body be slow and still and as you breathe you may imagine strong living roots that grow from the base of your spine on the soles of your feet down to the rich dark soil down through Stone reaching deeper deeper into the Earth with each breath  these roots anchor you  they are studying they are patient as you can be steady and patient  Route 8 and strong  Justice you
