[Music] welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to another episode of back on the broomstick I'm Ila and I'm shell what are we talking about today Ila crystals well I had a little trouble with this uh try it shell why well I started out very very cranky and it got better but I definitely started out cranky cranky at doing the tri it or just cranky in general when it was time to do the tri it I got ready to do the try it and realized that all my crystals are gone like most of my crystals are just gone when we moved they were in a box from my office that had tons of crystals including and this breaks my heart an old craft box that I had gotten when I was a little witchling and had written out every single you know those boxes that are divided with little sares in them yeah I had written out what different crystals meant and like taped it to the inside of those squares and it was full of all my crystals from when I was a witchling back in the80s and a bunch of my old books were in there my daughter's VR headset was on the top of the box that's the box and that's the Box we can't find so it either got disappeared when we hired people to help us when we broke down or somehow it disappeared on its own I don't know but we can't find it so anyways I was very cranky being reminded of that and reminded that that's where all my crystals were and I couldn't do a big beautiful crystal grid meditation whereas on the flip side I had a much more pleasant experience because I am doing that end of the summer gut your bedroom clean everything out dust touch everything kind of clean and I actually had ripped out all of my crystals all my altar stuff everything actually and cleaned and dusted and and just did good stuff to it all and then as I was putting my room back together and putting some of my stuff away I was like oh yeah I got to do this crystal grid so I actually was able to do it knowing where everything was everything was all great and shiny and sparkly but to that end I still would like to recharge them under the moon but you know here we are at least they were dusted so our topic today is crystal grid meditations so obviously sh was very well prepared for her meditation today and I had a little bit of trouble but despite all of that today's topic encompasses some of my absolute favorite things sacred geometry magical math crystals meditation and for all of our listeners these are all the things that shell tries to avoid in life cryst meditations no the crystal part you got down I love crystals but once you start talking the MW forget about it yeah so actually I was kind of surprised when we picked this topic to be our try it that I hadn't actually tried it yet at least not in this particular form I think that we have both have an interesting perspective here which our listeners will see on Instagram because we're going to post pictures I use a wooden cutout grid template I don't know maybe a grid template isn't the right word for it I'm sure you have a word for it well sacred geometry is what that grid template is showing a picture of the particular one that shell is holding up right now happens to have the name called Metatron cube a lot of these geometric shapes have different names the particular one I wanted to use today was called The Flower of Life there's also the Tree of Life the seed of life The Germ of life and some have different names like vector equilibrium or meraba there's a lot of different secret geometry shapes out there that you can find but you can also find your own or make your own there are hundreds of shapes that are used uh some are more common than others they've been called quote perfect figures and often referred to as the architecture of the universe and you can see these things in the natural world and they're very satisfying our brains love them and they're all kind of based on fee or the Fibonacci sequence the golden ratio so that's where we get into the magical math but you don't need to know any of that to be able to do a crystal grid meditation thank God because I don't know any of that so shell has picked out a beautiful geometric figure on a wooden plaque what' you do with it I'm all into to manifesting abundance in my life right now so I got some what I like to be abundant Stones Different Strokes for different folks maybe you use one thing I use another but I did put my uh pyite right in the center good stone for abundance yep and I used um a few not all obviously but I did use multiple green stones cuz well green money so I just I just kind of did my own thing with it you know I I don't know the math the rhyme or the reason I just I just laid it out with intention and kind of focused on it you know and that's exactly what you're supposed to do in a crystal grid meditation if you know the math if you know the high magic sure that's great but it's definitely not necessary this is more what I would classify as chaos magic we'll get into that later but all you need to know is that if you take a geometric shape it can be anything you can draw a circle you can draw a square you can draw a grid you can find them online or make your own and all you do is you take your crystals and then align them like shell said she picked a Center Stone that aligned with her intent and that's really what you want to do you'd like to pick one that's going to send this energy whatever your purpose your intent is out to the universe out to the Natural World out to the deities out to wherever this manifestation is going to come from you need a stone to point the direction and that's why I thought with my whole you know wanting to create abundance that maybe pyite was the way to start yep so pick your Center Stone matches your intention perfect now my question is is I've seen your picture um I haven't posted it yet on Instagram but I've seen your photo you don't use a wooden grid like I do you just like did this on the Fly what's up with that well that kind of gets into a little bit with I was cranky when I started this I had a grid picked out it's called the happiness Grid in sacred geometry it's basically circles same size circles and you put them together touching inside a bigger Circle anyways it ends up looking like a flower and it it's beautiful because it's made with all circles but it has straight lines in it so you get both that circular soft receptive energy as well as the strong dynamic Straight Energy you get both you get a balance in it I had planned on using that and I had brought that grid out with me just printed out on a piece of paper because again this isn't something I've done before in this type of form but then I remembered I didn't have the crystals in order to do it the way that I wanted to and I got really mad to be honest I got reallyy I was I I was and here I'm all getting ready to go into this meditative space I'm super excited because again Favorite Things s geometry math crystals meditation yeah I was stoked crystals are gone disappeared GRE legs walked off however they're gone they're gone and so I was kind of in a funk for a little while and then I went over to this space where I have put out the alter stuff that I do still have and I I have crystals there I have a small handful of crystals I have an amethyst point that I've had forever I have some other beautiful small crystals that were given to me or that I had gotten in different rituals and I'm like you know what these aren't exactly what I wanted they aren't the quote unquote right kind of crystals so I'm going to do it my way none of them matched none of none of them were what I had read online or in books or I I spoke to a gentleman Ed the Pagan who's part of pagan TV he actually does a large crystal grid around the whole world we'll get into that at a different time but I asked him for some pointers and he basically said it was no problem there are no set types of crystals or kinds of crystals raw points polish Stones there's no rules you have to follow regarding the kinds of crystals that you put in your grid so armed with that extra bit of knowledge I decided to just go for it my crystals didn't look like I thought they were supposed to and so when I went outside to this Stone table I have in my backyard I again was still mad and wasn't sure what I was going to do and then I just noticed how beautiful the table looked and the the seed pods and the little flowers that were on it and my crystals looked gorgeous on this table and right there was a cicada skin and then I knew I just had to do more of Elven chess I guess than and what Elvin chess is you just take Natural things that you find and you place them in beautiful format on on a stump or a table or whatever so my crystal grid took on more of a free form natural flowing occurring shape and I very much got into a meditative flow as I was doing it well I'm glad it worked out and you got out of your crankiness I did and it worked out beautifully so tell me more about your shape about your crystal grid now I kind of because I have the the wooden geometrical pre-made thing here um I just kind of went with the points I have six circles uh on the outside and then a bunch of of of pointy lines that come together on the insides and I just kind of put Crystals at the different points I also have a second grid that's much smaller actually um this is like a 4 in one this actually has like moon phases on it that's gorgeous the center looks like a honeycomb or almost like a sunflower seed it does it looks like a sunflower with the moon phases around it I think and when I've used that one I actually do it in between the moon phases on the points because I don't know the witch in me doesn't want to cover up the moons I love that probably just a me thing who knows so I put it on the points in between the moons um and then you know like you said you're going to have whatever your focus stone is in the center and as far as these patterns go I just have to just in a side shell what the hell I like sacred math I like sacred geometry and I have none of those things and have never done I'm the one with the wooden grids you're the freaking kitchen witch and you have the grids and I've done this before how does this work got to be it's got to be a living in Salem thing I don't know it must be but I love it but shell is absolutely correct there is no wrong way to put your crystals on these grids you are literally supposed to work with your intention your feelings the way it feels right to you and as Lila pointed out there's no wrong crystals or Elven chest pieces to use use what works and and yes if your intention is there that's really all that matters absolutely and and the the meditation part comes in when you lay these crystals down you can almost feel them click into place when you lay it along a line or like shell said on a point or on a star in a circle or in a space it starts to fit nicely and a lot of times like you'll see in the picture of my Elven chess crystal grid it's very symmetrical even as it's chaotic and and it feels right and it feels good as you align these things down in the patterns and you'll know you're doing it right because it does feel right and anyone who's worked with crystals before knows that they definitely have a a weight a feeling an energy to them that especially when you're putting them where they want to be you can kind of you get a reciprocal feeling with that so did you feel any of that shell as you were putting the crystals down well I was kind of my intent was more of a like I said kind of a doing an abundance uh manifestation so I guess I will have to let you know well one of the first things that I learned when doing any type of work with crystals is you want to get them on your side you want to talk like fairies like fairies and you want to align them with what you're doing so I took all these crystals that I had from again various gifts rituals different things and I I held them with me and I spoke to them I literally breathed on them and breathed with them for a little bit while I thought about my intentions and then I told them what I was about to do literally held the crystals in my hands and I told them now we're going to we're going to try this crystal grid meditation never done one before but this is going to be my intention and my intention was to find groundedness and connection and Clarity really and I think it worked it was really nice but yeah so you speak to your crystals tell them what the intention is before you set up your grid and then get into your magical space like you normally would um did you do this as a full ritual shell or or did you just kind of sit down and I didn't do it as a full ritual um I kind of did it more as a just kind of sit down think about my intention I have a plethora of stones to choose from and it it I think a lot of my intention literally was more picking the stones more so than laying them out probably not the way that was supposed to go but I I I put probably a little more intention into what Stones I was picking to lay out and the little OCD side in me I had to put all the green ones down first then I started with a couple of clear quartz crystals I had I put I I had to do things in like a color code that made sense to me but that's a me thing I found that I did the same thing as I was sitting at my stone alter in the backyard I oriented myself more because there's a couple grooves in the table so I oriented myself to kind of make those grooves flow with the energy of the stones I was laying down and I realized as I was was putting them down that I was facing north and I put all my green stones in the north all my yellow and white stones you know and so I had placed them subconsciously I'm sure maybe a little consciously I'm but in the correct quarters so the stones that corresponded to the correct quarters went there and when I found that cicada skin the shed cicada skin that went in the South uh in the box of stones was a the Box itself was a gift from an old friend a very dear friend who is passed on Patricia canel Morrison that shell and I got the great pleasure to meet a few years ago and to host for a while the traveler man um at least they're together but one of the things she gave me while she was here was a um I don't know what it's made out of a small silver tadpole isn't it like peor or something yeah I think it's a small peor tadpole and and that was in with some of the crystals that I had again they were gifts so I put that in the West and I had uh when we broke down in New Mexico I had bought a turquoise bear a little bear charm and so he went in the north and in the East I had a monarch butterfly that when we first moved to the house I had found dead in the driveway and I I kept in My indoor plants so that went in the East so I had a little bit of everything there again it was more Elven chess than Crystal meditation but it was what I needed I didn't have a mathematical Grid in front of me and I was upset and angry and so connecting to the earth I think along with those crystals and the Very Act of placing them was so meditative to me just putting everything together and making it look beautiful and pleasing and feel right to my soul completely calmed me down and grounded me and brought me back to the fact that I know those crystals and those books and those things were things I'd had for a long time but they're just things and it's okay I'm I'm here now I have these things and I can still make it pretty and beautiful and work even though I didn't have the geometric grid that I had printed out and planned on using now this has nothing to do with what we're talking about at all but I need to point this out to our listeners which you'll see on Instagram so you and I hundreds of miles apart here we're not doing these Triads together you're doing it at your home I'm doing at my home did you notice that a we both ended up using What They Call Aura crystals and B we both picked the green Ora Crystal did you notice that in our photos you got to show me so not only did I not know I still haven't seen it yet and it's funny because I put mine in the absolute North and you put yours in the north but a little to the side so I just think it's funny that we both picked green Ora crystals that Crystal is one that my husband got at brush wood if you'll notice it has a corresponding Point you're talking about the one that's in the north um West quadrant and then I have another in the Southeast quadrant yeah they were at one time one long cylinder really oh see it looks it looks like one of those green aura Stones it does no this is a it's a fluorite it's a green and purple fluorite he carried that for a whole summer and Infused that with Brushwood drumming and Fire magic and hate when stones break yeah it just cut cleanly in that one point so it still feels magical it still has that energy and when I set it there the the cut ends it kind of rolled on the table and the cut ends aligned so almost like magnetic how cool if you look in the picture if you slide them straight they would fit perfectly together it was very cool well we'll have to get Leila some some stones and load her back up I'm not worried about it it'll come it's okay and uh I do worry a little bit about whoever took that box well yeah that's you know that's a Karma thing as a witch's box that not the one you want to be stealing can't help you with that no do you think this is something that you're gonna want to do again or something that you would do regularly yes and yes um I would I would do it both the Elven chess way that I did it here and also the traditional using a grid because I I do like that but I just for me personally doing a grid I want more points than I do round polished crystals I would like points better you made crystals or the grid itself crystals I'd rather have Crystal points like unpolished points as opposed to when making a grid no but for me it would feel better when I placed them I would like that better whereas I feel like in a in an Elven chest it's a little a little more free form a little less rules I don't know I guess that's a rule a self rule I've imposed on myself and that's really the only rules that that there really are with all of this self-imposed now to be honest when you first said crystal grid meditation I jumped back to when you and I would do stonings we would do stoning meditations right different thing yes now I don't mean stoning as in cannabis stoned but what I do mean is we would do a crystal countdown Alpha State type meditation or a chakra meditation and we would Place stones that corresponded to the chakra points all along our body on our actual body sometimes along the Meridian points sometimes at different points on the body you know I believed we did a um a fertility meditation on someone and had the stones around their womb on their lower belly uh we've done heart clearing you can use stones on your body it was basically our body was the grid that's yes yes think of your body as the grid and put the stones there and we did those or Stones around your body in a same chakra cleansing you can do the same thing um to to cleanse your chakras and for that I actually use the corresponding chakra Stones yes abs and you can buy kits of that or you can use your intuition to find stones that work for you so this is something that we have done in different forms for a long time I I just I'm I'm surprised I never stumbled across the crystals on sacred geometry I have seen people put crystals in patterns before and to make almost Mandela type patterns with you see that a lot of festivals and such yeah yeah and and it's beautiful and you can feel the energy and and it they make wonderful meditations both the creation of it and the sitting and looking at it so for me I like the creation of it a lot that for me is very very meditative and then sitting with it feeling that vibrational energy is also very nice um I'm not one to leave crystals out like this like um after a little while I just bundled them up and put them away oh absolutely same thing I mean I got two cats here people we can't be leaving this stuff out for an afternoon the cats would be like playing like pinball with it but you can you can set them up permanently you can set them up temporarily you can leave them for any length of time you like whatever works for you what I had thought about um actually is I know that that by the time this episode airs it will probably be the blue moon or the day after but I was thinking of resetting up my grid outside um under the Blue Moon later this week oh I like that you know just to go on a slight tangent I think I'm going to try to make some Florida water under the the blue moon this week so nice yeah so that's basically just taking some vodka and putting in some different flowers and a few different oils putting that out under the moon to charge and you know have myself some good Florida water so we'll see if that works I am actually this weekend um up here in the in the Northeast I'm looking to make some hurricane water get some storm water going on o the Blue Moon is a wonderful time to do all sorts of different charging I mean the energies of this are just going to be so much fun I love doing Crystal cleanses on a blue moon I don't know it seems right weird I don't know but I personally think that that's a great time to just kind of clear and recharge and reboot all of your crystals and actually any of your magical tools for that matter um on a blue moon yep I have a Tarot deck that I just recently received it second hand and so part of my cleansing the last part of my cleansing of this deck is going to be having it out under the Blue Moon so that's something else that you can do which I've also done with crystals um cover the deck with crystals on top and charge it that way I've done that as well oh that's really nice too that's actually a good point something that you want to charge put it outside under the Blue Moon and put crystals on top of it to amplify that energy in certain directions on your absolutely absolutely and yeah a crystal grid like if you're using a geometric grid with crystals on it and you're going to put that under the Blue Moon how fun will that be that's G to be some that's GNA be some energy amplification right there that's like a whole different Tri It episode I think so how about you shell I mean obviously you have those boards you've done this typee of meditation in the past even though you might not what do you call it if not a meditation my crystal grid why do you have to call everything a meditation Lea why does everything have to be called a meditation man it's a good point very good point I don't know I think I'm obsessed but so when you do your crystal grid not meditation do you have a preference for one or the other of those grids do you think you'll get different types of um it you know honestly it kind of depends on what I'm doing it for because as you can see uh the one I used uh for for this particular Tri it was a 6 inch um these are not big grids by the way this is a 6inch grid and then the other one that has all the moon phases in it is actually only a 4 in Grid you know how you can get those like um Stone chips the crystal chips if I'm going to use the the smaller one with the moon phases on it I generally use chips on that got just because it's a smaller board whereas this one because it's a little bigger I'll just put any old big old fatty on there um but the smaller one I feel is more for like the chips gotcha and that's another good point is it doesn't have to be big huge crystals I've seen pictures all over you know witch's social media with the gigantic crystal quartz in the center of their grid doesn't have to be like that like shelle said you can use the chips get yourself a bag of chips you don't need you don't need to use the big huge crystals right right it's about your intention not your tool yep and now Ed the Pagan who works very often with Crystal grids and often talks about a crystal grid that he has set up again spanning continents he says that he likes to um after setting the Center Crystal he likes to set several crystals with their points pointing outward to project the energy and some with the tips pointing inward to draw in energy that he'd like and he uses the Center Stone as the projector and that makes like a local field of magic and then you can work with or meditate with that energy so you could do a bigger one where you bury these Crystal points around your house like we've talked about doing protections for a home or blessings for a home you could bury crystals around your home to do a crystal grid right where you live you can do one for you can do one for love we don't like to promote love spells and love magic but you can do a grid for it you absolutely could especially a grid for self-love and the geometric pattern you pick that can also have an effect on the type of spell or the work that you're doing so it could be a meditation it could be a spell it could be a ritual it could be something you leave permanently there's a lot of different uses for this type of meditation whether you call it that or not I definitely think this was a really good try it I think this was definitely something that I'm going to use my grid again because we're not calling it a meditation and I think this is one that that our listeners should give it a go it's easy it's fun little artsy but this this was a good one yeah I very much enjoyed it myself and I I do think that um the balance of it really appeals to my brain the beauty of using crystals and being able to feel that energy it's very satisfying it's very soothing so I highly recommend that our listeners try it and I'm glad I did I just love you coin to the phrase Elven chess no that's not a me thing I think I first read that in a green egg magazine Oberon zelle great guy by the way but Oberon zelle and friends I believe coined that in an old green egg magazine long long time ago so well I'm gonna take my crystal grid and I'm gonna get it ready to be taken out in front of that blue moon here in a few days all right and I'm still laughing my ass off over you in the geometric forms and me doing Elvin chess in my backyard I think isn't that how we roll yes all right thank you guys
