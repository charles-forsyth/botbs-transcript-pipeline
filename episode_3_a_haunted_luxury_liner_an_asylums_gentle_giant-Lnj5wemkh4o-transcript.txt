tell truish Tales of restless Souls ghoulish crimes and the dangers of bad Cuisine excuse me cough get off one am I not coughing good gracious smoke another one that'll fix it always does it really does what are you smoking today anything good I'm still smoking the same homegrown [ __ ] one of the things I love about growing my own is we have this um Kei box that we put we just put pot in you know it has a screen in the bottom and then you open the bottom and there's a a tray like a plate collects all the KE that falls through so sometimes my lovely husband will pack me bongs and then pack the top of it with just like a ton of covered over yeah covered over it's so nice and then it has a a dab of a dab in the middle so it's very pretty he's he gets very artistic with his bowls it's impressive yeah right now it's either Bruce Banner or uh blueberry Jack hair or if we have decided to do a little delivery this is I got to flip it around it's bubble cush bubble cush it's empty because we smoked it all I actually I actually got the stuff for Christmas it's like purple purple something you got pot for Christmas I did all I remember about the name is it's purple I don't know it's good I'm high that's all that matters hey that's all that counts right now and to to be honest I I have to say sh I am smoking more than I usually do why stress man not to be the downer of Downers but I don't see this year being any more productive than the last two really wanted to ring in 2022 and be very hopeful well I did that the last couple years and it hasn't worked so I figure I'll be pessimistic this year and maybe that'll change things reverse psychology there you go we'll scare the year or something I didn't get any pot for Christmas lucky girl nobody loves you I'm teas I did get wax for New Year's so we did get yeah it was pretty good we got that Bubba Kush and runs the other one was runs nice little sace I took some Christmas money I got and I made a purchase the Disney villains tarot o that's awesome I want a villains Tarot deck that's amazing I bet it's gorgeous very cool very cool like they they dug deep for some of these villains and it's super cool nice I love that it's awesome I love it we're going to have to do an episode where you go through your tarot decks and I just drool and fawn over them I probably you know I'm probably like getting to the point where I could probably contact Guinness and be like hey as far as personal collections go what do we looking at well I happened to notice last night that um The Golden Girls tarot almost tripled in price oh I bet I bet I heard a thing and I kind of I choose to believe it basically said Betty White sacrificed herself she took 2021 down by the throat and threw them into the fires of Mordor together so that we could have better 2022 she was like who's that Christian guy St Michael or something oh did he slay demons or something yeah he like killed the devil man oh right he did that in The Exorcist yeah so Betty White is like that St Michael guy a or you know she's like Gollum yeah either way she's a hero SL demons remember when you used to have that Steamroller that we'd smoke out of is that the one I called token Jr token yes yes yes that that thing's probably been long broken it has sadly for such a shittily made pipe it was beautiful it was such thin glass but it was absolutely gorgeous pretty pretty pipe I miss it yeah well it looked like a big Gandalf pipe it was it was like different shades of blue and white and it kind of curled and came down it had like a big fat bottom on it it was just really neat looking Jr token I remember that that was a good one it was a good one you seem to always kind of keep up with the we'll call it latest smoking technology only since moving here and yeah I do love where I kind of still stick to my little pipe and I still like Mass packet you have only lived in a legal state for less than a year now um like 18 months okay so you've been in in a legal okay so you have no excuse just you're just an old school Stoner I I I'm just an old school Stoner who just likes my pipe and I just jam it full with a big fat bud and you know when it comes down to it I am a flower girl all the way give me a bong or a pipe and some flour and I mean I grow my own for that very reason I like to have jars and jars of flour I have progressed we gota we got to give credit because I have progressed because if you recall what was it maybe 20 years or so ago I was like oh we can smoke just pack it off don't do that anymore so I'm making steps in the right direction yeah we are long past the days when you would call me a pot snob simply because I wouldn't smoke stems and seeds yeah well I I've I've upgraded I've matured to the fact where I no longer smoke stems and seeds anymore but when I was like 20 25 years old pack it all in man light that [ __ ] up well we've smoked so much crap I think we've done we've paid our dues it's time to smoke the good flour you know that's why that's why I started growing was I was so tired of what we were getting in New York was you know that crappy brick weed and dirt weed like you said it had actual dirt in it and you know that's all well and good but I I like the good stuff now and I think being here in California with access to so many different things and honestly there was a time just last year in the beginning of this year where I had such bad fibroid pain that if I didn't have dabs and CBD dabs I don't think I would have gotten through it I mean it really helped it nothing else I was taking so much ibuprofen it was making me sick and being able to dab High concentrate th C along with some high CBD really took the pain down to a manageable level when I was hurting myself with what the hospital was telling me to take so yeah but recreationally too above and beyond medical reasons it's awesome I I like all the different opportun all the different things available yeah and you don't have to like call a friend who calls a friend who calls a friend and wait six hours you know you just get in the car you go to the store you're done order online done better yet I text my guy and he shows up at my door between a half an hour and two hours later and I love it love it you should have seen me the first few times I was able to go to like the actual store and buy it I'd come out and I'd be like I used my debit card and I have a receipt I have a receipt for weed oh my God the first few times I went in it I couldn't help it I I probably look like a little kid going to like the fair for the first time and then when I found I could get it delivered to my house how awesome is that they're starting to work on that here delivery I think New York is talking about having that as well and and honestly for patients who need it it's excellent and for people who are lazy like me it's awesome I would give a shout out I gotta ask them be like hey I will shout you out if you give me some pre-rolls man just just a couple just just a couple I'm just glad you guys aren't all using like blowtorches is we don't have any dab stuff right now we just have that little blowtorch anyway delivery guy didn't come no we just haven't gotten any you guys are coming out right you coming out you coming out you coming out unless we're all like on [ __ ] lockdown again right I forget what my [ __ ] point was my husband's plying me with weed and now I forgot just just smoke that bong and it'll all work out smoke another one I'm going to smoke this absolutely gorgeous looking bowl that my sweetheart just passed me because I know you're going to tell me a true story about an asylum some place that I know well Upstate New York which is why you should go there you know next time I come out to New York you should come out too and we should go visit a couple of these places together because there's a bunch of them in that area not too far we could spend a week and we could go Airbnb hopping from haunted place to haunted place would be awesome all right well it's a date for next year so we're going to talk about the Rolling Hills Asylum in Bethany New York it it's it's a interesting place kind of nestled in rural Western New York if you're familiar with New York it's between like the Rochester Buffalo area um and ironically enough it's near Attica a different podcast that's for another time right right but when I looked it up um on the map actually I want to say Rolling Hills is only about maybe a 20 minute drive from Attica so it's actually right like kind of in that neighborhood so it's already nearby some interesting energy now before becoming infamously known is the Rolling Hills Asylum a lot of these places were called poor houses or institutions it was already documented to be a hot bed of Paranormal Activity this place was apparently kind of paranormally before it was considered Rolling Hills a stylum this was actually like I said it was a the the county Tor farm and they affectionately referred to it as the old country home how do you affectionately refer to an asylum like who does that that's ridiculous the old country home they're like oh yeah we sent crazy Uncle Joe to the old country home is that like sending your dog to the farm upstate well it's better than saying I sent Uncle Joe to The Rolling Hills Asylum I guess I suppose if you need a euphemism it's the better way to say it around the Thanksgiving table yeah definitely definitely so you know the poor houses you know they housed orphan children um the destitute elderly physically handicap mentally unstable morally corrupt really because that would be like all of New York State oh I'm sure their definition of morally corrupt probably fluctuated with what worked best for them and their mistress right and and they were situated in land you know part of the draw to Western New York was it was very farmy back then still is kind of farmy to be honest with you so they had Farms there which able-body residents were required to work so you know they had oh so they were keeping slave labor Alive by putting quote unquote undesirables into the Reformatory correct so if you were an orphan or you were if you were mentally unstable or morally corrupt you had to work for your for your pay and you know back then they were they were relying on this this was like a self-sufficient Poor House you know they would slaughter their own own animals for meat they'd grow their own vegetables they would have cows to milk for dairy this was a totally self-sufficient City within a city but yeah like kind of slave labor is yeah it kind of sounds like it I mean it it it sounds like they very much took advantage of these people especially because I mean morally corrupt I mean really that covers so much ground they they actually put an an article in the newspaper in 1828 listen to how nuts this is so they put an article in the newspaper and they're like hey you know they would they would assist what they called the poppers of the county so poor people poppers you know who yeah and they would give them you know food clothing shelter and and things of that nature but when they put this article in the newspaper they said the following were eligible for assistance you're G to love this list habitual drunkards lunatics one who by disease grief or accident lost the reason or from old age sickness or weakness that was so weak of mind to be incapable of managing or govering their own Affairs so you could be sad and be sent there too sad yeah yeah if you had no income if you are blind lame old or disabled or a vagrant you could be like hey I can't stand my mother-in-law let's put her in the popper house yeah old just a imagine the the types of people that were all thrown into this not that I want to put my mother-in-law in the in the in the poer house I just want to put that out there right now hi Leslie I love you the PO house it was definitely for folks that were criminally minded and if they couldn't keep you in jail you'd go to one of these types of places so just imagine um the type of of people going through the doors here all types of people it sounds like you know anyone from poor people crazy people to people who had too much grief people who had who went lame or went blind or got a little too old but they were able because they were able to to have this you know self-sufficient working farm in woods because it was about 200 Acres I mean we're talking a big chunk of property yes and they loved the whole work will you know make you better have a good work ethic and you'll get healthy they were able to knock it down by making everybody work for everything it only costs the state a dollar a week per resident that's whole dollar a dollar a week per resident y because they were able to work them and here's the worst part the residents were referred to as inmates so they really were trapped no matter why they were housed there they were considered and and they were referred to as inmates people's rights away I mean they completely stri those people of all their rights and of all autonomy basically the minute you walk through the doors you were signing your life away and you pretty much it took an Act of God to get out once you were in you were kind of in we'd be in so much troubl shell the amount of weed we smoke they be like oh yeah they're deranged let's put them in the institution here's where the sadness kind of starts and this is probably where some of these hauntings kind of settle into this place now now you can imagine obviously with orphans and some elderly folks and you know in the times you know people didn't live long back then there were people that were at this place that had no family so the county would bury the people who had no family there are records that indicate that there was a cemetery located on the property and there was at least over 2,000 documented burials guess what cemetery poof gone documentation poof gone so instead of looking for the cemetery they just built over it wait you're telling me that there was a thousanders cemetery that they deemed so unimportant that the paperwork just poofed away along with any evidence of the cemetery so that they could build over it is this like what's that movie what was that movie with the little girl and and they're here Poltergeist this Poltergeist so they like took away the headstones and built over it it didn't end well in Poltergeist I imagine it didn't end well here so you know as the as the the stones from the gra you know the graveston started crumpling away and the grass grew over it and they're like oh they're just poppers and crazy people and sad old ladies we're just gonna like build over it who cares but the horrible thing is you know what you know what one of the the government officials were quoted as saying in like 1872 he said no one is around to care for those and they've been long forgotten oh that is so sad so actually there is a movement going on it's been going on for the last 10 or 15 years there are folks that are trying to use what's that ground sonar equipment to actually try to find the cemetery um and map it out because you know everybody deserves to be remembered they do I wonder if that would put some of the Restless ghosts I mean to rest some of these spirits that are wandering the halls I wonder if it would if it would put some of those poor souls to rest well in 2004 the the Gennesse County uh Parks and Recreations did end up putting up a little fenced area with five headstones five headstones I'd be angry and pissed off if I was forgotten like that too and what are the odds that they're going to find the records of these I mean that's that's a thousand people that they tried to destroy the records of it's going to be painstaking probably no wonder there's so many Restless Souls wandering those Halls these people some of these people were buried between 1827 and 1888 we're talking a hundred years too late so you got to figure some of these ghosts are just sad and pissed off according to the current genese County historian um the actual Cemetery register and the plot map is yet to be discovered so you have all of these all of these Spirits you know women children uh men elderly disabled mentally insane no you know drunks these people were treated like [ __ ] and then they were just dumped and forgotten that's got to be unnerving for anybody how many ghosts are rumored to be there I have actually found believe it or not I have found hundreds of stories now there was a story about a man named Frank Frank didn't apparently have a last name uh not a lot of people had last names I'm finding at this place it was like prison you know this guy Frank he went in there as a habitual drunk they kind of used it as like a sober house but you know like I said consider inmates once you're there you don't leave Frank sobered up got his wits about him and kind of over time realized hey I'm so but yet I'm still here Frank tried to leave and he was actually chained to a bed he was chained to this bed for three weeks until he basically knew he couldn't leave did they let him out to go to the bathroom he was chained to a bed for three weeks ew that's so gross I need more pop for this he actually jumped out a window and killed himself so about a window when you're chained to a bed I after they let him go he was only chained to the bed for for three weeks oh okay so after three weeks they're like hey you don't have once he learned once he learned his lesson he needed to get out into the fields and earn his keep you know so that was like punishment change to a bed in like your own piss and [ __ ] for three weeks and then they're like hey now go work in the fields [ __ ] yeah and so he was like [ __ ] this man and he killed himself so you've got people who had me had medical experiments done on them you have people who Maybe went in there for a mild issue or were fine to begin with and the place drove them nuts a lot of suicides there a lot of people died from during medical experiments there were a lot of elderly if food was low in the winter time you got fed by age so there were elderly that just died of starvation I would imagine those are the folks that are Haun in those Halls the ones that died of starvation the ones that committed suicide the ones that died from the medical experiments the those are the people I believe are haunting the halls of the Rolling Hills Asylum I believe it well I've got a nice fat pre-roll here so go ahead and tell me a scary story okay so one of the tragic stories and this one kind of stuck with me was uh involved a we'll call him an inmate um named Roy and Roy suffered from giantism it but you know I I guess they consider giantism a physical deformity so the Giant from The Princess Bride like Andre the Giant yes um he had giantism as well so so just picture Andre the Giant you know some of those protruding facial features large hands and feet the guy was like over seven feet tall and you got to remember back in the early 1800s for someone to be almost seven feet tall like that was nuts now you know every basketball player on the planet's seven feet tall but back then it wasn't you know it wasn't a thing Roy was the son of a prominent Banker but his physical appearance was an embarrassment to his family so this poor child is born with giantism and because he's from a rich influential family they were embarrassed so at age 12 age 12 this poor little boy was just dropped off at the at the Rolling Hills Asylum and he was left there until he died when he was 62 why are families so cruel that is the meanest thing they how horrible is that that poor little boy because they were an influential family with a lot of money and they had an image to keep up with and he didn't fit that image so he had to go away that man was there from 12 to 62 he was there 50 years and he loved opera music and was generally they said a nice guy he's there he's still there there are a lot of people who have seen his shadow and they know it's him because they say it's like this large hulking shadow that that kind of would that be yeah who kind of lurks through the building but there was a story that there was a a group there of people I don't know if it was like an organized paranormal investigation but there were a group of people there investigating they happened to be kind of people on the more wealthy side and actually Roy went after him and it and it seemed like he didn't like people with money he like influential people wait what do you mean he went after them sh he would touch them um one lady said she felt like there were hands around her throat Str ghosts don't touch people the there was actually Witnesses who said they saw black Shadows around her throat he is an angry angry ghost and he's attacking people like wealthy people he he attacks people who are considered influential wealthy prominent it's almost like he's a friend of the poor hates the rich because obviously there's been lots of people who've done investigations in this place and they've never had a problem but people who seem to be of a higher wealth status get physically attacked by this ghost so he's the Asylum Robinhood is that what you're telling me apparently basically he is so hurt that he got dumped because he was an embarrassment that it is ingrained in his soul and it is ingrained in the walls of that Asylum rich people are bad rich people are hurtful you're never good enough for rich people they need to go wow he should also be against you know shitty parents that care more for their image than they do for their children but you know that kind of freaked me out because like you said ghosts don't usually touch people yeah that's like breaking a rule I think as soon as ghosts start touching you that's it I'm done get the [ __ ] out run sign you should not stay there once they start carving things on you or touching you no I'm done I'm out that's it but the reason the reason they kind of pin that on Roy is because like I said when when the girl thought that there were hands around her throat the people that were with her saw this big imposing Shadow and saw the shadow wrapped around her throat how creepy what would you do if you saw this big shadow of a human walk up to me and wrap itself around my throat wouldn't you [ __ ] yourself I would absolutely lose my mind and wonder what it was you had slipped into my bowl but a shadow around her throat why yeah that's no yeah no that's too much and I mean obviously you know there's there's stories of you know you go into the medical room and you hear screams sometimes actually this Roy guy when it's kind of peaceful there and I say peaceful the place is abandoned when all the ghosts are in a peaceful mood I don't know if you remember I said Ro liked opera music people have heard actually heard opera music echoing down the Halls has anyone ever tried playing opera music for him being in there with opera music playing not that I've ever uh that I've come across but I I would think somebody would have done that to try to draw him out wouldn't you try to do that to draw him out yeah I try to do that to make him happy I mean nobody wants a ghost scarf around their neck let me ask you this have you ever been a fan of American Horror Story the T show I'm passingly familiar with it American Horror Story is like this this FX TV thing I've watched a few seasons of it they had a season with Lady Gaga I watched it season one they did uh about a murder house but season two of of American Horror Story was called Asylum and actually FX an American Horror Story filmed season 2 asylum at the Rolling Hills Asylum no way yeah and what they did and this is so creepy I wish I known about it at the time so when they were getting ready to start filming season two of American Horror Story asylum they actually had fans get committed quote unquote committed overnight to Rolling Hills and they actually did a five-part web series for YouTube I have got to check that out what happened to those fans that were there overnight did did they experience anything um actually they did and and they were a lot of them said that they would never go back they never wanted to go to anything like that again too freaked out but you can actually see some of that on YouTube I am absolutely gonna check that out I don't know if I would yeah I would definitely stay there I would want to see what would happen did they capture anything when they were taping there on the show did they say if they caught any you know orbs or anything unusual um as far as The Show Goes they just said that a lot of weird things happened on set didn't go into too much detail didn't really say much they just said that a lot of weird things happened on set just interesting you know another interesting fact but you know to talk about Roy again people say that Roy was kind of a a pure Soul a very kind soul and they they say that Roy is kind of like The Keeper of the Asylum like you know kind of keeps all of the other like ghosties in check like the gatekeeper he like everybody now this is actually privately owned Now by a lady named Sharon I don't know Sharon's name last name I probably shouldn't say it if I did but a lady named Sharon owns this property now I don't want to say keeps it the way it is for paranormal purposes but kind of keeps it the way it is for paranormal purposes like you go there and and like rent it out and do can you do like tours there yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah that's freaking cool I bet there's a lot of footage of people who have done paranormal tours there so you know this Sharon the current owner she had been walking through shortly after she had bought the property she had come across just you know random it was abandoned building a rat and the rat made her scream you know if I saw a rat I'd scream come on now kind of think they're kind of cute but not in an asylum yeah not in an asylum so she sees this rat she screams and runs away so you know how I said Roy was kind of The Keeper of the gate the very next day she went in and found the rat dead on the stairs with blood oozing from its mouth like its neck had been broken and above the rat was a giant bloody hand print that looked like a Giant's hand and she and Sharon the current owner believes that Roy saw the rat scare her and saw her get scared and run so he killed the rat for her no [ __ ] way he liked this lady so he killed the rat for her and left a giant ham oh my [ __ ] no no no no that is it like it was kind of like his way of saying don't worry Sharon I got you I guess if I have to you know anything I'd rather be on the rat killing side of Roy than on the throat choking side of Roy right right you know Roy is a big presence there even still um there's actually I found a lot of stories I mean not a lot of stories about Roy because a lot of them are kind of of the same sentiment but Roy when when if if you look up this Asylum Rolling Hills Asylum Roy is a prominent figure in a lot of these paranormal experiences people have had and the reason they know it's Roy is either you know a seven foot tall Shadow or a bloody handprint that's bigger than the average human's handprint so you know they can definitely kind of pin it on Roy but yeah you know he'll protect one person but then pissed off at the next so you got to hit Roy on a good day it's intriguing to me that a lot of these haunted places have multiple entities that are similar enough that people actually name them that they know who this entity is like everybody has experiences with this big hulking presence and so they know that that's Roy because it's such a similar experience that everyone kind of has across the board and well Roy is kind of the gatekeeper he's the protector and also he's got Sharon turns back so we know he doesn't like wealthy people or people of stature yeah but couldn't you see why I mean he got who can blame him I can't blame the guy I mean that poor kid 50 years in an insane asylum just because you looked a little bit bigger than everybody else when nowadays he could be a movie star or a WWE wrestler or both so you know it it's really sad and of course there's a lot of stories of of nurses there was a nurse Emmy and you know every one of these Asylum stories always always has a bad mean nurse involved and she's kind of like think of like the spiritual Nemesis of Roy so Roy's going around doing good Emmy not so much Emmy was actually known for being absolutely cruel so if he's if he's the Robin Hood of the Asylum she's the Sheriff of Nottingham of the Asylum yeah basically so they're like they're fighting each other they're like mortal enemies on the other world basically so you know she was described as a power hungry and unkind woman now here we go again I you know I feel like everything always goes back to either Satan or Ouija boards telling me this story goes back to Ouija board too sh I am sensing a pattern here well a little bit not necessarily a Ouija board but close she was feared by the inmates and the staff now you know you're a [ __ ] of a nurse if the staff is a fear afraid of you and of course as you can imagine she was even rumored to have performed Satanic rituals and black magic on the residence like I said everything either has to come back to to Satan or Ouija boards of course rumors are still circulating that nurse Emmy still walks the halls and visitors can hear her cackle like laugh I have a cackle likee laugh what's wrong with a cackle like laugh I know I'm feeling like maybe she was typ cast here she was the boss she had a cackle like laugh they said she was kind of a [ __ ] so yeah she was really not a nice lady did this nurse Emmy die on the property she did she was killed by a resident so she was kind of hacked to death for being a [ __ ] and she's still there roaming the halls and cracking the whip so that's I think why Roy is still there kind of keeping her in check I bet she probably scares the ghostly pants off of the other Spirits there well there's another woman there named Haiti and there's a room called hadi's room on the first floor of the East wing and you can often a lot of folks that go there say they can often hear her yelling hello down the hallway oh that would creep me out and the reason they think it is her is because she was a inmate there a patient whatever you want to call it and she was blind so she didn't know when people were around and when she was living there she used to yell hello all day and all night to get the attention of staff and nurses so even to this day you can hear Haiti yelling hello down the hallway trying to get someone's attention I'm pretty sure the first time I heard that i' be like goodbye and I would be gone yeah yeah you got my attention and I'm out I'm not staying to see what else she does now apparently the only one that's really kind of really mean is is the nurse unless you have money and then Ro an issue for you too does the nurse hurt people too like or does she just torture The Ghosts no she just tortures The Ghost and and is just kind of she try she she'd be the one that would try to scare you you know the worst part of this place this I probably wouldn't do this they have a basement Ru don't go in the basement that's rule number one don't go in the basement you this place has a basement and you don't go in the basement why would you ever that's where things happen all bad things happen in the basement well the basement of Rolling Hills is where the psych ward and solitary confinement were oh proof right there all bad things happen in the basement you know what's still there there's iron brackets protruding out of the cement walls which they believe were used to Shackle the unruly people to oh probably the people that are like you know um hi I've sobered up now and I kind of just want to go home and then like nope [ __ ] you Shackled in the basement and this is the sad thing people with Alzheimer's epilepsy tourettes Asbergers if you were unruly wife you were put in this place and if you were not Towing the line your ass was chained to a wall do you know back then if a man couldn't control his wife he'd say I'm going to lock you up and he probably meant it there was an additional basement room what do you think was in it guess what it was probably an embalming room a the morg oh I was right it is an embalming room gross um apparently there's still an embalming table and two large refrigerator is still there why would you leave that there it's probably full of creepy gross things because they probably abandoned it and then we're like [ __ ] it we're a taking this [ __ ] with us that stuff is probably haunted like some of that old stuff holds energies and [ __ ] like the walls like you said the walls are oppressive like I imagine the tables the refrigerator ew ew ew ew ew that probably holds Echoes of all the nasty oh no nope nope nope nope no I think I'm done now um I just wanted to add that you know there are a lot of theories about different ghosts and different hauntings there but I think that the key thing with with Rolling Hills is that a lot of these people went in there thinking they could get out and they thought you know maybe it was a poor person and they thought you know I can kind of get my life together and then get out and go relive my life or like some of these children they thought you know Mommy and Daddy died or as Roy the giant you know my parents abandoned me here I think a lot of these people thought when they hit that adult age okay I'm 18 I can leave now and go live my life and that wasn't the case these people didn't have the option you know the the ones that went in as children they didn't have the option to leave when they were 18 you know the people that went in as as habitual drinkers they didn't have the option to leave once they became sober these are the people that will never leave Rolling Hills Asylum kind of that attitude you're GNA force me to stay here and never let me leave okay I'm gonna stay here and I'm Never Gonna Leave I wonder if any of that led to why it became abandoned if there was enough of a bad energy there that it was making it so people were not getting healthy you know they they couldn't in type of environment well like you said you know it's like a sponge to negative energy you know so much sadness so much negativity so much pain so much hurt so much cruelty you can't scrub that out of things that's like imprinted in the soul of the land that's the [ __ ] that kind of stays there and lingers and and that people can feel even you know decades later walking into the place and then you know aside from the people that maybe thought they could leave never could or or thought that someone would come back for them and they never did you know maybe some of these wives thought my husband will be back and he never came back not only did they have to suffer that fate they were buried and forgotten and desecrated I mean The Souls of these people went through hell from birth to the spirit world from birth to death doesn't even Encompass it for some of these people some of these people were being tortured after death Yeah by that crazy head nurse lady well that crazy head nurse lady is still there but you know Roy is on it Roy is gonna keep everybody safe thank you I'm telling you if I can ever get you to go to this place with me the first thing we're going to do is we're g to walk in that place and we are going to praise Roy like it's our jab okay well as long as he doesn't think that pot snobs are worthy of getting strangled then I think we'll be okay I will learn how to sing opera music just to get that guy to have our backs in that place yeah I've got a phone like my Spotify playlist has Opera I'm sure I could find some and if I hear if I hear that old lady Haiti saying hello I'm just gonna yell hello back yeah that's probably all she wants is she just wants somebody to talk to really as with any place and especially in Asylum I think these people just want to be heard they want someone to recognize them to validate their life because they were not validated when they lived there you know they they probably just want someone to acknowledge what was done to them or maybe I'm just really really stoned and taking it a little to well what are you smoking tonight anyways so tonight I've kind of switched it up a little bit I've got this great stuff called White Wedding there's like wedding cake I've had wedding cake I love wedding cake there's wedding bomb I've come to learn if it says wedding it's good stuff nice good stuff it's a very relaxed high it's not not as brainy it's more melty melty is nice and you know I I I kind of like to switch it up sometimes I kind of like that Zoom brainy I'm gonna Focus I'm gonna get a lot of stuff done and other times I just want to melt that always sounds nice some sometimes you know you don't want to uh you want to just relax you just kind of chill out hear some spooky stories and just be you know what are you smoking tonight this evening I am smoking some blueberry Jack hair ooh I love both of those and together this is an Autoflower blueberry Jack hair I'm smoking Bowl after Bowl after bowl of it so I'm definitely doing good this evening let me ask you this does it have a tint of blueberry taste to it it does it has a very fruity Aroma it's got a really nice clean taste to it and the the flowers are a little bit they're darker I wouldn't say that it's purple but the stems are kind of like a dark reddish purple and some of the flower itself has like a dark real dark reddish purple tint to it but it's very sweet tasting it has a really smooth smoke I like it a lot it it's also kind of a I'd say it's a good mix it's a good mix of of an up high and kind of a melty High first of all I want to be one of these people who just sits in a room and smokes a bunch of weed and comes up with names because that would be the greatest job you know where do they come up with some of these names you know when I hear some of these names you know like grape d Diamond I'm like ooh and then I'm thinking to myself it's going to taste grapy no I feel like sometimes the only thing that is true to name are citruses like Super Lemon hay lemon OG like if it says lemon you're gonna have that lemony Citrus anything else they lie cotton candy cush don't taste like cotton candy people I mean how many times have you had a blueberry that tasted different from another blueberry or right constantly chasing Jack Herer for that perfect Jack Hera that we had that one time but you're right whether it's homegrown or store-bought it's almost like there's no consistency back exactly it's a crapshoot what you're gonna get I really don't think that there's any kind of consistency being had people are trying I mean I'm not trying to knock Growers grower a lot of the good ones are really trying very hard I think it'll just get better as time goes on well I still like to be one of those people who just sits in a room smokes a bunch of weed and starts naming stuff yeah that would be the job wouldn't it well we just sit in a room smoke a bunch of weed and tell scary stories what scary story do you have well actually this time I'm going to tell you another California story I'm GNA kind of keep it close to home this is a place that I really hope to take you guys to when you come and visit me so when you come and visit in a couple months we are going because it's really not that far away they actually have paranormal investigations on here and it is it's a ship that has been Time Magazine listed as one of the top 10 most haunted places on Earth the oh wow yeah can you believe oh you're pulling me in already there you go it's the RMS Queen Mary it's a ship that's permanently docked in Long Beach Now isn't that a British ship it was it was originally a luxury liner back in the late 30s early 40s it was a luxury liner that took people from New York to what is it so haunt is it so haunted that the queen don't want it back that's haunted you Americans keep it kind of well it has a history so it was a luxury liner for a while and it it carried people like Bob Hope Elizabeth Taylor Walt Disney Clark Gable the Duke and Duchess of Windsor I mean so like Rich celebrity kind of people it carried a lot of Rich celebrities it was considered wow yeah it was considered one of the the biggest luxury liners of its time the Disney Cruises of the 1930s kind of maybe that's where Disney got his got an idea or I don't know but he did Sail on it at one point she was uh faster and bigger than the Titanic which had sank decades before this even sailed but it was huge and beautiful but this ship not only had it been a luxury liner but then once World War II started it was stripped of everything and retrofitted to be a troop transport and this is where some of the the ghost stories begin it was actually called the gray ghost oh wow why why was it called it was called the gry ghost because it was again picture the Titanic and then picture of both that's even bigger but kind of looks similar similar to it with the Big Smoke Stacks and once it was stripped it was painted dull everything was painted gray so like a warship like exactly like a warship so gray so that it was harder to be seen and it was nicknamed the gray ghost which maybe that was you know foreshadowing of what would happen because right now there's reportedly 150 to as many as 600 known ghosts on this ship wow oh wow that's a lot one of the reasons that it might be so haunted is during World War II it was it was the sight of a huge huge tragedy a huge crash the Queen Mary was being escorted from New York state to Glasgow by a smaller ship the HMS Kura and the HMS Kura was doing like a zigzag pattern in front of the Queen Mary in order to confuse the enemy Gunners however they did not account for the fact that the Queen Mary was very fast for being such a large ship and in the middle of one of these zigzags she crashed right into the Kura and split her in two of the 430 people that were on the kuraka only 90 survived so they meant to kind of protect it and keep it shielded and it ended up just kind of running them over exactly they were trying the Kura was trying to guide the Queen Mary to Glasgow and instead they rammed into this ship and hundreds of of people died in the freezing Waters with sharks they say that the Queen Mary couldn't stop because of their orders and they had to call in to another ship that these people had gone overboard and in the meantime Rumor Has It that some of them were getting chopped up in the propeller of the Queen Mary as they plowed through that's horrible it was absolutely horrible and by hours later when the other ships were able to get there and they were only able to pull 99 people from the water they say that you can still hear the screams of those people as they died when you're in the bow of the ship that's horrible w wow is that kind of how those 99 Souls attach themselves to that particular because that was kind of what brought them to their demise that's what they think those n there were 99 people that lived there was almost let's see 430 minus 99 yeah there was 330 people is that died they do say that that if you're in the hole of the ship that you can hear grinding metal and the screams of of men but did they keep using the ship after that they did continue to use the ship it it actually uh became quite famous during World War II for all the missions that it performed it transported prisoners of War there were German prisoners of War upfront that that died they do not have a record well they do have a record but it's sealed of the number of people that died on that ship it was also acted as a hospital during World War II there's so many people that were wounded and died on that ship that are unrecorded there are 49 recorded deaths on the ship itself so the records are still sealed all these years later the military records are still sealed so they they won't talk about what happened there at the end of the war the ship did what was called a wives and babies trip and what that is is like all the overseas men who married women from other countries and had children with them they needed to get these women and children back to the States and so they did three trips and carried over 22,000 women and children uh back to the US uh and and again it's undocumented how many people during that time died there is a baby that can be heard crying in the infirmary and it's rumored that it was a a baby boy that had been born during one of the crossings that died shortly after birth and you can still hear him crying in the infirmary area 22,000 wow we had a lot of horny servicemen in World War II we really did this ship they have pictures of the ship on the on the deck the front deck of the ship during one of these Crossings and it's covered with diapers on like clothing lines but oh wow yeah the ship was home to even more tragedies I mean there's some stories of one of the captain's having a stroke in his cabin and you can still smell his cigars in that area the Captain's cabin was a site of yet another death where a a second mate I believe he was told by the captain you know hey you did a great job go to my cabin and you can have a shot of Jin go make yourself a drink and so the guy went into the captain's cabin and made himself a drink and shortly thereafter started feeling very strange and then died three days later after being violently ill turned out he had drank cleaning fluid that had been stored in a gin bottle in the captain's cabin did he kill him on purpose that's what I'm saying I don't know there's no proof that he did no one says anything about that but yeah drink my Jin wink wink nudge nudge so what I what I find interesting about what you've said so far is the fact that no matter how much tragedies happened with this boat they keep on using it they kept on using it that that also happened in the 40s and again in the 40s a crewman down in the boiler room that's one of the other hot spots is the Boiler Room of this ship and they actually have a door 13 to the boiler room why would you you're asking for trouble with a door 13 hotels no better than to have a 13th floor why would you have a 13th door in a boiler room in 1942 a crew member named John McKenzie this is one of the documented deaths was crushed by door 13 and the rumor is is that he was held there as the door shut by his crew mates because they didn't like him another crew member was crushed there during a routine fire drill in 196 66 18-year-old John pet he was a a fireman down there they were having a fire drill and as 18 year-olds are want to do as the door is being shut he and his friends decided to play chicken with the door and he didn't make it he was crushed in half and you can still see him he is one of the ghosts that people often see walking down the corridors carrying a wrench wearing blue or white overalls and he often leaves greasy handprints on the door um please tell me you see his whole body and not just half of it you do you do see his whole body they they call him half hatch hairy so I imagine some people occasionally see him seeing a ghost is bad enough but I don't want to see one cut in half you don't want to see half a ghost no there's another person who died in engine room 13 this was a young man named John Henry and John Henry had lied stay away from engine room 13 do not go near engine room 13 again as as superstitious as people on ships are I am so surprised if they had anything with a number 13 but this young man was underage and he had lied about his age to get in service and he was a lot of people did that back then a lot of people did yeah yeah it was very patriotic it was the thing to do this unfortunate young man was in engine room 13 when it caught on fire and he was unable to escape and you can still smell fire and uh hear his screams one of the doors will actually be hot to the touch when you can hear poor John Henry is is most of the Paranormal Activity then kind of segregated to that lower level of the boat like the boiler room and and and all of that is it kind of just in that lower portion oh no actually it's all over the ship in in the pool area there was a first class and a second class pool area and those are both extremely haunted as well there are no reports that I could find of documented deaths but again during those mothers and babies trips who knows how many kids passed away but there there's a young girl in the pool that they called Jackie her full name was Jacqueline Tor and she was five or six and she drowned in the second class pool area and it seems like that's a documented death but I couldn't really find any specific information people will hear even though those pools are no longer pools one of them is a one of them is a lounge and I think one of them is a theater but people can still hear water splashing and hear a little girl laughing and she'll respond to questions and sometimes they'll see a little girl walking around with her teddy bear looking for her mother there's another Young woman her name is Sarah and she I believe is also a documented death she was murdered in the first class women's changing rooms and her killer was never found and you can see her wet Footprints walking from what was the pool into what was the women's changing room there's an eyewitness account from the maintenance supervisor Kathy love she and a cooworker were there one night in the in what had been the pool area and they not only heard a little girl giggling and the sounds of a little girl running around they heard water splashing and then later they saw the wet Footprints appear going from what had been the pool to the women's locker room area holy [ __ ] right where poor young Sarah had been strangled to death and her murderer never found imagine being a third shift maintenance worker and you walk around and all of a sudden these watery Footprints are appearing out of nowhere there's another area the whole I don't know if it's called a floor but this is also a hotel you can go and stay there there's hotel rooms in what used to be the uh first second and third class lounge or um cabin areas cabin areas for the passengers and they've all been retrofitted and one of the rooms room b340 is reported to be the most haunted and was actually closed down because it was so haunted at one point why what happened in 340 well at one time room b340 was actually three separate rooms the B deck once contained third class cabins room B 340 was originally three third class State rooms I believe it was b222 b224 and b226 there was a young woman named Dana that was staying there with her family one night poor Dana awoke to find her mother and her younger sister strangled to death in their bed and she ran to she ran to the bathroom only to find her father there who had committed the crime who shot her to death in the bathroom the man was discovered very shortly afterwards they found his crimes and they discovered that he had killed his family and they took him out of the room and locked him up in the second Suite the family had right next door while he was locked there they put a guard on the room and the guard reported that the man shortly after being locked in started screaming and crying and wanting to be left out and saying they're trying to kill me they're trying to kill me and of course the guard just thought he was being an [ __ ] and wanting to get out because obviously there's no one else in this little teeny tiny third class room gradually the man was quiet and the guard was happy that he' finally fallen asleep the next morning when they came to Dock and the police got on they opened the door to the room to find that the man had been dismembered and disemboweled and there was blood all over the room wait who got in the room no one else had gotten in the room and it wasn't the guard it was not the guard as far as they could tell no one else got there and so Dana still her go still roams around in the pool room and on those rooms now they very shortly after cleaning up that room and setting sail again reports of paranormal activity such as blankets being pulled off of people lights turning on and off water turning on and off started happening immediately so much so that they were having trouble getting people to stay in those rooms so they decided pretty active Dana's an active ghost well there they think that there's more ghost there as well so they they turned that into one suite and people were staying in it up until the 80s when they finally decided that that was too much they couldn't handle it anymore there were too many Maids wouldn't go in there so they boarded it up and they stopped renting the room out until 2018 when let's go you can you can rent it out now let's go it was I don't know what it is now but it was $500 you can rent it out the room has you can find it there's YouTube videos where people have stayed there they have like the Bloody Mary incantation next to the mirror in the bathroom there's quotes from people on the walls of different experiences that they've had there they have a whole chest of crystal ball a Ouija board and ghost hunting equipment that comes with the room that you can use a Ouija board why okay you know everything goes back to Ouija boards everything goes back to Ouija boards Honestly though I think though if we were any any of the rooms on the B deck are are hot beds of Paranormal Activity there's so many things that happen there and everywhere on this ship there's actually photographic evidence of some of the ghosts one of them is called the white lady that people often report seeing in one of the ballrooms they'll see a young woman dressed all White Dancing by herself in the corner sometimes she'll go over to towards a piano but she always disappears as you get closer to her what I find interesting about about a lot of these places whether it's an asylum or or a ship or a house doesn't it appear though that a lot of these places that there may be certain spots that are more active than others but if a house is haunted the whole house is haunted if a ship is haunted the whole ship is haunted like I'd go and stay on the a deck knowing that I'd probably have just as much of a paranormal experiences if I was on the B deck well unless I was in the murder Suite oh you're not wrong I mean there are ghosts everywhere even the old what did you call the old kitchen on a The Galley was it a galley in a ship I think the galley yeah so in the galley was even the sight of a brutal murder and this time again during World War II they had picked up a crew they said it was Australian soldiers but I don't know maybe they were just trying to blame it on the Australians but supposedly one of the cooks there was a very abusive man not a very good cook at all these soldiers who were helping him out decided that they had had enough of his abuse and his shitty food and so they shoved him into his own oven and burned him alive oh that's all handsel and grle man yeah so you can still hear his screams and smell burning flesh in the galley and you got to figure even because of the long Journeys these types of ships made and in the time frame they took them you're also going to have the people who just died of natural causes and were just caught between worlds because you know how ghosts are if they die on expectedly they're all confused and [ __ ] and stay there are 49 documented deaths that happened on the ship and anytime anything like that happens it's bound to leave an imprint but then there's all the hundreds of deaths that happened from the the kuraa accident and other deaths that had to have happened during its time as a warship when it was there's got to be undocumented deaths between when it was carrying the women and the children to the wartime stuff there's got to be undocumented deaths everyone that goes there has experiences it's interesting to see some of the different investigations people have done because you get the auditory Sensations I'm not as familiar with some of the ghost hunting paraphernalia as you might be but they use things that sense an Emi freeder yes they use those and things that can sense changes in temperature and movement heat sensing yep yep so I guess some of that comes with the run one room but who's to say we couldn't bring our own I don't know I'm one of those people like the equipment I guess is cool but first of all a lot of ghost experiences are going to make your equipment shut off I don't want to see it on a screen I want my hair standing up on the back of my neck I want to smell that fire I want to hear that pool water slushing and hear that giggle down the hall knowing I'm the only one there I want to feel it I want to experience it I don't want to just see it on a screen you were talking about the the long hallways and the the creepy looking place I mean just going there the whole presence of the place feels very scary and very haunted and very heavy with the weight of History so if you can stay there are there staff that are on this boat 247 and if so are they experiencing things there is a caretaker that stays there right now during covid he's the only one that stays there he stays there five days a week by himself and that's some freaky [ __ ] he has a cute little dog you know he says it he says it's haunted and he'll take he takes people through the rooms and can describe what's what's happened even the ship's log before you know before it became a stationary place the ship's log detailed haunted places how long has it been stationary when did it get technically like taken out of use or or however they call it all right so after World War II it went back to being a luxury liner again but it it it didn't last it stopped making money after a while because air travel became so much better and other ocean liners at that point had so much better accommodation I mean this one was just too old and too out of touch well things were changing at that point with technology and transportation so why would it why would you hop on a boat and take two weeks to get from England to New York when you could get on a plane and do it at that point right plus plane travel now is so much cheaper and so much more accessible to people so that's absolutely what they did they decided to sell it and the City of Long Beach California bought it for 3.45 million in 1967 October 31st 1967 if that ain't an omen that's when she departed on her final cruise and arrived in Long Beach on December 9th 1967 and that's where it is currently permanently docked so the City of Long Beach owns it well actually it's changed hands quite a few times and was even owned at one point by Disney and I do have to point that out he went on the boat and then he owned it well kind of in the 70s and 80s it looks like what had happened is someone Disney related bought it and they were going to do I think it was Port Disney Maritime Disney I'm not positive but it's rumored that that room b340 was rigged up kind of like the Haunted Mansion I mean the the ghost stories and the rumors had already been there but it's rumored that they had rigged that room up to actually be fake haunted to kind of scare people even after it was you know they kind of scrapped that idea and sold the ship and took all of those fake ghost props down people's fuzzy memories of being there as children may have kind of embellished some of these ghost stories about room b340 that kind of reminds me of of my story on Rolling Hills Asylum people go there and if they go there with good intentions they have one experience and if you go there to almost mock it or monopolize off of it it doesn't out I'm sure there's people that go there have absolutely zero experience and just don't talk about it but everyone that goes there hears weird noises they hear screams they hear giggling they hear footsteps they feel someone the whole atmosphere the whole place scared everyone but yet they just kept using it they kept going and and people keep going they keep but they keep having these experiences that's why it's one of the top 10 most haunted places now let me ask you this have you had the opportunity to actually go there yourself yet not yet I'm going to wait and save it for us to go together we're going we're going we can go and we we're going to find some ghosts we're going to catch some ghosts and we're going to show everybody what we find we'll have to count how many ghosts we get like psychics have been there and have talked like I said 150 up to as many as 600 ghosts if you want me to sit there and connect with 600 ghosts I can't just be there for like two hours we're gonna have like we're stay we could we could go on a ghost tour or we could maybe book a room and stay in a room let me tell you I'm down for booking a room I I just want that ghostly experience I love it then let's try hopefully they'll be open and we can book a room on the B deck excellent I wonder if any of these Spirits smoke weed do you think they do they've got to I mean some of them were Sailors right they smoke weed George Washington smoked weed smoked this peace pipe as American is smoking pot exactly EX exactly hold on bong puff time I'm way ahead of you I mean this sounds like Titanic type stuff like I am intrigued I'm not even scared I am like excited to go here as a matter of fact I want to go oh I want to go too I think there's so many ghosts one of them they call the growling ghost and he's one of the the more popular I guess ghosts everybody has an experience with a growling ghost supposedly there's a a stair a staircase near the first what was the first class swimming pool and that's kind of where he stays and he growls at people and there's recordings you can find online of him of the growling ghost unlike Henry the young boy who died in a fire in the engine room Henry actually will respond to questions about beer apparently young underage Henry liked beer beer a lot of these ghosts will respond if you ask them questions and like you ask a question then later you play it back and you can hear EVP I don't remember what the acronym stands for but it's EVP I think EVP stands for electronic voice phenomena I love that [ __ ] they have some sort of machine and it seems like [ __ ] to me but they have some sort of machine that like translates ghost talk and yeah and says it out loud I don't know if that's just programmed to have words come out of it randomly or if that's really a thing you know I don't trust techn ology when it comes to ghosts yeah I mean I could go into I could do a whole podcast on why I don't trust technology with ghosts I'd rather that psychic knowing that instant feeling I guess that personal experience because technology is whack and you can't trust it you can't trust technology and you can rig technology to kind of alter results well you can have really charismatic people who sound like they know what they're talking and they're just really spewing [ __ ] so I think I kind of like both I like I I do like when I can see that the temperature has changed in this spot or there was motion here where there should be no motion or I'll admit I'm a sucker for orb photos I totally you know I do like or photos I mean I know there's explanations for them I don't want to hear it I like them and I also do kind of like the whole EVP voice recording in the static thing that's interesting to me I I don't know if that's fully like a legit I look at it I look at it I try to look at those things as more of a affirmation of what I'm feeling I feel something here there's something here and now I have something to validate what I'm feeling more validation than having it be like well it says that there's something here so there must be if I feel it and then see it there that's validating for me I think that's why it's important to me to kind of have both because you know I do I do very much trust my intuition intuition other worldly senses you know when you walk into a space and and the hair on your arm stands up or you know you immediately can feel that presence and when everyone's feeling the same thing you know you kind of get that validation and so when your when your little meter goes off at the same time that your intuition goes off like you said that validating for sure it's very validating it's like you know I don't know what this is but something just happened and it's kind of freaking me out now I have used an EVP and I've also used the a heat sensor machine I kind of liked it when I would get a sense I'd get a feeling I'd see something and then it would pop up on the EVP or the one time I did see a full body uh figure on the heat sensor I felt like I saw it first I walked into a room and felt like I was being stared at and used the Heat sensor thing and actually saw an outline when there was nobody there to the naked eye that validated that for me but if I didn't have that heat sensor I still would have walked out of there saying yeah there was someone there and I saw them it just validated what I already knew right you didn't need it it's just it was nice to to have both of those pieces of evidence right but I feel like I had the same exact experience I would have had the same experience even if I didn't have the equipment the equipment just valid ated what I was already feeling and that's what happens over and over again on the Queen Mary is they've done so many investigations sensitives and psychics have gone there they've done seances and you know Ouija boards and paranormal investigations and people have just gone there to visit and have fun and had a paranormal experience for the first time in their lives you know since all we we've had a bunch of our our podcast stories so far somehow someway tie back to a Ouija board D Ouija Bo but you know I don't think the Queen Mary is a place you want to be taking a Ouija board okay everything every Wiccan and Pagan in in witchy witchcraft sense in me says do not ever board that ship with a Ouija board it sounds like the ship is already a hot bed of activity and that's you just have to walk through it in order to feel it you don't need to be antagonizing anything or calling anything it's already there you just have to walk into these places and you can hear hear it and feel it and ghosts here are so prolific that you don't need any extra anything well let me tell you my friend when I am in sunny California in about two two and a half months we are going to the Queen Mary yes yes and we probably can't smoke there so I'm gonna bring a lot of Edibles I mean it is California but it's still a hotel so it's going to have to be like eat this Brownie and in an hour we're gonna we're going to go tour the ship I'm intrigued we're going we're going to stay we'll stay overnight and we will see if we can find some Spirits absolutely so the Queen Mary Newport Beach California Long Beach Long Beach Long Beach Long Beach Queen Mary in Long Beach yep I'll remember that Snoop Dog Sayang about Long Beach yeah so did uh Sublime and then there's also the Long Beach Dub all stars who doesn't love them that's all for episode three of the stoned which hour thank you so much for hanging out with us and if you enjoyed this episode please give us a follow and
