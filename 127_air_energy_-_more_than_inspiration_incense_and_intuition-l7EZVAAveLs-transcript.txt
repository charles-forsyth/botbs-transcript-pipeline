Elemental energy what are we talking about today show talking about are Layla and you know I find I have such a love-hate such a love-hate with are so I did want to kind of talk about that for a second because I know that sometimes folks have a hard time connecting with a particular element and for being an air sign I feel like I have a hard time connecting with the air element it's just strange to me sometimes I wonder if people have trouble with it because it's invisible it's hard to see and so sometimes I think if that makes it a little more mysterious for people but I'm such a Words which that are has always been kind of easy for me I can't I can't shut up I mean  a podcast because I can't stop talking I'm a communicator that's right I think you're right I just there's nothing like with fire you know you focus on the flame and with water you've got the water there and with Earth you know you're deep into the dirt and was are it's like this invisible gas that you are is it here is it not here I know I'm breathing it but you know okay there you go and that's what I usually tell my students is breathing it really like to bring it back to the breath because that's so fundamental and that's something that we can control and that we can actually feel very easily so bring it back to breath and communication is very important I think when talking about are energy and you know I think that speaking of breath and that is a good focal point when working with are at least for me because it's the one thing that I can kind of quantify  that are with I'm breathing it must be there you know what I'm saying but like the communication you know it's also kind of for me thoughts you know I know sometimes people will cross thoughtfulness between Aaron fire but I kind of look at fire Moore's action and errors the thought you put into it prior to that and subconscious thought not active thought so very deeply thoughtful and communicative element in a correspondence to the element yeah and another way that people can connect with it if communication also means intuition it means talking to your ancestors it means divination so when you're casting rooms when you're pulling tarot cards all of this is very deeply entwined with elemental are your intuition your divination all of these messages coming to you are coming to you very strongly  true are true that element and you know also creativity I think of are as well and I think it's just kind of that when I think of are I have that like a most Whimsical as you so I feel that when I'm thinking of creativity and artistic manner or inspiration in potentially to stick manner I'm thinking that is an air quality yeah air is very much about intellect and creativity it's about learning something new it's it's springtime and we talked before about are being associated with yeast and with the Dawn and even if you don't necessarily associate are with the direction of East are still very often associated with New Beginnings like the freshness of a spring Breeze a breath of fresh air people will talk about the breadth of inspiration or intuition so it's a very deeply connected to those new beginning ideas even if you don't connect it to Dawn and also  each of the elements is associated with different season and Dawn is kind of represented by that spring season that Awakening the dawn of the seasons the winter has pulled back things are starting to grow things are starting to pop up and that is also kind of their heirs aspect of the wheel has definitely communicate and spells communication ritual is communication chanting is communication all of these I associate with the element air to work this into your practice what are some ways that you like to work with are in your brush work is probably the first thing you know not so much now but back in the day chanting as well I don't know how I kind of pulled away a little bit from from chance enchanting but back in the day I would have said chanting as well as yeah but breath  lends itself very easily to a cyclone to a tornado type visualization of energy so if you call are in with the idea that you want to raise it up and do a cone of power and directed to something your brain your magical brain will very easily connect the idea of drawing in are energy whipping it into a cycle a spiral a tornado and then pushing it to your target so if that's a very easy visualization for your brain to hold onto so you can pull are energy in that way towards whatever purpose that you have especially when using a chance and then whip it into that spiral just makes it easier is also easily worked with for me anyway during storms you know when that wind is weapon start going back to what I said before it's almost like because it's a weapon it's Quantified and I can feel it there for but the way  thoughts can travel in the wind the way ideas can travel in the wind I feel that sometimes air is also a courier to the next step to air will carry the wind will carry you on to the next stop so I look at it almost is like a a vehicle of chain is a great way to carry messages to the universe a lot of people talk about burning something tonight I know that's fire but the smoke the idea is the smoke from what you burned carries your message off through the air to the universe the same goes for if you're burning incense the smoke of that incense as an offering goes up through the air so yeah there's a little fire involved but like we mentioned last episode not very much that you'll find in the world is pure one thing or another I had to make sure I pointed this out some some point in the episode in this is a good time so do you know what it one air tool would possibly be  I want okay you are just have to take it there and okay a broomstick Layla a broomstick oh yeah I've always kind of had that be an air tool I don't know very ones like rooms are very well and like and a sweet things away I love it also but when you think of a witch on a broom in the night sky she is using her broom to fly through the air out a room you can actually sweep out the negative energy to clear the air so that works great and of course you know there's different associations and different correspondences obviously like you said feathers I'm always thinking of birds or my favorite dragon  eyes always make me think of air and bees to I Love The Folk practice of whispering to the bees you know telling them messages that they will carry to our beloved Jet and those are all properties of air yep you know as far as magical workings I would say my biggest thing are specific is going to be the breathwork few times and we've talked about meditations of things in the past we've talked about box breathing where you concentrate on your breath a lot of traditions will have you concentrate on the breath because it is part of life it is so vital to life and so by respecting your breath and by paying attention to your breath not only are you honoring the elements of air but you're honoring life itself box breathing is breathing in for a count of for holding your breath for a count of four breathing out for a count of four and then holding your breath again for accounted for and then continuing to do that and that's  one of many different ways that you can pay attention to your breath and really connect with that energy and also use that to raise energy for spell work what do you do to connect with a specific play incense is a big one for me I do love to have incense and nice smelling thing that said give them I also have a lot of plants in my house and the room for a particularly have a lot of plants I feel like the air is nicer there and so sometimes if I'm doing a meditation especially one that involves a lot of breath work I like to work maybe in my living room where I have a ton of plans or in this one corner of my office where I have a nice window in a lot of plants and that really helps me to feel like I'm connecting not just with are but with elemental energy and Jen I like the number to I've never looked at plan Suzanne are things so interesting perspective that I'm going to ponder in the elemental Earth meditation that we posted not too long ago one of the things I do  talked about was breathing in harmony with the trees and even though that was an earth meditation getting you connected to the earth into trees the idea of breathing with a plant is very Air Base because when you breathe out the carbon dioxide you breathe out is what the plant breathe in and the plant breathe out oxygen that you then breathe in so just thinking about that symbiosis that cycle between you and the natural world while you're sitting in your plant corn or whatever that is a beautiful error meditation in a beautiful way to work with the energy I think it's another example of how something such as trees or plants can be under dual elements everything else we talked about in the earth episode where the idea of these building blocks of life came from and we know now there's how many elements on the periodic table  all of our ancestors only thought they were five there's more of them when we were in ninth grade how about that and they literally thought that the only pure things were dirt are that's all around us water and fire they told you those were the only pure things and everything else was made up in some way of all of those things and then powered by Aether are orbs spirit so nothing is really really just one thing or the other yeah so Layla let's let's kind of just jump a little bit too cuz we talked about this with Earth, but I want to make sure we touch on it with each of the elements let's talk about for a second some deities deities associated with are because I know that's again another thing that that people are looking for who do I do I call to when I'm working with are as far as deity and I mean I think the biggest one I can think of is going to be Odin and I think it's because of the whole  storm aspect with Odin and how I view storms a lot of the time is an air thing ends and written language and his companions are two crows so how about you Leila what are who are deities you think of when you think of are well two of the big ones are Mercury and urine urine test because that's my planet that deity is air and Mercury is variares the communication he's the heir God I also feed the dog, and his role as the sky father and father of speech is very are like assholes or as the goddess of the sky and of Art and music can be a goddess because she is goddess of the night sky the stars in space  haraf it's because her domain includes the wind and sky and one of her symbols is a peacock zephyrus he's a Greek god of the West Wind and I remember his name because a zephyr is a type of wind some people also say fairies fairies and two types of fairies called silt are also are fairies that people like to work with and they'll say that they are associated with that element I've also seen people associated with are very much are not just one thing Daddy and ask to work with the aspects of them that are related to your working in this case are but you don't have to work with all of the elements that make them up but you can call on different aspects of them feel like most of them are multifaceted the lightning thing would be a big reason why but  let's just mention the elephant in the room okay ones swords swords ones we all have different views on which direction are is I've you are in the East and I know people view are the north the important part is how you honor the element and not necessarily what quarter the element is in yeah if you know why you picked up quarter for the element automatic yeah that's fine all the matters and Wands now the argument for some people is that stores are are because they cut through the air because they Bayern that's right they also say that swords are represented by are because people talk about a sharp wit or sharp as a tack a keen intellect  so they say that that means it's towards our air Juan's being fire because they burn I haven't seen much other reasoning why ones are that action that fire Elements by be honest with me East are wand type of girl are as communication and to represent Communications expert get passed around if you pick up a Juan because you're a magician or a wizard or witch you're using it to cast a spell you're using it to direct your words your will and I know people like to say that stores our communication but when was the last time someone picked up a sword with the intent to talk right by your reaction sometimes with the consequences of that action and Wands are Barefoot again if you have a different Viewpoint as long as you know why you have that Viewpoint or cool with it that's fine  absolutely so using different tools to represent an element is wonderful and the reason you do that is to help get your brain your subconscious your magical brain in the framework to recognize that element so if you put everything around you that reminds you of are you have wonderful incense going if you have some light music in the bathroom can all represent are maybe you have the color yellow or light pale colors whites and yellow some people like pastel colors anything light in pretty free-flowing curtains anything that makes you think are put that all around you and then sit and have a full little meditation and focus on your breath will post a short are meditation that will go along with this episode as well but I also have a spell with your breath that I could talk about I bet you do all right do you remember when I talked about how to feel and her  by using the soap bubble imagery between we all remember practice today so we're going to give you the similar type thing but this is to learn how to push energy into something to come up with energy that has a certain flavor and push it into something so what you're going to do is hold up your hands palm-up in front of you and concentrate on your palms until you can feel them kind of warm up just a little bit then you're going to put them so they're Palm to Palm in front of you about two to three inches apart just like you did in the sense of energy sounds an awful lot like Reiki to me but it keep going it's very very similar very similar break is all about raising energy flavoring it a certain way and pushing it so this is a lot like that I'm giving away Ricky secret I have no idea I'm not certified you are and I don't know what I'm talking about  apart from each other and instead of a massive little bubbles like I had to Envision before to feel that energy now I want you to think of a time when you had just one big soap bubble between your hands just one big one in between your hands sometimes I actually visualize it as a bubble gum bubble yasso picture of big bubble with a bubble gum soap whatever you want but a nice big one big round bubble between your hands just sitting there nice and strong and beautiful then you're going to think of whatever energy you want pick a spell show something you want to spell for okay how about a spell for Prosperity Prosperity going to be for success and prosperity so you get your mind off thinking boss about success and prosperity and you feel solid in yourself and you're still in visioning this bubble between your hands  now you're pulling into your Center into your belly success Prosperity money doing good feeling happy and secure in your life and you're thinking all these things that mean success and prosperity to you and once you've got that in your belly all big and strong read that in your lungs breathing into your lungs all that energy and mix it up with all those feelings and then blow it gently don't pop the bubble blow that energy into the bubble like you're blowing smoke into it and it should be green for prosperity and success and then just imagine that smoke that green colored smoke swirling around inside that bubble as you blow all that energy into it and then hold it there and imagine that energy swirling Andreas at bubble above your head and pop it on top of your head and Let the Smoke Fall all down around you now you can raise the energy of success and prosperity you've directed it into the bubble and then you put it back into yourself to give yourself that black  you could also push that energy into a crystal or into something metal or something else that so that you can hold on to it for later or if you were going to say you were doing a spell over too well for someone else you could you could direct it into a crystal or another object and give it to the to a person or put it into that bubble and then pop it on them this is really just an exercise for you to practice raising different types of energy into your breath flavor your breath that energy of air that life giving breath flavor that would whatever energy you want to cash in your spell and then blow it literally direct it into that bubble in your hands and your cupped hands into a chalice is McChrystal and then blow that breath that you have flavored with the energy you want for your spell into the item and now you have that ready to direct so that you can push that energy out to the universe to work your will so not only are you working with the element and  doing a ritual with and directed at the element but you're also getting yourself practiced more and you know energy development and energy directing a lot of people have a hard time working with it but it's such an easy way to raise and Direct Energy you just do a little bit of breath work in a meditation you can really feel that energy freezing up I just think it's a it's a nice way nice easy way to get connected that people Overlook sometimes I think that when I was a newbie which I don't know if that's the right term but that's what I'm going to say when I was a newbie which I think that I didn't take enough stock into breathwork because I I took I took breathing for granted there for kind of took breathwork for granted and I don't think it really dawned on me how important doing breathwork was legit until I had two kids  in any kind of learn me like how there's something to this breath thing and you know I think that's what really I think childbirth is what kind of gave in my mind validity to breathwork makes a lot of sense if you can control your breath you can calm yourself down you can hide yourself up you can help control pain I mean there's so much that you can do if you can work with your breath really well you got it meditation know that breath work is a huge part of that so we mentioned chanting earlier as a way to work with are and singing and chanting are a form of breath work listening to music even if you don't sing is another way to connect to the air element and listening to music while channeling because communication writing and words are really good ways to work with are and we talked a little bit about journaling we talked way too much about journaling little more because journaling and getting those thoughts out like you mentioned earlier in the app  oh that thought thinking we also are and sometimes you need to get that out sometimes you just need to do some Journey Pages just get those pages out in the morning just right right right right right right and that can be a really great way to help bring Clarity which is another air quality you can bring that Clarity in that clear missed yourself before you do a working if you're just able to write it all down right all the things that are cluttering your brain and just get it on paper and get it out simple spell in and of itself sometimes communicating could be communicating with your Spirit guides just cuz you write it out doesn't mean you have to give it to anyone in particular you could give those writings to your Spirit guides to read and you know a spirit work working with ancestors and spirit work is all are this is all about its communication if it's digital communication if you're working online the airwaves that's right it's all are this podcast so if you were sitting there  incense going you're listening to our podcast you got a nice warm cup of tea and you're pulling tarot cards to journal air air air air air air air air energy Brushwood 2025 playlist true I do to actually speaking of our Brushwood playlist I do believe that the Brushwood radio used to in the offseason just play random music but I believe now they have recorded shows like ours and they're doing those shows the pre-recorded Brushwood radio spots during the serious rising and and colorful pasta bowls are all going to be played on rotation on Brushwood radio you should put a link up to that I will I believe they're also going to start having talk shows and a few things like that  you might hear a couple of your favorite podcasters pop up down there now and again it was crazy witches as a companion to at this episode as well I did have a little tidbit here about their can assist with past-life regressions and kind of conducting with maybe the past lives that you have had I know that ancestor work is a part of air but sometimes they look at your own ancestry and this is a good time to do past life regression where have I been in other lives I mean I know I know that where I've been in this life where have I been in other lives in this is a good time to kind of tune into that or get with somebody meet with somebody maybe a hypnotherapist or whatnot that can assist you with past-life regressions but I think anything really to do with Spirit very much as an error  whether you're communicating with your past Spirit ancestors Spirit whatever the case maybe it's all are my my fascination with meditation definitely let me down the hypnosis path and I did get certified in hypnotherapy and I'm also certified in past life regression and I have done some very interesting sessions with people doing past lives but I would usually associate hypnosis and past life regression war with water because of its relationship with the subconscious and deep memories so I can see how you'd like it to are as well by seeing spirits and spirit realm is are communicating with your past life could also be seen as are so it's one of those mixture of elements occasion to go together and meditation anyting it with the mind like that is associated with are hypnosis a little bit multi-element  very much thinking it's one of those crossovers are well past life regression is so fascinating and have you ever had have you ever done a past life regression had someone guide me through it in the past on my falling down at once before and I feel like I've told you this before but can we both say we're not shocked that this person told me I had been a princess in a former life I am not shocked at all cuz I surely was not shocked but yeah I was I was actually told that I was a princess in a former life in an area that is currently known as Russia but I would like to download it to this again some other time with you and have you just take me down that path and see where I have been I know I am very surprised I mean I have done past-life regressions for other people in our community before but or whatever we never have and I'm kind of  I will have to see if the Russian princess thing comes up but some of the things that come out from that really helped people you know when I've done past-life regressions with people before it usually has brought up something that is related to issues that they're having in their life right now literally something that they're continuing working on from a past life and they still are working on it in this life lessons and working on lessons you know can be part of that working with are energy and finding things about yourself from past life can often help someone work through blockages or issues they're having in this life that's one of the things that just fascinates me is how often do with the way that they died in their past life or maybe their occupation or something that happened to them in their past life relates to things that are relevant in this life now I'm not saying that everything is related to your past lives because most certainly is not that it's known to happen. It's surprising how often these correlations  and how is talking about it can really help people in this lifetime work through it and again that communication thing you know that's very are like we are humans are kind of like aggression is digging down to the next layer and then to the next layer because all of the people that you have been in the past really do create and make up who you are now and I want to know where have I been in what if I done that is created this hot mess to do ancestor work is to also do deep meditation or hypnosis therapy work with past life regression where you can talk to your ancestors you know maybe it's not you in a past life but maybe you do some hypnotherapy work where you go back and you call your ancestors and you have a conversation with them you know that can be very helpful sometimes for people who have difficulty ancestors I'm a firm believer that once people pass they  become connected with more of their oversoul that they become connected with more of who they have been through many lifetimes and all the lessons that they have learned so very rarely have I encountered someone unless they've just recently passed is still a dick once they've been dead for a little while even if you have problematic ancestors you are more than likely going to be able to connect to the time on some level there less dicks now because Heather I got grounded  terrible but communicate with your ancestors communicate with the spirits and I doing meditation and hypnosis therapy a lot of times I can facilitate that communication that can help you in this lifetime can I just give a left turn sign out here are six sense of humor is why we are the bestest yes that among many other things I absolutely are sick are sick twisted sense of humor definitely does not hurt at all I think maybe probably the best way for folks to just take a step back and honor are and do some working is with air would be to just maybe be cognizant of your of your breath that's probably the best first step I could say is be cognizant of your breath breathe everything how often have you been in a bad mood or been all scattered at someone says take a breath so many times have you told me that and you take that deep breath  answer your nose out to your house and you immediately that calm that relaxation you startled me and just being right there that can help center you and help bring you right back to this moment so breakfast so important so next what are we going to talk about next Layla next week I believe we will be talkin about by here or firefighters everyone's favorite elements I think every other person at brush with no I'm not complaining I think it's awesome but I think like every third person that Brushwood had some version of fire as a name a popular Pagan name to close to Hellfire but yeah a lot of fire names well I guess we're going to dive into fire next time and we're going to see if we get back thank you all so much for listening to this episode of  back on the broomstick please like subscribe leave us some reviews it really helps the show out helps you will find us and make sure Lanai super happy for the love of the lady send us mail people again you will be entered into the seasons of the which saw in Oracle deck drawing if you send us something in the mail postmarked between August 8th and October 1st and again you can find us app back on the broomstick PO Box 106 Salem Mass 01970.
