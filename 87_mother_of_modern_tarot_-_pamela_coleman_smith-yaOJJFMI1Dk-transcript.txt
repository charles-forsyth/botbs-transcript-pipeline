join us as we get back on the broomstick welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and on this All Souls day we'll be talking about someone every tarot reader out there can call on as an ancestress the almost forgotten artist behind the most iconic version of tarot what is known as the writer waight Smith version and I don't mean writer who was the publisher or waight who was the esoteric brains behind it I mean Smith Pamela Coleman Smith why do they always forget the woman right that makes me so frustrated and Not only was her name left off for decades but she was barely paid anything for the artwork that she did seriously she is the artist mother of the writer waight Smith Tarot deck now often called the weight Smith or Smith weight deck if you prefer so for this episode we'll be focusing on Pamela also known as pixie as well as her life her art and her huge influence on the tarot cards that we know and love today I'm really excited that we're doing this and welcome everybody shell here and I just want to say there's more to the story than tarot and I was just taken a back at Pamela Coleman Smith's story so we're going to dive into it and we're going to talk about a little bit more of her life other than her tarot piece I was just fascinated fascinated when I first saw a picture of her I was immediately drawn in in her personality just crackles off the picture you can see it in every single picture of her you can see the life and the energy that she must have had when I see pictures of her she reminds me of a Tarot reader someone that knows things and obviously she knew things because these pictures this deck and you know I have more decks than one person really should have but this is the deck that has stood the of time I mean this came out in what 1909 and here we are in 2024 and it is still the most sold deck like on the planet still there are over 100 million copies worldwide and I own probably seven of them and when I first started out my first deck was a weight Smith clone and it was called a rider weight deck never ever heard of Pamela Coleman Smith in the first several decades that I read cards neither did I now funny story so you know I have this Obsession but I never ever ever would use the wrer weight deck never you know why because it just felt too basic to me even from the onset 30 years ago I skipped over it I didn't want it a part of my collection I actually only obtained actually multiple copies of it in my collection in maybe the last 10 years but you know I've only used maybe two or three decks to consistently read with as much of a collector as you are most of the time they're a novelty you collect them for the artwork and you might do a PO or two but there's just a couple Decks that you consistently work with for personal or for public readings I have avoided this deck for 30 plus years and sure as guess what I am using right now all right to be fair you say that you don't use a Smith weight version of the deck however anything that you think of as a traditional Tarot deck is based on Pamela Coleman Smith's artwork your favorite deck to read with for a very long time was the Ellen Canon read deck that is a rer weight Smith clone even though someone else redid the artwork they're basically copying Pamela Coleman Smith's artwork and the symbology that she worked into each of these cards so it might not call itself a rer weight Smith deck or a rider weight Smith clone but unless it's completely reimagined most of the time these decks follow pixie's artwork so I think I think your collection has a lot of ryer weight Smith clones or Decks that are very similar to her artwork but I think you only specifically have a handful that are called Rider weight Smith right you know I have you know the mini deck I have the radian I I have all the versions um in my collection but what I've been using lately is the writer weight Smith Centennial Deck which was a nod to kind of give her that recognition all these years later it was a version of the deck that they took back to like her original I think it's colors if you look at the various versions The Coloring is different and I think this version this Centennial version they took it back to the most accurate to how she released it originally as possible so let's rewind a little bit Pamela Coleman Smith was born in London to American parents she was born February 16th 1878 in pimo London and she traveled quite a lot with her family to the point where she lived in London she lived in Jamaica she lived in America and then she lived back in the United Kingdom she's a little bit of a mysterious figure even during her time people weren't quite sure what to make of her she was loud she wore men's pants she was colorful she was ambiguous they didn't know if she liked men they didn't know if she liked women they didn't know if she was Poss possibly biracial they didn't know where she came from and she perpetuated a lot of these stereotypes her parents were writers and artists her grandfather was the mayor of Brooklyn so her family was somewhat connected to the Bohemian scene but still in an affluent kind of way and she spent quite a bit of her childhood I believe she was about five years old when her family moved to Jamaica and it very much impacted her to the point where when she came back from Jamaica she would very often speak in a Jamaican dialect to kind of impress or fluster the people around her and she wrote a book called anoun stories telling the folk tales and I believe it was the first book that published these verbal folktales from Jamaica and it was quite popular at the time and she did that when she was 19 years old wow I did read one thing I I found was interesting as far as her travels and whereabouts throughout her life is that she moved to a art colony in New Hampshire which back then in in in that time period who's moving to New Hampshire she old up there but yeah I know she went up to New Hampshire um and spent some time with an art colony up there yep she spent a lot of time at the Cornish art colony in New Hampshire and it was a place for artists to go be creative and to be in nature it was interesting because prior to that she had spent time at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn New York prior to going to the artist colony and there she was exposed to everything she like thrived in that Bohemian atmosphere and her art was passionate and expressive and inclusive and very much broke all the Norms of the time so she went from there to the Cornish art colony and those are the two places that really formed her artistic expression they say that that kind of brought a lot of inspiration to her as far as drawing on spirituality and things you know intuition in her art um and that was really a little bit prior to her doing the Tarot deck and I read in a couple different places that they think that her time spent in the art colony in New Hampshire inspired some of the backdrops of some of the cards as well as her time spent in Wales and some of those backdrops inspiring the cards interesting she was a prolific artist in her early 20s and her father uh her mother died when she was around 15 um I believe while she was in Jamaica she was very close with her father and traveled quite a bit with him and he tried to help her once she published this book a nans stories and he actually introduced her to Bram Stoker I saw that she actually traveled with Bram stoer um for a while and and and did a lot of work and I was like are you kidding yes at the time he was like the stage manager for the lysium theater and so he managed all these actors and actresses at the time and basically Pamela Coleman Smith Charmed the pants off of him she showed him these miniature sets and miniature dolls that she did all these plays with and he immediately hired her to work on costumes and set design another interesting thing though is that she I think she spent some time with these folks in a period where there was a lot of I don't know if fantasy and mysticism is the right way to explain it you're exactly right I mean the Golden Dawn was coming up Alister Crowley was being weird at this time right like there was a lot like she was starting to get you know how it was like when we were in college like the theater kids are kind of likeed in that and she was kind of that theater group kind of brought her into the Hermetic order you know what I mean they they did that theater group was all people that were part of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn they were all part of mysticism and learning all of this magic and she was right in the thick of it as an artist as an artist and one of the actresses at the time like the premier actress at the time was Ellen Terry and Ellen Terry kind of took Pamela under her Wing gave her the nickname pixie because people said things about Pamela Coleman Smith like she was that odd artist Mystic Girl and other people said things like she looked like the goddaughter of a witch and a sister to a fairy that's a compliment right seriously but people would call her dark and Mystic and witchy and Ellen Terry was also very Bohemian she had lots of babies and lovers and was not married and she was loud and proud and and anian in a more acceptable way well know acceptable as an actress could be at that time but she was also part of the Golden Dawn and so they took her in and she started to go through the orders because the Golden Dawn has um they have stages they have orders you have to go through and pixie kind of did some classes here and there but most importantly this is where she met Arthur Edward weight a weight now one thing uh that she did is a means to earn money um that I I just I could not believe this this was one of those fun fact of the day things for me she actually was was quite the spearhead for supporting women's rights to vote she was a part of that movement she actually Illustrated posters that was some of the things that she did to kind of do her part for the the greater good um she designed a lot of those posters and I actually went back and you know I don't know if you've looked at any of these or seen any of these you look at some of those posters for the Voting Rights they kind of look like tarot cards you can see that art new V style you can see her style really come through and some of her artwork is absolutely gorgeous it has been shown in a few places and and we'll get to how she died but unfortunately a lot of her work has been lost it definitely was one of those things like diamond in the rough I don't think at the time people appreciated her skill and I think it's just because the time and period was very oversaturated with artists you know what I mean I mean she did you know she was in a in an art colony full of artsy people she was in Greenwich Village full of artsy people she was just I I I don't think her personality allowed her to blow up while she was living she did a little bit I mean she sold she Illustrated a bunch of books she was working quite a bit in her younger 20s and she got this commission to work with AE weight he didn't pay her very much I heard her describe it as a lot of bit of work for a little bit of pay yes there are a couple books out uh biographies that do have some of her letters and writings in them so you can see what she says about this job so what they did was AE weight who was a Mystic and a scholar and also a Grandmaster of the Golden Dawn had this idea for tarot cards so so he met with Pixie Pamela Coleman Smith and hired her to draw these cards and he gave her very detailed instructions about the major Arcana but very little instruction about the minor Arcana that wasn't a big thing back then though the minor Arcana usually in the early Italian decks from you know the 1600s and such they were just almost like what we would look at as modern-day playing cards some people call them the PIP cards or I call them minor Arcana cards but they were just almost like a a side thought to the major Arcana right until pixie came along and gave them life and gave them layers and depth that they had never had before it changed the world of tarot reading so now instead of saying okay that's the six of diamonds that means teaching uh sharing generosity you know giving of yourself instead of memorizing that or looking in the book you could look at the picture you didn't even need to know what the six of diamonds meant or the the six of cups or the Six of Pentacles meant you could use the imagery and have a really damn good idea of what it means and a lot of this imagery came from her love of mysticism from Arthur weight's descriptions of things but it also came from an interesting place because pixie had synesthesia what is that synesthesia is basically where your senses in your brain get crossed somehow so you can taste colors you can see music you can hear sents no no and in pixie's case she said she saw pictures when she listened to music and so very often when she did these cards she would be in a meditative state with music playing and she would do these paintings while she was basically channeling the music and these images that Arthur weight told her about you know I think this is just my theory here who the hell am I but I think that it was a combination of he did give her kind of the basis with the major Arcana and a brief outline um with just some brief bullet points on the minor Arcana and I think she took that like you said almost like channeling something exactly almost like what do they call that again when when a download yeah yeah yeah no she really did you know combined the download with his bullet point and created the minor Arcana it took her about five months to do it and she based a lot of the cards illust big amount no she did 80 illustrations in five months and some of them she based on people that she knew like Ellen Terry is the empress Ellen Terry's daughter Edith Craig she's the queen of Wands William Terrace who was an actor at the time he's the fool the black cat on the Queen of Wands is a friend of hers cats named Snuffles I don't know how true that is but that's what I've heard but other people were people that she knew in the theatrical world she modeled some of the clothing on costumes that she styled from the lysium group The other thing I wanted to mention is that um when she was doing some of these cards and like you said that she had come up with 80 well we all know a Tarot a standard Tarot deck is 78 cards if you get the Centennial edition of the rightwe Smith deck it actually does come with all 80 cards and what the other two cards are are just I want to call it a painting but it's on a tarot card you know it's like artwork but it's not actually a card and I've actually used those shuffled them in with the other cards and there's only been a couple times that one or both have come out look at you using a mini Magpie deck shush yourself here sh but it's almost like you put your own interpretation to it it's almost like the Joker the card you know I am a big fan of Magpie decks but what I mostly do is use a standard 78 card deck and then a few wild cards and I started that a long time ago with the L tarot the L tarot has a 79th card it's beautiful and it's called The Who are you really card and that for me when that would pop up it could change a reading it added an extra Dimension and so that's something that I'll do now I love to add a few oracle cards in or you know a handful of wild cards as opposed to like a really deck the two extra cards in the Centennial version they're they're beautiful as is the rest of the deck so now we're gonna talk about one of my favorite Mysteries you love a good mystery I do love a good mystery one of my favorite mysteries about these tarot cards came before I ever heard of Pamela Coleman Smith and that is on every single tarot card there's layers of meaning there's symbolism from Arthur weight mostly in the major arcano and from pixie herself mostly in the minor Arcana but also on every single card usually in the lower right hand corner you'll see this weird squiggly sigil this symbol some people have described it as a how do you say that catacus a snake thing a Sigil a symbol some people say it looks like some sort of why does everything esoteric have to be Egyptian but people are like it's some ancient Egyptian symbol it's her initials man it turns out it's her initials when I was a kid like I said I learned on a writer weight clone and a lot of these clones will just publish the pictures straight over and it will have her signature on it which is this squiggly looking symbol it's it's beautiful she at one time when she was at the Pratt Institute one of the classes that she took was about Japanese art and she learned about Japanese block Printing and a lot of times the way they'd sign it was these beautiful calligraphy initials like turning your initials into a symbol or a Sigil yeah and so part of the lesson was to create your own initial sigil and she did and so it's a P with a very long line uh the C and the S and a DOT now on the Centennial version um that is actually on the back of all the cards it is as well on the picture but it's on the back as well I can remember having conversations with other budding witches and Tarot readers and we did not know what this symbol meant we thought it was like some cryptic thing I thought it was some sort of sigil I did not know what it meant but I'm so happy now to know what it is and and it's interesting that its placement varies slightly uh usually for artistic reasons there are some people who will actually read that as a Sigil especially for the few cards that it's not on now I need to talk to you about something real quick let me hear it now you know that um I have been working on a project that I needed a Tarot deck for and I was oh Lord I couldn't take one out of the collection for this project so I had to go out and buy a specific deck of course you did because what I'm doing I wanted you know Vivid radiant colors I ended up getting the radiant writer weight deck for this project so I also have that right here which the people can't see but you can see so yeah I mean I hear you all the versions I have have her initial sigil at the bottom not not on this radiant wrer weight her signature thing is not on these cards oh that's kind of up actually like to the point where I seriously will like take a picture with my phone and text message like it's not on any of these cards what the hell it is on this other deck they've taken her initial sigil off the card in this version of the deck well I really hate that that's kind of  but for the most part because this artwork is now technically in the public domain people can just make a ride orwe clone or any way they want to so if they're slightly redoing the art I guess they don't have to put her signature on it and certainly if they're reimagining the art even if they're going off of her symbolism I guess they still don't have to put her signature on it but it's kind of I object who do I write I protest we need a petition up we need to have a petition I mean I am trying to call it the Smith weight deck whenever I can because seriously writer dude you're the publisher sit back who are you dude who are you sit down these are not your nachos off it should be the Smith weight deck sure weight is the author absolutely he wrote the book he wrote the definitions some people say that he switched the meanings of the swords and the wands in order to keep non-believers away chew on that for a minute but uh different episode different episode no this is this is definitely the wait Coleman deck in my opinion her name first colan weight the Smith weight deck Smith weight okay I don't know I guess you have to ask her like when is her name hyphenated like is it Coleman Smith should it be the Coleman Smith weight deck or should it be the Smith weight deck it's not hyphenated but Coleman was like it's they have it written like a middle name but it is two last names all right people with two last names would you be the Coleman Smith weight deck or the Smith weight deck or the Coleman weight deck I need to know you know now I've gone down the road before where I had the hyphenated name in the past yes and pain in the ass honestly go go with a maiden name rocket you were born with it keep it she never married so neither of those were a married name that was the name she was born witha Coleman Smith I am so butt hurt that they I can't get over I'm sorry you're trying to move on and I'm so butt hurt that they took her initial sigil off the radiant weight I I am too I wasn't joking about the petition I mean we should definitely write a very Caren letter to them a very caring letter we could get pretty Ken on their asses about that that's kind of ridiculous oh you said Ken I thought you meant caring and I was like no no Ken you met me Karen yes Karen could be your middle name but it's not you're not a Karen there's my for today I'm mad at us game systems now anyway so she never did marry so Coleman Smith is not her hyphenated married name because she never did marry she threw lots of really  cool parties to be honest I wish I had gone to her parties you know when you think back you know how you have these visions of um The Roaring 20s and these Roaring 20s parties yeah I feel like she threw a lot of them yeah me too supposedly there was like a list at the door and you had to sign up to perform when you went into one of her salons I want to be on her list right so she would act out in tell these Jamaican folk tales she would have famous actors and singers and musicians all there performing for the fun of everybody I'm sure the weed and the liquor and the Opium was probably flying imagine though so you got this chick who's half Welsh half Jamaican imagine listening he's not Jamaican I thought her mother was nope it's a rumor her parents were from America her mother's father was the mayor of Brooklyn so that doesn't mean she wasn't Jamaican there's just not a lot of proof that she was and so there's been a lot of controversy about that I mean even when she was alive she kept her identity very ambiguous I think she liked the controversy because they said her dad was Welsh and she and her mom was was Jamaican because I'm thinking what stories think of that Storyteller from everything I can find some people thought she was and so people were saying she was half black and that's why the whole racially ambiguous thing came in because some people say say her mother was Jamaican some people say her mother was white from Brooklyn uh some people say that she was half Japanese who gives a she was a good artist who cares exactly so it it doesn't really matter so nobody really knew so that was part of her Mystique her charm it's almost like she never put in any effort to dispel any of the oh no she leaned into it she leaned into it she dressed wild and yeah yeah she threw these parties she dressed wild she broke conventional Norms she you know she said what she wanted she did what she wanted she never married she did live with a woman for most of her life up until she died yeah for like the last 20 years of her life uh Nora Lake and she wanted everything that she had to go to Nora when she passed away but unfortunately when she passed away she was broke broke ass completely broke and they took everything what a shitty way to end such a rich life and and such an impactful life I mean this poor woman died a damn popper and yet this is the most famous deck on the planet 100 years later like what the hell I don't think at the time she had any idea any idea the impact that she would make on the Pagan World on the tarot reading world because this is what I know this is what we know this is the imagery and the iconography and these are the the words that we know are the meaning of the Smith weight deck not to mention all those Decks that I love and adore and the Decks that I actually use and and are like my my second hand they're all just different pictures based on the writer wa Smith decks based on these images that she you know she took all this esoteric knowledge that she learned in her life that she got from uh AE weight and she channeled it through her synesthesia into this magical beautiful deck that we all adore and you know we're still now discussing the nuances of the different lines and the meaning of all the symbology that she has that's the thing Leila it's not just artwork like this is the most well-known divinatory tool yeah and her version of it is the most well-known divinatory tool how do you die a popper like I don't get that Society suck sometimes it does she did actually kind of reject all the mysticism in her later life and become more of a Christian she got very much into Welsh fairies and fairy knowledge and fairy lore but she became kind of a Christian in her later years and a little bit of a Hermit so she went from all these amazing parties the conversations there can you even imagine about magic and what an aliser Crawley was last weekend and you know did you see what he did holy right and you know what kind of Alchemy and magic and ritual are we going to get up to this weekend and it must have been absolutely amazing and just the art I just picture her with one of those like long cigarette holders right lots of beads and scarves and Harum pants and I was goingon to say but going against the grain of the time and wearing the pants and not the dresses but I I just I don't know this vision of her being just badass being like yeah I'm one of the guys he fought for the vote for women's rights she was loud and she was out there with her ideas and what an amazing artist you know her works are beautiful there are some places that they have shown her work in the past I don't know if any of it is up right now but I do know there's a couple amazing books including Pamela Coleman Smith the Untold Story by R kapan Stewart It's a little pricey saving up for it but it's gorgeous it has a a decent history a decent U biog graphy but its big claim to fame is it has a ton of pictures of her art and her letters and you know just pictures of her she has a painting called the blue cat that um I came across when I was when I was looking into her and there's something about that blue cat that I just love and I was like damn it why didn't she put that on the tarot card right I would love to have some of her artwork how amazing yeah the Whitney Museum of American art did have some of her work up there so you can see some of it there but again a lot of her work was lost because when you know when she died things got taken sold lost destroyed and that's that's pretty sad well and you also have to remember in the prime of her time um we were chugging through not only World War I but World War II and that had an effect on some of the whereabouts of her art and I think that also really did have an effect honestly on her credit or lack thereof from this deck I mean she was she was designing War posters um she was you know like I said she was trying to do the struggle to vote posters I mean and I don't think the war messed up the war messed up her popularity because she had to divert her attention and I do think that the publisher and Arthur both didn't give a I love that you just call him the publisher you won't even name him seriously though the two of them basically were like okay here's your pennies for this art now go away how do we take advantage of this woman to get the art we need exactly they're like go away and we're going to sell this deck and we're going to name it after ourselves because we don't need you screw Rider right seriously to know that they did that to her that just kind of sucks but she passed away September 18th 1951 at the age of 73 and it does suck that we don't have our stuff but this episode is coming out on All Saints Day on All Souls day and what better ancestor to honor than to maybe maybe pull a card for do a little tarot journaling for Pamela Coleman Smith for pixie we're going to post some pictures of her on our socials so that you can see how cool and badass she looks I mean I want to be her friend I wish I had known her she looks like she was a  trip but she also looks like someone I would want to totally like spend a hundred hours talking about the Tarot deck with yeah to go to one of these parties and to talk to her about her artwork and the meaning behind it and you know the meaning of life the universe and everything while we smoke a joint or two how did you come up with the blue cat Pamela and when are we going to get the blue cat Tarot deck next that would be so great but yeah so she is an ancestor that I am definitely honoring on All Souls day today so thank you pixie and I sure as I'll hope that she's like haunting like writers somewhere and I'm like you are you are now known as he who shall not be named that's right you're the publisher ha so yes pick up your Smith weight deck pull a card for the ancestors today and uh honor Pamela Coleman Smith one of our founding Queens one of our founding ladies without her it wouldn't be possible it would not be the same that's for sure I would have 200 plus Decks that have just basically Diamond Spades hearts and clubs on them fun would that be that would not be quite as fun so thank you all so much for listening to this episode of back on the broomstick thank you so much for hanging out with us shell and I very much enjoy your
