welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and it's a tick you know I like my ticks or tick on the wheel that's right it is inul another tick on the wheel of the year or it's about to be inul now this is kind of a part two but not a part two because last week we talked about some like folklore and some you know fun facts about inul now we're going to kind of dive into more rituals and spells and just way ways to celebrate imul ways to honor this sabbath and just some cool  you can do imul is a fire Festival it's a cross quarter day on February 1st or 2nd and we celebrate the goddess breed who is the goddess of smithcraft Midwifery healing crafts she's the goddess of the home and of Hearth now if you didn't catch last week's episode first of all stop that train rewind and go check it out but second of all I just want to readdress for anybody who didn't catch it Lea calls it breed whereas some of you other folks out there might call her Bridget we're all talking about the same person here same one both are correct it's just a pronunciation thing which I ain't want to down pronunciations hell check out every other episode we've ever had I'm the worst at it but I have always heard you call her breed so it's just always been that for me mhm and now Selena Fox herself has a chant where she calls upon bright blessings from bridgid so if Selena says Bridget well we love Selena Fox so oh yeah so if it's good enough for her breed or Bridget either one is fine yeah I just wanted to point that out so people weren't confused on what you were talking about she is originally a goddess she has also been kind of co-opted as a saint and she is one of the patron saints of Ireland so she is very important figure there where she is a goddess of fire and of the Sacred Wells you know what the hell is with this being a fire Festival this is the last damn time of the year I want to be outside just saying like the bonfire thing I feel you I enjoy bonfires I love fire but it is February For the Love of All Things warm yeah not going outside this time of year either but it is a great time to have little bonfires in your house or at the very least candles yeah in every room of your house it's the best time for that and that's actually one good way to honor breed to honor your home to honor impul is to set a candle in each room of your house and then on imoke go through and light each of those candles and say a small blessing to breed to the season of spring to Renewal and to bring those energies into your home and just by lighting a candle in every room that can be a ritual in and of itself you know I don't like sticking with tradition I'm a weirdo like that but I always used pale candles this time of year like a pale pink a white a pale blue I don't know if it's just cuz that was what was left over from the holiday season I don't know but like I don't know it just seems like always paler colors do you notice that is that a thing I do and I think it's kind of like flowers under the snow you know the colors are are really light they're really pale there are some flowers snow crocuses yeah the white snow crocuses anytime you look up inbook you're going to see those crocuses coming up out of the snow that light purple color you know the pink almost oara colors but spring colors but muted a little bit not as vibrant I don't think as vibrant as Easter colors Easter colors are more vibrant in my mind yeah think spring colors covered in snow yeah yeah this is a really good time of year like shelle said nobody wants to go outside and have a big bonfire well maybe you do I don't know that could be fun and kind of warm but a lot of us like to stay in we kind of hibernate we're in our homes we're cozy we're cooking good food speaking of cozy and good food I want to throw out there I love tea I love tea all year generally I I don't drink a whole ton of hot tea in the summer so this is like my hot tea season me too I am a fan of Earl gry tea I don't know why I think it's that English and Welsh DNA I got in me or something but I love me some Earl Gray you always just wanted to be English royalty I know I am a princess don't doubt that it's true so here in Salem there's a local shop that I love so much that makes uh what they call the Salem fog which is a version of the London Fog and I like to drink a little drink that I had found online a moon or two ago called the imul fog oh what's the imul fog so still you're starting with that Earl Gray base because basically the London Fog if you come here to to Salem and get the Salem fog it's still that Earl Gray base but what this has in it much like the Salem fog it's got lavender but this also you put Rosemary in it as well it's basically like lavender and rosemary tea latte and then because I just don't have the skill in ability CU as you can attest for me not a cooker never been you can froth the milk I just don't know how to do such a thing or have such a device to do that so I just warm it in a pan good enough I mean I need a milk frother people but yeah so you know the warm milk or the froth milk you need to get the lavender syrup I mean Could you actually steep lavender leaves in with the earl gray hell yeah you could lavender syrup is a little more 2024 not going to lie but the Rosemary on the other hand I don't think you can find rosemary syrup not that I've looked for it but I don't think you can find that doesn't sound very common like if you kind of crack the Rosemary and kind of get that oil into the tea you know what I'm saying and just kind of let that float in there I mean you can you know let it steep in there for a few minutes and dig it out but why not give it a go and drink it with it in there that's what I do I love that because not only do you have the earl gray and the milk which is great for this time of year because inul is when the she dairy products are like a big symbol of this whole thing that's right that's right and then you've got the oak gray with the milk and then you put in your lavender which is another spring flour and then add in Rosemary which is sacred to breed so that's perfect and then like with any other tea obviously you can you know do your sugar or your honey which also relate back to imul as well not to mention I like sweeten tea me too okay so I also have a recipe but mine was for coffee yeah nobody likes coffee Lea oh I do love coffee I like coffee do not email me people people please do not email me and tell me about how coffee is great because first of all you will never get to agree and and we just can't be arguing about coffee and tea here that's okay you can email me cuz I love the coffee love the tea but take your coffee whatever kind you like and put a little bit of cinnamon in with the coffee grounds before you brew your coffee it'll give it a nice little flavor a little bit of a kick and cinnamon represents the Sun and you know everybody's been doing those cinnamon blows on the first of the month right or a cinnamon throw or a cinnamon throw if you're a shell why not put that cinnamon in the grounds of your coffee on IM on the oh no and it's on the first you're like double duty in the cinnamon oh you're a genius Lea thank you thank you yes I am and then so after you brew the coffee put in your heavy cream again milk to symbolize the season cream for its richness I like the sweet cream I'm not going to lie the sweet cream is topnotch put a little bit of honey in there because you know in the spring the hives are going to start to be active bees represent industriousness sweetness after work of rewards so put that honey in there to sweeten the Seas and stir it with intention stir your tea your imul fog tea or your imul coffee with intention while you're mixing it together and that's a little spell in and of itself that you then take into you so you're bringing those energies into yourself see I look at this as like I don't know how to best describe it like the most quiet holiday um the most reflective and I don't know if that's because I never really went out to like Greater Community rituals for imul because they don't like being cold or if it was just the vibe but this is just such a quiet reflective time where you are going to Cozy up on the couch wrapped in a blanket drinking some badass hot tea and you know it's kind of that snuggle in time still but as much as it's snuggle in time in your mind you're like all right I got a couple weeks and then I'm G be outside doing this I'm going to be planting these seeds I'm going to be doing this work outside whatever the case may be for you not only are you germinating seeds that you want to sew in such later in the year but you're also kind of germinating your creative seeds what are you looking to become this next year like we said in our last episode I think you mentioned the image of being within the womb of the earth kind of being you know like a bear I love that image to this holiday yeah yeah and we all kind of feel that you know after the rest of hustle and bustle of the holidays this is a great time to go within plus the weather's crap in a lot of the United States and so it's really nice to like you said kind of snuggle in and be quiet but we're also that spark of beginning that anticipation that energy that's kind of coiled up like a seed and ready to burst out you're still hunkered down but you see the light at the end of the tunnel finally exactly you're like that coiled snake ready to spring or your the seedling inside the seed ready to burst forth the egg ready to hatch quiet but strength Gathering somebody said it I can't remember who said it or where I heard it somebody said it was uh akin to like the slowly uncoiling kinetic energy of Reawakening life and I really liked that that slowly uncoiling idea you know kinetic energy stored energy right now seeds are such an important symbol of this holiday and one of the rituals that people would traditionally do on imul is to consecrate their tools any kinds of tools your Smith craft tools if you just so happen to be a Smith I know a couple but they can be your garden tools it could be the seeds and your gardening tools they could be be your alter tools definitely should be your alter tools your crafting tools you know your work could be your computer whatever tools that you use in your daily life this is a wonderful time to cleanse them ritually magically and bless them and consecrate them to your work for the coming year it's also a good time for initiations I don't want to say maybe commitment ceremon isn't the best thing but sometimes you're trying to commit yourself to a project or an idea good time for that this is not resolutions I swear to God but you know just kind of that time to do some sort of initiative thing yeah because again it is that stored energy so if you're going to start projects what what greater time to start it than when everything's set to like spring forward so let's talk alter pieces here because I know everybody's like well what do I need first of all you really don't need anything let's start there um but if you do need something this would be a good time I know you're biging the money Bowl thing right now yep burning one right now a bowl of milk is what I've put not a bowl it's not like I put out some big hankerin but like some tiny little dish honestly I drive my cats crazy but just like a little you know a little tiny dish of milk like I said the pale candles is another thing lots of candles I know I say this about every holiday but it's also a season for divination especially fire scrying you mentioned having a bowl or a small you know thing of milk on the altar you can also have a bowl of fire you could and you should have lots of candles you can have your corn dolly to represent breed you can have your breeds crossed they're super easy to make i' I've actually had an egg not recently this was several years back um but I had put an egg on the altar at this time of year the other really great thing is especially if you're going to put a lot of candles on your altar I mean definitely use fire safety but if you put a shallow dish of water near the candles not only is water also sacred to breed but you can use the reflection of the fire in the water to do your fire scrying and this is a traditionally a time when people would do fire scrying for the coming year but honestly folks please practice safe fire scrying as Smoky the Bear says only you can prevent fires here uh be careful and yes it's a fire holiday but don't be set and a blaze I do have a spell a sacred flame candle spell I know I love it whenever you dig out your old books of Shadows and I did you dig out something I did I happened to gra see imul for me we were just talking about not going to our big Community Gathering rituals on imul and and I know I've said in the past that in the winter time our community would go indoors usually to the local YuYu church and I was big on going to those rituals as well not necessarily always for inul that's cuz we were always getting together for your birthday right I had other things to do with my birthday it's cold I probably wasn't up to peopling so I would usually do imul solitary so I looked up in my book of shadows to see what I had done for past imul and I found a spell uh it's a fire scrying spell I called it the sacred flame candle spell and basically you take three five or seven candles I'm sure I had some sort of magical reason for picking those numbers of course you did three for the triple goddess three five and seven are very often sacred so the more the marrier but only what you can safely burn I like to put them in a cauldron again the big round cauldron is is symbolic of a pregnant belly which is perfect for imul and a safe thing to burn stuff in take the candles and you can dress them with like an inul oil or any type of blessing oil and then on each candle inscribe them with sigils or with runes or with a wish or a word something that you want to bring into your life or something that you want to grow for the coming year and do that for each one and then place them in your cauldron and then put a shallow dish of water near the candles light all the candles at once and then use that to scry in the water and the candles will send that energy out and the water will reflect that and you can kind of look in the water reflection and do your fire divination right there okay I'm about to make up a divination method right here on the spot so check couldn't you do the same thing using a bowl of milk and basically do milk scrying oh I I don't know I don't see why not did I just create a new divination method for ulk but do you follow me here you follow me couldn't you actually use the milk for scrying why the hell not I don't see why not oh my God I'm gonna try this I'm gonna try it too why not I mean that would be kind of cool I think it's mostly your intuition anyway right it just seems more appropriate than a bowl of water I mean it's a damn Dairy holiday for God's sake we should be scrying in milk that just I don't know it makes sense to me hey I'm I'll try it I'll try pretty much anything once I'll try it if anybody out there tries milk scrying let me know back on the broomstick gmail.com we want to hear your experiences with fire milk scrying now um so speaking of dressing candles one of the things that you can do now for your year is to get a bunch of candles not that I've ever done this before but you can get your candles for the year and bless all of magical candles at this time to use in spellwork and ritual for the rest of the year there's no way I would have been that organized just putting that out there there's no way I had enough money to spend on worth of candles up front but if you do or if you happen to grab a whole bunch of them on sale or just lucky enough to have them imul is the best time to bless your candles to use magically for the year now let me ask you this do you use a special imul bless in oil or just your normal what you normally used all year around for every other thing yes you can use both I do have an imul oil that I use again from my old Book of Shadows I'll give it to you quickly but I'll also put it in the show notes if anyone wants to use it but any old oil will work you know your favorite oil your favorite perfume whatever you like is going to be just fine to dress your candles with like shell always says it's your intention more than what you're using the Magic's in you more than it is in the oil so anyway this recipe is basically a couple tablespoons of you could just use olive oil from your kitchen doesn't last very long it's not going to have a long shelf life but it's easy to find we usually have it and olives are associated with this time of year so it's great choice for imul to that you're going to add about five drops of lavender essential oil four drops of Rosemary essential oil hey that sounds like my tea right I was thinking that too when you mentioned it but those are great for purification Clarity peace healing represent breed and then I also like to add a few drops of orange essential oil to represent the sun's energy and then frankincense for spiritual connection oh my God I should try some orange peel in my tea and see if the orange and the Rosemary and the lavender why not why the hell not that sounds kind of delicious actually I'm always up for citrus and I'm going to try it I'm I'm going to try add an orange to it what is it with that we're just like lots of renewal here all sorts of new things we're going to try how you know why you know why because it's the imul episode that's right it it's just flowing we're just going to be crafting everything trying new things honoring breed that way exactly yeah so yeah you can uh dress them with that oil and then have them for the rest of the year I do love that idea and I'm gonna I'm going to kind of ask a question slash pull a story out of yeah okay so I see this online a lot and it's very relevant to what you what you were just talking about people will ask how long does quote unquote magic last so if I make if I make a oil a magical oil how long is that still got that quote unquote magic you know what's the expiration date um and so you were talking about dressing candles a year in advance you know it imul ing all your candles for the year do you feel that the magic Fades as the year goes on I I want to hear your thoughts on that and then I want to talk about some candles that you're currently using that you dressed 100 years ago personally I feel that if you dress your candles a year ahead of time they're going to last and be just as magical can that fluctuate I mean could you do something kind of flippant and it it just Fades yes magical energy is like a lot of other other energies think of it like these blessing oils when you put the blessing oil on the candle it's going to smell very strongly you're going to smell it and that can be more activating and over time it'll lessen kind of like the magic you know the stronger the oil the longer it will last but for the most part in Magic because you put that oil on there whether you can smell it or not the energy of that oil and your intention has blended with that candle and it's there so for the most part I think it just lasts if you make Moon water and you have that Moon water a year later it's still Moon water it might be less potent because you know water evaporates herbs dry up and Decay oils break down so some things will change but it's still going to hold the magic and I know you're going to ask me about the candle so talk to me about this candle what Shell's referring to is a candle that I sent her a picture of that she and I had created in ritual space about 20 years ago we were in charge of the fire portion of the belain ritual and so the day before the ritual in our big Community we headed up a workshop about fire and in that Workshop we had candles oils we had ribbons to represent fire and we built a fire the people who participated in the ritual we did chanting we did drumming we danced around this little fire we all charged these candles and these ribbons together the idea was that this fire energy this passion this success this energy to move forward was all bound together we tied knots to hold the Magic in these candles and as part of the spell we said that anytime any one of the candles was burned it would activate the energy for every other person who had a candle I never felt the time was right to burn mine but I kept it along with my Al I think I burned mine a good 20 years ago it just it was one of those things that I could feel its energy as it sat on my Altar and it just wasn't time yet to burn it until just recently I started burning it about Ule in 2023 and then as part of one of our TR It episodes in January I created a money Bowl So I dressed a candle to be in the money bowl and I have been using my special Fire magic candle from 20 years ago to light the money Bowl candle and so I had showed shell that and she was shocked that I still had that candle but the energy is very potent and I can feel the magic you know as I work with it it's very nice to light the money bowl with that special candle and it it feels really good I just I just know that that's a burning question for a lot of people like is there a quote unquote expiration date you know like I do I do a lot of spell jars and I still got some lying around that are a year or two old for what they were made for they feel just as potent as when they were made but that's a long ass time to keep a candle like I'm proud of you just for the the longevity well yeah it just it was just one of those things I guess it just didn't seem it was never quite the right time and I guess I was waiting till now till back on the broomstick you know here we are doing another project together and it finally felt right so I think that's kind of proof that the magic can last in something it it's going to depend on how much energy you put into it how much intent you put into it but for the most part it's going to last so I think really you know the main takeaways are you want to definitely be honoring yourself and kind of honoring the things that you've gone through and the things that you've been through and challenges you've overcome to kind of get you to that point where now that you're back hunkered down underground you're ready to springboard out you know literally spring out so you know you want to you want to kind of make your ritual practice right now make your spellwork practice kind of with the thought of that emerging energy or on the brink of emerging that potential energy you know like I said germinating your creative self your creative seeds yeah nurturing yourself yeah and and and maybe depending on your fun pastimes maybe you take germinating literal maybe if you're a gardener or a horticulturist now is a good time to start getting some of those seeds prepped and ready to be planted outdoors and I just love that it's kind of that time where you still are all cozied up but you know that the end is near yeah you can feel that reemerging sun and that R strengthening sun and before we close up I want to mention one other ritual that's very near and dear to both of our hearts not that we love cleaning but Broms are sacred Bas homes are sacred to breed and she is the goddess of Hearth and Home so you can sweep out your house use your magical broom or use your regular broom and sweep out the old and make room for the new you know hang your brooms or refresh the Broom the cinnamon broom that you got for Ule refresh that maybe with some Rosemary or some lavender maybe I'll throw my cinnamon broom out the door maybe that'll work my cinnamon well don't PE most people get rid of them this time of year anyways so yeah toss that sucker out the door or refresh it yeah that would work but yeah brooms and bomes are sacred this time of year you could create one which would be even better to honor the crafting of breed to me brooms are sacred all year a same so thank you
