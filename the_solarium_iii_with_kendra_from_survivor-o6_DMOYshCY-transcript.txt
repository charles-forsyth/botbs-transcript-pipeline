we sip on our our tea and I smoke on this delicious rose petal joint tell them tell them tell them shell and I are old school from day one huge fans of Survivor the television show I feel like if I was a singer I would do their little intro you know the little wow you hit that that was nice right you did good there I remember in in in just a little backstory I had a a we little apartment back in season 1 episode one days of Survivor and Lila would come to my apartment every week we'd have a Survivor watch party and like we were hardcore we were hardcore fans I mean there was a time when I was going online scouring trying to like spoil every episode we were into it for a minute you'd send me messages you'd like I got a spoiler do you want to hear it and sometimes I'd say yes sometimes I'd say no but you yeah we we were we were in it we were in we had plans to be the first witches on Survivor didn't happen how does that relate to today's salarium Lea do tell well not just because we're super Survivor fans but this past season of Survivor season 45 did actually feature the very first witch on Survivor and I fell in love even though it was straight love now I love this person this person is so vibrant and full of energy and in such a positive force but I'm still jelly that it wasn't us me too but I absolutely loved watching her we are of course talking about Kendra ruthless from Survivor 45 and better or better wise known as the official Survivor astrologist oh yeah she's got an amazing new business called happy to be here that we'll talk about later but before we get too far into what she's doing now let's welcome to back on the broomsticks Solarium [Music] Kendra for this episode shell and I are thrilled to welcome to the show a witch who is also a world traveler a Tarot reader and not just an astrologer but she was actually called the astrologer of the hit TV show Survivor by Jeff propes for the most recent Survivor season 45 that ended this past December she was my favorite contestant I was rooting for you girl she's an allaround badass Kendra Ruth welcome to the show Kendra hello welcome Kendra oh my gosh thank you so much I am so happy to be here with y'all um especially as like I don't want to say this for sure but I think I might be the first like out witch to be on Survivor I think you are I think are yeah let's go we've been fans since season 1 we used to have episode one y yep we used to have watch parties at her apartment and we would plan on how to get on the show we were so thrilled to see a witch on the show when I saw you come up I said to my daughter I'm like she's a witch I know it and you're like hey clock in my witchy Vibe I was so happy and you just continue to Thrill us for the entire season so thank you for that oh my gosh thank you so much for saying that that was truly I mean the whole experience is the greatest experience of my life um but yeah it was um really funny because now I think with season 46 coming up not that we want to talk about them too much because like we're still talking about 45 because the house and it's still about me um no but with like all these they're like oh like I'm a Leo or there's like a guy who's like really into astrology and like online it's kind of gotten tra action of like the Kendra effect which like if I'm known as the AST Survivor astrology lady like I think I'm doing something right in life I'm like this is all I've ever wanted amazing I was loving that for you when Jeff said that at the season finale and you just jumped right up and owned that you were just like yes yes I am the astrologer I loved that for you I thought that was such a cool moment now at that you had said that you called the season showmance between D and Austin that you had seen that before it even happened can you tell us about that a little bit absolutely so I am like pretty in tune to like other people's emotions their feelings whatever and like I'm a Libra I know how to like pick up on this especially like drama and so um I I remember when we were at camp and Austin was like talking about de and I can kind of see a sparkle in his eyes and I was like okay I'm not going to like obviously say anything about it but then merge happened and you know at that time it wasn't really shown but I was working I was working with the Bellow girls kind of as a potential Alliance moving forward I was really looking to Austin Drew and Emily from a new Bellow and we were working together you know to the extent that I believe we were working together I think a little bit more with me and Emily we were working together but I would say that I remember pulling Drew and Emily to the side almost daily um being like are we worried about this DN awestin thing they're like Kendra what do you mean this DN awestin thing I'm like what do you mean this DN aw thing I could really just tell that they had um a Vibe and that they like Pro like and they're both beautiful I'm like how are these two beautiful non sing I mean beautiful this season everyone's beautiful oh my God for sure such a hot cast but like how do these two single people you know not on the same Tri you could see the energy flowing between them for sure absolutely it was like so obvious to me so when people like weren't really believing me or like being like Oh I don't know I don't know I'm like how are they're going to take each other to the end I remember saying that to Drew and Emily and you were so right you called that one right from the beginning yeah now Kendra I have a question you had this this Vision or or premonition what have you of of the typical on show romance did you do any sort of divination or any sort of magic prior to going on Survivor other than having this vision of this this show man oh really great question um really great question so I dabble with I mean not dabble I'm I'm super into astrocartography and so um I realized that my Jupiter line my Jupiter MC line was going right through Fiji and I was like oh my gosh what a amazing opportunity especially to have an opportunity like this where I'm on stage I'm going to be broadcast like all that MC jupiterian energy and I'm a Jupiter rolled person myself and so I I just did a lot of um Jupiter I just was calling in that abundance and like knew while I was there also to like lean into that Jupiter energy CU like I definitely have a different side of myself that I didn't really lean into on the show so much which I call like if I ever go back on any type of show I'm going back to my villain era like um that would be fun but I really wanted to lean into like this Jupiter happy go-lucky fun energy also to like seem less um intimidating um and so yeah just working with Jupiter working with a lot of like Rosemary like sun Jupiter herbs um and just a lot of manifestation I am a pretty quick manifestor uh my cousin always said says who's like you know we got into like our witch witchiness together she always says if you had any real superpower it would be the power of manifestation because you can just like say something and it'll end up in your hand the LA your lap the next day that's what you have to be careful with 100% And so yeah that was I would say just working with the energies of Jupiter nice now a follow-up question to that is did you do any magic or ritual while you were in Fiji I mean how could you not there's got to be times where you like walked away from the camera walked away from the tribe did you do anything there um so I was trying to just do very subtle things um because I think magic is not always like a big ritual or anything like I really use it like just practically in my day-to-day life but something that was so important for me to do um is like every after we got back from every single challenge I would go into the water by myself because I always got a little nervous going away by myself um of having like that paranoia energy of like oh what's she up to so I always wanted to be visible when I was doing this so I could have a clear conscience about it but I would do a like basically a washing ritual like a cleansing ritual with the like not only just cleaning myself but like energetically with the water every single day except for the day I got voted out except for the day oh wow ironic ironic and I literally was kicking myself like I was like I didn't go in the water that's like because it really helped me get I'm so just like you know sensitive to other people so really just going out there alone I love the water I'm such a fish going out there and just doing like a full body just like little raiki over myself um just to clear my head and like Imagining the salt water just like brushing away um like any like paranoia or like getting my just getting my head and my body into the right space to like make decisions moving forward in Tribal Council I love that you also had to balance that with you can't be away too long or people are going to get suspect what she canot even there's that Survivor element of that too absolutely which is why I wanted to be visible like I went to the beach like straight in front of everyone like I would wait for other people to get cleaned off and like leave and just have my a alone time because I needed aone time out there and like that was where I got it without having that lingering what's she doing right is she off looking for an idol in in the jungle now going along with that I am not surprised that you needed a moment to to Center and to cleanse yourself because you looked like you gave it your all you looked like you loved every single second of that competition and you enjy to watch and we loved it you went hard in those challenges you were an amazing competitor just to see that spirit and how much Joy you brought to those was wonderful as someone who loves this game to see how you grabbed on to that and went for it was beyond brilliant loved it I loved it thank you so much my favorite competition however now I'm a competitive gal and I love to see you go hard but my favorite competition was the old school survivor auction that one oh yeah you made me cry woman you you bid on that beer and pretzels and you won that and you said that was for your biological dad and we learned about that side of you in that story and I hope this is okay to talk about um absolutely I cried shell cried when we watched it together we because it was so touching to see that moment with you guys and so what was that like for you to to Cheers your dad from there and and to to have that moment tell us about that wow just seeing the beer like knowing that I was in the mid-range of money and so I really needed to act soon so I had a vote and so I was and like I was like I don't give it I don't care what it is I'm throwing my money out there it could be a bowl of worms like really don't care and then it being a beer um and I didn't really make the connection until I you know held the beer and I was just like this is just like it like literally just made me think of my dad and he was such a driving force for me out there he's super competitive like didn't really get to watch me play Sports growing up so it really just like hit home and I was just like it took me by surprise it really did cuz I wasn't expecting like me holding a beer I don't really drink that much anymore like I was drunk off oh my God I was so drunk off that one beer um but yeah that was such an incredible moment for me and just to like share about that and then like obviously so many things happening you don't know what's going to be shown on TV and so when that came up my dad just like called me was like sweetheart that was perfect like I love you so much and like just knowing that he's such a so competitive such an athlete like such a warrior spirit and like it was so so special to like make that connection out there and just have it be really like authentic the way that story was brought you know what I mean like I was definitely just like really thinking about him and he was I just wanted to make him proud and I know no matter what I did would make him proud but I wanted to win it for him and like oh gosh yeah for that like moment for him to have with me because we didn't we haven't had a lot of big moments because we haven't known each other for so long that was a big moment that that was a moment that touched PE I mean it touched us I'm sure it touched a lot of people that was such a cool moment to have with him and to see your child as a Survivor fan you know to see your child do that how freaking cool that was just that was a fun moment to watch cool so I'm glad to see it was equally cool yeah he was so soed and I was stoked you know I had a fan girl moment because I was like oh my God there's a picture of her and her dad from the leaning tower of pizza so I had a I had a nostalgic root one moment myself with it yeah that's where we met actually I met him at that Prince of pizza when I was 18 years old so anytime anytime I go home we both like we always meet up at Prince of pizza and we each pretty much eat a whole pizza and always froming is so that's like our that's like our staple yeah that is very cool nice all right so now one last question about Survivor and then I want to talk more about your travel and your tarot and astrology and so my last question is what moment stood out to you as like the moment where you were really like holy I'm on Survivor like was there a moment that just it really struck you that wow I'm here or was it just all like that oh my gosh I would say it's like all like that but like that initial moment of like getting up on the barge and like going to the marooning it's like so overwhelm and you'll hear like Survivor players talk about this is like that first moment where you just met with like hundreds of cameras and you see the whole crew there and you're just like this is actually happening and like then Jeff is talking he's asking all these questions and you're just like can you let me soak it in for a minute because like this is like a lot Jeff I don't know if you know this and and it probably doesn't stop after that it just keeps coming I bet yeah I I need to know is Jeff as cool in person as he is on TV he's so cool I love it he's also so intimidating like that I like call they didn't show I love it I love it I was like you're I was like I don't know when your birthday is but you're giving like fullon Scorpio Jeff during like the the like how' you know and I was like go piercing eyes and you're just so like mysterious and like intense it's just if you're not a Scorpio I quit astrolog it so funny and then he's like I am I was like like could smell you coming from a mile away that's why Jeff dubbed you the Survivor astrologer yes yes and he um I would say another moment that was just like so real I mean obviously your first Tribal Council what um and then I would say like winning that first competition and getting back to a camp and being actually I didn't even get back to Camp I went to Lulu but when get back to like when you're celebrating with your tribe for the first time and you like win you know you're safe from Tribal Council oh that's when it felt so real like I was just like I we're freaking doing it like me and Jake all the time would just be like we're on Survivor what is this it was really like a 247 like oh my gosh like I cannot believe this is real and this is very real and like we gotta like I got to figure this out yes and you tried I loved seeing you try to bring the girl group together to to bring things together and your ally got voted out you tried you played a really good game I was very impressed it was fun to watch so thank you it's sometimes I don't I don't feel like it's perceived like that because I am kind of like shown as this kooky character but like I was playing hard you know what I mean like I was trying like I was trying my best to figure it out and I was yeah sending it full sense for looks like you enjoying every second what we would all hope to do if we got so lucky to be survivors just enjoy every second abely absolutely every single second I did not have a moment of like not having a good time out there even the bad times are kind of good they're at least memorable yeah I'm like oh this is this bad on Survivor like like nobody's calling me I don't have to clock in work this is great so like can I I was like can I just stay here like I'll just be the welcoming committee just give me some rice like I'll be fine like I'm fine I'd be down with that I'd be down for that anytime anytime now after seeing your Instagram I'm not surprised you say that sign me up like I was down to sleep on bamboo for long it's could be rice I'm chill when I first saw you on Survivor the second thing I said after I said she's a witch was I would love to ask her to be on the podcast and so I grew some balls and I looked you up and I found your Instagram and just fell in love with everything you were saying there even more than I already was and I just love your nomadic spirit so I'm not surprised that you would be the Survivor welcome committee because you seem like you could be at home anywhere that's what your website happy to be here that's the whole vibe that that gives is you're very welcoming and opening to new challenges and that you want to bring other people Along on this beautiful Adventure that you find yourself in what a cool concept and what an amazing Vibe so tell us a little bit about what you offer there and and what you do absolutely happy to be here is oh my gosh it's like years and years and years in the making and I've just always struggled with like impostor syndrome and Survivor was really like a catalyst for me to be like I yeah nobody could say to me anymore I was on Survivor like literally like leave me alone I can do whatever I want to do in this life and like I've already always embodied that but like there's something about I mean I can see it in my birth chair I know what's going on but there's something about like being seen that is just such a core wound for me Chiron and Leo in the Eighth House hello um and I just have always had a lot of imposter syndrome about it and Survivor just like the confidence I got from that and like just it being a catalyst for me to just be like I'm just gonna do what I'm here to do and happy to be here it came from just something I would always say like even when was hard like has been so hard gosh like like being a human is super super difficult um and I would always just say you know what but at the end of the day I'm just happy to be here like I'm happy for the struggle like I see how interconnected like the struggle is into my growth I see how interconnected pain is to my joy like I see all the Pathways in which like everything can transmute and transform and like everything is always changing and that's beautiful yes and so happy to be here I felt like having that name as my um business name was just like a tip of the hat to Life's experience es and like using tarot and using astrology and like my spiritual practices and my spiritual self has really just like grounded me into this daily gratitude um and self-standing and just getting to know myself and having that that True North Point within me and just knowing that yeah like life can suck but I'm still happy to be here and like let's talk about the inherent struggle and like let's use them to you know feel them like 100% feel them but like also how can we transmute this or what's the pattern happening here and so oh my gosh my readings have been going so freaking amazing I am like overflowing with just like feeling so fulfilled and feeling so in my like in my purpose doing them that yeah I just you know I want to help Empower people to feel through the bad like the hard and the bad things and all those things but also it's like we all have a reason to be happy to be here you know and like that reason can be ourselves and like the more we learn about ourselves and the more we learn to love ourselves and I use astrology as a tool for like you know understanding and self-compassion and Grace and having Grace for ourselves and trusting ourselves and like the more integrated we are into our true selves like the brighter we shine and the more we can see the good in the world around us so yeah just knowing ourselves helps us you know go through this world a little bit easier and it's not a it's not an easy thing to do to know oneself but it is a amazing journey it can be such a lifelong struggle for people and you just glow and resonate with like you said True North I can see that in you I can see that star and I can see you being a guide for people so I think you have truly found your calling in this and I'm just so excited for you and the blessings that you're bringing for other people with that now as someone who has read tarot in the past and worked with people I know that just like when you were on Survivor finding those moments where you can ground yourself and cleanse yourself and kind of come back to that Center are so important do you have any daily rituals or anything like that that you do to for self-care with being such an out and open person yeah I mean I spent spend a lot of time alone um I always am just you know stretching just being in my body um but I think a big part of like my daily ritual of like cleansing is just like sit it like lately I used to I used to have a lot of different like modalities and tools and like a strict schedule and routines that I did every day but honestly um especially since being living in the jungle now like in My Little freaking cabin um I just like taking a moment watching the water watch like listening to the the wind blow and just like feeling deeper into nature just being surrounded by Nature really helps cleanse me and like yeah I just spend a lot of time alone I just I drink a lot of tea and I sit and I don't do anything like that is a lot of what brings me a lot of like cleansing and Clarity just space like having space for myself and just being super super present in the moment I think is something that instead of like worrying about this or thinking about a reading or whatever it's just like presence Stillness breath and appreciation um has really just been like a very simple way for me to ground lately and it's it's really great I think that is so beautiful that's something that that shell and I are big on is simple you don't need to have elaborate at the right time or all the tools just like you said being present in your body and acknowledging your breath and just being there in your own space can be such a powerful moment such a powerful ritual for yourself yeah it all can be fixed with a cup of tea is what I always say that's what I say too I am I drink so much tea I am I I'm just a tea I'm mad for tea I love it it helps me ground and it soothes me and you know of course like depends on what you put in your tea and just yeah tea ritual is definitely like a really big part of my day-to-day life and I also think it's important to not for anyone who's like oh I want to get more in touch with my spiritual side I want to like get deeper into magic it's like magic in the mundane is such a big part of my life and like just finding little things it's just all about bringing attention to things and like it doesn't have to I mean sometimes I like to do a full ceremony and something that's been really a amazing medicine for me in the past month and through my life but just like as a maybe weekly ritual is um cacao and Rose so Brewing um a cup of caca it's just super hard opening makes me oh my gosh cry every time I drink it and um it's just like a deep connection to Mother Nature and and selflove and just opening up my heart and knowing that like our heart frequency like I'm just surrounded by so much nature and just like connecting with that has just been so so vital for me so I would say like my weekly ritual is like a a mini cacao ceremony sometimes in community sometimes myself depends on the week but that's been such a big thing for me as far as like a medicine and a ritual that I've been doing lately yeah now other than the cacao and Rose are there any tea Blends that you in particular like is there anything that you that your goto Shell's an Earl Gray girl I love Earl Gray i' like I'm just really into there's like a there's a farm down the road that makes that their homemade chai so that has been like super just like warming for my system cuz it's actually been kind of chilly here like even though I'm in Hawaii like why am I bundled up right now yeah I love love love like a really good chai like cardamom is just one of especially being like a p Constitution and ayurvedic medicine like having cooling herbs is super important for my internal system um and so cardamom is just like my besy so like cardamom and rose tea is also another favorite I usually do like cardamom Rose and then maybe like a little bit of like colula in there as like or chamomile as a filler but cardamom rose tea has been I would say my go to and you can drink it creamy you can drink it black it's like such another heart opening thing uh heart opening um medicine that I love love love love love and it just gives me this like feeling of just like it's almost like ethereal like I love Rose roses just like people like roses are overrated I'm like roses don't get enough like oh it's just the ultimate it's so good yes I am the same I am a big fan of rose hips in might te and rose petals with my weed it's some of my favorite ways to get in touch and just Z Rose Mullen a little bit of Yerba Santa and cannabis in a a joint um I've been really enjoying I've been off the Cannabis as of recently like maybe like a week um just because I'm on my Neptune line in Hawaii here and I'm already so heavy like don't need to get more there no and I want to use it like here as a medicine for when I need it um so just changing up my relationship with it because I just I mean I love cannabis like literally forever and always I was like okay we get beer on these rewards can I just get a doobie like God yall are driving me crazy I will live for the first time that happens that would be so great that would be so I better be there and just like bringing out like a tray of munchies like that as a reward just like here's a doobie between like pick two people to split it with and like nobody from my cat oh it would have been Caleb it just would have been me and oh me Caleb and coutur yeah i' been like y'all come with me I would have spent $900
