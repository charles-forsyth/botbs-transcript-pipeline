welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and today we're going to be getting out the herbal witch in all of us that magic potion Queen The Elixir the loose incense the potions the powders the herbs this has totally been my Jive for like 30 years I have been like this incense making wizard this herbal remedy Queen like this has been my jam and and I'm I'm excited to talk about this because I love herbs um I love making interesting potions with them and yeah I think this is going to be a fun topic as long as I have known you shell you have been the herb witch yep you had the shelves and shelves of labeled jars of all sorts of different potions and leaves and stems and powders and no one owns more mason jars full of stuff than I do I'm pretty sure sticks and dried leaves all abound at Shell's house and you were very fond of giving them away I think I still have like the last little bits of a loose incense you made back in the day or you would make bath salts before bath bombs were a thing and I loved getting those as gifts because it was always a personalized blend of oils and herbs that you would use for each person in the coven or each person that was close to you that was my favorite part was seeing what different herbs you had chosen for me for that particular gift one thing when when I'm gifting a herbal concoction my problem is is I make too much you're getting like a pint Mason Jar full of and I'm like wow that's going to take them seven years to use well here you go so one thing I do I've always had a problem with this portion control probably my first tip with doing anything with herbs who cares about how much you're making there's never too much never never too much and I'm going to come in on the other side as The Frugal witch and say a pinch you'll do just fine most of the time if you're putting together an incense I would do them just a small batch just enough for that little half of a charcoal in the loose incense burner I put more lavender and stuff than that amount geez you and I are Polar Opposites on on portions yes and I'm a big a big believer also in that a little bit is just as representative of the energy of an herb is a large amount there's so many different types of incenses out there I mean you walk into a grocery store and you can buy stick incense from all over the world not just the cheap crappy knockoffs why would someone want to blend their own incense or use loose incense instead of all the nice little cones and sticks that are out there before I answer that I am going to say there nothing replaces the blue and red box sag Champa that like nothing replaces like you cannot tear me away from that n Champa I am the same I am a nagchampa witch myself it lives in a special part in my soul right right aside from that who knows who made it in the grocery store probably some mass production factory it was probably made by robots somewhere if I am making loose incense I am able to a make it however I want however amount I want whatever intentions and that that's the big thing what intentions am I going to you know I could quote unquote cleanse and and reint incense sticks from the store but if I have the ability to create that magic from the get-go myself that is my preference but I am not negating incense from the store um in any way because trust me I've used them more often than than I care to admit but it's easier for me to put 100% of my magical intentions into something that I am creating because I've also created the stick incense so it's it's really comes down to intention and not necessarily method of burn I love that you brought up both of those that you can buy stick incense that was mass manufactured by somebody making minimum wage in Idaho and make that just as magical as incense that you have created however what we're talking about today is that you can boost your practice that it's easier like you said to get into the mindset of this incense is sacred maybe you have to work with it for a minute but if you've created that incense you've chosen each herb carefully for its addition to your spell or your ritual for the energies and vibrations that it will bring to you and to your working and so by doing that you have just added one more layer that makes it easier for you to get into magical space and to create magical change because you also don't know what other ingredients have been put in mass-produced incense there are some that are mass-produced where there is like a a coating on them and that coating keeps them from kind of powdering apart you know how sometimes with n Champa if you have it too long it'll powder off of the stick there are some mass-produced Brands where they put on a chemical coating to prevent that I don't know what that coating is I don't know if that's in line with my magical intentions or what I want that could be totally against everything I'm trying to do so I know when I am making it myself you know it's kind of like dinner when I'm making dinner not that I'm a cook but when I'm cooking I know what I'm eating because I'm putting it in there and you're not getting an ingredients list on the back of an incense box exactly and there's more fun things that you can do with incense that you make yourself we're we're heading into summertime we're in summertime right now camping season is in full swing what better way to do an incense at Camp than to put it in the fire you know if you're camping and you have a small ritual fire say you want to do a a love spell or a deepening of a relationship spell and you've made a small ball using honey and lavender and rose hips yeah a little bit of cinnamon you know maybe a little bit of pepper for some spice and or some apricot even yeah and you've wrapped all these rose petals and everything toss that into your fire and that's going to smell great you're going to now make your whole Camp smell fantastic as that releases the energy of your spell and you can't do that with a stick incense PSA once you put your incense ball in your campfire it's not the appropriate time to be roasting marshmallows although I've done it before not thinking and been like wow that sure tastes like dragons blood damn it and honestly there's nothing that will take you out of magical space faster I have been at rituals before around the bonfire in the wee hours of the morning as the drummers are still kind of going strong and people are moving slower around the bonfire maybe doing some magical work and the next thing you know somebody comes up and is like tossing their paper plate from the snack they just had into the ritual fire oh Lord there's nothing that'll pop you out of magical space faster than that you know and aside from um making loose incense here's a couple other things I've used herbs for this is one thing I've been working on actually right at this very moment well not while we're talking but last night and I probably will do it after we're done spell bottles that's been my kick for a while we've been talking about it for a while um spell bottles have been my My Jam at the moment and I have actually gone and harvested some local good stuff here in Salem I actually went down what was it two days ago I believe I went down to the ocean and harvested some well I didn't Harvest it it washed up on on the on the beach I I got some washed up kelp that I've been drying oh what's the magical properties of kelp what I've specifically got it for aside from the magical properties is I've been into this sea witch stuff lately yeah hey me with my collecting seag glass and Driftwood I feel you so you know it was just I I'm making I'm starting to make some some spell bottles that that are more ocean themed but kelp kind of brings in that that flowing energy that flexibleness because when you look at it something like kelp which is a seaweed essentially for those that aren't aware of that it it's kind of that seaweed that that keeps things fluid keeps things flexible and in movement but it also is a protector you can use kelp in a protection incense or I'm putting it in a spell botle like I said um because again it represents one of those Protectors of the sea so right now what I've been doing I just been drying it on a paper towel in my window s with the window open hey the sunlight right now as we're going towards I mean this is going to come out after the solstice but as it's going towards the solstice that sun energy being absorbed by those plants is a beautiful balance of Fire and Water Energy in that KP but we've had some relatively decent weather up here in the Northeast um for a little bit so I've been able to harvest already some catnip some basil the sage we talked about the sage I was growing last time um so I I've been drying some of that out jarring it up to be to be putting in for some of the spell bottles I've been using I've got some sprigs of lavender finally so I actually just harvested those yesterday and I will be using probably be splitting that between spell bottles and loosen scents but what I've been really looking into at this point other than the ocean thing a lot of folks have been asking for Prosperity stuff is the season I guess we all need camping money my friends honestly you were talking about what you have been harvesting I have been harvesting mint for that very reason my daughter is an herbal witch and she has been growing mint and catnip and quite a few other things and I just spent a few days recently because you know mint it'll go crazy harvesting a whole bunch of mint and drying it our last episode you had talked about taking sticks and making a pentacle out of them to hang herbs from so we're trying that to try I love that I love that she's doing that isn't that great and so I I'm again to kind of absorb that sun energy in the mint for Prosperity spells because mint is fabulous for that type of spell we're also Gathering all the peie um right now all our peanes are huge crazy yeah pedals everywhere and peie flowers are fantastic for romance spells and for good health and healing and good they're good for marriage so romance good marriage health and happiness so great time of year to harvest these herbs to use in your magical workings you know don't get me wrong I am an herb buyer I will go to any local store you know living in Salem really is is a killer on my my finances so jealous at your fingertips I'll go down you know I'll buy I'll buy stuff you know I'll get my frankincense and my dragon's blood and my myrr and my this and my that but there are things and this was this was even the case in when when I lived when we lived in Upstate New York try to use locally sourced things things that you can Source yourself you don't necessarily have to put tons of money into being an herb witch but you might have to walk around outside every now and again yeah you know there's there's so many things that are local to you wherever you are that can be utilized no matter your int you know here in the Northeast we just happen to be abundant with all types of trees and plants and and flowers and and things of that nature but you know if you're say out in California there are plants and trees and and Barks and stuff out in California that can be utilized for the same intentions but maybe aren't the same exact plant product that maybe I have here at my fingertips to go harvest in my yard or down the street or at the beach staying local is a fabulous way to honor the Earth which is a lot of what we're doing by making your own incense using smaller amounts use just a little bit you don't need a whole white sage bundle in order to get that cleansing and healing property you don't need to use the entire plant you can just use a small amount and get that same magical kick it's not going to get more magical because you used a handful shell likes abundance so sometimes shell likes to make this stuff and give it away so I think that kind of colors her magic and she's just like I'll put some handfuls in here because she's giving away that abundance to people but when you're doing a spell or what have you you don't need a lot I know people who use and I'm one of them the loose incense holders you know with the sand with the little charcoals break those charcoals in half break it in a quarter if you just need a little tiny bit because those suckers will burn for a long time if you get a good one see I'm the one who will use the whole charcoal in one sitting and then my smoke detector's going off and I'm fan in the whole place yeah oh yeah I've been there for sure I mean I love copal and Dragon Blood two of my favorite scents especially if I'm going to burn it on a loose incense burner and so I will go all out but yeah you've got to kind of watch out you're going to smoke out your house if you're trying to keep your witchcraft or your spellcraft on the downlo a little secret don't use a full charcoal because everyone in your house and possibly your neighborhood will know I I I wanted to just touch on a couple of things that this is just local to me but some things that you may just have in your backyard that you can utilize for incense or spell work or spell bottles because you know it's not just incense and spell bottles you know I have done the bay leaf thing you know I have written my little spells on the bay leaves and either burned them or folded them up and and and put them in the ocean or what have you but there are things that you are going to just find that are so good like here Oak we have oak trees everywhere I look out my bedroom window I have an oak tree right here fertility healing Health luck money potency protection I don't need to go necessarily would I like to go get maybe some valaran or something of that nature for protection maybe I would but maybe I can't afford it or don't have access to it I can go right outside my bedroom and get some oak leaves I could maybe get a piece of a branch of that oak tree that's come off on what have you maybe a piece of the bark and have just as much of a of a protection spell with that Oak for my yard as the Valyrian I bought for 9.95 online exactly and if you can't get Sage or if you don't have an ethical way to Source it Pine grab a little branch of Pine and put that in your moon water as you're sprinkling your house to cleanse it or use it in your incense or in your working it's free you can just go get that most places I I know it doesn't grow everywhere but that's something that very easily can be sourced cheap you know as much as I am witchy to the core I still have that blend of Christmas fule christma Ule and I get a tree every year always get a real one just one shell well the one is real the rest not okay different episode on my OCD Christmas tree thing but I will actually before I dispose of the tree after I take all my decorations off which sometimes is February I will actually take pieces off that tree and jar them up for later spellwork down the road so you just Source this stuff it doesn't have to be about buying these fancy concoctions online or it you know I'm not I'm not knocking small business spend all your money at local business but you can do it too on your own without spending you can do it out of your kitchen how often shell have you reached for your spice cabinet to throw together herbs for a spell when you didn't have your witchy herbs how many how many things in my herb catalog are actually from Whole Foods in a Whole Foods container exactly exactly it's herbs and everything seem so complicated and there's some wonderful authors out there my first one Scott Cunningham you know Encyclopedia of herbs love it it's like a Bible Cunningham's Encyclopedia of magical herbs was my first one fabulous cute little book and he has a couple of them now there's also my daughter's favorite is Rosemary gladstar and she's phenomenal she's more of the medicinal side and the healing side of herbs okay but one of the things to remember when you're talking magical uses of herbs is like for like right practicality matches magical if it's a hot pepper its magical uses are to spice things up to bring fire to bring energy and all those things that fire represents if it's c a meal and you drink it in a tea to make you sleepy it represents peace and calmness and Harmony roses people give roses for love they make people feel romantic rose petals magically are for romance and love so like for like you just have to remember that so if you know the medicinal uses of an herb you'll know the magical properties as well right right you know there is definitely a a separate set of knowledge between the magical uses um and the medicinal uses oh yeah it doesn't go the other way no no but but we want to make sure we tell people that yeah the other way like don't be ingesting stuff if you don't know yeah don't don't no please don't don't eat any of these unless you know that they are edible you know there's things that have properties that people don't realize potatoes healing and image magic and then you've got raspberries with love and protection rice abundance fertility money protection these are things that are in your everyday or maybe in your every day um maybe you don't eat po potatoes every day I'm with an Irishman so I have to but just normal things that you would find in your refrigerator in your cupboard look them up see what their magical properties are you may be able to use them in your magical work you know Rosemary the uses for Rosemary I I can't even list all of them it's one of my favorite magical and edible herbs yeah strawberries love and luck who doesn't love strawberries right so one of the other uses for herbs is potions I love making me some potions this is where the tea lover in me comes to play oh my gosh yes that's where my herb witch and my tea lover come face to face me too I am definitely a hot leaf water fan and we all have these stories of when we were little making potions how many potions did you make shell I had a plastic tea set what are you talking about I was making potions in my yard with Nettles and onion and Thorns from a blackberry bush you know I needed to curse my enemies man you were horrible I was making them with flowers man what do you mean metals like I was making like little things with flowers looking back in retrospect I was making spell bottles back then I would be making flow crowns you were just angry I was an angry child yeah I collected Cemetery dirt and yeah don't cross me when I was eight anyway man what I wouldn't have given for like a coffin nail at that age but anyway now is where it's at and you know I've also noticed an uptick Get It uptick On The Tick Tock h on on te freeding and oh okay I think a lot of people think that te freeding is something new this is like a couple thousand year old practice Yeah but te te freeding is a great form of divination definitely we're not going to get into that today but look it up get some info fun stuff especially if you're a tea lover as far as the herbs and the teas go you can do so much with a cup of tea so so much it's an easy potion it's an easy spell potion right there and if you're concerned about making your own or harvesting your own go to the local grocery store and go to the tea section and there is a plethora of herbal concoctions there and they're all delicious very delicious the chamomile tea might be Celestial Seasons is the brand I could be wrong that chamomile tea I have done some good magic with that good magic yeah go to your Farmers Market a lot of times they'll have local herbs and things that you can add to your herbal teas and chamomile tea little lemongrass I mean if you need to draw peace or Harmony into your life that's a fabulous potion right there well and also you know if you're a summer iced tea cold tea type person you can make you can make your iced tea your cold tea I love cold tea um just as much as I love hot tea but you can just squirt some lemon in there for For Love or purification so these are things that you know you may already be utilizing in your everyday quote unquote menu and just incorporate them more magically as well exactly and how easy to do a spell as you're waiting for the water to heat up to draw those energies in and to infuse that water with the power of that heat and then conscientiously choose each herb and put it in whatever it is that you're going to soak into the tea and you know choose honey to add a little sweetness to it and strengthen it everybody's looking for a love spell everybody is I got the perfect love spell for you folks get a gallon of water put some tea in it I like black tea put lemon in it put honey in it and put some pure sugar cane in it sugar for love and lust perfect lemon relationships and love honey love like you want to do a love spell make some sun tea it's that easy oh yeah this again this time of year that sun energy put some sun tea out there to soak it up black tea itself is magical and it gives you faith and strength it can also be a psychic energy bring Clairvoyance and protection green tea also is for divination for happiness for healing if you use ulong tea That's stands for strength and mercy it can also be For Love or divine intervention and white tea has the energies of healing and immortality along with benevolence so you can choose the type of tea that you want as a base as well as any Earth herbs or flowers that you want to add to it to add those energies and just a super easy way to bring that energy into your life and like shell said stick it in the Sun make sun tea and now you've had that added energy of the sun god energy infused into that potion and that's always my go-to when people do you have a love spell you could give me could you talk to me about love spells yeah go make some sun tea go make some sun like what's that got to do with a love spell I'm like well and then if you want a little extra boost to that toss in some fresh raspberries again for love yep I like to do a little bit of black tea for luck with mint and chamomile definitely help you for your Prosperity Jasmine if you have access to to Jasmine that would be another one well there you go a little mint Jasmine black tea that sounds delicious you've got a Prosperity spell right there protection is another big one I think that's a good one we might want to also touch on and and now this always made my my daughter my oldest child laugh my daughter she's an adult she loves mimosas okay doesn't realize that Mimosa is actually a plant that is a good protection she thought that drinking mimosas not a plant would be protection oh interesting okay I'm gonna use that excuse I guess if that's her intention actually mustard and I know mustard tea I've actually done it before it's weird mustard seed that doesn't sound very good well I like mustard to begin with that's why I tried it cool but yeah you know you can do like the nettle tea you can do orange oh yeah I love any Citrus give me a citrus in my tea any day and those are fantastic I love it oh yeah absolutely love it I've never had this in a tea but my grandma used to make a pie rhubarb now I liked the rhubarb pie so I would be curious I would try a rubarb tea hell yeah I have a lot of rhubarb my family has a lot of rhubarb that grows um my my grandmother that recently passed at 100 years old has a ton of rhubarb and a lot of the family came and picked rhubarb out of that patch after she had passed and made rhubarb pies rhubarb cakes rhubarb bread rhubarb muffins rhubarb and I do love rhubarb give me a strawberry rhubarb pie any day fantastic stuff so don't you think strawberry rhubarb tea could be good I've never had rhubarb in a tea I would definitely have to try that that's something I'm GNA have to try I'm gonna have to give that a go we'll have to whip up some sort of spelly thing that involves that and see how it goes see how it tastes what I have let's see for rhubarb I've got Fidelity and pro and protection H and I know that the the leaves of it can be very bitter if not poisonous so that would make sense that it would be a protection thing possibly the big protective leaves sure protection Fidelity and to increase male libido sometimes people will use rubarb in food in order to uh make their man more interested or a little more Lusty in bed possibly again the like for like maybe it's the big stock I don't know but yeah you can use foods for magic rice who would have thought rice abundance fertility money protection like come on it's rice everybody's got access to Rice well that makes sense again too because in a lot of cultures having rice meant that you had enough to eat that you had enough to keep going and so having rice would be a wealth thing right I could see where sugar also can be because of some of its connotations as only for the wealthy can be considered magically to have that correspondence similar to um some spices are the same way because they were considered so precious they have that kind of energy associated with them yeah like turmeric for clarity and purification um vanilla lust love mental Powers these are things that you know walnuts my grandma used to make cookies every Christmas with walnuts walnuts Health infertility assist with that you can make wishes on walnuts I remember when I was a kid at Christmas we would make wishes on walnuts how do you make a wish on a walnut I don't know we'd hold it in our hand and make a wish on it I don't know oh okay I didn't know if there was anything more involved than that like think of it like I don't know maybe you'd call it pray into the Walnut I don't know we'd make these wishes on the walnuts and then we'd paint my grandma would have this paint and these little paint brushes and then we paint things on the Walnut shelf that's kind of cool little spell right there and then they'd be decorations my grandma wasn't a witch just asked her she'd tell you and then we'd paint the walnuts yeah this is the Pennsylvania Dutch grandma that was not a witch correct correct that's right gotcha I guess the point I keep trying to to swing it back to is you do not need to just go spending all kinds of money to start being able to create herbal spells and do Herbal Magic and you know kind of incorporate that into your life some people say this isn't herbal I do I don't know I'll fight you for it simmer pots love a damn good simmer pot maybe not so much this time of year but like more maybe mabin to ostara in that chunk of period of time here in the northern hemisphere perfect simmer pot get some oranges and some apples and some clove and some cinnamon sticks and just simmer that in a big old pot like there's nothing like it I think simmer pots are just water-based incense to be honest really yeah a lot of people I know use them that exact same way and it is herbal basically you're making a big tea or a soup a big potion and allowing the aromatics of that and the energy that you've put into that to your out to the universe y yeah and and you're doing it with all of the elements you've got the air where the scent comes up you've got the fire that you're using to heat it with water that's your base and then the Earth that are all the different herbs and items that you put in there to make that scent to bring that power out into the world in the form of that scent and that mist that's going to cover everything to push your magic out or as an alternative to that as long as your simmer pot is full of edible things consumable things after you're done with your you know if you've had that going for you know three six nine hours here we are with that 369 thing again right you can then strain some of that out for a te uh for a tincture and consume it to continue your spell or complete your spell that way yeah you can then take the solids the herbs and things that you put into that and bury them in your garden as mulch and to also continue releasing the energy of that Spell absolutely you know there's so much that you can do with this and one of my grandmothers also not a witch would be happy to tell you she was not a witch just ask her just ask her loved to do Kitchen Magic when she was cooking how many times have you heard in a kitchen an older relative say the quickest way to a man's heart is through his stomach yep how often do people to say I'm sorry or welcome to the neighborhood or I hope you get better make food or or at the passing of someone or yeah when someone passes away people make food food is a magical ritual in and of itself and so why not start adding these herbs into it to make it an actual magical meal use your herbs with intention and with Choice choose them because they taste good and also for their properties that they have have let's go back to love and abundance you know if you're making a dinner for someone that you love and you want to continue that love maybe use some edible flowers make it a sweet meal instead of savory you know make make it hot and sweet you know use a little bit of chili powder use a little bit of Honey use don't don't make these people think that they that if you want to be an herbal witch you got to be a kitchen witch because you don't have to no I'm just saying I can't cook to save my life okay I can't cook to save my life but yet I've been rocking the herb witch thing for a couple decades here but don't let me cook for you because it could turn tragic and you'll be eaten out of a microwave yeah and a lot of the herbs that are used in in incenses are not edible right so and a lot of edible herbs smell very differently then they taste if you burn it exactly exactly you know something that may have a sweet taste to it is going to smell bitter and I think a a good example of that is um that Yaro Yaro kind of if you break it very sweet and if you put your tongue on it very sweet to The Taste if you burn it it's kind of offputting sometimes when you burn things you shouldn't breathe it in you don't want to breathe in these smokes of a lot of these different things and there's things that parts of them are consumable and other parts of them are not that's a game you don't want to play you know maybe the leaf is consumable but the stock is poisonous or you know vice versa um or maybe I just always stuck it safe with the herbal witch part of it honestly if if you stick with consumable herbs you're not going to really hurt yourself um but check out some of the books check out Cunningham he's got some great information it might be a little simple but it's a great place to start check out Rosemary glad star and so that you can find the edible and the medicinal herbs as well to kind of balance the magical part of your practice and as far as um a really good website to find the magical correspondences and this this site's been around for several years I I don't know these people I have no association with them I just think they've always had a pretty badass website the white goddess. co.uk and they have a very extensive excellent magical correspondence list on their site and if you're from the white goddess website and you want to reach out to us hey feel free back on the broomstick gmail.com but I I definitely think having some sort of reference of correspondences is a good way to start because if you have the correspondence kind of in front of you you can see okay what do I have in my kitchen that I can use for this and what do I have in my backyard that I can use for that always be appreciative as well you know if you are going to take trimmings or cuttings you want to thank that plant or thank that shrub or whatever um before you just take you don't just take you don't just ever take be appreciative and thankful for that prior but see what you've got around you and then you can kind of work with things from there but I think probably the best way to start is to have a correspondence list whether it's from Cunningham's book or from a website um whatever because then you can kind of build maybe a little herbal closet out from there you know what are my intentions am I looking for love okay where are the oranges and The Raspberries at here people because I'm looking for love you know kind of start from there yeah and try to use ingredients that you have on hand as much as possible I know my first instinct is I want all the pretty jars I want them all filled to the brim with incense and I want them labeled and I want the shelves and all the tool needed love that but I also know myself I move a lot and I don't use a lot of these things when I make an incense or a tincture or a potion I just use a little bit so don't go buying a big ounce of yo when you go get it you might only need a small amount you know keep it in a little jar because the last thing you want is to be cleaning out ounces and ounces of these dried old dusty ass herbs that have lost all potency and now you're trying to compost them and do something with them and you've spent all this money so start small you might only find that you like you know a couple three five herbs that are your go-tos you're always grabbing the dragon's blood you're always grabbing the mint or know what have the rose petals you know keep those particular herbs on hand and then Source the other ones as you need them in two to three years is my limit here folks the longest I will keep an ingredient is two to three years after that I feel like it's kind of lived its life The Thrill Is Gone the magic has dwindled three years I'll keep something stored for usage and then that's it it's got to go and be replaced because you know this stuff isn't you can't have something to jar for 36 years and expect it to be just as potent you know that bay leaf does turn to dust after a bit now you and I when we first started all of this witchcraft stuff was way back in the day when wika was really the only name of the game if you were a witch you were a Wiccan that was pretty much an assumption it was one in the same back then that's right that's right all witches were wiccans or you were some sort of devil worshipper pretty much pretty much but when I was first looking into herbalism I was old Hook Line and Sinker the whole idea of the witch in her robes going out at dawn with her bowan you know that curved sacred knife to cut her herbs with the first who the hell wants to be up at dawn what the Lord now there are some magical Traditions that will tell you if you're going to use these herbs in any type of magical working you have to pick them at a certain time of day with a certain tool with a certain intention and that's all well and good there are High magic there are rituals where you will want to do that remember I told you I sourced the lavender last night I went out there at like I don't know 9:15 at night I had scissors I was in my Minnie Mouse pajamas there was nothing sacred about this sourcing at all and yet that's going to work just as well for Shell as someone going out at dawn with their pearl handled bowling you know collecting the D don't judge me on the Minnie Mouse pajama pants by the way love those love those but yeah I mean it's all about intention would I like to have gone out there and done this at you know 1201 am on the Dark Moon on the 13th of the month sure does that fit my life absolutely not am I going anywhere at Sunrise I'm not going anywhere at Sunrise nowhere nowhere except sleepy sleepy land so we're going to wrap this up and say intention is really King but one of these days we we have to do an episode on intention because it's not the same as saying I want it to be like this and so it is it's not that simple that's not intention necessarily that's a backhanded intention you have to you definitely have to have the frame of reference for sure that's the one thing that I think I see a lot of lately is that I want to be a witch and I want to be an all powerful witch overnight I wish it was overnight because here I sit 30 years later still reading books and and and learning things and trying things out and what works what doesn't work you know like I said I'm I'm starting to get into this whole SE which thing and that is not something I've ever delved into so there is a lot of learning and a lot of practice involved in this and it's I'm not going to say it's not daunting it is especially after you've done this for so long but it's the natural path of things it's the way it is it's like you got to put in your time this is the way of the wise you got to put in your study yeah you got to put in your study you got to put in the the the trial and error and then you will get to the point where you're just doing this  on the Fly exactly just because a powerlifter lifts up you know several hundred pounds and makes it look easy doesn't mean that they didn't work very hard to get to that point to make it look easy you know the you're not seeing the hundreds of hours and worked to make the muscle to get to that point and so when people just say well as long as the intent is there I think sometimes we're forgetting the work that went in behind it right but different podcast anyway we'll talk about intent another day my friends so I say get your jars get your herbs and just start throwing together and see what happens because that's the only way you're GNA a learn and B know if you want to do Herbal Magic or be a herb witch or what have you is just start throwing together and start burning it and see what happens Y and if you start making your own incenses and you don't like the way they smell they don't burn properly for you you find that it's just not your bag it's fine to use cone or stick incense or buy someone else's Blends because that can be just as powerful you just have to put your energy into it in a different way rather than creating it and right down your ingredients that was a tough lesson I learned in the beginning I wouldn't write anything down and they'd be like oh what' you put in that I don't remember hey Shell I love that incense you made for me we started talking my relationship got better it's fantastic what' you put in it I don't remember stuff and I was in magical space man and I just went with it just put stuff in there and it worked every time you were the
