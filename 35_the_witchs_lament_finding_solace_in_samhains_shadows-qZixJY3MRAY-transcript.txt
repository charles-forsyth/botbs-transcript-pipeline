the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and today we are talking about the next notch on the wheel and what no well yeah in the southern hemisphere yes hi Australia by the way hey New Zealand do you know that the country that listens to us the second most is Australia and it's belane there you know I love belane we should hop on a plane and go down there honestly this year I would much rather it be belan so I'm very happy to say happy belain to the Southern Hemisphere and to all of us up here in the northern hemisphere we are celebrating sin whatever well you know I kind of like it you know that whole thin veil and you can feel the spirits I mean I know it is equal at balain but I feel like I can feel it more I don't know maybe it is the nights or earlier thing I don't know but I feel oh yeah the whole atmosphere lends itself to ancestor work and Shadow work and inner work here in the northern hemisphere for sa whereas at belan I feel like when the veil is thin they're coming here to party but when the veil is thin at sa they're coming here to do work you know I was listening shell today to our sa episode from last year on our other podcast the stoned witches hour if you want to check it out wheel of the Year s 2022 on the stoned witches hour and I it kind of made me sad shell why cuz I was happy then I I was all excited about Sin I was all happy about the reflection and going within and I'm like yeah sin's not that sad it's our beloved Dead coming back and then this year really kicked me in my ass and I lost a because because then you had the reflection that you were oh so looking for careful what you wish for unfortunately there was a lot of death in my family this Year my beloved dog died my 100-year-old grandmother died shortly after turning 100 my uncle one of my beloved uncles uh got cancer and suddenly passed away very quickly this year it's been a year sh you know I I I'm not so sure that we're going into this sa with a much better year ahead crazy world we live in just saying it's uh it's definitely not a happy s this year you know there's not a lot of yay my beloved dead I'm going to cry a lot this S I know it and you know being here up in Salem it is always festive this time of year as you can imagine is festive really the adjective you'd use to describe it I've heard you talk about this and festive is not what you use to me in private it is especially if we're talking about me trying to drive to my 9 to-5 job you know usually people are joyous and they're wearing costumes from like the second week of September nobody is like that they're just like zombie tourists walking around nobody's in costume no hold on back up back up I've spoken to you several Octobers now through the years and one of your favorite things in sin is at work to sit there and watch the great window looking out onto Main Street proper and seeing all the different costumes and you love that part no sat in the window the other day my my whole office had lunch in that in that corner window and we we sat there and it was the biggest disappointment surely there's some witches all dressed to the nin snuggled up next to Bora one or two but not like not like before like people are like Debbie Downer this year I don't know but there's more of them right even way more people but they're all in street clothes I don't get it I don't get it I don't get it Weir definitely a strange year whether it's belan or S I wonder if it has to do with all of the eclipses and all of that like planetary the that's going on in the world that yeah that which we shall not speak of yeah it's heavy shit's heavy we costume this episode comes out right before sa right before the full moon right before the lunar eclipse Buckle in folks we're going for a ride this weekend my good gracious so in lighter news now that we've got everyone all depressed and wishing they were down in Australia for belan we do actually have some good news to talk about guess what if you stay till the end of the episode we know who has won Jamie Del's book a signed autograph or the audio book voiced by Jamie herself and I'm sad to say we already know that I'm not the winner no no shell was disqualified I had to throw away at least 13 of her own name that she put in there but hey you can't blame me for trying really really don't blame you one bit so we will tell you at the end of this episode who the winner is so stay tuned for that so let's let's talk about sa a bit now we I we mentioned the thinning Veil I like to as we post it on our social media kind of display things that make me think of my ancestors that a pass now I knowa has a fun thing that she does that she stole the idea from somebody but we won't talk about that but I think sometimes it's more about taking advantage of the thin veil than maybe focusing on other aspects because the way I look at it is you don't have too many opportunities for that thinnest Veil so take advantage when you do belan and sa I mean doesn't get thinner than that and while you can talk to your beloved dead any time of the year you can talk to your ancestors at any point of the year it does feel different now it does feel more conducive to those conversations and I don't know about you but I have been thinking about people near and dear to me this year that have passed a lot I've been dreaming about them things that they used to like are coming up unexpectedly in my life and you know I'm noticing these synchronicities and these things and and it just feels like they're very very close post and this year for some reason I'm more prone to want to do tarot readings and you know not that I don't do them but I've never done it any different in October than any other month whereas this year it seems a little different I don't know it's almost like I got the Divination bug this month more so I started last month I I started a PO a day using um The Witches wisdom tarot by Phyllis kirat for self-reflection and so I've been pulling a tarot card every day and trying to meditate with that card and and work with that particular card and it's been hard you know I find myself sometimes lapsing a little bit like I I missed a day or two here or there and so I've been getting down on myself about that how about you when you are doing your your divinations this time of year how are those working out for you you know it's almost like for as thin as Veil is supposed to be things are a little cloudy messages seem garbled like talking through static like there's just something weird about this year I don't know I don't know I can't even explain it like you said maybe the eclipses are having something to do with the energy just being kind of all over the place instead of like talking face to face it's like trying to talk to someone through a door oh you get what I'm saying I do almost like the veil isn't very thin yeah yeah like we know in our mind it is but it's not kind of feeling it I hear you I know it's supp to be but I'm not feeling it but that's like you know how I love analogies that's my best analogy it's like instead of a face-to-face conversation it's like talking through a door talking to someone on the other side of the door harder to hear harder to listen you know what I mean you know that's going to happen at sometimes in your practice you're going to find that rituals or spells that used to be easy for you aren't as easy the magic doesn't feel like it's the same or or that you know the energy feels different or sty well that's the other thing is it me is it the Universe I don't know I don't know how to find out I'm hoping it's not me but yeah it's just weird so some things you can do when that's happening you can pull more cards you can Journal through it LS like a mofo people right and it's always a good time to do a cleansing absolutely right of yourself your house your space whatever because s is the witch's New Year a lot of people do like to do a house cleansing now we're about to button up our houses for the winter time so cleaning your whole space like cleaning fresh for the new year like the opposite of spring cleaning yeah exactly you know do some fall cleaning do some s cleaning and cut cords do it energetically while you're physically cleaning your house reprotect your space reprotect it use your dragon's blood use your Sage you know use cinnamon love cinnamon this time of year Rosemary and push all of that out of theace you know if you don't want to burn the incense simmer pots I'm seeing simmer pots everywhere well honestly I was going to say you could take those same things and make a tea out of them just saying tea out of them roll the joint you can turn it into a broom I've seen a lot of beautiful herb brooms that people make and you can use that to sweep the air in your house flowers use some flowers or get some flowers like chrysanthemums or maragold which are symbol of the Dead this time of year put those in your house and let that scent permeate and and help to cleanse your space and you know like shiny things so you know I got some uh Crystal quarts all over the place and you know my rose quarts and you know just just good things to have around yeah sit with your sit with your crystals personally I have been neglecting my ancestor altar so what I have been doing lately is is doing a lot of cleansing I've been cleaning my space cleaning each of the items that I like to have on my Altar and unfortunately putting on some new ones and and setting that up and so I I'm trying to take my time with that and really set up a beautiful ancestor altar um just to kind of pay my respects and put a little offering a food offering there every day I'm cheating though and I'm using bird seed and I'm putting it outside so hey whatever works man whatever works it's all about your intent not whether you're using bird seed or whatever you could be using there you go I also wanted to mention that this as well as belain my favorite thing bonfire Festival I love a good bonfire love bonfires that that that must be like the the upstate New Yorker in me I just love a good bonfire you know the other thing to kind of tie in the whole masking and and this is a good time for masking and unmasking and I'm not necessarily talking about you know trick-or-treating per se sometimes we wear a mask that we have to take off and sometimes we don't have a mask and should put one on and that is always something I've kind of reflected on in this time of year do I have a mask should I have a mask you know what I mean I don't know why I get so deep this time of year maybe it's the whole dark thing but I take the whole trick-or-treating mask thing to a spiritual level of what masks should I or should I not be going into this next year with you know we all hide behind mask here and there whether friends family work out in random public wherever at the mall but what masks do you want to leave behind or pick up going into the new year there's a ritual for you right take some of those paper masks make your own paper masks and and write words on them you know how you used to make when you were a little kid you cut a circle maybe in a pie plate or something put little holes on the side and type thread around it so you my God a paper plate yes yeah so make a like a paper plate mask you could make some literal masks out of paper plate or a piece of paper yeah you could put feathers on it what you know do whatever cut eye holes in it a little mouth hole in it and then write on it all the different things that that mask represents that you don't want to wear anymore and then burn that in the bonfire you know or on on the the flip of that you could also make masks of what you want to have going into the next year like I said you know what masks are you wearing now that you want to leave behind and what masks should you may be wearing coming into the new year that you should pick up on yep and it's a good reminder that this is the third Harvest this is the New Year this is like sa for the Kelts this was I don't know if it's technically the name of the month but it's the time of year it's like the end of the year basically it's their Lial time between summer and winter the ending of one season and the beginning of another and so Lial spaces are very very good for just like you said leaving behind that which doesn't serve you and carrying forward only that which does and bonfires are a beautiful symbolic way to get rid of things not everybody can have a bonfire so if you got a little cauldron or a little candle that will work just as well you know or you can symbolically burn things you don't have to literally burn it I'll be honest with you I like to literally burn things fire fire fire fire and I mean that in the most Firebug kind of way not fire buug kind of way no in the most IAL kind of way yeah but I like that as a good activity that and that is a good activity for this time of year but I don't know I I I think this year I'm going to kind of more Relish in the be in the now that's a that's a good lesson to remember any time but definitely after the third Harvest after you've put away the growing things are all done now we've gotten the last little bits from the field and you better be ready you have to be ready and sometimes you've done all you can do you've learned all you can learn you've put away the things that you need to now you need to just be here right now and experiencing where you're at right now that can be really hard well a lot of people look at sa and like they look at you know like January 1 New Year's New Year's Eve let's make some resolutions well whether it is January 1 or October 31st none of us stick to these resolutions people you've never liked resolutions I am the most anti-r olution person on the planet I think that's kind where the whole be in the now be cognizant of the present don't Focus too much on the future or too much on the past you know what I mean I do and unfortunately for me the S is going to be an awful lot focused on the past I can't help it there's just a lot of saying goodbye I guess I need to do there's a lot of a lot of things I need to say so it's going to be a long night yeah you got you got some people that are crossing that bridge and take advantage that you still have that relationship yeah just on a different level just on a different level and I try to remember that I try not to be sad about it but it's hard it's hard sometimes not to be sad so I'm going to let myself be a little sad that night I kind of feel like we're turning sa episode into like a therapy session I feel deby Downer I told you I listen our last episode was all fun we talked about great things and and this episode I'm like that I'm sad I'm just sad well what are some fun things you do for Sal and also you know we've got like you said the eclipse the full moon like it's a busy weekend it really is what are your magical plans tell us all your magical plans for for this weird holiday weekend my biggest magical plan is we're having a silent supper and S celebration with my coven so I'll be doing that but for myself I'll be doing Circle in my backyard in my ritual space but I'll be doing a fire I'm going to have a fire in my backyard and burn it all night long while I cry my eyes out see we can't get away from the sad while I cry my eyes out all night long and uh wait till dawn so I'm going to be doing a ritual there and then uh keeping that going until morning how about you this is where we're going to start livening this up folks I am having a very non-magical sa this year my plans include being one of the 400,000 people reveling in Downtown Salem Massachusetts throw some history in there maybe do a ghost tour it's a lot of people shoulder toosh shoulder pagans isn't it really more people than really should fit in this town but hey I ain't judging I am going to be reveling in the whole sa vibe in which city USA hey that's a better way then I'm going to spend it I'm going to be spending it in my damp and cold backyard in front of my kind of admittedly cool backyard fireplace and I'm gonna be sad all night until dawn and you're gonna be having fun with pagans so I will send you pictures I appreciate it awesome yeah that's how I'm planning on spending it and I mean don't get me wrong I will I will do my own thing at some point over the weekend in in you know my ancestor reflection and all of that you know honoring the full moon in that lunar eclipse on the 31st I am going to be a Salem reveler I've been out there before around the season and it is just the the vibe is is a Mayhem Mayhem it is there's a lot of people there and I guess it's breaking records this year the nice thing is if you ever feel alone in the world like you're the only witch out there come to Salem on Halloween there'll be more witches around you than you will ever want to be close to shoulder Tosh shoulder we're not kidding here people but as much as there isn't really anything ritualistic in that don't for a second think there's nothing magical in that one of my very first times I ever saw pagans I went out to Salem for sin and met my very first real life witches they were everywhere they were everywhere they were doing ritual in this big field and and walking around in their cloaks and their pointy hats and it was just amazing to the witchling that I was that knew no one else to go to the witch City and and I know that no real witches died there we all know this it was just a persecution of people but it is kind of turned into almost a safe haven it really has you know we we want to change the idea of Witchcraft as being something that you could be persecuted for you know we we're trying to reclaim that so we have very much claimed this city where such a tragedy happened to such innocent people you know we have claimed that as our as our Mecca I don't want to say Mecca as our like Homeland is our like homecoming is our covenstead you know that's where we're drawn to and it's beautiful it's beautiful in a lot of different ways I think it's pretty fantastic and that that is the magic I will be ruffling in and you know honestly we need more of that magic and we need more of that recognition because just today shell you know we've heard a little bit some of you guys have probably heard this too down in Pennsylvania there was a pagan shop that was visited by a police officer and they were told they were just reminded no one was arrested or given a ticket or anything but this police officer thought that he needed to remind the owners of this shop that reading tarot cards or divination for money was against the law and that if they did that or if there are any problems with that there would be tickets issued and they would be arrested can I just interject real quick um you know what the story makes me think of what's that utilizing my itchy spell oh I love that spell anyone doesn't know we'll put a link in the I'll put a link in the show notes to the YouTube page where we discuss what the itchy spell is but yeah they definitely need it it gets worse shell it gets much worse do I have to put that on the whole town yeah you probably do because I think in the same town they're having what's called a witch walk and what that is is for about 3 hours people dress up like Witches Walk around they go to different businesses in the area not sure exactly what all goes on here but it looks like a lot of fun and it's being protested by the local church what and they're actually posting memes about burning witches okay first of all it is the year 2023 and this is is really happening it really is happening in Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania can I point something out about Pennsylvania that is where people came over from Europe for Religious Freedom isn't that like against everything that pencilvania was founded on they say that these practices are a gateway to the diabolic and invite demonic presences into one's life family and home we have done some diabolical things actually on occasion oh yeah yeah so he's not entirely wrong on that one but I I guess I have a hard time maybe I'm naive I'm usually the naive one honestly I can't really wrap my head around the fact that we're still dealing with that in 2023 I am absolutely completely surprised at what's going on here I mean it looks like just a a fun little thing you know I don't see anything at all here even that's necessarily actual real witches it just looks like a fun Halloween thing to do for the community and people are very quick to not only condemn it and say that people shouldn't go but they're actually posting memes that are threatening see you thought we were gonna talk about fun stuff didn't you I did and you know I don't understand the Prejudice I know it's out there I get it I don't understand it well you live in the heart of which city where they historically used that prejudice to execute innocent people and now they use it to make money but different different conversation but I just I feel like why is that okay I mean it's in the news and yet nobody does anything about it I guess that's a good lesson that maybe we're just not as accepted as we thought I mean you and I have never cared what people thought about what we believe we we never have honestly but I think that makes it easier to forget that some people do suffer persecution that we're not used to some people have to worry about their children or their job or where they're living it can be dangerous for some people to say even now that they're a witch or they're a pagan and that's  up that is up you know I guess with with everything that's going on in the world you know religion is one of the things that really divides people well on the bright side let's talk about things you can do to celebrate sa so other than crying in front of a fire I will actually be cleaning and redoing my ancestor altar I will also be I I do like to set a place I like to set a very elaborate table for sa and leading up to S I will often leave a place setting like a dinner place setting your best China your best silverware your your fanciest wine goblet your coolest water glass whatever you've got set out your most beautiful play setting put fresh flowers there every day and you put that there so that your dead those that you love whether related to you by blood or in spirit or in heart they know that they're welcome in your home that play setting is for them and so I like to set that sometime in the beginning of the month I'll set it and leave it for the whole month and then on sa itself I'll actually serve food onto that plate and then later I put that plate outside to offer to the elements and to the animals and to to my beloved dead um but that's that's one of the big things that I like to do ritually in addition to my ancestor altars I like to set up a um a place setting and on S in itself again I serve food onto that plate for those that have gone before me you know what I like to do that's kind of corny what's that sh as you know our listeners don't know this but as you know my uh my one grandmother Halloween was like her Christmas yeah wasn't an admitted wi we'll call it that but like she treated Halloween like Christmas it was her favorite time of year she dressed up every year in costume until the year she died at 85 years old it was always a big deal and even when I had my kids we always made you know I always made sure I took my kids to her house even though it was they lived in the best neighborhood for for Halloween she did honestly yeah my kids would agree but one thing I do is because it was a big deal and for her obviously she didn't know what sa was or or you know celebrate that or or even know anything about it but Halloween was her thing so what I like to do is do a pumpkin you know triangle eyes triangle nose like a traditional Jacka Lantern right and kind of treat it like a Beacon I don't know Beacon might not be the right word but that's exactly what they are you know what I mean yeah and like we would literally leave me and my kids would leave that damn pumpkin out out front lighted every night until it was like rotting into my front porch basically it was kind of like a beacon to my grandma like a even if it wasn't hey I why don't you come over and let's chat kind of more of a celebrating you because celebrating kind of made us feel like celebrating her because it's almost like you know Associated one and the same because she was so into it you know it might not cover all of my ancestors but you know who doesn't like to carve a good Jackal Lantern I love to have a little spiritual Association behind it just kind of makes it all the more meaningful well like you always say it's the intent right so if you get your Jacko Lantern if you get a turnip or a small gourd or a pumpkin you know if you want to be traditional get your turnup but if you use that time while you're carving the pumpkin to think about your ancestor Who Loved Halloween or Who Loved pumpkin pie or just loved fall or if you carve that intent into the pumpkin and then put a candle maybe that you've charged and carved maybe with their name you could put that in the pumpkin and then every time you light that pumpkin exactly like shell said it becomes a beacon to that person's energy to that soul and they know that they're still thought of and they know that they're still loved and maybe they'll come give you a message like the spiritual bat signal you know what I mean I love that and the the the other thing that it kind of as far as the honoring ancestors thing you know my children are grown we've even chatted with my son on our podcasts we all still dress up you know both of my both of my adult children dress up I dress up that's kind of in honor of my grand like with my grandma you were never too old for costume like like I said you know even in her mid 80s when she passed never too old for a costume so kind of utilizing that is a celebration of her life I love that you see what I'm saying I do and at my house you are never too old to get candy if you come to my door and say Trick or Treat you're getting candy I don't care and that for me is an act of you know people used to give out candies or breads or things like that to appease the spirits because the idea was you didn't know this time of year who's coming to your door if it's a demon if it's a trickster if it's a spirit of an ancestor if it's the kid down the street so you gave everyone treats to make sure that you didn't get tricked and so giving candy to the kids as they come can also be part of that celebration and honoring those that have come before and also giving out of abundance helps you to receive abundance but yeah you come to my door on Halloween you get candy I'm going for the king's siiz bar I'm coming to your house come to my house girl I got you covered you know that's the other thing I like I like candy I ain't gonna lie when I had kids I'd take some of their candy when they went to bed I ain't gonna lie but I always try to leave out a piece of candy in honor of my grandma I don't know it's just a thing just a thing and maybe I focus too much on one person but that could just be because of how much it meant to her and how and you know as you know how close I was with that Grandma so sometimes I do tend to focus on her more this time of year that makes sense and you know you might focus on people who have passed more recently or there might be some years where someone comes through more strongly than others and that's okay you know maybe you want to tailor your holiday around that particular person if that happens to go by our general rule of thumb do what works for you hey we do say that don't we we do we really do but we mean it we truly mean it that's the best part we're not just saying it no because that is really what works Works your magical brain is different than everyone else's magical brain and some things are are pretty close to Universal but not everything is my magical brain this s might not be my magical brain next s that's right well hey like we said I listened to us talking last year and I was looking forward to it because there's I have a lot of good associations with sin this year I'm not I heard my dog walking in the background of that episode and I started crying and couldn't listen to the rest of it so the energy this year and where my intention is focused is different this year than it was last year well I
