welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode we'll be talking about books of Shadows grimoires and magical journals I'm Leila and I'm shell and I'm G to start right off with a question what the hell is the difference between a book of shadows a gmir and six other names people call it well I guess it really depends on who you ask technically there's a difference a grimoire technically is an old magical book kind of like an encyclopedia or a text book it's recipes its rules and it was usually handed down in families or in Traditions from head of circle to the next head of the circle Book of Shadows was a term coined by Gerald Gardner and I actually have a really cool little factoid about Book of Shadows and how they came to be called Book of Shadows but we're gonna get to that what's a book of shadows to me or by definition honestly to me it's the same damn thing okay in my book of shadows I'm writing down the Spells in the correspondences and and you know tarot spreads and tea recipes all of it same and and I guess the better way to put it is a book of shadows is a personal Journal it's your journey you put in there whatever you want the things that you want to learn I have several different books of Shadows you know one for tarot one for Magical journaling one that's very specifically for spells and recipes so that's like your book of shadows is a very personal magical journal and a grimoire is usually more like an encyclopedia or a book of rules and those are usually a little more formal technically they're different but in reality they're not I'm with you shell everything goes in there and how you organize it I mean we say do magic your own way your book of shadows is a magical tool it's the exact same thing do it your way and the best way that works for you now kind of the buzz skill to all of this is for all of you listeners out there I've already posted a picture of my books of Shadows so you kind of see what I'm working with here but we do want to real quick talk about there are commercial books too you know this can be a spiral notebook or you know some of the cute leatherbound books that that we have that I posted but let's talk for a second about commercial books of Shadows because there is such a thing actually there are and you can you can purchase a book of shadows Shell's not just talking about the blank ones she's talking about something like the The Eclectic witch's Book of Shadows a companion work book by Deborah Blake if you don't know what to put in your book of shadows or if you've never created one before something like it's like a template it's like a template that's what I think of it as it's a template yeah it has different sections on all the different things that you would want to put in a book of shadows like crystals and you know your Magical Garden magical recip y crafting your own invocations and it kind of walks you through it step by step so that's really nice if you want somebody right there with you to kind of help you create a book of shadow but once you do that or if you want to skip that entirely you're going to create your own personal journal and I talk a lot about Journal Journal Journal Journal oh my God that's all you talk about journaling and meditation I think it's really really important and it's really nice to be able to look back through your old books of Shadows and see where you were as a baby witch you know as you were just starting out and all the different things that you've learned and the different phases you've gone through now I talk a lot about going back to my old books and just I think probably the most important thing I can say as far as Logistics don't use pencil man you'll regret it in 30 years I said it before when we talked about it and I'll say it again pencil it rubs and wears and I don't know bad news for long-term effect yeah my very first book of shadows I'm not sure why I started one it might have been something that I read in buckland's B you to journal I do like to journal so I have I have a lot of Diaries and stuff from when I was a kid but magical journaling was not something I was aware of until I think I read it in buckland's Big Blue Book I'm not positive where I first heard the term Book of Shadows but it was just a plain black notebook that I then decorated with stickers same you know and in it I put what I thought was important like I opened it with the charge of the goddess and you know I put spells in it but it very quickly became a journal I would write in it what the moon phase was how I felt if I did a spell and you know I put all sorts of things in there not just recipes emotions and things that happened that day as well I think you know what really works for for one person is going to be different for another but the concept is the same you know I don't necessarily have a lot of today's Moon phase is this and this is how I felt about it but I do have this is a Tarot spread I did on this date and this was the question I asked and these are the cards that came out and let me tell you they're fun to look back on oh I love that yeah like little chants we came up with or little rituals we came up with um you know like I have our initiations all still written out our coven initiations I still have all written out because for as much as I hate journaling I always end up being like the coven book of Shadow scribe person because I I do kind of like that detail of jotting down these things to kind of reflect on or maybe utilize for a similar purpose down the road you touched on such a good point jot down the date jot down the chant that you used write down the ritual structure or the spell structure because if it worked you're going to want to know that if it didn't work you're gonna you're want to know that yeah and you're G to tell yourself that you'll remember the chant you don't need to write it down you'll remember it no you won no you won't you're not gonna remember it write that  down you ain't remembering nothing write everything down because you will not remember it you think you will you'll tell yourself you will you w't so write it all down because it really is important in your magical practice especially if you're trying to get to be a better manifestor if you're trying to get to be better with your spellwork if you're trying to get closer to deity or find balance within yourself whatever your magical goal is journaling that is going to help you along that path it's going to help you be a better witch it's a almost a necessity in divination work I always go back to tarot but kind of journaling your tarot Journey you know we talked about the wiser tar Journal a few weeks back that was edited by Teresa Reed and you know same concept it's just like a a book of shadows for tarot but you know I've got big chunk sections on moon magic I got big chunk sections on Dragon magic you know I have a whole book that I wrote out on herb magic so it is also a way for you to kind of explore things while writing them down and then again for me sometimes if I'm writing down these spells are writing down these correspondences that kind of makes me remember it better memorize it better because if I write it down I don't know somehow I remember it better yes that's another really great point when you write it down there's something between your brain in your hand the act of writing it really does help you to remember it in a different way than just reading it online or type even typing it it's different and my book of shadows you know is going to be very different from hers because a lot of times what's seems to be very common with people is especially in your first couple Book of Shadows it goes by your interest at that moment right mine started out you know with an interest in crystals and then an interest in herbs and then an interest in astrology and so each chapter possibly of my book of shadows is going to be filled with notes it's going to have different chakras and all the different meanings and names for those energy sources and you know it's going to go through different phases and and shells will go through different phases and chapters as well with your interests and as it should you know with my first my very first book how I actually started that off was like that was some basic that I got going with that you know what are the quarters and what are the associations with the quarters um I have written out in the first few pages of my book of shadows how to cast a circle you know stuff about you know invoking the god and goddess so I had started my original book of shadows way back in 1990 what with kind of some base basic ritual stuff basic you know just some basic knowledge stuff moon phases associations um with numbers things of that nature so I kind of started with a basic witchcraft knowledge and then my second book like I said I think it's pretty much divided equally into half moon magic and half dragon magic and then it just kind of spirals out from there but that very first one was really kind of the fundamentals of witchcraft mine too and I think that again as you're writing it really reinforced those lessons for you every young witch should be writing out those initial correspondences and those initial lessons especially if you don't have a Coven or a mentor to guide you yes the information is readily available online or in a myriad of books but there's something to be said for having it Consolidated in one place in your handwriting that you wrote down not only are you going to remember it better but you know a couple years from now when you're trying to come up with your money bowl and you're like correspondences for money and success and luck you can just grab your book flip through to your correspondences section and they're all right there all the ones that have worked for you are right there you don't have to go searching to six different websites or pull two different books off your shelves or head to the library or something it's right there right and same thing like I do I have this cross reference system where I can cross reference different herbs based on what whether they're for incense or for Te so I have this like whole chart that I wrote out it's charted out the way I want it and what makes sense to my crazy brain but I've gone back to that that's in my very first book from 30 years ago and I go back to that on occasion even frequently recently I just map things out you know I take in that information and then I kind of map it out on paper for a what I need it for and B what makes sense to my brain unfortunately that was in the box of things that got quote unquote lost in the move but my original book of shadows was same thing The Binding was falling apart because I was constantly opening it there were Pages falling out because it was a reference that I would go back to regularly because not only was it correspondences but I did write down spells and things that worked and I would update those correspondences with how it worked for me or new information that I got that's another thing holy  don't be afraid to cross things out write in new information paste in a new little piece of paper on there you know your book of shadows can be organic you know if you want to keep a grimoire that's beautiful like a scrapbook and you just use your best handwriting and you keep that all perfect go for it but your book of shadows should be alive it should be just like a human you know full of flaws and love and joy and knowledge and all these things throw it in your bag when you go on a trip to be jotting down while you're out and about yes yes you know you should be spilling potions on it and there should be herbs talked in the pages and you know it's dirty cuz you took it camping with you last year remember that time we found that big big marijuana leaf inside one of my books of Shadows that was so great was that on top of my hand fasting vow it was it was there's a Tarot deck was it the herbal tarot The herbal tarot the T of Cups was the marijuana cup cup marijuana card yes the happy family card and they used marijuana leaves in that card and I've never forgot in that you know maybe having that super huge fan leaf on top of my hand fasting vows for so long that's probably pretty potent love magic herbs right there well it's definitely ingrained into the two pages in that book of shadows yeah I have four leaf clover stuck in one I've got you know different herbs and what in the same respect I also have sticky notes shoved in there and like ripped scraps of paper from when I was somewhere and wanted oh I just thought of this or you know look at this and need to jot this down and that sliver of paper just got shoved in my book I do have a book of shadows that is a school spiral notebook it's one of those three section notebooks that has pockets and you got the pockets full don't you oh yeah pockets are full it's written in I think it was a notebook that I had bought for my kids at one point for school that they maybe used like one page out of or something and then when I was desperately looking for something to use as a book of shadows I found this Barely Used notebook it was perfect and I loved being able to shove stuff into the pockets it was really nice to have something that was kind of like a binder you know so and I've seen people with three ring binders or you know they rip Pages out of something and shove it into their Book of Shadows it's not just a book of bound papers it's all loose leaf or things that they kind of stick together spoiler alert Ila probably had a Trapper Keeper when she was a younger person I did did I love it I loved my Traer keeper hey you probably did too actually no I didn't but I was always the person who had like like a fan folder inside my backpack you did not like one of those accordion folders I like organization I love that I like to be discreetly see I like to be fashionable organized that sounds like you perfect right right books of Shadows have come a long way from the time where we were just grabbing any old diary off the shelf they are specifically books of Shadows and they look gorgeous you know I like the Hocus Pocus one with the ey on it and here in Salem you can actually buy blank books of Shadows that look just like the Hocus Pocus one with an eye on it they're rather cool I'm just saying can't do it look so you can get a really fancy one you can get one that's beautiful that calls to you I have a hard time resisting a good Journal I love them they're definitely addicting once because you find one and you're like I love that and you're like but wait I love that one too I'll get them both I'll fill them both up now if you're a crafty witch you can get stickers and cover the top with stickers you can decoupage them I've seen the coolest thing with a glue gun where you take your book cover and you draw on it with hot glue from a glue gun so you could make that eye from book from hogus pogus or you can make a symbol or a Sigil or something and then paint over it and you've got a really cool looking book now I know you're going to remember this because this was freaking hysterical you know how like these places will send you free stickers in the mail yes so one time I had gotten these free stickers in the mail about the same time I was getting a new book of shadows because I had filled up other ones I know what book you're talking about and they had these stickers on it that said Church activity so I covered my whole book of shadows with these stickers that said Church activity they're still on it to this day and every time I look at the cover of that I just get a little chuckle on the inside grab onto your broomstick witches back after these messages hey all you witches pagans heathens and magical Souls shell and I want to give a big thank you to all of our donating patrons and we want to remind you that if you become a donating Patron before April 8th we'll be doing a drawing for a tarot reading by shell during the solar Clips all you need to do is sign up to donate to the show by April 8th thank you so much to everyone who's donating to back on the broomstick it really helps out the show keep it witchy see you can do anything with your book of shadows cover it in fabric cover it in church activity stickers whatever you want to do but I really am digging those leather ones that have like the I don't know what it is like carved out isn't really the word but it's like oh yeah sculpted leather yeah yeah those are really nice those are gorgeous those are gorgeous but you know what guess what a spiral notebook from CVS works just as well yes I am definitely partial to handmade paper I really like it it makes me feel very witchy when I'm writing on it and to be honest anything that helps you in your journaling practice go for it if you need the pretty book if you want to decorate it yourself if you want the handmade paper you know if you want to use it like a scrapbook or a journal whatever is going to get you to use your book of shadows to write your magical progress your witchy progress your spiritual progress in it is good because I really do think it's a vital part of any witch's practice now you know that I hate this more than anything for a multitude of reasons which I will mention in a moment but let's talk about the elephant in the room digital books of Shadows yes okay I am a big guilty guilty guil guilty of digital books of Shadows yes I talk about writing in journals and I have lots of handwritten journals I also have a huge ginormous Book of Shadows that's so big it has its own external hard drive and I'm not a fan at all yeah so and there's a lot of ways that you can keep them digitally and there's a lot of advantages in my opinion that they have freaking control all delete and that shit's gone what's the advantage to that like what if there's an accident what if if your laptop gets crushed by elephants what if Google goes down and you've lost your Google Drive like there's just so many factors a book I can hold I can caress it I can love it and rub it and make sure it's safe I can't do that with a digital book and my hard drive of Shadows is beautiful and I love it and I have it in triplicate because we all know that three is a very sacred magical number right so it lives on my laptop it lives on my external hard drive and it also lives in Google Drive so I have it in three different places the reason I do that's a lot of freaking work man no actually it just saves there it's not a lot of work it's not and the reason I do that is because back in the day when we had Circle amarra and I was The Keeper of the online website and the online book of shadows I had a ton of information and we were constantly putting it up on that website I was continuously putting things up there and then it disappeared I was was going to say remember the time you lost it for 15 years yes I have it back it took a while but I have it back so you're not entirely wrong my children grew up and graduated high school and college by the time she got it back it's true that's true but I did get it and now everything is in triplicate but the advantage of having it online is the sheer amount of data that you can have sometimes I just don't feel like writing it out and you can add pictures like sometimes I'm like man I wish I could just take that picture and add it to my book of shadows as reference so you got me on that I'll give you that and and and I do love in a book of shadows where you print things out and stick it in there that's nice too but it is super easy in a digital Book of Shadows to to put all your pictures there take a picture of the spell keep it with the spell list keep it with the ritual you can search it when you ask me to find something I'm like yeah give me like two days and I'll get back to you yeah right and because I've written them because you've written them you probably have a good general idea of where it is but digitally I can call that up in a heartbeat as well as several other articles or interesting things that have similar keywords whereas I can sometimes be like well I know what book that might be written in but it does lack some of the the personalization of handwriting and for me I remember it better if I write it out by hand right so you know there's nothing wrong shell has some very valid points you don't want to lose your book of shadows you know it there's some negatives to devastated I feel like I like lost a half of my brain yep so keeping it digitally is one way to do it some people use different notes apps one note you could do it on Google Drive you can do it on your phone whatever works whatever works for you so you can do it with a pre-made book you can do it with a a book you make or a book you buy you can do it digitally another thing that I like to do and some people are going to think this is blasphemy throw it at me write in your books isn't that what you get them for well no I meant like write in your books by authors oh my God why would you do that what's wrong with you no you should I think you should take that copy that you have I wish people could see my face like now I'm not saying every single one you know if you got a first addition of drawing down the moon or something you're probably not going to want to write in that however you know if you've got a copy of Matt ain's psychic witch or whatever right in the margins especially if there's a spell or if there's a a meditation or a lesson that you're doing highlight that write in the margins use those as a book of shadows as well I have books that are 30 35 years old that I didn't even let the bindings get bent in and they look like they're in Min brand new condition and you're talking about writing in them I know I am an absolute book Fiend I love books I search them out you're the kid who has mustard stains on the pages that's you well I wouldn't go that far but I would say that they're well-loved and they're used and I do think that you should be able to take them with you use them just like your book of shadows you know write in them obviously if you have a classic and you know it's expensive then don't write in it but everything else write in it you know make sure that you write your notes you need to write how it worked for you you're not yes that's true I have recently come across an interesting and this is not something I've tried but an interesting other way that folks are keeping books of shads and that is voice recordings almost like an audio diary or an A not a diary but like an audio Journal of sorts don't we call this podcast a uh spoken word grimoire right all I could think of is that you know sitting there talking in your phone but that's not a bad idea the problem is is you got to make sure you listen back to that just like you write all this down you got to go back and reference back to it or play it for something that has a transcription option I believe that um you open up a Google a Google doc gives you the option to transcribe yeah so then you can just play it and have it transcribed there that might work but I think that's a good idea oh actually that's a cool idea one of my biggest problems with a book of shadows with any Journal typically what putting the first thing in it oh my God I stress about that that gives me anxiet done with page one after page one I don't give a what happens after that but that first page that like you open and then what because they're so perfect you know an Unwritten in Book of Shadows is beautiful it's pristine it's perfect everything is wonderful I'm so afraid I'm G to ruin it if I don't do it just right I either started with a poem um I did my initiation spell is one of them for one of my books you know something kind of meaningful that I don't want to say sets the tone but kind of sets the tone for that book because every book has a different tone so whatever is going to set the tone for that book like the one I I've talked about a couple of times now that's like half moon magic and half dragon magic I have this like beautiful poem written in there about like dragons you know flying through the moon and stuff like so it's kind of it sets the tone for my magic writings that are in that particular book yep I've kind of fallen into that same thing as well my very first book of shadows had the charge of the Goddess as the first page and all the rest of them tend to have a quote like you said to kind of set the tone usually I'll find some type of quote or something like that that sets it that way or sometimes I'll just free form write I have a couple journals where the first page I just kind of get into a meditative State you know use candles if you like incense if you like but just kind of get in into a nice calm balanced meditative state with your pen and that paper and then just start writing and then just let it flow and I have two or three journals that I started that way that's hard for me because the anxiety is high so if I'm able to calm myself down and do that it works otherwise I go with tried and true I usually like you said a poem or a quote it is so stressful on how to like open a book how do you how do you open this next chapter of your magical journey that's some stress I've skipped the first page before just to be a and promised myself I'll go back and put something wicked cool there and I think and at least I can show you right now I'm pretty sure this one I have nothing in the first page that's funny that's funny because was afraid I've done symbols and sigils as a first page though before too you know symbols that meant something to me and put some sigils in there that had meaning to me of again setting the tone for that book so I've done it that way too where I've just kind of drawn out some you know some runes different symbols things of that nature so really whatever floats your boat now this question has been asked by a couple different listeners but have we ever consecrated or blessed a book of shadows and if so how do you do that is that important and how do you do it I got a good way to bless someone with your book of Shadow does it involve throwing it at their forehead kind of a little bit maybe you know I've kind of done maybe I guess when I first get it I kind of do this here we are you are my new book I am your new writer what are we mapping out but like I don't do it like every time I open it I don't know if I consecrate it per se but I'd say I maybe have a a conversation with it yeah I definitely did my first one I think as I was creating my first one and putting my magical name and stickers along the spine and putting everything on there I did bless it with oil I had some type of blessing oil I had it in Sacred Space in circle something very simple yeah I've never done that yeah I think the very first time hey I was extra I was a teen man what do you want there were candles exra what are you talking about I like to be a little extra sometimes it's fun but yeah I think whatever works for you because you know you you went kind of a little extra and I didn't necessarily but I don't think that that makes yours or mine any greater or lesser it's just whatever works for you yeah I think I only ever did it with the first one and then after that I think just the act of choosing it and then like you said kind of sitting with it that first time and flipping through it and just being like ah this is my fresh new journal and just feeling it in my hands and just kind of getting comfortable with it getting to know it and I guess that kind of goes back to the anxiety of that first page because it's like you are officially setting in stone and the relationship you and this you know that the journey that you and this book are going to go on yeah that's that's what's that's what's up with first page anxiety it feels weighty but it does get better once you're able to put something down on that page or skip it entirely usually you're able to just go right ahead and I don't have the world's best handwriting and I can't draw for however I will draw things in my book of shadows I give that up I set that ego at the door and when I'm in my book of shadows I know this is for me it's highly personal so whatever I want to put in there if I want to draw some weird little spiral I'll draw it and I'll even go back sometimes with colored pencils or colored pens and add in details and things like that but I try not to worry about whether my handwriting is perfect or if I have to cross something out or not ain't no published works here folks you're not sending this off to an editor by any stretch you know even if you've got horrible handwriting still do it right you know the the goddess is not going to be looking over my shoulder onto my book of shadows and being like oh honey your handwriting does not cut it you're just out you know that's that's not going to happen it's just yours if you can share it if you want but Book of Shadows typically very personal right if you're involved in a coven particularly if it's a Wiccan coven there might be a coven Book of Shadows or a coven grimoire that your high priest or high priestess will have um and that will sometimes get like if a daughter coven hives off they will take a copy of that grimoire or Book of Shadows and that's usually something like we said earlier that is a little more formal it's a little more like a textbook that'll have more like rules of the coven guidelines this is the way the coven calls a circle this is how a coven does these spells lay out the Traditions right so that'll be a little more formal and if you're lucky enough to get a book of shadows or a grimoire handed down to you those are very cool not very common but very very cool you know kind of going back to an old episode um where we we talked to the author Jamie Dela about a book called a box of magic that's actually what happened to her her her friend SL Mentor passed away and after a good long chunk of time like a little more than a decade if I'm not mistaken she just get this box at her door full of her Mentor old books of Shadows that to me would have been gold man C you know if you've got your granny's old recipe box that's got you know that's got your cough syrup in it or it's got something for you know aches and pains or whatever in it that's just as good I think all those old recipes absolutely and I do actually have like you know how I'm sure your grandma did the same thing and your mother the index cards with the I actually have a wooden box full of index cards that were both of my my grandmothers I have some of my great-grandmothers some of my mothers and that's almost like I look at that as almost like a Kitchen Witch Book of Shadows you know like I have the books of Shad I have that one book of shadows that's split between Moon magic and dragon magic that box is like Kitchen Magic I love that that's gold right there that's beautiful you know to have something like that handed down that's fantastic and I'm lucky enough that a lot of those recipes are actually written in my grandmother's uh and my mother's handwriting and so that kind of makes it extra special hopefully not in pencil right not in pencil now I said at the beginning of the episode that I had a kind of fun fact about Book of Shadows okay tell me tell me right so the term Book of Shadows people are pretty sure was a creation of Gerald Gardner now Gerald Gardner back in 1949 published a book called high Magic's Aid and it was about which craft in the Medieval era in that book he does not mention anywhere the word Book of Shadows so Dorian Valente tells a story about when this book was published in 1949 there was an advertisement for high Magic's Aid that came out in a magazine called The Occult Observer and in the occult Observer so there's one page that has Gerald Gardner's book High Magic's Aid advertised directly on the opposite page was an advertisement for something by an author named Mir Basher and he was talking about a Sanskrit divination method that involved measuring people's shadows and it was called The Book of Shadows and bente says that Gardner thought that that was such a cool term that he adopted the term Book of Shadows for a witch's personal magical Journal you know that sounds like something he would do right so after that after his book came out so roughly 1949 Gardner came up with the term Book of Shadows and again it was mostly because of an advertisement that was opposite his book in The Occult Observer so there you go no that was like 75 years ago wow right so that's where the term Book of Shadows came from 1949 is by Gerald Gardner so are you telling me then that the word and the term gmar predate that oh yes absolutely I'm not big on word origins I'm sorry but I'm just curious is this something is was grimoire kind of the for lack of a better phrase the ancient name for it yes grimoire is a French word kind of related to the word grammar and it used to refer to any book that was uh any book that was written or any book that was written in Latin okay I gotcha and then it started to become associated you know Latin like the magical language magicians write in Latin then right so grimoire or grammar started to become associated with books of magic so yeah that came in like the 19th century I think so it's a couple hundred years old nice okay okay Grim came first stuck yep Book of Shadows came next and honestly people pretty much use them interchangeably right and journaling came in between that's right journaling is important all around magical journaling mundane journaling Journal everything that's what I say so that's pretty much it I think we've covered the topic of books of Shadows grimoire magical journals from cover cover nice nice pun I did there yeah you like that yeah I like the pun I like the pun cover to cover well I was bound by your comments oh very good I like that stop us now I know this is
