tap into your inner magic grab your cauldron light some candles and get ready for a spellbinding episode on reconnecting with that witchy way of life and of course getting back on the broomstick so you know getting back into this sometimes when you you get caught up in everyday life you get caught up in work you get caught up in parenting sometimes you get caught up in a nap you know I would hope to get caught up in a nap I mean finding time for relaxation is really hard but you know then you start laying there after a while and you're like oh you know I see the moon out the window as I lay on my pillow you feel you all of a sudden realize you're disconnected and you're like I've been disconnected for a while but it's almost like you get so caught up in the dayto day you didn't even realize you were disconnected until you were ready to reconnect does that make sense that does make sense you know I think I felt that way too as I was drifting a little bit away I I just kept getting busier and busier with family and and we kept moving and and jobs and things like that and I I didn't even realize that it had kind of slipped as far away as it had until I'm all the way across the country and I'm trying to find community and it's nowhere to be found and it's difficult and and that's when I realized how far away I had gotten from my magical practice and I really really wanted to reconnect with it when we first started learning about magic and getting into our magical practices everything was Hands-On there was nothing pre-made for you you know we made our own cloaks and we made our own magical robes and dresses we made our own candles and incense and even as those things became more readily available we still like to kind of get our hands dirty and make our own magical tools and items you and I have always been Crafty Witches we like to make things and so for us kind of making a spell jar or a simmer pot or making some in circles you back in yeah that's kind of you know I can do that intentionally and I I have my moments of being a doer and somehow it it just all of a sudden made me be a doer I started getting these jars I love these little spell jars and you know I've always kind of been a herb mixer an herbal magician to go back to our first episode you are an herbal witch in many ways right but I like mixing things and even though it wasn't necessarily all herbs I just all of a sudden got into these spell jars you know you're you're flipping through Facebook you're flipping through Tik Tok and Instagram and you're like I can do that and I can do that way cooler and I just started doing it and that kind of snowballed it you know like we talked about I also somehow out of nowhere got smacked in the face with that damn freaking wrer weight Tarot deck you and that Rider weight Tarot deck that and your simmer pots I think the simmer pots those thing is they really kind of started catching me in the winter time I can't really get into a simmer Po in the summer is that a me thing does that no no no no I'm the same way fall right around Thanksgiving and and through the rest of that until maybe just until the beginning of Spring and then it's no more nobody wants sim a simmer pot in June well what's a simmer pot that's in our in our wheel of the year in our other podcast you've talked about those so with the simmer pots what I had done this was back kind of late fall early winter I had put in sliced up oranges I had put in sliced up apples which by the way I made sure I cut them in the direction that the pentacle of seeds was there oh yeah so into your pot on the stove you put you get that all set with your liquid like your cider or your apple juice so you know I actually start it with water I do the sliced oranges the sliced apples and then I do cinnamon sticks now how do you slice them so you see the pentacle I would I wish I had a visual here so like if you're holding the apple and the core is on top you're slicing sideways not up and down slice horizontally yeah so you slice through the side you got all the good words horizontally but yeah when you cut it that way there's a five-pointed star in the center of the Apple so when whenever I do a summer po I make sure they're cut that way because well I want the pentacle there for the Magic Man and I just I just let it cook down and cook down and cook down the first couple of times what I did did was I was like okay so I'm going to start my little magic potion I kind of went back to being a kid you know when you're a kid you make everything a magic potion I did I had so many backyard spells and Bruise it wasn't even funny you turn mud puddles into potion so I went back to being like a five-year-old kid and I'm just tossing this in the pot I'm kind of like doing that I'm making my magic I'm bringing my magic back so then when I was done I strained it out and drank it as in a trying to create my magic again and then drinking it down it probably would have been a lot better if I used cider or wasel but it really wasn't too shabby as a water base that's a really cool way to actually internalize a spell and how fun and delicious you know incense and those simmer pots for me have been a good way to intentionally try to set my space you know when I know that I want to be intentional and in a magical presence that light incense around my house and setting a simmer pot is even better because just like you said you can do things like make sure that the pentacle is showing and put in elements that are going to smell good but also correspond to the quarters and correspond to the intention that you want to set and then your home is permeated with this magic with this scent and then afterwards if you're able to drink it if you've put all you know things that you're able to eat in it it's another way to internalize that magic and to kind of bring that energy literally inside and that's why I pointed out that the the first couple of batches I did that way because I had done later batches um especially more towards Ule and stuff where they weren't so drinkable like when we put up our our tree we put up our Christmas tree yes I'm a witch who celebrates Christmas we're out here people oh we'll talk about that some time Christmas is Ule I mean it's the Christians that are actually celebrating Ule not the other way around right so you know how you got to like trim and trim to make it all fit in the stand or trim from the top so it ain't dragging on your ceiling I would do a similar orange Apple that was usually my base no matter what I made I don't know for me personally a simmer prop base is orange apple and cinnamon and you can take it from there if you choose to I was putting in the sprigs like little sticks from my tree with the pine needles that would add such a lovely pine scent yeah don't drink that yeah so you know I was adding stuff on occasion that I wouldn't necessarily drink we were out walking and you know how I don't even know what they are those red berries that are poisonous that deer eat that you shouldn't eat I picked a bunch of those off when we out had gone out walking and put them in one time again not drinking that one so what your ingredients generally are is going to depend on how you want to you know sometimes i' would just dump it out after yeah yeah pour it in your garden or intentionally return it to the Earth you know if you have a compost pile or something like that that's a great way to to return that energy and to allow that to kind of be reclaimed claimed by the Earth but then I got the wacky idea so I'm looking at these spell jars on Tik Tock and Instagram and all that and I'm like hey why don't I take a few nibbits of my simmer pot and make a little spell jar out of what I've simmered so like I got a little pieces of the apples and I always would put the you know I didn't core them out because I wanted the little Pentacle there so there'd be seeds in there so I'd grab a little apple seed some of the pieces of disintegrated o orange I'd break off some cinnamon and I'd put it in a little spell jar and then seal that with wax what a perfect way to keep that energy know if you've done that spell simmer pot what a fabulous way to kind of keep that energy around it all started with feeling guilty about dumping it and I know the whole return it to the Earth blah blah blah but I still felt guilty about dumping it so hey you know we're Frugal witches too we can't waste everything I mean I did dispose of most of it but I that first spell jar I I got back into was with a little jar from a simmer po that I kept very cool I love that and you know I've started making some spell jars using these small glass jars I get from the weed store very good recycling reduce reuse recycle right right right but they're a little big for your traditional very small spell jars but I like them a lot for very pretty decorative jars you know a little bit of colored sand or salt on the bottom you know layer them with some natural items with your spell written on a parchment maybe a crystal and they make a very nice large they're not that large but visual reminder very pretty you know what else is a good addition to a spell jar I've been getting into you know how you can get those like little tiny tiny tiny tiny miniature rer weight tarot decks I love those they're so adorable those are so cute not functional for a tarot reading not really you can actually use cards from those in spell jars now that's a fabulous use for those what a great use for those yeah and obviously you're not putting the whole deck in a spell jar yeah but one card would really amp up the Magic in a spell jar wow that's great you can put anything in there it doesn't have to be liquid it doesn't have to be sand or salt you know you can put in little branches and Stones I have spell jars I have a spell jar right here that's nothing but Moon water and Stones like little you know how you can get those like chips chip Stones it's it's moonwater and Chip Stones there's my spell jar nothing fancy and it Tinkles I like how it Tinkles makes a very nice noise your simmer pots and intuitive Magic on the Fly are examples of how differently from ourselves when we you know first started as witches as well as again being opposites to each other and another example of that is that you and I are again taking slightly different from past this time around you're kind of getting back into you know you likened it to being very open very fairy likee very Fay you're just kind of feeling the magic and going with it and whereas I'm feeling like I need a little more I needed a little more regimented I need to write things down I need to do the quarter calls flop happen I don't know this is like an exact flip-flop from us from like how funny is that because I was always the foot loose and head the clouds and follow my intuition which and you were the write it all down write it all down here's the rules here's the quarter call here are the correspondences and and now we literally have swapped places and I I think I need that to balance my my Aquarian head in the clouds you know too brainy for my own good I need a little bit of that regimentation in my life that's what's helping me feel connected whereas you kind of need to let loose and that's funny because I had thought the same thing I'm like that's exactly what my crazy Gemini ass needs I used to do it in such a bookwork kind of way trust me I've got the books of Shadows stacked up to Pro but I did it in a very methodical journaling bookwork kind of way and I was you know you were always the Foot Loose Fancy free is I'm the one following behind you jotting it down in the Book of Shadows you know I need that balance of who cares if I write that down I don't need to write it down whatever man right and and I always felt like I was in the flow it was so Primal and I'm in the magic and doing it and just kind of experiencing and feeling and I think I now need to balance that part you know just having that part isn't enough anymore and so for you having the regimented magical part isn't enough anymore so it it's not just a finding reconnecting with the path it's also finding that balance within ourselves so it's it's yeah it's not just reconnecting it's balancing it's rebalancing ourselves and it's Reinventing the way we do magic personally yes because I'm sure that you're finding this out and and and it's kind of weird some of this stuff is when you're looking at it from that perspective I know that you are looking at things very different and methodical because I've been there and I've thought of it that way it's different it's very different than what you know and kind of doing it this way for me the whole foot loose and fancy free not a care in the world way is just very it's different but it's good yes it feels very powerful it's almost like you're trying to gain control and I'm trying to let go of control yeah yeah and and and I think finding that space finding that Center within us is beautiful it's very magical and it's it's starting over again it's starting at the beginning and looking at this path that I thought I was familiar with with completely different eyes totally different perspective yeah and it's so freaking beautiful to have that path I'm familiar with that chaos the magic the you know the dance under the Moonlight with the fire at your feet and you know the fairies in the woods and to just kind of go with it and to now see it through a little bit more of ceremonial magic and through journaling and through really being methodical with it it's just opening up so many new Pathways and it's it's beautiful we're on the right track man we're back on the broomstick we're back on the broomstick and back to the basics in so many ways reconnecting by relearning nothing fancy simple circles and spells simple invocations familiar tarot decks we must be in an alternate timeline because you're using the rwe Tarot deck you know the tide has shifted somehow someway the stars have reformed if I'm using that damn deck and enjoying it that's the key I know you're loving it I'm glad you're sitting down because if I would have said that when you were standing up you probably would have fallen over you know actually at this point I'm used to you bringing up the writer weight Tarot deck because You' have just been absolutely loving this deck and I'm loving that you kind of went back to the beginning which is matching it's another cycle that kind of matches what we're doing right now tell this is our year it is so many little synchronicities you know so many little things and and I love when that happens speaking of synchronicities to go on a little tangent guess that's one of the things that people notice in manifestation and in magic when you start to align your energy with something that you want or with something you're working towards if you're on the right path you'll start to see those signs everywhere you know I don't want to simplify it but like equate it to weight loss you know you're sitting there with your B and& Jerry's and you're all kind of sad and then you're like one day you're just like you know what I'm just gonna do it and whatever you do walk sit-ups join a gym whatever you're kind of down in the dumps but the minute you see results you freaking are like oh man I'm on this train same with magic you know you're kind of like uh how do I do this you know am I doing this right you know but this book says if I skip this step yeah but the minute you start seeing results none of that matters and you just take off with it that's a really really good point that you mentioned is that sometimes when you want to do something you know when you make that wish I want to have a better job nothing happens but when that moment is right and you feel it and you feel that shift in energy you feel your whole body align with I want this job I want a better job then things start to fall in your lap your friend says oh by the way my company's hiring and you'd be perfect for that job you put your application in and you meet the hiring manager and it happens to be someone you were friends with when you were you know in high school and and things just kind of start to fall into place when it's right and when you align yourself properly with that energy but I think where sometimes people go wrong as they think that magic is just wishes well I wished for it and didn't happen so magic is a bunch of magic just like everything else there there it's a little more than wishes there's manifestation and depending on what you're going for is going to depend on that manifestation and for what you were saying with a job the manifestation piece on your part is you gotta fix that cover letter fix that resume and you got to turn that in because if you don't turn you got to be in it to win it first of all it's like the lottery you got to be in it to win it so you miss 100% of the shots that you don't take right you know the Stars might align but the Stars can align a thousand times and if you don't submit your resume it doesn't matter that's right if you're not standing in that spot with your CV in hand you're not getting that job whether the stars are aligned or not so magic isn't just wishes there is that manifestation piece and that goes with any religion you know same with Catholicism you know it's more than just praying it's so true you got to do a little bit more than just praying and and it's the same concept so true manifestation is more than just simply wishing or asking for something manifestation is an act of bringing your desires into reality through the power of aligning everything about you with the universe everything that you're asking for it means aligning your thoughts feelings your actions your magical self all of it with the energy of what you want to achieve and once you're in complete alignment with that that's when you tap into the universal forces that can kind of bring that to life but just simply wishing or asking the universe for it is definitely not enough so for example I'm working on manifesting a year of magical reconnection and new magical connections and as part of that practice I'm writing every day in a book of shadows just a simple meditative daily practice and that helps to kind of bring me more in alignment with my goals with my desires so for me journaling every day in a book of shadows has been a tool to help me manifest those goals Book of Shadows I think are very important especially you know when you are learning and finding your way and trying to find out what traditions work for you what types of rituals work for you write it all down because maybe it was great this time or maybe it sucked so you can go back to it and know what parts didn't work besides being nostalgic it's almost like you're creating your own textbook not too long ago I was like oh you know let me do a spell for this and then I'm like I forgot because it's been a while I just go right back and I did it exactly the way we did it 20 years ago word for word it's right there I love that it's right there that is exactly what I have decided to do as my as my daily thing to kind of reconnect with my Pagan craft with my you know reconnect to deity reconnect to Witchcraft I have started in a brand new book of shadows because I love me a new book of the Shadows brand new Journal nothing more magical to me I have a hard time writing in it for the first time but I honestly I have like a stack of journals because I buy them because I love them and then I can't write in them because as soon as you write in them like it's a commitment you're a weirdo I know Mrs I have 165 decks of tarot 163 stop joking so I have a small stack of journals I haven't written in I have a brand new grimoire for this year and I'm just writing a little bit every day I just you know nothing big I found that if I try to write my whole day out I won't do it but I tell myself I just write a little affirmation every day if I just journal every day I'm finding that I'm actually doing quite a bit more than that I'm putting in little spells that I might think of or or the astrological correspondences for the day you know what a weird thing is that I do too what's that and I don't know if you've ever done this actually we've never talked about this since I've been trying to Circle back to tarot every couple of days I'll pull a couple cards and I will write out the whole maybe not do the whole interpretation write out but like this was the spread and these were the cards and where they were and then I put the date on it I love that and actually I've done that for a long time and what sparked the idea was going back into my old books of Shadows where I realized I had been doing that and looking back and hindsight 2020 I was looking back at like a card spread I did in like 2012 and now knowing years later what I was going through at that point I'm like oh yeah that made sense I just wasn't listening when the cards were telling me so retrospectively it was very interesting to have it written down but if you do do it consistently when you're working on change and when you're working on on different things you can use those to go back and kind of reflect your path I love putting in regular self tarot readings or regular you know if I do a meditation where I'm trying to do a divination or I'm trying to to set intentions I love writing those down and I every year I do a tarot reading for the year in January for myself and I write that down in my journal and so having that in my magical journal for this year is I'm trying to really reconnect with that daily practice that's a wonderful thing to do yeah and it can really help you can do that for anything for herbs crystals your tarot cards your runes you know whatever you have that you want to kind of reinforce pull something for yourself for the day and then write about that card or write about that Crystal well that's what I was going to say with crystals you know maybe you could pick a crystal you know either every day or every week or every month or whatever your motivational level is and just spend that amount of time working with it learning it writing stuff down about it color correspondences quarter correspondences Planet correspondences holiday correspondences spell correspondences you know like like figure that out for each thing whether it's tarot or Stones you know whatever the case may be and you don't have to write it out by hand if typing is your thing type it print it out or just keep it online make your book of shadows online do whatever works for you that you're going to be able to touch and do daily or at least put in your magical workings you know when you do that full moon ritual when you do that spell write it down make sure that you keep track of what you're doing because the act of writing it in your book of shadows will not only help you stay connected to the magic like shell said it's a wonderful thing to look back on 20 years from now you are going to be amazed at the different things that you wrote down and forgot about and don't think there's a right or wrong way because as much as Leila and I talk about you know we physically write our stuff out and always have that's that's our mojo you know that don't have to be your flavor because as much as we have our own personal books handwritten we also our old Cuffin Book of Shadows was all typed up absolutely printed everything out we put it remember those clear plastic covers I do I love that our cuen book of shadow was essentially a three- ring binder which by the way I still have again something else that I lost in the flood that I am so grateful that you have shell is your freaking packrat for all things I love you so much have I said that lately shell I love you I love you all right thank you so much for joining us on back on the broomstick this is going to be a weekly podcast every Friday from here on out where we're going to talk about all things witchy and Pagan and get into spells and our favorite crystals and herbs and little bit of tarot even if you're good kids oh yeah we're going to touch on divination and Tarot shell and I are both tarot readers from way back more than happy to get our hands dirty in that we'll have interviews with some Pagan authors with some different people that are up and coming in the witchy world and we're going to tell you a little bit about our path and where we started and all the witchy magic we went through to get where we are so stay tuned for stories and tidbits about our life kind of laugh along with us as we learn and grow and kind of get back into the witchy thing and uh watch us get back on the broomstick
