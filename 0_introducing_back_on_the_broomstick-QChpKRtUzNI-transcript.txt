hey witches hey I'm shell and I'm Lea and welcome to back on the broomstick a conversation of Life Witchcraft and our journey to reclaim our spiritual selves podcast about witchcraft today we're a podcast all about being witchy women and you know sometimes breaks happen and we're back on the broomstick we want to talk about Witchcraft and spellwork and Tarot and spirituality and maybe a dab of astrology I don't know we'll see how it goes on our other podcast we talk a lot about our coven and the different things that we did the festivals we went to the the presentations that we did the the tarot parties and we went to colleges and we had all just badass rituals we did together badass rituals for hundreds of people that we facilitated and and being very involved in a witchy magical scene and then pretty much at the same time we both stopped life intervened we got busy dorcy and we just had to go dormant for a while you know kids life work it happens big time dormy I mean we went from being baby witches just discovering all this magic to ramping up and being so involved in everything and and doing spellwork and full moon and Dark Moon and all of these different things and then we were gaining this like East Coast notoriety and then all of a sudden we were like I got stuff to do I got kids man I've got a husband I've got a job oh I'm busy you know and then intruded and I've lost touch with my Pagan Community I've lost touch with my coven I've lost touch with my witchy friends and I've lost touch with the goddess oh yeah okay I was trying to avoid that part that yeah I lost touch with deity with goddess with with all of that and I I tried like i' I'd put some incense together or I'd do a little spell or i' i' cleanse my Tarot deck or charge my crystals and then I wouldn't do anything for a long time yeah you know I I I did the same thing I even I even went so far um at the early stages of uh covid I went and got my raiki master certification what the hell did have I done with it so far I stayed you know it was like it was like this roller coaster of up and down you know I'd feel it and then I'd be like oh I got stuff and then I'd feel it and then i' be like oh I got stuff and then some weird twist to F you and I just both kind of cosmically were like hey I've been kind of feeling lately and we're like no you too you to and here we are and here we are back on the broomstick back on the broomstick back into that witchy life back into reading all the new books and seeing this explosion on social media of people finding or reconnecting to Witchcraft we are not the only people who were practicing in the '90s and the 2000s that are now like we need to reconnect here we yeah who who had this big magical life back when it it was more in the broom closet and now it's so out and it's wonderful and accessible and I it's a great time to come back to paganism and I'm loving all the resources all the people and all the things that are out there that we can see and I'm very excited to bring people Along on our journey of Discovery on our journey of reconnecting to them we can't be the only people who've had this happen no other people have have had to have had this sort of EB and flow of connection and through no fault of anything and we're not going to shame anybody for how you got disconnected or reconnected but it happens and you and I can't be the only ones oh of course not there's got to be more of us out there but we're gonna talk about bringing it back you know how can you how can you reconnect bringing it back because we're not the only ones no and you know we are not the only ones who sometimes let our faith and our beliefs our paganism our that whole mindset kind of it's it's easy to be like well I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it later I'll light that candle and do that meditation in the morning right and then morning I have all these great ideas at night nighttime me is like I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna do yoga and I'm going to meditate and I'm going to make tea and I'm going to get out my crystals and I'm going to set my intention for the day and then you wake up 20 minutes before work and off you go and then I wake up in the morning and I'm like that from last night she's crazy she doesn't know what she's talking about I got to do I got to do I'm grabbing a monster and I'm running out the door right you know and I don't want to do that anymore I want to take that step I want to I want to find witchy me again I know she's in there I want to find the goddess again I want to walk in her footsteps again we all were able to make time and figure it out before and somehow we felt too overwhelmed to figure it out and we have figured it back out again and we're working it back in and you know maybe it's some of that in our other podcast the stoned which is our we were doing our new moon cycle that's kind of how we used to do it and I think it kind of sucked us back in to be a little bit corny I think the world is crying out for this connection and I think that's why so many people are realizing oh I'm a witch or I'm Pagan or I'm Heathen and really feeling that connection to the Earth and to the goddess and to the gods and it's not you know this isn't anything about you know having lost Faith or or questioning faith it wasn't that at all it was more about you know marriage divorce kids you know grandkid work me personally I move States I mean States multiple times you know and and you and I each have two kids that you know we we're parenting and and even though our kids are older now you don't stop being a mom you know you don't stop being so just just life happened so it wasn't about a disbelief or or or anything like that it was just about we had gotten worn down and had a lot on our plate and and exactly and it something had to give something had to give and unfortunately you know that was our connection to a daily practice and to being that witchy person and for whatever reason we didn't feel like or we just didn't have the energy or the time for it and I remembered what I was going to say about our Dark Moon episode we were talking about cycles and how little Cycles in your life are similar to bigger Cycles in your life and that kind of period of going Inward and having a different Focus that didn't disconnect us from the goddess but it kind of shifted Focus towards other things and now that cycle is changing yet again that that cycle that wheel is turning the ticks of the wheel as you would say are coming around again and so I want to honor this was just a bigger Circle this time around yes bigger Circle a big Circle and now we're right back to where we began almost seeking and learning and beginning all over again with like the eyes of a new witch you know a brand new witch and I there's just so much out there and I I I'm excited to kind of share this weird feeling of being the old powerful High Priestess I have commanded rituals of hundreds of people called down the goddess countless times but now all of a sudden we're like we're like a cross between that and a baby witch I'm like what candle do I use what incense again wait a minute what quarter was that my thing is is you know I get online and you know I'm looking on Instagram and I'm on Facebook and I'm on Tik Tok and I'm looking and I'm like oh my God I need to get back in my game and catch up should I even tell people that like we used to do these classes and and teach workshops and as you say command rituals for hundreds of people because it almost sounds ridiculous to me right now I don't know I just I I I almost feel like like that was so long ago maybe it's a confidence thing you know what it was I I haven't done a tarot reading for someone else especially a stranger in years and years and years and then we did our episode of the stoned Witches Hour and kind of on the Fly not that you threw me under the bus because you didn't um but you were like hey Shell you want to do this reading for our special guest I totally did throw you under the on that one yeah I'll do it and that was actually the first time I had read for a stranger in probably 10 years no if not closer to 15 years that was the first time W oh and you nailed it like the two of I just kind of had this feeling you pulled this deck out I'm like I feel like it needs to be Shell's deck and it was such a beautiful reading I loved it it felt the energy there was just like when we used to do ritual together was C when they started tearing up and in the whole and and and I don't know if you remember but they were they were starting to try to give me some info and I'm like nope I don't want to hear it let me finish and that that was because I needed I needed that I needed to know that I could do it that I still had it that I still had it and when I realized I still had it I was like no I still have it but that was the first time I had read for a stranger in 10 to 15 years and no you did not throw me under the bus and I didn't mean it that way no I know what you're saying but no I did feel you had that deck in your hands I mean I know we both had decks because we were talking about them but you had that deck in your hand and I just felt that that was your time that you needed to do that reading and I didn't realize it was for you I I think that ultimately that was for me that's awesome and and it's that sense of reconnecting that just kind of keeps happening I found that in my experience both way back in the day and now life the universe the goddess whatever you want to call it has a tendency to put you on a path as tarot readers we know that life is not predetermined but there's a path that you're on that's the most likely one and there often sometimes seem to be predetermined things that you're not going to avoid no matter what right past life lessons current life lessons Karma whatever it happens to be yes you have free will but there's some things that universe or whatever is going to throw at you that you have to deal with and and I think I think the spiritual break we took was one of those things I agree I agree and and deity has this way of if you're not on the right path things are hard it's difficult right and and you keep getting signs that you should be doing something different once you once you finally accept that and relinquish control and say okay I'll do it that way and you're going the right way everything kind of Falls in place and the signs start coming and you for example my husband is doing a project at work that has to do with a constellation in the sky that he named and now all of a sudden he's seeing that everywhere you know magical weird because when you've pointed out to me I've been like wow now I feel like I'm seeing it everywhere exactly and I do feel like the universe will do that for you when you're on the right path it might still be hard because difficulty is part of life and it's definitely part of magical growth but things will kind of flow you'll feel that flow even as it's hard you'll feel that flow you'll feel that you're moving in the right direction and if you're not if you're like I'm going to step out of this and do something different the goddess is going to slap you right upside the head make things a million times harder until you get back on the path you're supposed to be on right right and you know here's what I love the most about this whole story right now just the synchronicity that you and I are just in sync with all this we kind of flew out of it together you know we flew into it together we flew out of it together flew into it together flew out of it together and here we are flying back in on our broomstick exactly I I think what you know it when it comes to specifically tarot what did it for me and I think what got me back into the groove you know I'm a weirdo and I don't like to conform to the norm my beloved weirdo right like I would never touch a rer weight deck in my life I'm like that's so basic and like literally you know 30 years didn't touch a wrer weight deck I own a couple because as you know I'm an obsessive tarot collector what is it 164 now yeah nice so a few months back I I don't want to say I succumb to the writer weight but I kind of succumb to the writer weight and I I actually had to reconcile this Within Myself it actually had to be a conversation I'm like you know what if I'm going to get back into tarot damn it I am going to start with that writer weight deck now granted I got the writer weight Smith C mman Centennial one for the specific version if you're wondering I don't know what it was I shuffled those cards and it was like the switch just flipped back on and it was literally like a switch it was like it was off and then it was on there was no between there was no in between it was off and then it was on and that you know that absolutely happens sometimes I think it's because I reconciled the fact that I needed to go back to basics you know back in the 90s in the early 000s I was too good for the writer weight no I wasn't and I had to come to this point now to be like no you're not go pick up that rer weight deck and Shuffle it as soon as you gave into that things started to fall into place and that's when everything started magically kind of moving forward it's interesting because I think this is maybe the fifth time that you have brought up and apologized for the fact that you're using the rider weight deck and I think it's because you are still kind of like in crous inside yourself that you're like I can't believe I'm using the r or wave deck I can't I can't I can't and and so it's been quite a while that since you've told me first told me that you were and and I think you still are feeling very vulnerable about it because this is a vulnerable spot that we're in we are we are powerful witches man and here we are at the beginning again also reclaiming we're in a reclaiming stage that's right we're in and and being in that reclaim that Lial reclaiming space is vulnerable it's a vulnerable place to be in and it's also a very magical place to be in and kind of accepting that and accepting that vulner vulnerability is I think what's going to propel us forward in our magical practice and I think one thing that's also been difficult is we didn't have a hard time breaking into the scene 30 years ago and and and it's a different scene now and it's we're older we're different people it's a different scene and it's a hard scene to kind of break back into finding people in real life seems to be difficult I found quite a few people online you know I'm able to actively talk to other people online but finding that community in real life is surprisingly hard and surprisingly difficult and I think that's a a big shift that was happening when we were being reclusive is that shift was happening and it was like if you weren't already infiltrated in an in-person group it just became harder and harder and harder a lot of them turned online and then you throw you know a global pandemic into it and people are doing Zoom rituals and I'm not I'm not knocking Zoom rituals and things of that nature because there is definitely a use for it but you cannot replace in-person magic I agree oh I definitely 100% agree there's there's nothing there's nothing like it absolutely and and I think we're going to try and reclaim a little bit of that by being together here you know and try to bring some of that magic to this podcast with our voices kind of thing but but yeah you're right finding finding people in real life is going to for sure be a focus of at least one of our episodes because everyone wants to find that connection everyone wants to find that coven that they can work with so I think that that maybe the big takeaway here is that the witches are back I mean we're we're we're reclaiming we're rejuvenating and we want to share our journey of reclaiming with those that are on that same journey and are looking to f figure out how do I get back on the get get back in the game you know how do I how do I pull back into the circle how do I tell the goddess I'm back you know how do I get those quarters to remember me when I call you know yeah the thing the simple things you know what candle am I using what crystals do I use damn it or or you know just the simple things that we need to just get back to it's not that we don't remember it and know it we just have to get it back back into our daily life back into yeah and find out what new things people have discovered what's the new interesting thing I hear manifestation is huge if I see one more claw foot bathtub in the forest filled with flowers on Tik Tok I'm G to have a meltdown because I don't have one right you know and and what can you use instead of these expensive elaborate gorgeous setups that you see on social media right you know there there's so much more to it than that and uh you know we'll talk about all of it and hopefully you can follow us as we reclaim our witchy ways as we walk this path towards an uncertain future but back towards the goddess and back towards Witchcraft and ritual and all of it and we hope that maybe it'll it'll give folks a sense of you know what I need to get back to it too you are not alone walking this path no matter where you are in the world where you are in the United States join us walk this path together with us and we'll we'll kind of reclaim a little bit of everything and find the magic in our lives again and no matter what your flavor join us that's right come with us grab your wand and uh join us as we get back on the broomstick
