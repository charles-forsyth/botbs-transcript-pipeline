enjoy the show so let's talk about some witchcraft absolutely let's talk about some witchcraft in today's world there are many different types of paganism there are so many different flavors of Witchcraft and the big ones that you hear about you hear about wiah you hear paganism you hear witchcraft as a whole is a witch a Wiccan and is a Wiccan a witch and is a pagan a Wiccan and is a pagan a witch only one thing I did want to mention is paganism is an umbrella just like Christianity is an umbrella and people say well are you Pagan well are you Christian well no I'm Baptist okay well I may be Pagan but I'm XYZ you know I think oh I like how you said that you know Christianity is like the big umbrella and then under that you have like Lutheran and Baptist Methodist prian blah blah blah right and they can be very very different and ism is an umbrella you could have Native Americans wiccans you can have witches you can have Voodoo priestesses paganism is really more of an umbrella that equates to Christianity just because you're Christian doesn't mean you're Catholic just because you're a pagan doesn't mean you're Wiccan paganism originally was a I believe it was a Latin term that originally started with Christians and they kind of used it as a pejorative against people that worked with the Earth that people that followed a cyclical season calendar mostly Farmers you know also people that had earth-based religions or that followed earth-based religions and so that were they used that word to kind of mean less than or someone who was dirty or a farmer but it really just means an earth-based religion it was definitely a derogatory it was a derogatory statement you know it's obviously at this point in time been embraced by the Pagan Community but it originated as a derogatory statement right mostly with the the Romans Roman Catholics it was meant to be derogatory against people who worked with the land and followed a seasonal worship calendar or that were polytheist yep and we have kind of claimed that like witch which also was at one time a negative word and is still now used you know oh she's such a witch you know people use it in in place of most of the time you know can I just could I just sidebar for a second absolutely you just sparked a two-minute tangent so you know people say that and you're like oh well you know people don't say that anymore because it's it's not politically correct and we're all sensitive twice yesterday like yesterday the day before we're recording this yesterday I heard two people use that statement in a extremely negative derogatory way these are people that know I'm a witch it just and they used witch like a negative word like a mean term that lady was a witch like yeah are you me in the witch capital of the world someone used witch as a slur as a negative term can I just say one of them was at my workplace and the other one was inside my home my jaw is on the floor wow these are people at work loud and proud like they know wow you know what annoys me the most what's that in both of those situations it never dawned on either of the people that they were making a derogatory the thing is is it doesn't even the thought never connected like they don't even get it I know in the case of at least one of those people they know you're a witch both and that still both of those people and that they still used witch in a negative way in front of you and I could tell in both situations that neither person had a freaking clue that they were being discriminative that's complete and that is exactly what we're still facing today this is not something as simple as it's better now because everybody likes witchcraft because it's on there's something called witch talk there's dude I live in witch City USA and this is twice in 24 hours and I am in witch City USA twice in 24 hours yeah and if it can happen to you you know it's happening to the poor witch in Idaho right and we know it's happened in even Upstate New York and the thing is is that I think you know you and I we're a different breed okay some of my favorite weirdos we have been loud and proud since our teens and I remember back in our early early 20s you and I together worked at a worldwide Corporation and we we almost lost our jobs for being witches like remember the times where we were told that we weren't allowed to wear our Pentacles to work I do do you remember that I also remember people in our own Pagan community that were very upset and threatened by the fact that we were out and some of that was legitimate because if people knew who we hung out with those people could be also labeled as witches and there were people in our community that had an actual reason to fear for their jobs because they were witches where we were young and in our 20s and we were like  them all we were like you I dare you I want you to fire me for being a witch we didn't really have anything to lose did because you had kids at the time but you've always been a you kind of witch I I was and I also tried to pull the it's my constitutional right because that's how I and it is it absolutely is right that was my mom brain kicking in to make sure I still had a steady income but yeah almost 30 years ago okay yeah that was the life we lived in a small country but in 2023 what the actual why is it still the same why has it not changed why is witchcraft still being used against parents in custody battles right this should have been settled decades ago when we were kind of stepping out of Witchcraft and focusing on other things in our not really stepping out of Witchcraft but focusing on other things in our life I was sure that things were just going to snowball at this point witchcraft it's a moot point it's accepted no even with the proliferation now it is still still not accepted no wow so I'm sorry about you sparked it and I had to and I couldn't stop it's perfect it's perfectly related because honestly I remember when I first went to Salem Massachusetts when I was 19 years old going to my very first sin with other people and seeing all these thousands of witches just thronging the streets oh my little witchy heart was filled to bursting but there were people on every corner with their crosses and with their signs and saying mean things and one of the things they like to do was to litter all their little stupid pamphlets and one of them on the front of it said are you a good witch or a bad witch depends on my mood right depends on what you did today but on the back it said it doesn't matter because you're going to hell which you know we don't believe in hell so whatever we would give them back to them and ask them not to litter actually considering I'm in the northe East in in the winter right now hell is sounding pretty exciting because honest warm there ring like SPF 100 and towel and you'll be good it's be like a sauna I would think but anyway so we would joke and be like well I'm a sandwich I'm a  Witch you know ha haa but the point remain is it still kind of sparked a little bit of a conversation amongst myself and some of the new people that I had met what kind of witch are you are you a good witch or a bad witch do you back then wio was the big thing most people I met were wiccans that was that was it that was pretty much it you were like a Wiccan or you were a Satanist and there was really no in between and like and even to the point where I think I was probably pushing 30 and You're gonna laugh at this because I don't even know if I've ever confessed this to you I was probably pushing 30 so a good decade or so in before I I kind of realized that that everybody wasn't Wiccan sure yeah I mean because that's where it was and even though we had a large community um where where we were from everybody kind of followed that Wiccan mold so it was kind of all I knew you know what I mean yeah and then we went crazy and became these eclectic fun folk yeah I think most people even amongst the even in the Pagan community that we were involved in which was a  blessing and we did not we did not appre apprciate it anywhere near as much What You Got Till It's Gone just saying just saying so all of all of you in the bpc we love you we miss you dearly can't wait to and we we we'll come back we will oh my gosh that would be so great we should go we should go for belan oh my God how imagine like strolling in on belan arm in arm like our music playing in the background oh my God Leila and shell are back like a third of them would be cheering a third of them would be crying and a third of them will be like who the are those  can I just say that I am totally up to do that on one condition what's that sh that I can bring my Bluetooth speaker with me and play Eminem guess who's back back again Witch is back tell a friend like we we would have to we would have to walk down that path to that song word I'm okay deal it's a deal we'll record it we'll put on YouTube right and we're back so so yeah we we saw Wier everywhere because that's what that's how witchcraft broke in to mainstream in America is in the 70s Gardner and his friends produced Garder and wiah and Witchcraft I think and this is kind of where I kind of figured out other stuff going on and where I kind of took a left turn in all of this you know roughly about 10 years in or so was when we we formed our coven Circle amarat we had carefully picked some close friends to form that coven with one of our early coven mates introduced me to santoria and then we had another coven mate that that introduced me to Voodoo and I was like wait I thought Voodoo was the hoodoo that you do you know I didn't realize that that was kind of a part of this umbrella and then it just kind of spiraled from there and then then I was introduced to to African traditions and and Egyptian tradition and it just kind of went and I was like oh no not everybody's Wicked huh part of that came from you know worshiping and and doing ritual and and finding like-minded people in our area and that that lovely large community that we had we also started going to festivals where we would meet people from all over the country and all sorts of different versions their own version of paganism we this was before Facebook groups and Tik Tock you know obviously the internet was there at that point we're not that old but witches weren't congregating in Mass online right exactly and we but we were introduced to Green witches people who worship more of the earth and are more nature-based and we were introduced to Garian witches like we talked about wiah and Garian ISM um which isic which is a little more High magic a little more formal which is very similar to um masonry if you're interested in wiah I highly recommend that you check out I'll insert a couple books here future Leila there's a couple books that get into the rituals of M of a masonic tradition and you're going to be shocked when you see how much of masonic traditions and ancient Druid Traditions were just kind of cut whole cloth and and put right into wiah I remember when your husband uh became a Mason and I was like what that sounds like you're going to Ritual exactly exactly Less in sense right right and so I think we kind of moved away a little bit from that traditional wiah that traditional it it just didn't feel right and even back then a lot of this religion is doing what works for you doing what feels right and and kind of finding your own path not being told what to do not being told by someone else but that's called power tripping that's right a lot of this is learning and searching finding finding it out for yourself and I think how we kind of both took that eclectic turn is we kind of enjoyed we're gonna do a Celtic ritual this time and an Egyptian ritual this time and an African ritual this time and we kind of enjoyed that diversity because we weren't forced into that rigid mold right exactly and but we always had a time and place for that rigid mold and we always went back to it but we incorporated other traditions into that as well and I think that's a big part of we very much quickly became what's called an Eclectic witch and that is is a big thing that both of us will kind of describe ourselves as at least one of the terms will be eclectic and what eclectic means is someone who who grabs things from various Traditions someone who honors all traditions and and feels that all of them have worth and validity and so therefore we'll we'll use and honor Traditions from many different religions and cultures we definitely and even even back in the day trying to be as culturally sensitive as possible I'm not talking about stealing rituals and things from other cultures and then just using them insensitively you know some things we just study some things we use but eclectic means that you're relying on all these different beliefs all these different cultures and systems to find something that is your own personal blend your own personal mix that works for you absolutely you know one one thing I do also want to touch on that we haven't mentioned is is this whole is it true is it not true what's the validity um hereditary witches I'm not your kids and my kids are hereditary witches hell yeah they are you know I think there was at one point if you weren't hereditary you didn't count and that is so not the case I know you and I can pick apart both of our grandmothers and find they might not have said they were witches but let me tell you right and I think that hereditary thing comes from two different places fear fear fear fear well yeah one is you want to belong and everybody thinks that you have a better claim to belonging if you can say my family has been witches since you know my great great great great grandmother and that's all well and good that's fine but most of them weren't witches and definitely didn't call themselves witches like your family Pennsylvania Dutch they do a lot of spells and hex signs and and house blessings and things like that that we recognize right as witchcraft they will never say it's Witchcraft and if you tried to tell them you were a hereditary witch they would slap you silly my grandma thought I was a Satanist who we kiding exactly so that's different now the other reason people liked hereditary witchcraft or where that became a big thing is going again back to Garian Witchcraft and in that tradition in wickah you had to be initiated or you could not be a witch they said at time kind of like today they say you can't do tarot unless you're gifted a deck I was just going to use that analogy when you took a break in your breath I was gonna say just like you have to buy you know if you buy your Tarot deck for yourself it'll never work go buy 50 I have thank you exactly absolutely do that is there something fun about a deck that's gifted to you sure thing Shell's been gifted 100 no problem it's fun to be gifted one but necessary absolutely not absolutely not and and in that same vein Garian wiah to be valid in that tradition and only in that tradition you have to be initiated in a man initiates a woman a woman initiates a man because that was so big at our time a lot of people when they would first meet you would want to know who initiated you and if you said I dedicated myself to the goddess you got laughed at and turned away and we pretty much said you right my self-initiation is just as valid as your naked ritual okay who doesn't love a good naked ritual but it's just as valid my ritual is just as valid as yours I am a witch and we are huge proponents of if you say you're a witch you're a witch done whereas I was actually initiated by you and another friend so you actually were the self initia and you and a old friend of ours were mine remember because I was I had ammana I do and she had put that all in that beginning of my first book of shadows I have it right here next to my leg that's absolutely lovely and yet another good reason why you should keep a book of shadows baby witches because they are so wonderful to look back at you know at the time I'm like I am like breaking my damn arm right in this here we are 28 29 years later and I am so so glad so glad I am so grateful my family has suffered two floods one of them we lost everything and in that I lost almost all of my momentos and you know I have a couple of my books of Shadows and things like that but I lost all of my hand fasting things and you my wonderful amazing friend I could kiss your beautiful face you have a copy of my entire hand fasting in your book of shadows including a pot leaf you know I'm laughing I'm laughing because I didn't remember that and I'm going through the book and I'm sitting here and I'm like nuh-uh once I saw it I remembered but I'm like this is freaking great the whole big leaf right in that page you know I'm gonna say the 10 of cups in the herbalist deck the happy family card is the marijuana card y you have had that leaf pressed in those pages for all 23 years that I have been married to my husband we still very much in love do you know how potent that herb is for love spells right now can I just tell you something really funny that I noticed so you you pointed out that leaf has been in my book for 23 years um when I sent you the picture of it last week did you notice that leaf is not crinkled that leaf is not like you know how leaves after a while they just turn to dust dust it's right there years that  still going strong I couldn't believe it it's just between regular parchment paper it wasn't in any type of Wax or anything like that cuz at the time you know here I am 20s something years old how would I have known that I was actually going to still have that when I was pushing 50 if you make any true love jars I would recommend putting just a tiny little pinch of that but you know it's precious not too many of them like Beauty and the Beast it's like the pink stuff just a little bit it's delicious so what kind of witch are you shelle we kind of said a little bit one time in our teaser that you know you kind of you're going to describe yourself as a flavor of Witchcraft you know I've gone with this flavor for a long time I have to stick with with the eclectic thing because I can't you know as much as I kind of generally navigate myself always back to the Celtic Traditions I might love my Celtic world so much but then you know there's times when you got to pull P out that's all I'm saying there's there's times where p is the one for you and you know so sometimes you got to switch it up and you know I've worked with hkat for 20 years not Celtic actually Greek but I don't necessarily follow Greek Traditions so I just kind of sucked in My Little Greek goddess into my little Celtic practices with a touch of different things here and there you know in the last couple years I got raiki Master Certified that's like a whole different left turn from anything Celtic or Egyptian or or Hawaiian or I just kind of work with what feel good for me and I combined it all into one big happy this is my magic I love that because there's so much about accepting who you are and I I am very much eclectic and I know sometimes we describe ourselves as kitchen like interchangeably with eclectic we'll say kitchen witch or eclectic witch but nowadays and see that's that's why I don't like that term nowadays because nowadays it's turned into something different a kitchen witch is someone who's making magic cooking and chopping and baking and making and I am the last person you should leave alone in a kitchen if I'm cooking your ass better be ready to eat out so that's why I pulled away from kitchen witch because nowadays it implies you're making magic with with your food and your drink and and kitchen stuff which I the last person who should be involved in that and I think that makes a lot more sense like before a kitchen which was like everything in the kitchen sink it was someone who used everything and was more than willing to to pick up a stick to be a magic wand or to use a flower to cast a circle and and that's what that meant at the time and again you're absolutely right now kitchen witch is someone who's using literal like literal kitchen witch right literally making food and magic with their food and I think that's wonderful yeah no kitchen witches couldn't live without you love every single one of you I just can't cook for beans I burn water Lea is my witness yes I love cooking and but I would not necessarily say I'm a kitchen witch have I done spells with cooking yes but I'm not a kitchen witch but 20 30 years ago like you said kitchen witch meant something different so now you're just totally eclectic because that's that's really what your definition of kitchen witch is now is eclectic that's right I would also say that I'm very much a green witch and a green witch is someone who very earth-based someone tends to live in in harmony with the cycles and with the seasons and someone who feels that the Earth is their mother that they've honor nature and it's very Mama earth based goddess based now to give you the flip side of Leila's opinion on that that's whoy green witch that's just a witch isn't that what we all do like I don't get I don't get why that's a different type like isn't that what all witches are in harmony nature blah like what I don't get it yes but also no I mean you know there's chaos witches and Cosmic witches and there's all sorts of different types of witches and some are not that earthy you know I would think that most are but some are not and so some would not say they're green but there's a lot to be said for chaos magic it's very very similar to High magic it can be harness it can be harnessed and harnessed well right and and the world is full of chaos I mean the world itself we came from chaos so there's something to be said for that type of energy but I guess chaos magic to me is a little bit more like eclectic High magic it's using High magic in different ways and basically it was uh it's eclectic High magic is is a lot is probably the easiest way to describe it it's like everybody has to have a title like everybody wants to split hairs and and in nowadays everybody wants to split hairs on names of Witchcraft and we're all witches here folks we are all witches and you can you can be whatever kind of witch you want but you are a witch and I think after looking at it for first I was like well this is kind of silly so at first I was looking at it and I was a little bit shocked because I'm like well there's fire witches and water witches and divination witches and and they're just witches just like you said that's just witchcraft I think it part of it is a focus so like if you're a Tarot witch you focus on tarot if you're a crystal witch you focus on crystal if you're a fire witch you focus on fire energy I think it's really just kind of their focus yes and and it's always kind of been it's always kind of been like that I mean we've all known people who had an affinity who had an affinity for fire or who had an affinity for crystals or for herbs we didn't say they were specifically that kind of witch although they might describe themselves a little bit and I think You' you've hit it there with the focus and I also think it's a big part of belonging so remember remember when we would go to festivals and there were a group of awesome folks there that we called fire Spinners and they they would TWR the the fiery things and have the fire ropes and all well even more they were part of fire tribe of the red suspender tribe that was an actual group that performed fire safety and took care of the bonfires and nowadays they would be considered Fire magic fire magicians you know fire witches yeah and and I do think that it gets to being a lot of wanting to belong you want to find your tribe everybody wants to find that group that they kind of belong in commonality interest and maybe nowadays everyone is a witch it's not enough to say oh I'm a witch people want to say what their focus is and I also think a little bit that I hope this particular podcast helps with is that people don't realize that there's something other than those little classifications all of those people are witches you're all kind of an earth-based witch and I don't think they remember theic witchcraft they don't remember gardnerian and rosac crucian and alexandrian yeah all of that the Golden Dawn they don't remember these actual real factions or tribes of of historical Witchcraft and so it gets divided into these easy labels not that there's anything wrong with them but I do think that it really is it really comes down to finding your common people you know if if you're a crystal witch you would prefer to connect with other people who are crystal witches so y'all can be all crystally together there's nothing wrong with that it's just they're trying to refine it's almost like refining Your Inner Circle yeah they're trying to find their tribe whereas before there were so few of us we found our tribe just by saying we are witches now people like to kind of find their tribe within that tribe and I think that's that's kind of cool but we're still all witches you know what I don't like about that when we were in our our larger Community back in Upstate New York everybody was just they did their thing and we all congregated together that diversity made us kind of expand our practice because we were able to experience things that we may not have otherwise be not being around as diverse of a population well to expand on that a little bit the the community that we're talking about wasn't a coven it was a local group of many covens individuals family groups smaller Traditions that would all gather together on High holidays like witch Gatherings exactly and we would you know kind of coming together of the tribes and we would alternate who was in charge of those rituals so a different group facated basically we we we alter we alternated facilitators people yeah people would volunteer sometimes well in advance sometimes that very day but people would volunteer in advance to be the facilitator and they would be in charge of getting permission for the land setting up porta potties making sure there was food and water that the camping areas were clean the ritual area was ready that there was firewood cut and tended uh very often we would do work on the land for the owner of the land to to thank them for allowing us to be there so there was a lot of work involved in it but also in addition to that they also were able to at their own will plot and plan out all of the details of that particular ritual for that particular period so you know you might have folks that were very Egyptian based for this ritual and then very Celtic based for the next so you had so much diversity that you were exposed to so many different things that you could kind of expand yourself right exactly so so you would learn different calls you would learn of different deities or different belief systems when these different groups would host the ritual and that was part of the joy of it I mean we had touchstones and things that that were common that we did for each ritual including our coven created a chalice that was created by the owner of the land from clay from the land you know with our input in magical Direction because part of the community ritual was a sharing of water and blessings around the circle not that I'm sure they do that now but that chalice was part of that and so there were touchstones that were the same but each ritual like you said was hosted by a different group and so you got to experience these different things I hope that people are learning you know more than just finding their their little niche within witchcraft I hope they're actually learning about the greater belief systems the greater beliefs that go into what it could be and what the actual history of wiah and Witchcraft is and the types of those goes Way Beyond I'm a flower witch yeah absolutely absolutely you know I just I I love the diversity of the bigger umbrella I love that too I love that too and I also love finding your tribe because we all know again from that larger Pagan Festival that we used to go to with the the red suspender fire tribe it was a great honor to be part of that tribe and each quarter had different areas that were responsible for you know the huge festivals every year they would be responsible for the you know there's the air tribe and the Earth tribe I believe the fire tribe was the most uh well-known fire people tend to be right out there but also they were the ones that would tend the bonfires the nightly bonfires so they were very very commonly known and seen around nothing nothing wrong with taking your little niche group out to the bigger wide world once in a while that's right and having a little fun with it I think that I've kind of gone a little more like the let's pull a little bit of this pull a little bit of that you know like like very I don't want to say Loosey Goosey but not as regimented as ceremonial magic yeah I wouldn't say so far as to put my robes on but I like a good sigil I like marking the quarters I like incorporating elements in my quarter calls and I like having those things there I like having an altar I like I like writing a spell out so right now maybe because I've gotten out of touch and so it's not as fun it's not as nice it's not as reconnecting for me to visualize it that's where I think that I have a struggle with that and other people probably do as well is I find that very difficult by myself whereas I can get in that Groove in a hot second in a group as much as I enjoy that High ceremonial magic it's a Groove I can't get into solitary it's nice to do it myself I find the whole Act of performing a full ritual very soothing it's very meditative you know to to cast The Circle to call the quarters and light the candle for each quarter as if I was in a ritual with other people and and I I don't do that enough you know so I I want to try and do that more for sure even just you know this past full moon I went out and cast a small circle and lit a candle and that was great great but I want more I want to do more of that right and and it is very difficult sometimes for me to get that type of serious ritualistic Focus alone and so that's why I guess it's so disappointing you know that we haven't found people to work with you're in the freaking witch City there should be people you know every single Pagan store of which you have like five million and I mean I'll be the first to admit you know I can ride on that fine line of being antisocial but like I've actually tried to seek it out I'm still coming up with nothing I think what bothers me the most is there are some groups that do offer public rituals but like it's very a you have to pay to get in and B we're putting on a show for the community like I feel like you this is how I feel my personal feelings is that the only reason which is are accepted currently in this town is because it's the biggest  money maker they've come across in a long time wow that's sad again that's just my personal feeling but like I feel like I had an easier time getting into a pagan community in Upstate New York than I am in Dam Salem Massachusetts you know I'm going to try to go to this class where they have I'm going to a class on tarot reading but it does say for all levels and it does sound like it might be an interesting way to meet people oh my God because I was thinking of doing the same thing here in February and it did say it was like all levels I'm like you know what if nothing else I could use it as a as a way to meet people meet people get a refresher I that's so funny that we were both thinking about that yeah so I'm definitely going to the local pagan shop and I'm going to go next month to this and we'll have to both talk about it after we get back from our classes and see how it goes we'll have to report back and say if we did actually meet anybody but I have been I have cont conted two different people both who lead very large pagant groups in the area and I've been ghosted by both of them and I don't know if everyone's just really busy or if maybe I contacted them the wrong I don't do Facebook so I think I have to hop on Facebook and try and catch them there what I found disheartening was I I was talking to a local shopkeep you know I said you know hey I've been here for a couple years and I'm having a hard time you know Finding anybody and they're like well who do you know and I'm like well like I said you know I just I I moved here about three years ago from New York they're like oh so you don't know anybody good luck wow I didn't say anything I was like oh you know I'm sorry to bother you but in my head I'm like what the right you gotta know somebody in 2023 and how are you supposed to know someone if you don't know anybody what does that even mean really I just moved here so I don't know anybody so I'm an outcast it's bad enough I don't have the accent I mean really I mean I guess on the one hand there's obviously a market for that if that's what sadly sadly you know people will go and just kind of watch that while they put on like a play ritual or something remember how we used to do rituals for our big pig and Community like everybody was in the circle but we were kind of doing this stuff same thing I gotcha so like you're a part of the circle but $35 I mean I understand when we did our stuff with our our larger Community back in New York back in the day there was a suggested donation because we had to rat portapotty and we were supplying a a feast meal you know all that we we were using that money but these are you're making money and I understand Church's profit but you know if you're G to make money can you at least give people a a a a clear path to be a part of it if they'd like they could at the very least have satellite groups groups where they have you know maybe younger members who want who are training to be high priests or high priestesses will take over charge of a new group right why are we gatekeeping and keeping it as a a for-profit thing when it could actually be a training situation for your priestesses as well as a way for new members to gain access to a circle and to a coven if that's what they want to training and I I just think that it went so very quickly from being a a behind the scenes practice to a for-profit practice that it's very difficult now to find other people because everyone's kind of scattered and solitary again well I think the thing I find the most disheartening is is that I guess I was too naive and thought that we were past this and it doesn't sound like they're even giving anyone an opportunity to get to know anyone you know it doesn't matter if you're yeah not that I've been able to find in a city as as big as Salem that has as many covens and groups that are worshiping and that are doing ritual together and training together there's absolutely no reason to gatekeep like that there should be ways for people to to get vetted to to go to lesser espit and to you know to get involved to volunteer to to to be part of the group and to make your way into a group just like any other religion and to gatekeep it that hard sucks I understand steps you know we had a coven we had steps we created the steps we implemented the steps I get the steps how come no one will give me the damn opportunity to go through the steps no one will even give you the steps right right you know they're just saying you can come watch but that's it there are no steps and I was kind of laughing because I I have some of my my altery stuff here next to my laptop and I have our cords I almost wore it on sin and I didn't because no one here would respect it because I'm not a Salem witch I Goa
