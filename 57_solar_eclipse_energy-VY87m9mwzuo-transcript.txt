welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I'm shell and today we what are we talking about today this is exciting tell us tell us this is extremely exciting because today we'll be talking about solar eclipse magic it's funny because this isn't something I feel like this isn't something that happens in my neck of the woods our neck of the woods terribly often so I actually had to do a few days of research on this topic because yeah you know here in the eastern United States we don't get this Joy terribly often this year on April 8th there will be a total solar eclipse and the path of totality runs through a big SWA of the United States including directly over New York State and the Rochester New York area where I happen to live and so we're going to be able to experience a total solar eclipse which does happen twice a year but it doesn't happen in the same place all the time so you have to kind of be lucky enough not where we are it don't no that's right um so I wanted to kind of Kick this off with you know everybody's like oh what's this mean and you know the history behind this is like oh the world is ending so I thought how's our world ending here Ila so I wanted to start off with I found on almanac.com great website all zodiac signs are going to be affected by this so I wanted to read to you yours and mine and see what you think y for it this solar eclipse is happening what is it in the sign of Aries it is happening in the sign of Aries fire sign and I've heard that astrologically I know that eclipses happen when the moon is near either the North or the South node and those nodes are associated with fate and so having an eclipse there can sometimes mess with that fate so I'm excited to see what this means for aquarians particularly okay well I'm going to start with me cuz you know I'm selfish like that okay go for it what's it say for Geminis okay for all you Geminis out there this is what we're gearing up for for the solar eclipse now you're going to laugh at this when I first laugh when I first read this I was dying Geminis your social life is about to go through a purge oh oh no I was like really are we good we're good right we're good my first thought was like who do I have left a purge here Jesus the total solar eclipse will feel like a like a Toto Rooter on your friends list a roto rooter it says Toto rer but I think they do they mean like you're gonna get sucked up in some type of cyclone in the middle of Kansas and your little dog too is that what that means and your friend's list that's right a Toto Rooter you're gonna be like the witch on the bicycle going around the hurricane it's possible to be honest with you all right so a new phrase it also says that you are one of the most gregarious signs of the zodiac no or you me oh you're so gregarious this is funny it says you are one of the most gregarious signs of the zodiac with a circle of acquaintances as vast as the globe that's pretty true though you do have a lot of friends that is pretty true so what I was thinking is maybe that is what I'm Roto rering but this Eclipse wants all us to focus on quality rather than quantity a few friendships may disappear around this day most likely superficial connections and people you've outgrown so basically what this is telling me is toxic people be gone make room for new companions maybe it's a day for cord cutting for you right not just me but for allinis wow that sounds pretty intense it was pretty deep I thought I was like gez that's a little deep I thought this was going to be like you know uplifting geez it was almanac.com so I think kind of the the takeaway here for Geminis is toxic people be gone okay toxic people be gone there you go get rid of people that no longer are a good part of your life no longer bring you Joy you're gonna love Aquarius okay oh boy I'm a little scared to be honest yours is way better than mine all right I'm I'm ready I'm braced hit me okay your mind is about to get as clear as a bell okay all right that sounds good so far the total solar eclipse eliminates doubt worry and mental blocks suddenly it does suddenly you see the light and know exactly what to do if you've been stuck between multiple options the way forward will be obvious this Eclipse could also open up the way for new adventures so gather your friends and hit the road yeah baby road trip right if you are daring and this is such a you thing I swear this is such a you thing to the point where I don't even want to say it if you're daring follow the path of the eclipse it could just be what your wonderand lust needs are you kidding me it says gather your friends hit the road if you're daring follow the path of the eclipse it could be just what your wander loss needs this is so me that is so me how Weir like oh my goda's gonna follow this damn Eclipse around the world now well yeah I hear that a lot that happens to a lot of people people that experience total solar eclipses are really moved a vast majority of people that experience these it affects them you know mentally some people even physically and a small percentage of them start chasing solar eclipse around the world aquariuses apparently exactly wow so I want to put it out there my my boss in my mundane World job says that she's a listener so my boss if you are listening will you please let me go 100% fully remote so I can go chase the eclipse with Lea I swear I'll do my work during the day we need to go it says gather your friends what better friend than you you and me oh my gosh how fun with that be Travel Channel call us we'll be waiting right eclipse the path forward will become clear that's right the path forward I'm back to my nomadic rootless ways and you're coming with me apparently yeah yes so my boss needs to definitely make that happen Discovery Channel Travel Channel The Witches hit up paranormal sites religious sites from around the world I mean come on how fun would that be castles any place that's haunted any place that's got a portal to another dimension we're so there portals to hell too don't forget those those our fa H historical locations you know we don't discriminate we want to see them all we'll go want cannabis farms in Northern California right so I think that according to almanac.com we've got a drop the dead weight travel the path of the solar eclipse right the stars have aligned and they have said that this is so so I'm I'm pretty sure we need to do it you know and and for anybody else who wants to know what apparently this is in the store for you you know go check out what your Zodiac horoscope for the eclipse is because I'm down with mine and I'm down with Le I will definitely be putting a link to that in the show description if you want to check out what your sign has in store for the solar eclipse so Megan Skinner who's an astrologist she says that the North and South nodes are associated with fate and she says solar eclipses are associated with like outward change like World change sometimes in history there was even a king that died on a solar eclipse oh jeez how foring would that be back in the day right exactly people used to be scared of it and I think that's why it's Associated I think people still are they really are back before they knew the science of it people literally thought the sun was going away you know they didn't understand what was happening it was a very scary time that's not necessarily A Time's gone by thing though because you know I've spent the last week doing research on solar eclipse stuff and you know I have actually found that in current modern day United States of America and Beyond bars note that there are less patrons there are less people out on the streets there are less people in restaurants less people go to entertainment things such as movies and sporting events that are happened on the day of a solar eclipse so actually present day there are still people who are sked out by the idea of the sun disappearing it literally becomes night time it gets dark just like it's night you'll hear the Crickets everything will start coming out the in SE are fooled and think that it's nighttime the birds are fooled and think that it's nighttime so your whole circadian rhythm I mean everything in your body gets a little freaked out because it shouldn't be nighttime now and so that can create some very strange Sensations for people now a couple things I want to point out to our listeners before we get too deep into this is kind of the what really is the solar eclipse and what it is is the moon blocking the Sun from the earth so it's like the Moon is in between the Sun and the Earth what people may not realize is yes it is a solar eclipse and there is a magic involved in it not only from the solar aspect but the whole thing with the solar eclipse is the new moon yes solar eclipses happen during the new moon and lunar eclipses happen during the full moon there's roughly like five solar eclipses that happen every year they don't happen every month mon because the moon has to be aligned with the sun in our sight so it basically has to be aligned roughly on the equator and so they only happen around the spring and the fall equinox they call it like Eclipse season when there's a solar and a lunar I even know that is that really a thing it only happens during the equinoxes not during the Equinox but around that time of year because the The Horizon has to be lined up usually the Moon is either above or below the sun on the horizon so it doesn't block it enough to create an eclipse but roughly five times a year clustered around the spring and the fall equinoxes interesting there's a couple things that um I wanted to also mention that this eclipse is going to happen what time did it say oh Jesus it was like 11 in the morning in New York state where I happen to live the partial eclipse starts April 8th 2:07 p.m. eastern time and the eclipse itself totality will begin about 3:21 almost 32 2 and it will last for about 3 minutes and 39 seconds the entire Clips will be over by 4:33 p.m. eastern time so it's basically like a two and a half hour event correct and but the totality is about three minutes 39 seconds right right now before we get into to some magically stuff I want to talk about some folklore here Norse cultures thought that the god Loki was Chained and that Loki got Revenge by creating wolf-like Giant Giants one of which swallowed the sun another of the giant wolves chased the moon and was trying to eat it basically the Norse folks believed that this wolf-like monster literally swallowed the sun then you got the chipa people they were in such fear over this that they would shoot flaming arrows into the sky to try to rekindle the sun they must have thought they won every time yeah well they definitely thought it worked for sure so tribes in Peru they did the same thing because they also again thought that this Beast was attacking the Sun a lot of themes here where they thought that the Beast was attacking the sun in Armenia I love this one the best in Armenia their Legend says that the dragon swallowed the Sun and the Moon I love good Dragon you know I love dragons yeah and then in India many believe that when the eclipse occurs the dragon is trying to seize the two orbs meaning the Sun and the Moon and people would immerse themselves in rivers up to their necks imploring the sun and moon to defend themselves against the dragon oh wow that's kind of cool like what do you just sit in the river until the eclipse is over maybe maybe they thought the water would protect them well again they thought they won every time I guess so I I think it's super cool that this is the year of the dragon now this final piece of folklore I actually thought was pretty nifty some North American Indian tribes believe the Eclipse was simply Nature's Way of checking in with the sky perhaps of sort of a cleaning house the Sun and the Moon temporarily leave their place in the sky to see if things are still going all right on Earth interesting I thought that was probably the most interesting folklore type story I found now the only folklore that I've ever heard of is like from ancient Babylon ancient Babylonian thing they believed that it was a bad Omen so they were worried about King and what they would do is they would put the king in hiding and through a series of Ceremonies they would take a commoner and make that person King for the day even to the point where they would marry him to some young virgin and make how did they know it was coming mathematically people have known about eclipses and been able to predict eclipses for thousands of years I mean there's notations about eclipses I think 3,000 BCE so people have known about this for a very very long time it can be mathematically predicted right down to the minute but yet they didn't know they'd be okay but they didn't know they'd be well common people wouldn't know they'd be okay they didn't understand the math I think even today people don't really understand the math I don't understand the math just saying yeah so these the Babylonians would hide their King and they would make a fake King for the day just in case anything bad happened like the King was going to die it would happen to the fake King and not the real King bad news dude gets ceremonies and parties all day long for the eclipse and then they kill him after the eclipse is over and his Queen just to make sure that any possible lingering bad luck is gone with the dead fake King it's all funny games get picked until you're murdered at the end right do you think they knew going into it like what was going to happen or do you think they were just like yeah come on we'll dress you in Gold we'll give you good food you get to marry this chick it'll be great to be honest with you a lot of those um more ancient cultures true fact these people probably knew they were sacrificing to the gods they probably knew yeah that's probably true totally down with it totally one time however apparently in history it's recorded that one time they did this and the real King like choked on a mushroom or something like that during the eclipse and so the fake king ruled until his death no one time one time I want to be a fake queen one time for Life yeah usually that life is very short shell but that gets us to you hear a lot especially online especially today there's a huge debate is Magic during a solar eclipse a good idea or not a good idea you hear a lot of people talk about chaos magic that doing magic during the solar eclipse is too chaotic too powerful going to cause too many problems isn't that the fun of it well you know one thing that I had had read up on is that this is definitely uh there's definitely a theory out there that the solar eclipse energy is extremely high and chaotic but it's all how you wield it and that could be any energy you could wield into some weird Twisted way so chaotic energy I don't look at as any different do you know where the chaos energy came from like the idea of it I would imagine from the Moon in the sun kind of having that magnetic together that extra gravitational pole they're right aligned together I wish people could see the hand motions I'm making right now but like you know like aligned together and they're normally not like perfectly aligned so I would imagine from that gravitational magnetic ISM I've never experienced a total solar eclipse I've experienced several partial solar eclipses me as well even some that have made the day very dark but never a total one my personal opinion and I'll let you know after this one what what it's really like for me but my personal opinion is I don't see chaos in a solar eclipse they are mathematically predictable down to the second hundreds if not thousand years in advance they're so predictable so mathematically able to be calculated I don't see chaos in that I see perfect alignment and I see perfect math I I don't see chaos there dear listeners that previous statement was made by someone who loves chaos magic more than anything in the world just saying it's that is true that is true I do I do the chaos of the universe the chaos that created all of us the chaos that makes perfect squares and the bed of the ocean that looks like a wall that kind of chaos the chaos that created us yes I absolutely love that  I don't see it in a solar eclipse it's too orderly too mathematical I just kind of look at a solar eclipse is just a different kind of energy and a different kind of magic that doesn't make it un yieldable or negative it's just different yeah and it does have historical connotations of fear there A lot of times historically when people wrote down about eclipses There Was Fear associated with it they saw a wolf Monster ate the damn Sun wouldn't you be afraid yes yes I would and because I didn't understand it now we understand it so much that there are half a million people going to pour into my city to watch it I mean people chase this around the world so your connotation how you see this solar eclipse is going to be deeply personal only you can decide if this is too chaotic to use too powerful or too personal or how you see it is going to be how it is for you that's your truth that's your magic and honestly there's a lot of people out there and and this goes for Geminis for sure Scorpios as well sometimes we find peace in the chaos absolutely there's a lot of good good magic that can be done during this time you know a lot of transformative magic a lot of you know sh just like my horoscope said shed in the old and opening up for new you know it's it's definitely some good positive magic not to be missed based on fear in my opinion yes I mean if you look at it like what it does physically is what it does magically the sun gets covered there are shadows it is an amazing time to go within and do Shadow work here is night in the middle of day you know what better representation of going within and doing that shadow work could there be and then the moon leaves the path of the sun and the Sun is uncovered Hidden Truths coming out your light coming out removing obstacles all of those are amazing energies to work with during the eclipse whether you can see it or not while it's happening you could be in California where you can't see it at all and do this type of magic yeah and still work the magic since you mentioned working the magic and going within I'll spoil alert for folks uh when we do air this episode I will post on our socials I have actually come up with a solar eclipse tarot spread so I will show you the spread I did and I will share the details of that spread on the socials yep I also I have a solar eclipse spell o it's all about removing blockages so I will also post some pictures of that but I'll give you a little bit of it now it combines that new moon energy with the solar eclipse energy because like we said solar eclipses all happen during a new moon so any type of magic you would do during a new moon is good to do now you know your manifestation but just keep in mind that at the start of that manifestation there's going to be some type of blockage first before the way is cleared so just remember that when you're doing your magic it's going to be kind of like a forced Fresh Start unexpected opportunity so you want to plan your new Ventures take initiative this is a time of change of luck of growth of of abundance and I think it's actually an exciting magical time as opposed to something that should be feared I think it's going to be an extremely powerful shift this year it feels to me maybe because I live in the path of totality and and people are talking about it all the time I mean everybody's got some event there's something going on there's they're making having like Eclipse parties oh my gosh everywhere Bill NY is going to be here the college is having a big party there's observation parties all over the place I imagine anywhere in the path of totality this is happening I suppose if my boss is listening I probably can't call him sick and show up at your house that'd probably be a bad thing H probably not but we're we'll try and take some video If you do okay it'll be good we'll do some ritual it'll be great but so I I can't escape it but it it seems seems like there's a buzz even now you know a few weeks ahead of time you can almost start to feel something in the air there's some type of energy actually here in Massachusetts they um do do some advertising here and there um about people going up to uh Northern New Hampshire or Vermont or northern Maine so there's advertising about this going hot and heavy on the whole East Coast not just in the path it really does affect people whether you're a a witch or a magical person or not solar eclipses have profound effect on people when they see them and as we talked about with the different the different LS different societies different beliefs all around the world different sex of people all have their own belief and people have gotten so much into their roots and so much into their her Heritage and so much into their history that they're starting to pay more attention to things like this that their grandparents their great grandparents their great great grandparents did and so it's kind of in the Forefront of a lot more people's mind I think than maybe in the past I think you're right and I think we all know that things are changing and I think this is just kind of an exciting moment to maybe start over start fresh move some of those blockages away it's a good excuse to start over well I had to start over was a solar eclipse what could I do right right that's what I'm gonna do when I purge my Facebook account I'm gonna be like I had to delete you off my Facebook the solar eclipse made me do it I am super excited about travel and that I'm just really excited to experience the total solar eclipse because people that talk about how it can affect your third eye people have profound spiritual experiences during totality and I'm excited to see what's G to happen I don't know we'll see I might be there we'll see I hope so I hope so well we're definitely going to be doing the drawing for the tarot reading during the solar eclipse yeah even if we're not together don't worry folks the drawing will be done but one interesting fact that I heard and I I'm trying try to find out if this is true maybe one of our listeners knows but I've heard that even spiders during the solar eclipse unwind their webs and then redo their webs and I don't know if that's true or not I'm not sure apparently um even sometimes animals will act a little strangely leading up to and during a solar eclipse so I'm kind of intrigued about the spider fact and I I need to know if it's true or not that's so weird because is that strange it's almost like it's just like a faux night I mean do they pack up their webs at night some types do I know there were orb weavers that did I mean like charlot's web didn't did she no I don't think so know in California we had orb weavers that made webs at night and would pack them up during the day but I haven't heard of the opposite so I'm curious I I have heard some people talk about they'll feel dizzy you know they can feel a little strange some people feel pressure on their third eye now also we want to just make sure that we put out the the responsible PSA do not look at the damn son with your bare eyes Okay wear your safety goggles I don't know what it'll do but it's bad it's bad take a colander and hold it and see the Shadows really take a colar yeah I have pictures of partial eclipses where you can see if you hold a colander that has all the holes in it right yeah on a sunny day you'll just see a bunch of round Sunshine holes in the shadow but during an eclipse they look like CR moons no  yeah and so you can you can hold one of those up and watch the light move through a colander as this as the do that and take a video of it because I need to see it our listeners need to see it I need to see this we will do a bunch of that during the solar eclipse here but I do have an old picture from the previous partial eclipse I'll send you a picture of that Nifty Nifty you can see it but we'll take some for this one that's a fun way to look at it if you can't if you don't have glasses or anything you can't look at it so do you have any final tidbit tips tricks things that people need to know Journal you always go back to DM journaling you might as well follow medication I do Shadow work and journaling find yourself a new moon manifestation spell find yourself a shadow work meditation do a tarot reading definitely do a tarot reading your divination of choice during that time period do Shell's tarot spread do my spell you know do something and set your intentions do something that's kind of reflective yeah something something that's kind of in the spirit of starting a new moving forward kind of breaking through old habits and creating a new reality removing obstacles removing things that don't serve you any longer coming out from the Dark Shadow work all I keep saying is Shadow work Shadow work Shadow work you know starting new transformation I feel like this Eclipse season is like a combination of like sin and oara all happening at once at once yeah because it's the dark during you know you're having a dark introspective reflective period during the rebirth during the Spring yeah when everything's like bright and sunny and rebirthing you know it's definitely very powerful time to go within you know and and just take a look and be honest with yourself you know take a look deeply and and be that butterfly and go through that metamorphosis because this is the time and this is the magic I like oh that was good that was pretty awesome where to pull that out of so we'll post Shell's solar eclipse tarot spread that you can do anytime during that day leading up to or after and I will also post up
