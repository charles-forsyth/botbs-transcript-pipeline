see who has the creepiest craziest most out there scary story I always do oh no no no no it's always me East Coast rul man West Coast is the scar and today is no exception today I'm going to be talking about a haunted mine in Alaska o pretty scary I didn't know there were haunted mines in Alaska this is the largest copper mine in the entire world at the time and it is very very haunted and there's also a related True Crime ooh oo interesting well I'm gonna one up you like I always do because here on the east coast and actually we're kind of teetering our our our threshold line we always uh had divided from from episode one we kind of made the Mississippi our our guiding divider here that's right so Ila is west of the Mississippi I'm east of the Mississippi so I'm kind of riding the line here and we're going to take it down to Tennessee to a place a place that that I know you've heard of you might not know graand no Dolly would even better I like Dolly way better than Elvis but

Veer off the road out of total scaredness I say that because I know my boyfriend listens while he drives so stay on the road babe about to scare you it's about to be spooky yes so I'm Lea representing the west coast and tonight like I said I'll be taking you to Alaska and uh I'm shell and I'm hi and I'm I'm taking you to Tennessee I love it I love it so what are you smoking today that's the important part who cares where we're going what do you smoking I've gone back to the cousin I guess of a favorite few episodes ago I went on and on about bakio gelato which so good so good and I haven't been able to find it again still looking for seeds if you know any the stoned Witches Hour gmail.com hook a witch up anyway so I did find however from one of my favorite delivery places gelato number 41 and it is related to bako gelato and it looks like it it's pretty dark green just like the bako gelato and when you break into it it's got that gorgeous purple loveliness and it tastes very sweet up high really happy really chatty good stuff about a 29% THC shell so I know that you'd like like that right up my alley right up there and it tastes delicious which you know I love so it's the perfect strain for talking for doing podcasting you know for getting [ __ ] done and for being happy about it anything in the gelato family seems to make me very happy I'm just uplifted upbeat and happy I love it so this is you'd call this a functional I would it's not like the bako gelato where I was like really really high after just a few hits this I would say is a little more fun I mean it is 29% which is on the higher end but it's not into your 30s so it's not slapping me right in the face it's just giving me that I get the grins you know you can start to feel your cheeks turn up and you start talking a little more yeah this is definitely a not a sit down and and get like a focused work done this is more of a get a podcasting or getting a social type work done I Goa I gocha how about you sh what are you smoking today so you know this stuff I I I can't even so I I it's called I don't know if you've ever heard of this I've never heard of it before and I always like trying new things especially if they're they're high THC Jelly Belly never heard of it I've heard of Jelly Bellies doct who introduced me to Jelly Bellies back in the day but I've never had a Jelly Belly cannabis this is a sativa but I will say upbeat relatively motivated I could lay down and take a nap or I could sit here and podcast half the day like either way but again you know sativas and indicas can sometimes hit people differently yeah as we've discussed before having two classifications or three if you go with hybrid really doesn't cover the full spectrum and honestly isn't scientifically accurate when they look into the genetics of the plant so I don't know take your sativa or your indicia with a little grain of salt pretty much I just kind of go with how I feel yeah that's it's so good to talk to great bud tenders and and you've had excellent luck with Bud tenders did you get any advice about this before you bought it um I did not this um I actually got this at a shop downtown that I generally normally don't go to it was one of those running low walking around town hey they're right there yeah um so it's not generally a store that I frequent a lot so I didn't get I didn't make a huge purchase because I didn't you know you never want right you don't want to go in blind and and now you've bought an ounce and you're out however much money right and how much was this by the way um this was back to the traditional 60 and8th y same with the gelato 41 that's a lot which I feel is highway robbery but whatever but it is a 29.7 good high good taste it you know it almost tastes like as much as they call it Jelly Belly it reminds me of like seven Up or Sprite kind of got that like lemony limey Tang oh I like that I like that it almost sounds like we're both in that sweets and dreams category of the the Cannabis Cup you know correlations but this is another one of those um and I've talked about this before that I really do feel it's a better smoke and it's just all around just a better whatever uh experience ground this isn't the consistency that you want to just stuff and shove yeah yeah even a famous stuff and shover sometimes these really these really heavily resonated nugs really should be ground up and fluffier or you're just not going to get a nice burn out of it well not only are they are they like that but they're also super compact like they've grown compact as well because the first little butt I did that with and first of all it felt like I took eight years to smoke that little bud which is not actually as good as you'd think because you don't want to keep getting that Ash hit on every hit through half your pipe but it just it just didn't smoke good as a bud but ground up Rockstar stuff I worry I worry sometimes about really really dense buds because because of something called PG and what pray tell is pgr sounds like MSG it's a hormone it's a synthetic hormone it stands for plant growth regulators and sometimes people will use this on cannabis as they're growing and basically what these hormones do is they help plants to not Branch as much it gives you better um fruit production or or Bud production and it it helps to increase density of buds and make them kind of bigger thicker and denser and so sometimes I haven't seen any but people say that there's one way to tell pgr or or cannabis that has had this growth hormone used on it is if they seem to be excessively dense now is that like harmful or something yes you should be told when you're buying wheat if any pesticides were used on it or any type of growth hormone or growth regulator some people get nausea and vomiting or will have breathing issues after smoking weed that has been treated with pgr no [ __ ] so what to look out for with pgr weed is you're GNA find pot that has um it doesn't smell a lot you won't you won't get a lot of that green smell or or you know your your typical weed smell it'll have little to no smell right it'll be unusually dense very thick very dense they'll feel almost uh like squishy like spongy and won't have as much tricomes maybe as you're used to seeing so has that been happening a lot lately is that like a new thing I think so I think as people are trying to find that picture perfect weed because I've shown you weed that I've grown and that other fellow Growers have grown and it sometimes will be we don't trim it up as nice you know leave a lot of the sugar leaves it looks shaggier sometimes it'll look fluffier it won't be quite as dense depending on the cultivar it will be as dense but people who grow to sell want it to look pretty they want people to look at it and buy it and and your average buyer isn't going to know that that shaggy weed is probably sungrown full of crystals and absolutely fabulous they want that typical pretty stuff pretty stuff big thick fat buds that they can show off on Reddit or Instagram and that's not what you're always going to get but with pgr you get that every single time so some Growers unscrupulous Growers will use this growth hormone to make weed that doesn't look good look fabulous even though it's not going to get you as high well I'm gonna I'm going to keep an eye on that because you know I don't know how many episodes back now but we could probably go back at least two or three or four episodes where I've commented that I've had these buds that you really just have to grind up to smoke that might not necessarily mean anything cannabis will naturally there are some cultivars that are naturally going to produce a lot of resin and have very thick dense buds so that doesn't always mean that a growth hormone has been used on it the best thing to do is buy from a dispensary and ask them you know do you know where this was grown I mean if it's all packaged up and it comes from a commercial grower 99% chance that everything that's been used on is listed because of regulations but if it's just in a big jar or you got it from a farmer ask them you know what chemicals were used when and were any hormone U growth regulating hormones used well my my sellers at Happy Valley are super chatty so next time I swing out there I'm gonna be like hey can we chat about this and because they're reputable they're going to say no and you won't find anything there with PG I hope but if you're just buying from an unregulated place what to look out for is excessive orange or red hairs not a lot of crystals Bud that feels kind of spongy and is unusually dense um and has a harsh taste when you hit it and doesn't have a good smell so keep an eye out for that and keep yourself safe and ask your dealer where was this SC you know so much about weed boggles my mind it really boggles my mind I just smoked the [ __ ] I love it I love it so much so I I just read a lot I wouldn't say I know a lot I'm always learning I'm always looking for new stuff and I'm always learning and I I like it I want to keep our listeners healthy man don't smoke bad [ __ ] smoke good [ __ ] right right but I also want to scare our listeners we we we want to scare them now that now that we've talked about the weed that that can get them High I mean now I want to frighten them there's mines in Alaska what do they even m in Alaska I I thought all like mining was like in Pennsylvania and [ __ ] what are you mining for first of all in Alaska gold yes copper and gold underground yes and above ground so what I'm going to talk about today is called the Kut mine and Kut Kut okay it's k n n e c o t t kenicott so the kenicott mines are in Alaska and they're not that far from Anchorage and they were found in 1900 when two Prospectors were just kind of wandering around the Wilds of Alaska because the place is huge Alaska's bigger than like half of the continental United States I don't think people know that is it really it is it's huge it's freaking huge if you were to put Alaska on top of the continental United States it would take up almost half of the US it's bigger than Texas way bigger than Texas it's bigger than Texas Well yeah if it's bigger than half the country they say there's nothing bigger than Texas they lie because Alaska's bigger than Texas and all of our Texas listeners we love you but Alaska is bigger we do love you Texas listers what's up with fluger Ville Pflugerville Pflugerville we have a listener in Pflugerville Texas PF Pflugerville is it fluger Ville or Pflugerville I need to know lugerville it's probably fluger pH no PF PF yeah fer well yeah that's probably true the p is silent the p is silent is silent is silent in Texas so let us know flug Grille people I silent you're probably right you're probably absolutely right anyway Alaska M anyway Alaska big huge Wilderness these prospector Prospectors are out in a mountain range in August of 1900 and they stopped to graze their horses and just happen to see a huge outcropping of blue green stone and it's copper and it's huge and they're so excited and they quickly stake a claim they form the chitta mining and exploration company chitta is a city that's nearby there and so they form the chna mining and exploration company with nine of their friends so these 11 people are super stoked they found a ton of copper and hopefully gold too and they're noticed by a man named Steven Birch who is a mining engineer who happened to have a ton of friends back East who are loaded they hear about this mine and want in they form a company and they buy out these Prospectors they pay them $275,000 in 1900 and I looked it up I got a calculator shell and I looked this up $275,000 in 1900 is comparable to $8 million today oh wow so they were paid roughly eight million bucks to give up the claim on this mine which they did the kenot copper Corporation was found they had to build a railroad to get this copper out right this place is so hard to get to Shell I think a lot of Alaska is is just so wild that it's hard to get a lot of places it took them over four years and it it expands almost 200 miles of track and this track goes over huge huge chasms and it also went over a glacier and Glaciers don't stay still this portion of the track on the glacier had to be built and rebuilt every single day as the glacier would move to adjust for the movement of the glacier so that The Ore could come down oh some of the ore they would float it over three miles suspended in the air to get back to the track so as you can imagine this was an extremely dangerous environment to build a railroad in and hundreds and hundreds of people died I couldn't even find an accurate number just so many people died building this railroad during the construction some of these people were even required to dig through avalanches and snow the weather in this area can go from 50° below zero 45° C to oh 90 degrees which is 32 degrees celsus in the summer not a very hospitable Place yeah so they built this 200 100m long track and all these people died and now they have this huge copper mine and as they start pulling copper out they realize that they have stumbled upon the largest known copper load on the planet Planet they're getting millions of dollars it it cost them $20 million to build the tracks it cost them $20 million to build the tracks at the time and adjusted for inflation that's over $460 million today that's a lot it is a lot but there was so many accidents and problems as they were building it Copper's coming out and it has the highest concentration of copper in the world and they're making huge profits its biggest year of production was 1916 and they pulled out 32 million worth of copper and again I adjusted it for today right $880 Million worth of copper hly crap so some towns obviously sprung up around these mines Kennicott was right near the mine and that's where all the miners lived and it was small and kind of disheveled and then a little bit further away the town of McCarthy was developed and that was where the red light district and the bars and where everybody went to spend their money and they were about four miles away from each other Anchorage Alaska a lot of people have heard of Anchorage Alaska this mine is about 230 miles east of Anchorage the area that it's in is part of a national park and preserve and that Park and preserve is the size of West Virginia so it's kind of out there it's way out in the middle of nowhere so a lot of miners lost their lives working in this mine the conditions weren't very good but so much money was coming out nobody cared by the mid 20s they could see that almost all the ore was gone and so people started leaving and the first section closed in 1929 the biggest mine called the mother load closed in 1938 and then the final three smaller knot mines named Erie jumbo and Bonanza they all closed in September of 1938 so the town of kencott was deserted by November of 1938 complete ghost town you can still go there today and check it out however kenicott and McCarthy are literal ghost towns very few people live there but it's really really haunted people say that as they drive up to see it's hard to get to but people say as they drive up the roads that follow these railroad tracks to go see the towns of of Kena and McCarthy one of the more common ghost sightings is as they're driving up these roads people will see tombstones on the side of the road oh but when they stop to look at them they're gone and it's one of those things that lots of people reported either particularly going up when they're going up to the kenot mines they'll see these tombstones on the side of the road they see quite a few of them continuously as they go up but anytime they stop or on the way back down if they stop to look and try to find these tombstones again they can't find them oh people that visit the mine will regularly hear miners yelling for help from down furthers in the shaft even though they know there's no one down there and just like the mine that you spoke about in Pennsylvania they'll very often see miners dressed in their Miner Garb walking into the mines as if they're going to work but no one's there when they go to try and find them oh wow people see orbs in the in the mines and and in the town itself and at one time in 1990 the state of Alaska was going to build a government housing tract along the trail that went up along this railroad but during construction of these houses the workers kept seeing people walk by that weren't there like dressed in old timey Garb and they would hear voices of people and children in particular but no one would be there and it kept fre the workers out so some workers wouldn't stay because the ghost sightings and hearing the ghostly voices got so bad that the workers building these houses just wouldn't stay and finally construction workers started seeing the Tombstones and then their tools started disappearing like they put their hammer in their tool belt and they'd go to grab it again and it would be gone or they'd put a saw or something in a toolbx and it wouldn't be there any longer and these got so bad that they finally couldn't get any construction workers to go work there they just complet stopped construction and the state of Alaska decided it was too haunted it wasn't worth it and they stopped construction so I thought that was kind of interesting so I started looking into this mine and I'm I'm checking into these stories of of hauntings and I hear about people talking about the ghost Miners and the orbs but as happens sometimes when we start researching I couldn't really find a ton it was interesting I thought it was interesting that people would see tombstones and people would see orbs and the old timey miners but I didn't think that was exactly like the scariest story to bring to you I was about to give up but then you must have found something I did so I was like you know this is kind of scary and it sounds like a really interesting place to visit it has kind of a cool history and there's lots of ghosts here I mean how many places do you know where the state has stopped construction on something because it's haunted so that seemed kind of cool but there just wasn't enough I didn't think so I'm kind of poking around and I'm like can I find anything about this kenicott mine what can I F and then I stumbled onto a true crime o yeah and it it involves this exact spot a gentleman who had a summer cabin in the kenot mountains and he says that when he committed this massacre of six people wounding two others he says that he was Driven Crazy by the spirits and the fumes on that mountain the kenot mine that's so haunted that the state stopped construction there did they ever start construction again later nope it's still abandoned never ever so right now it's left how they left it it is it absolutely left how they left it so here's the True Crime that I found okay in the early 1980s a gentleman named Lou Hastings moved to Anchorage Alaska with his wife Lou Hastings was born January 1st 1944 and he was a very shy child it said his dad was kind of abusive and a big old dick but Lou grew up to be a very caring and gentle adult who had a little bit of depression but who was known as being a really nice guy who loved animals he went into the Air Force and became a computer programmer and his friends described him as being introverted someone who was continuously worried about his personal safety he also thought very highly of himself he was a computer programmer and he thought he was the [ __ ] however his friends were like yeah he's he's kind of just so so sounds like a typical uh I won't even say keep going 1979 Lou Hastings met a woman named meline stovel who was a librarian and they got married and they honeymooned at the kott lodge in Alaska near the city of McCarthy and they loved it so much they decided to quit their jobs in California and move to Alaska the following sounds like something we would do it really does like oh hey I'm vacationing here and I love it let's move here yeah it's happened they decide to move there one reason behind it was that Lou had gotten kind of dis illusioned with Modern Life when an oil spill had happened and he had helped to clean some ducks and some Wildlife that had gotten covered in oil oh yeah that happened a lot up there unfortunately it did and so what they wanted to do by moving to Alaska was escape to a place that was was less civilized was was more wild and and more more preserved more yeah they wanted to go to the Wilderness enjoy nature exactly he wanted to be an environmentalist he was huge on nature so they move to Alaska they purchase a home in Anchorage and he starts a business doing like computer repair and Computer Services unfortunately his computer business starts to take a nose dive and so does his marriage and they'd bought a summer home a little cabin out on the kot mountains and he starts spending more and more time at this cabin in 1982 and the wife is spending more and more time in Anchorage now is this cabin close to where the mine was yes it is right on kenot right near this old copper mine now Lou Hastings is you know he's making friends it's a very very small town there are 22 people who live in kenicott 23 now because of Lou Hastings so he's making friends with some of the locals and February 28 1983 Lou Hastings spends the evening at the home of one of his neighbors a gentleman named Chris Richards and they're just drinking hang out playing board games as they kind of did on occasion the next morning March 1st about 8:30 in the morning Lou shows up at Chris Richard's house and Chris is like hey come on in I'm making coffee and he turns his back to Lou Hastings when all of a sudden a gunshot is fired and it shatters his glasses and then another shot grazes the back of his head he falls to the ground and Lou Hastings his friend comes standing over him and basically tells him you're already dead what don't fight and I'll make it quick what Chris Richard has the same reaction he's so confused he doesn't understand what's going on and he manages to grab a knife that was on the table and he stabs his friend to try and get him to stop shooting at him and he manages to uh to stab Hastings in the chest and the thigh and Richards runs out of the house through the snow and he manages to get to a small abandoned cabin that wasn't that far away this is like 10 degree weather and this guy is like Barefoot and in his morning clothes right he's probably in pajamas and so he gets to this cabin and he luckily finds some boots and a Parker that had been abandoned there Chris Richards then heads to another neighbor Tim and Amy Nash who were a young couple who had just gotten married the Christmas before and they had been on honeymoon and had returned to kencott just two weeks before this Richards thought that Hastings was on his way to the nashes so he got there first and told Tim and Amy what had happened and they treat his wounds and everybody's just in shock they don't understand what's going on so they decide to warn the other people in the town it's Tuesday which is mail day so they know that a plane is going to be coming in at one of their neighbors lesson flow heglin house to deliver the mail and there would probably be a bunch of people gathered there so they decide to go there and see if they can get Richard some help as well as to warn the people that are there that's the thing up there everybody's so secluded and so far spread out that they did have to deal with issues like the plane only coming once a week right and they had to deal with issues like not people didn't have phones the only way for them to get word to the outside world was at the hegins house where the plane is coming because they had a radio that could go long distances they couldn't even call their neighbors to let them know that they needed to be safe they had to go there and so the nashes and Chris Richards headed to the hegins house to warn everyone so they thought that possibly Lou Hastings was on the way to the hegins so they decide to head there meanwhile Lou Hastings has followed rich Trail through the snow and ends up at the Nash's house but he gets there and there's no one there so he goes back to his cabin and grabs more weapons including one with a silencer and then he heads on a shorter route to the hegins so Hastings gets to the hein's house ahead of Richards and the nashes kicks in the door and kills both Les andf flow hegins as well as a woman named Maxine Edwards who had shown up there to wait for the mail plane as a lot of people in the town often did to make sure they were dead he shoots each of them in the head and then why why do Killers always do that why is there always let me make sure they're dead I don't know let's make sure they're more dead exactly so after shooting them in the head he then drags them into the bedroom and stacks them on top of each other and leaves the silencer and some of his weapons there at the same time the nashes and Richards are showing up at the air strip which is right near the hein's house and on the air strip they meet Gary green a pilot who had gotten there and was cleaning off his airplane he heard their story about what had happened and agrees to take them to the nearby town to get Richard some medical help and to let the authorities know what's going on Tim says Amy get on the plane she won't so he runs over to the hegins to let them know what's going on while Amy finishes loading Richard's on the plane with Gary so as the plane's taking off Amy sees her husband running back to her he said that the hegins were dead when he had gotten to the house and that he had actually seen Lou Hastings standing on the back porch and had fired at him and missed but that Lou Hasting had returned fire and hit him in leg so the Nash is again Tim's trying to get his wife to get on the plane she won't they think that Lou Hastings has left and so they're gonna stay there and warn the mail plane when it comes in and to warn anyone else who might be coming to get their mail green and Richards takeoff and warn the authorities unfortunately Hastings had followed a trail around and circled around and come back to the airst strip out of sight of Tim and Amy Nash he set up his gun and shot them both from about 200 yards away yeah he then walked closer to them shot them again before finally shooting them each in the head make sure they're dead dead and then buried their bodies in the snow bank to try and hide it oh [ __ ] at this same time right after he buried Tim and Amy Nash in the snowbank a gentleman named Harley king and a woman named Donna Byam are arriving on King's snowmobile they were neighbors and they were coming to the hegan's house to meet the mail plane so as they're driving up they see large blotches of Blood on the snow on the airst strip and they know that something's not right and as they get closer to Hastings as he's standing there Hastings opens fire on them King who was driving the snowmobile got hit in the leg oh he tried to turn the snowmobile and and drive away as fast as he could away from Hastings but unfortunately because of his broken leg he lost control of the machine and it flipped putting him and Donna Byrum both in the snow with Hast stings covering ground quickly towards them Donna tried her best to drag King up back onto the snowmobile but he couldn't help himself he couldn't move and he was too big for her to get on the snowmobile and he insisted that she save herself she didn't want to but Hastings was getting closer and starting to fire at them so she jumped on the snowmobile and took off towards the hegins house behind her she heard Hastings come up to Harley King and basically say don't move you're dead she heard two shots and that was it how crazy literally he then started firing towards her and hit her in the arm she made it to the hegan's house got off the snowmobile and hid in some um I believe they were green houses with Lou Hastings hot on her heels he started looking for her and she could hear him chanting one not dead one not dead like hunting her almost like hunting her like hunting her trying to find her before he finally took off holy crap sounds like he was hunting her almost like you'd hunt an animal yeah so he then gets on the snowmobile and takes off he was heading west on McCarthy Road where he ran into the Troopers that Gary green had radioed for he told them that he was Chris Richards and that Lou Hastings had gone crazy and was killing people the Troopers however knew that Chris Richards was already in Glenn Allen the city where Gary green had flown him for medical attention and that this man who was telling them that he was Chris rich fit the description of Lou Hastings the known shooter so they then arrested him with no incident after this Rampage at first the news articles I read said that they had no idea what had caused this Rampage there was no leads until he confessed he had a very inflated sense of himself and he had had a whole plan he had killed six people Maxine Edwards Flo hegland Les hegland Harley King Amy Nash and Tim Nash and he had wounded two Donna Byam and Christopher Richards the reason he said that he did this was because of the oil pipeline he had planned for almost a year the whole eight months that he had been living on the kenicott mountain he had planned to destroy the pipeline and what he was going to do was go to the heelan's house kill everyone there and then when the mail plane landed he was going to kill the pilot hijack the plane then fly the plane 80 miles to where the pipeline was kill everyone there leave the plane as a diversion or possibly blow it up on the road so that no one could come help and then drive a truck into the pipeline which would then blow up killing him and he thought that because it was so cold the oil would kind of congeal and so it wouldn't cause an ecological disaster so in his mind that was okay he was going to save the pristine Alaskan Wilderness by blowing up the Pipeline and spilling all this oil and because of the manner of death no one would know that he was a murderer who then committed suicide oh wow yeah he was a psychiatrist said that he had a personality disorder and that he considered himself to be an extremely exceptional person and they felt that he would not have killed himself because he he had too high of an opinion of himself oh Lou Hastings was tried in 1984 for six counts of of murder and two counts of attempted murder and he was sentenced in July of that year to six 99-year terms and two 20-year terms a total of 634 years without chance of parole he claimed that he was temporarily insane due to the inhalation of the copper on kennicot mountain and Poss that that can happen so who's to say maybe he did go temporarily insane from the field maybe he did maybe the ghosts of the mountain got to him I I know maybe he had some issues but regardless people said that he was a little odd but no one expected this it was completely I mean the guy he was playing board games with Chris Rogers the night before came over the next morning for coffee like he often did and then just started shooting that's creepy like totally unprovoked almost completely unprovoked we all want the environment to be saved we all want good things but wow that that seems to be like a pretty extreme way to go about it and so no one was ever able to figure out the true reason why he had a lot of writings they're pretty sure the true reason why was he did have this grandiose plan to blow up the Alaskan oil Pipeline and to save the pristine Alaskan Wilderness and they're pretty sure that is exactly why he did it and he just decided in his in his mind that in order to do that he had to kill all these people you know unfortunately when you have people who are mentally unstable to begin with that are very passionate about a particular cause they can go a little overboard and their reasoning isn't always going to make sense right we're not always going to understand why sure saving the environment is a great cause this isn't a very sane way to go about doing it and certainly killing that many people particularly people who have become your friends is outside of any rational thought I don't understand and I I think that's part of it is like you said when someone starts to have issues whether from copper or ghosts or already long- held mental issues we are not always going to know the reasons why they commit these crimes there's not always going to be a rational explanation exactly so I started out looking for ghosts and I found a mass murderer wow so there you go I did a little bit of both for you shelle a haunted tunnel that you can ghost go to now and see orbs and ghost Miners and and hear miners yelling for hell and and in Kut and and the McCarthy towns you can still see you know ladies of the night walking down the street and catch lots of orb photos and all those good ghosty things if you want to go visit but just be a little bit careful because you know there's also the potential to run into the spirits of people who lost their lives to a a shitty murderer still alive by the way still serving his 634 year term what is he in like a Alaskan State Penitentiary type thing or yes he's current currently being held at the Spring Creek Correctional Facility in Seward Alaska that was 40 years ago that was 40 years ago long time he he'll never get pared or nothing no chance of parole all sentences were to be served consecutively so that's why the 634 years with zero chance of parole yeah that's that's not something that's not someone that you want out I mean someone that would just up and decide they need to murder everyone in a town that's yeah scary all for the environment pretty creepy so I'm going to hit some more of my gelato 41 and I'm gonna scare the [ __ ] out of you I would like that I would like that a lot because it's all shitty and you know I hate the things that people do to each other the shitty things we do G well you know I love a good ghosty story me too me to one this one this is a good one and I came into this story there's a couple movies based uh around the story so I came in with some for knowledge that I thought I know what this is about no talk about how people come up and make stuff up over a couple hundred years so we're gonna talk about the Bell Witch in the bell witch cave yay in Adams Tennessee the two movies I'm referencing that were Loosely well we'll say Loosely revolving around this story is one as you had mentioned earlier Blair Witch Project I love the Blair Witch parts of the Blair Witch Project were pulled from this lore not all of it but part of it was and then another movie that was a little more kind of solely based around this story was called an American haunting I don't know if you remember that movie I want to say it was like I don't think I ever saw that one the early 2000s that movie came out I remember it had uh what do you call it not Keith or southernland his dad Donald southernland he actually played uh Mr Bell but anyway so so that movie was a little more more specifically related around this tale and Blair Witch uh project pulled from some of the story so we've all seen one or both of those movies we kind of get get the idea of what the Blair Witch cave is some of us have seen the Blair Witch more than a few times you know it's still The Blair Witch Project still gives me motion sickness yeah and and looking back at I watched it with my kids not too long ago and you know it doesn't really stand up that well it's not as scary now as it was at the time you know one of my kids was like why is this scary I was like because it the hype around it was so much fun I knew it was fake but I'd found this website and I found all this other stuff and they had missing person posters out for months they did they they did a lot of things in the real world to kind of tie into this movie and it was the first one that I had seen that had done anything like that and it was just fantastic and it really fed into the whole it did the whole scary frenzy of it and I love that about it yeah they made it to seem like it was a real thing and not a movie like the marketing behind that excellent oh yeah way ahead of their time yeah so the bell witch cave like I said we're talking like the Tennessee uh Kentucky border and I don't know how I always get wrapped up into these stories that are from like the 1820s but we're going to take it back to the 1820s seems like that was a a ripe time for hauntings in America the 1800s was like ghost Central it seems so it's like 1820 now right from the get-go I was Finding conflicting stories and you know how I get annoyed when I find conflicting stories oh yeah one Legend says that there was this woman named Kate baits and she essentially is the Bell Witch the long and short of it is but she was supposedly in one version the girlfriend of John Bell okay and then during their engagement suddenly for no particular reason broke off the engagement John Bell broke off the engagement and immediately married someone named Lucy whoa whoa whoa so they're engaged everything seems fine and then he abruptly go no reason abruptly breaks up with her and marries Lucy yep that's one version the cad and then has like four or five kids with Lucy so then another version is is that John and Lucy were one big happy family and that Kate Bates was their disgruntled neighbor who was a witch so version one she's the adorned girlfriend gets her heartbroken and then version two she's the crazy witch neighbor knowing the way a lot of this folklore goes version one's probably closer to the truth right he's the [ __ ] and she gets blamed for it and as we all know especially back in those times you didn't like somebody accused him of being a witch especially if it's a woman that was your fiance and now you want out of the picture easiest way she's rich I think had boyfriends do that too um only in this case it's true it's true so some call her the neighbor that that was a witch and was shady um like you said I actually tend to believe the the Brokenhearted ex fiance story myself so Lucy and John their first child out of multiple children's name was Betsy which will be important in a few minutes okay little Betsy see Betsy Bell also you know kind of depending on the version of the story depends on kind of what similar Direction you're going to go in so if you go on the girlfriend story it has said that she wouldn't leave him alone she was she was you know why you marry her we were supposed to get married what the hell you know all crazy she needs answers she's got a lot of questions I mean this is abrupt you got a figure early 1800s in rural Tennessee small town everybody knows each other so she's all like beating on his door you know why y'all sleeping with her what happened to me last week it's not like she can quietly stalk his Facebook and Instagram or get you know or find somebody else on Tinder in a heartbeat so she goes and beats down the door yeah so he so if we're still on the girlfriend Story the theory goes he locks her in the basement and slowly tortures her and starves her to death in his basement whoa whoa this escalated yeah did I can understand being annoyed I've been the annoying exra why why why won't you come back oh my God calling being there showing up their dorm room okay I've been that person yeah but they never locked you in the basement they never locked you in the basement I've seen the annoying ex-girlfriend I've been the annoying ex-girlfriend you don't lock him in a basement I mean there have been some that I've kind of wanted to but you know on the ho on the girlfriend version of the story locks her in the basement and tortures and starves her to death and then her spirit haunts him well no [ __ ] here's the thing he brought that on himself the Bell Witch never haunted Lucy well good because probably not Lucy's fault honestly it's probably [ __ ] Mr Bell's ball the Bell Witch haunted John Bell Mr Bell and Betsy the first child oh why Betsy oh that's not fair because she was the child that Kate Bates was never going to have with Mr Bell okay Kate I was with you till the kid yeah you know [ __ ] with Mr Bell John Bell all you want but leave Betsy alone to the point where she tortured Betsy until Betsy's death oh Kate Kate Kate kind of ruined their life yeah now this cave was said to be on John Bell's property so it's a part of his property but initially when he was dating Kate and engaged it was like either I can't I couldn't decipher through what I was reading if it was a place that was just a common land that she would go to all the time or if it was something that her family owned that his family took over from her so it might have been something that he stole from her right along with her Pride yeah in her heart and you know all that yeah and apparently her need for food um so life yeah so um that was like the only place that she was said to feel at home because she spent a lot of time in that cave as a child so it kind of when she died in his basement she went to her safe place that was like her home base but she would go and torture the bells for years now nobody really believed it and they thought it was a bunch of [ __ ] and that they were all crazy until finally John Bell died because he was mysteriously poisoned and then everybody believed it was the spirit of the witch Kate who poisoned him it was probably Lucy because he was probably sleeping with some other chick and Lucy had had enough of his [ __ ] right but then it's easy enough to blame it on poor Kate because she's already dead and a g already dead and a ghost and she's torturing your daughter and I'm sorry once somebody starts [ __ ] with your kids all bets are off another version of the story is they were neighbors Kate and John were neighbors and hated each other so much and that she was a witch that cursed him in his property and took over his cave as a way to kind of take over his property with her spirit I see so like the the pissed off neighbor who who decides to you know in death I'm going to take over this part of your land anyway right right so they kind of made it she was more like the neighbor that he hated but right after like I said Bel died under suspicious circumstances and they said that he was poisoned by her spirit because her spirit was Haunting the farm so obviously she must have poisoned him yeah somebody shows up poisoned must be the ghost that would be my first thought too I mean what what what can you say yeah I know okay you actually can go to the cave the Bell cave yeah and you for like 20 bucks you can go and actually I think it's like 80 feet deep or something it's not a super deep cave but what I don't understand is somehow the translation went to this brokenhearted girl to now all of a sudden she's a witch right right like if you're a pissed off female in the 1800s you're apparently a witch just say yeah anytime anytime a woman stepped out of her place whether she had excessive emotions or whether she was too smart too outspoken they had to denigrate her in some way and witch was an easy she's a witch she's a witch now we just call them [ __ ] yeah but even that term we're taking back take that another twist to the story like I said so many different quote unquote Origins another is that he uh be John Bell became the Deacon of the Red River Baptist Church and that after he became the Deacon the family began to experience Paranormal Activity all over their property because I guess they owned like probably like 10 or so Acres like of of a Farm property and they would see strange animals roaming the prop property like Cryptids like Cryptids not the normal animals like we're not talking goats and cows and whatever they all they would describe them as a strange animals roaming the property they would hear knocking sounds on the doors in the walls late at night chains being dragged through the house choking sounds so these are some of kind of some of the the things that that they were hearing even though they didn't really have a reason to believe anything about her because again we're just calling her a witch but that doesn't mean she was practicing magic right that was just what she was called at the time right so over time the unidentified presence in Bell's house developed a voice and would actually speak it would actually turn into like different identities and you know you know like the Ouija board who am I talking to you're talking never trust never trust what a Ouija board tells you when used to ask who's calling the spirit one time when asked said call me Kate the Bell Witch okay and that one identity seemed to stick above all others I guess and then that Spirit who on occasion called itself Kate took credit for Belle's death oh okay so the ghost admitted to it so they admitted to killing him called themselves Kate so the people tied it back to this Kate the old neighbor right okay or depending on what you want but depending on the other story scorn to love or ex-girlfriend Okay so we've got this poor girl we've got the sad story of heartbreak she kills them gets her revenge let's fast forward a little bit okay so you got this cave this cave does weird stuff there was there was uh two gentlemen who decided they wanted to go into this cave one of them was like a I can't remember the word for it but they're like a cave person like a cave olist I don't remember the word but you know what I'm talking about like a scientific cavey guy sure and the other guy was a photographer so they were gonna go and do like the story about the cave you do actually have the option or at least you did uh back in the 80s because these two gentlemen went in they were actually doing a story for the um a newspaper in Tennessee called The Tennessean so they were they were doing an article on this cave for The Tennessean and this so this is like 19 I think it was 1986 okay so at least at that point I don't know about today but you could spend the night there even in the cave in the cave oh wow um so these guys decided we're going to go spend the night in the cave and they want to go you know see about the legend of Kate Bates who is the Bell Witch um ironically enough they never ended up spending the night instead they were frightened Away by something that they weren't even sure what it was that frightened him away oh wow yeah so they're too scared to even stay overnight now apparently it is a a kind of a small looking hole in a cliff near the Red River uh in Adams Tennessee and they had actually tour guide type people take them to the mouth of the cave and the two guys were these two brothers who lived on the farm where the bell witch cave is located so you know like the property owner type people not necessarily tour guide people but the property owner so that was probably John Bell's Farm yeah oh yeah okay so there there's two brothers who live on that farm that were doing these tours basically in the 80s um I'm not sure if they were descendants or not so the these two guys the the the photographer and the scientific journalist guy they were given permission to spend the night and the brothers told them we don't think you should they said they'd never spend the night in the cave and in fact they would never go to the cave alone and these are like grown men they knew what was up they knew that the place was spooky and had problems oh absolutely I mean they're they're doings yeah yeah so these two guys undaunted they're like yeah this is supposed to contain the spirit of the infamous Bell Witch and you know a ghost accused of Haunting and then eventually murdering John Bell so they're like yeah whatever this lady from 1820 who haunted and killed this guy not pretty scary so there's like a metal gate at kind of the mouth of the the cave entrance so they walked through this metal gate they thought it was basically like a grunge hole and that's actually their exact words on how they described it was a grunge hole this is where I would freak out it isn't the they deci once they got in the cave it wasn't the witches that they needed to be afraid of you know what else is in this cave besides the freaking Bell Witch bats brown recluse spider o okay tuck your pants into your socks people so they point a flashlight on one of the walls and the whole wall was covered with freaking brown recluse spiders maybe that's how John Bell got poisoned including one the size of a half dollar hanging in the middle of the web whoa scary okay they described it as there were so many they couldn't count them we should put an Arachnophobia warning on this episode yeah right so you know my mind went exactly where yours did my first thought is sucker got bit by a spider because who even knows if they knew what a brown recluse was in 1820 right he he goes to the cave on his property on his own property and then gets bit gets sick and he's like yeah it's that [ __ ] Kate I went to her cave again and now I'm sick and then he drops over debt and they're like oh it's Kate's fault right right we think we solved it sh we solved the crime it's a cold case no longer I know right so I agree I think that he got bit by his spider but anyway these two guys are still in here looking around a little creeped out as one would that's a lot of spiders I don't mind spiders and that's a lot of poisonous spiders well spiders are one thing spiders that can kill me different ball game folks yeah why I wouldn't sleep there that's not safe well in the end they decided not to sleep there and their quote unquote excuse was the spiders well that's a good excuse dude I'm with you man I'm totally with you I don't want to die by a little freaking spider anyway they described the cave as like two rooms so to say like you go into the cave and there's a wide opening a quote unquote room and then there's like another passageway and then another wide opening that's kind of a quote unquote room it says that the cave is really only about 50 to 55 yards deep so we're not talking a big huge cave here so they get in there these these guys get in there they hear their first noise first noise wasn't very loud and it came kind of deeper in the cave like from the direction of like the second room both of these guys hear it and it sounds like a a raspy deepik an unwavering groan or a big electric buzzer with a weak battery oh sound lasted about five full seconds and with the sound came came several loud thumps and they were sounds that were difficult to make in Solid Rock so they weren't things that could have been natural sounds now the one guy whose name was Bill he is a member of the national spello I can't even say this speleological society and the sky has explored miles and miles of caves of all shapes and sizes all throughout Tennessee and Alabama so this guy Bill he's aable in caves he knows what they sound like he knows what they feel like he knows about caves and he said this was not a cave noise interesting I mean I don't want to elevate Bill to the level of calling him a cave expert but he's sure as hell knows more about caves than say the average guy and he knew that this was not a natural cave noise then after that they started hearing a growl oh no that's where I'd be done right right and it sounded like it was coming from like just around the bend kind of thing even worse yeah yeah yeah and the thing is is that these guys I don't want to call them professionals so to say but like I said the one guy's like a cave expert and the other guy's a like a world-renowned journalistic photographer so I mean it's not just like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure for any by any means they knew what they were doing right but they weren't necessarily there Ghost Hunt per se right so they kind of make their way to the front of the cave they're getting a little you know then they decide because there's a there's like a like a line of Lights in this cave obviously for the tourism effect so they go out to the mouth of the cave and they decide that the two brothers there the owners that are running the tours they they figure they got to have this cave rigged somehow with like loudspeakers and or like you know what I mean l iCal assumption that would be a good first step to go look for so they go outside the cave and they find what they think is a power line into the cave well there would be because you said there were lights run right right so they decide to trace it the only thing that line goes to is lights there's no loudspeakers those wires didn't get cut off into some direction that couldn't be traced I mean that line that power line went in lit the lights nothing else done no loudspeakers no sound system the scientist the Explorer and the the researcher in me loves that they checked I love that they checked I love the fact that it dawned you know it would that's not something that would necessarily Dawn on the average Joe where these guys were like all right where's the wires where's the wires you know right and that's cool you know you have to check for things like that the the most likely logical thing is usually what causes it it's not a ghost it was a gust of wind you know it's not a poltergeist you tripped over a corner of the rug you need to pay attention to what's in the environment and kind of take out those be like okay well you know there wasn't anything I could have tripped over there's nothing that could have caused a gust of wind you have to you have to methodically go through those because that's most likely what it is first once you've eliminated those then you can start to look at other avenues and other possible explanations right so they were able to basically kind of negate any outside forces creating those noises they went back into the cave again and they heard a woman's voice scream and then the cave just started groaning and moaning like that just Spooks me out to think of a cave itself groaning and moaning gives me the like creeps so they think it was the cave and like do they think it was Kate groaning and moaning like her spirit or they like the cave itself they described it as the cave itself was moaning and groaning all I could think about is like the Rocks breathing I don't know no you've now taken it to a point where it's way too creepy let's kind of back up a little bit so actually these guys get run out by the noises don't spend the night and then they went and told all their friends and family and co-workers that they were not able to spend the night because of the T of the of the brown recluse spiders no one believed him by the way because that's that's kind of where I think that people kind of sometimes make stuff up to suit their purposes because I believe that these guys encountered noises and and potentially some Paranormal Activity I believe that Kate is a scorned spirit and she probably did haunt Belle he deserved it deserved it absolutely no matter which story you follow either way in the end he deserved it it was his fault and he directly caused her death but but I do not believe that she was necessarily a witch she doesn't always cause harm either by the way a little boy as you can imagine you know kids are explorative in the area younger teenagers oh yeah that that cave would be first place kids would go a boy fell into I can't remember how they described it but all I could think of is like almost like a hole where the Rocks come together way down and he had like plunged kind of into to this get get back out oh oh that's terrible he was there with a a small group of friends um being kids and he started screaming help he started screaming help me help me and out of nowhere these children said they heard an adult woman's voice say don't worry I will help him and the boy described it as an invisible woman grabbed his arm and yanked him out of that little whatever you want call it whole and then all the kids cooperated the story and they said that this this partially Invisible Woman sat them all down and lectured them about how to be safe in the cave and then disappeared into a pile of smoke no [ __ ] way no way she basically saved the boy and then yelled at the kids for [ __ ] around and was basically giving that's [ __ ] funny gave him a lecture on safety but all of the children that were there all described her as a see-through woman wow wow that's amazing so she was helpful in that situation yeah so it's not that she is like anything she's not evil per se she's just mad at John Bell she scorned woman scorned that's right and you know how scorned Spirits are she's probably still scorned his descendants descendants descendants descendants um you know I mean if you are a descendant of John Bell you're [ __ ] um this has been PSA by the stoned Witches Hour exactly you know it's not that she's necessarily bad she targets and and probably honestly like other Spirits if you have a personality like Belle let's just say you might have a harder time than let's say if you don't have a personality like that right but there are encounters where um people have heard the voice The Voice will go from kind of a whisper in the cave to a deep violent voice oh sometimes the voice in the cave will sing hymns quote scriptures they said that even once was quoted word for word two sermons that were preached at the same time on the same day 13 miles apart interesting wow that's that's kind of an interesting Haunting of course there's another group of folk that that describe it as an evil spirit to quote this group the kind that the Bible talks about so she also has been known for people who live on the Bell property even present day experience bed covers that have been yanked off um someone was actually laying in bed and got slapped in the face by an invisible hand oh wow I wonder if uh I wonder if she only punishes people who have been untrue yeah I don't know I don't know I mean slapping a man in the face that kind of sounds like that would go stay there and if your significant other gets slapped or pinched or the covers pulled off of them you should question where they were last Saturday night check out their socials really really close um but you know essentially there's still spooky stories there's still you know people still hear things and experience things in the cave so still haunting it her energy that energy is still there and people up as most recently is um the late 90s have had experiences even in the properties on the Bell property so it's not just the cave it's the whole Farm I think but one article described the cave as her quote unquote headquarters which I translate that to almost like her home it's kind of interesting to me that possibly if they were like neighbors that were rivals and they had this kind of property dispute now hundreds of years later it's pretty much her property so she guess I guess kind of won that land War right right you know like I said it's one of those stories it's hard to tell because it's almost like there's two completely different versions of the same story you know a lot of these local Legends will have multiple origin stories and there's really no way to kind of pick them apart but I do kind of almost believe more the um scorned girlfriend over [ __ ] neighbor I mean that that makes a lot more sense and in that time what are the odds that a young single woman was a property owner that could have had that type of dispute with a a neighboring land owner it just not to mention I've had neighbors that I have really disliked I try not to use the HW a lot but I've had neighbors that I have not liked dude they're not worth my energy to haunt for all eternity I got bigger and batter fish to do that with not my not my ex- neighbors right I'm haunting you for all eternity there's some substance to my anger if I'm haunting you for all eternity we were in love and made promises to each other that you then broke for some strange and mysterious reason and now I'm [ __ ] pissed so yeah yeah she never got the answer she was looking for but apparently she got a Revenge she got her revenge and and she she is that that cave is her home it seems I like the story where she saved the kid that's pretty cool she's not all bad but I think like what you said she might sense people who have similar personality traits to John Bell and those are the people she's messing with or like you said maybe they're people who are somehow related to John Bell and she's just kind of just [ __ ] with people who happen to be like the second cousin eight times removed of John Bell you know I'm gonna curse you and all your descendants kind of for all eternity yeah curse yeah you're scorned lover yeah exactly somebody needs to get down on their knees and beg their ancestors for forgiveness or you know try and solve this and it just hasn't happened but I also I also don't necessarily believe that a ghost can poison you so I'm totally with the whole John got bit by a spider yeah either JN got bit by a spider and he happened to be talking about Kate so they blamed it on her or Lucy poisoned him and was like I'm not going to jail over this [ __ ] Kate did it [ __ ] probably put a spider in his bed one night there you go that would do well it would take more than one brown recluse SP I mean most of the time honestly stoned witches PSA most Brown recklo bites yes go immediately to the hospital but it's probably not going to kill you it's just going to make you really sick and wish you were dead but they're they're pretty nasty and honestly if you find a whole wall of them I'm pretty sure more than one bite could be very very deadly so run yeah run so putting one brown recluse in his bed would just kind of be that would be pretty spiteful and mean but probably wouldn't kill him but you know I I just I just get so baffled at how there can be and this isn't the first time I've found multiple versions of the same story very interesting very interesting because it's it you can tell based on the time period it's kind of like um the Salem Witch Trials you know God forbid that you're gonna admit to your wife that you had an affair no you're gonna say they're a witch and try to kill them yeah it was just kind of the way of the time was just accuse people of [ __ ] when it things didn't go your way when you got called out for being a liar and a cheat you just ruined someone's life to make it easier for yourself [ __ ] up and they would immediately point at someone with less power than them and and who had less power but women yeah and then a lot of times older women or or people who were homeless or who had mental disorders so they immediately go to the person who has less agency less power or what um um women who had a minuscule of power and property that we had to immediately take that away yep they were very threatening we have to get them out of out of the picture so I think that's a lot of what happened here I'm not saying the cave ain't haunted I'd love to go there to be honest with you um and and hear the cave breathe for myself minus the spiders but I think that it just might be a scorned lover not necessarily some evildoer neighbor witch lady but a scorned lover who you broke my heart man I'm going to ruin you for eternity and everyone you've ever loved in are related to just like in Practical Magic right yes just like just like Practical Magic it's interesting to me that the Bell Witch kind of became part of the Blair Witch Legend because I don't really see a lot of correlation there other than like a witch who lived in the woods I think that's really kind of you know the witchy KV yeah something like that but I want to go I want to go and take some pictures I want to hear The Ghost and see if she comes around but do you think we could go from Tennessee and then fly up to Alaska and then take some orb photos up at the kenicott copper mine up at the kott copper mine so that I can get my Orbee photos in with some ghosties up there and see if we can see some some long dead miners walking to work and then do one be kind of a long trip Tennessee to Alaska Tennessee would be so much fun because uh down in Tennessee there's also a lot of like gem mines oo I'll have to look a little deeper into it but you can't have a mine without having a story that's true it seems like they all have some sort of can't have a mine without a story of a ghost so true so true mines and ghosts kind of go hand inand and caves and ghosts hand in hand it's a thing oh yeah it seems to be you know as soon as we look at them they look kind of creepy right do you know where you're going next week shell with your stories um I I I no not yet yeah me either I I'm too too high to kind of pin that down yet we want to surprise everybody not only our listeners but ourselves ourselves as
