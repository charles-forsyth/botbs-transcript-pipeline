this is going to be the most confused I am in episode ever guys I am very excited I am I am interested in astrology but it is definitely far for my forte so Lori we welcome you to the show and tell us a little bit about yourself and your astrology background before we kind of dive into the nitty-gritty well I am delighted to be here let me say that  1st and astrology has just always been my passion from the time I think I was 7 years old the first time I saw the symbols on a little book by the grocery store checkout I remember those I saw those when I like I said when I was about seven years old and I don't know what it was but the symbols themselves just called to me really loudly and I begged and pleaded with my mother to buy me those little little tiny books And I memorized everything I couldn't you know I have spent the rest of my life since then chasing those symbols I knew there was something in them that I had to understand so that's that's where it all began it's amazing how sometimes these things can really reach out and call to us even when we don't understand what they are I have no idea it's like one of those little squiggly lines and what do they mean  astrology has always been one of those esoteric Pursuits that you would see regularly it was commonplace the sea magazines like that you know in the supermarket and you would see people's horoscopes in the newspaper and in magazines all the time I mean since the 80s has been very common to see astrology around but I think a lot of us realize after first reading horoscopes if there's more to it than the superficial this is what your daily horoscope means and you know I think that diving in beyond that that superficial is where you really start to get into the interesting parts of astrology absolutely people tend to think you know I'm a Sagittarius or I'm an Aries or whatever the sun sign is they tend to think that's who they are and that's such a tiny piece of it and you know what's interesting cuz there is there's many astrology shawl over the world there's Indian astrology this Vedic astrology you know what we're talking about here is Western astrology it is  not based on the constellations it's based on the seasons it's very much based on the seasons and you know there's just what you hear about astrology in today's world you're here a lot about what's called mundane astrology which is what's going on in current time you do people tend to know when Mercury is retrograde or when they're going to flip some kinds different ways of looking at it and my focus really is natal astrology which comes from the moment you took your first breath you bring in the energy of the patterns at that moment in time I think of you know astrology really is a study of time and I think of there being a river of time that goes by  and when we take that first breath it's like that split-second of time is removed from the river of time and hand it to you and it's your job to incorporate the gifts and the challenges that were inherent in that moment that's pretty deep that was one of your book to take it back to your book for just a second because it was like a workbook for me but I'm going to say that in the beginning you talked a lot about cycles and finding the Cycles in the stars and bringing those Cycles back to Earth so it struck me when you said that Western astrology follows the seasons it went back to you talking about the cycle and that resonates with me as a witch because we're very connected to Cycles in so many different levels and I didn't know that about Western astrology I didn't realize that it was cyclical like that can you explain that a little bit a lot of people follow and understand the cycle the lunar cycle  you know you got the new moon goes to the first quarter of the Full Moon the last quarterback to the Numa so that's the lunar cycle but you can expand that out and any two planets has a similar cycle so you could take like I don't know Venus and you're honest and when they come together it's like a new moon only it's those two planets cycle to all of the pairs of planets are creating their own cycles that are impacting our individual birth charts and we're born in the midst of a whole series of different Cycles  it is complicated. Why do I feel like an in and you haven't mentioned this yet but here's my fear with I know nothing about astrology other than I'm a Gemini and boy does she know it I feel like there's a lot of math involved is that true or is that just one of those Scare Tactics things back in the day there was a lot of math involved we had to sit down and you know Char all this stuff it was very very complicated in today's world we plug the information into the computer and it giving it gives us the information that you know you can you can work with the math of it but you don't really need them anymore so someone like me who is absolutely scared of math not my forte at all. Because me and math are like know and I felt like if you're not  good at math you're not going to be good at astrology that's absolutely not true yeah you might come into places that are a little confusing but you don't need to know that, okay even I mean I work with people who know absolutely nothing about astrology one of the things that I've really focused on is my desire has always been make this usable to anyone it doesn't need to be you know there's a lot of astrologers I think that have had this like you know we're special and we have the special knowledge that no one else can come near to I don't like that I want to make this I know what astrology has done for me in my life it has enabled me to become a decent human being you know seriously when I was young I was not a very nice person  and knowing astrology and using it to understand myself and other people just cracked me open in a way that I want people to be able to understand and love themselves and other people through this perspective that astrology gives us and we don't need to complicate it in huge ways you know you can get as complicated as you want with astrology but you know if you read somewhat my book I got the best compliment about my book recently from an old student that studied with me at my kitchen table like 35 years ago and she wrote to me she said I just read your book and I felt like I was sitting at your kitchen table and that just meant so much to me cuz that's what I wanted when I wrote the book I was writing it to my students  I was writing it to people that want to really understand the natal chart now I'm going to add to that and I'm going to say yes it does feel like I'm sitting at your kitchen table but only if you're a very serious Professor who has a lot of knowledge to impart and is giving me a lot of information because I I don't know a lot about astrology and I did read through this book and it was not easy but it was so good and I really love that you included charts of famous people we found lizzo and who else would we find Shell I found the rising information for Janis Joplin what made it really actually accessible for me I'm not going to say easy because that's the wrong word was that you have these charts in here and so when it finally started to click for me was when I would take these parts or my charge is generating like you said a free one that I could look at and then going back and reading the passage and relating it to the chart that I was  so I did have to do that it made more sense to me when I could look at it right on that chart and then it started to click and as I went through the book I was starting to see it not so much as math and rising signs but more like a Tarot spread more like a charm casting spread or tasseography I started to see in these pictures where they were sitting in their houses where they lay on just like in a Tarot spread how they've created a story how they wove together a narrative so your book is not easy yes sitting at your kitchen table sounds fun but it's a lot of work and so I did start to get it but it did take working through it but it it's starting to make sense and be very cool in that way to me so thank you if you're interested in understanding your own chart if you've got a copy of your chart in whole Sign House system I want to just reiterate that there's different house systems many so many and whole sign makes  much less dependent on knowing that I mean that's one of the one of the reasons I started working with whole Sign House system is it it's easier and after working with different house systems over many years you don't lose anything it makes it a lot easier and it's just as powerful I love it it makes things a lot easier and a lot less dependent on math I mean ya know if you were going to say you knew nothing cuz Layla is actually a step above me in astrology knowledge not saying much you know everybody pretty much knows the sign they were born under if they just wanted to kind of scratch the surface and get in any particular things they should focus on like I remember 20-30 years ago the big thing was knowing you're rising and what that meant if you knew your birth sign your Rising your son your moon you don't  is there a scratching the surface starting point or is this just a dive all in and get all the houses and just go For Broke at I'm you really do and Sun Moon and Rising are the basic place to start okay and if you know you know you can take those three pieces the sun is the core of who you are the Moon is your emotional nature your greatest need of the personality and the rising sign is sort of how people see you kind of mask that you wear not a mask to hide behind but the mask that allows you to show up in the world in a authentic way and if you know those three things you can kind of go out from there you know the way to think of it is there's the planets each planet is a particular piece of who we are we can think of it as the planets are our internal teachers  and the signs that they're in our the method they used to teach us and then the houses are different areas of life so wherever the planet lands it's teaching you with the method of the sign in that area of your life you know you can come to create the thing where you can just make little sentences of these different parts of we are complicated incredibly complicated I know I'm relating it to Tara because that's the system I'm most familiar with the boy is this an awful lot like a Tarot spread Planet putting it into a particular pattern and not me but it's really very much like tarot I love how you talk about it that way cuz you know I work sometimes with just thinking about the house ask your rooms inside of us a different things he's different energies and if it is you can definitely look at it similar to  tarot spread and if you think of taking that one breath as your board it's a troll spread that holds the entire focus of your life that but I have a question so with Terrell you know I kind of look at Terrell as this is where you're at in the path you're on right at the moment of this spread and you could take a left turn in 20 minutes and it could all change but this kind of War sounds like like the old saying it's written in the stars are you just destined to live out what all of this says or is there are you asking the Free Wheeler fate question to them know you're not you're not as yes your natal chart your birth chart is your chart it is your job to work with that however from that moment you breathe in that first moment the planets are set  their patterns but from that moment on the planets keep moving and as they move they interact with your chart so you have opportunities all throughout your life to work with these deep inner parts of yourself the parts are still the parts but when a planet comes along and says okay it's time right now this year in the year 2025 you have an opportunity to explore whatever your moon your emotional nature then you have choices on how you work with that okay changes the trajectories the whole conversation is fascinating because I think that there is an element of Faith because we're born at this moment we've chosen I think we've chosen this moment to come in we've chosen these lessons to take on how we respond  when were called upon to act on them is up to us it's up to us to me one of the things that my friend any day and I have started doing we've got a YouTube channel I've seen it I love it by the way charts makes so much more sense watching you guys break down different people's charts and talk about things and it's very good we just started the series of the famous people and we did we did Donald Trump we did Cory Booker right after he did his 25 hour AMC recently you should we do next because we're making a few more this week we haven't decided on who yet Anders can't find a birth time for him and I know him because I've lived in Burlington I was there when he became mayor of Burlington in 1981 I've known Bernie since 1981 and I actually asked his wife couple years ago  if she would give me his birth, she wouldn't I have a confession I don't know my birth time I have a gas that was given to me but my mother confessed that she made it up so I'm in the process of getting my long form birth certificate but I don't have it yet how does that impact peoples chart totally what should I do well the time of birth is crucial for really deep work there are ways you can work with a chart without a birth time you lose certain things there's still a lot of information there's still a lot of information what you do if you don't have a birth time is you just create the chart at the moment the sun is rising on that day and that's called a sunrise chart tails and you know if you were born in this country by law  the time is on the original long form however if you just contact the whatever Department of Vital Statistics and just say I want a copy of my birth certificate what they actually will send you is a registration of birth not the long-form that's exactly what I ran into as I do have official copy of my birth certificate but they are not the long-form they do not have the time you have to really contact a human being that you can talk to and I'll just order it online and be really clear you want the long form the original that has the time on it and you know I've talked to some people that just somehow get dumb lucky and get a hold of somebody says oh I'll check it and just give them time I was hoping for that but thankfully it's only a couple hours away from here and I have family and a good reason to go there so I'm lucky enough I can go get it I just don't have it now  I have the opposite my mother was a pack rat and back in the seventies and the town I was born and they actually put your time on your original birth certificate and my sweet pack ready mother has never never lost our birth certificates weed so I actually am now have my original that was issued to my parents at my birth and it has the time on it so I didn't even have to get like the whole long and process it just happened to be on the original because that's what they did in my town back in the 70s on little factoids the time that I was given as my birth which again was admittedly made up with 7:41 a.m. so what time were you born I was born at 7:41 p.m. isn't that funny you're too charts we're really interested I was just so many links oh that's interesting no wonder they do a podcast they left  each other a lot and you have to say Yes actually that is been that has been through our whole friendship we do not have a lot that's very true I'm not surprised one other place that's really almost always you can trust to be really accurate with the time is for parents that keep baby books people are very specific when they fill in that baby book so if you can't find a birth certificate easily look for baby book I didn't even spend mostly documented that in several different locations including a baby book children children's charts and mothers charts are so amazing to work with together we think we know our children. Boy it's really amazing to get the perspective of who our children are it helps us to raise them so much sweetheart  we think we know we don't laugh because like I said I'm a Gemini and my daughter is one of those people that was born on a day that they call a cusp so my daughter is a Libra Libra Scorpio on the cusp and she is just like her Gemini mother because of that it is very interesting the cost of an interesting thing because his kind of shorthand for we really don't know I was going to say I explain what a customer with the time of your birth allow you to decide which one it is yes absolutely the thing that the whole idea is because you know most people don't especially back back in time people don't know exactly the moment the sun moves that you know it's not like oh the book says the sun is in the sign from this date to that day and exactly at midnight the sons of you know obviously the Sun and its movement through the signs doesn't go by midnight  exactly and if your born before that 2:40 to your one sign if you're born after that 242 you're the other son is one of the reasons people you know I hear people so much it's like I know I'm on the cusp cuz I can feel both signed so clear in me well that's probably because there's some other planet in that other side you know the Sun Mercury and Venus never move very far away from each other because they are between us and the sun when we look at it from our perspective they're always close to the Sun they never are opposite the sun they're always close to it so if you think you're on the cusp between Scorpio and Libra well you probably have mercury in one in the sun in the other or you know Venus my sister I grew up I was the youngest of five kids but I think one of the reasons I was so obsessed with astrology was trying to  stand up crazy dysfunctional huge family and trying to make sense of the people I lived with and I had one sister who all the books told me she was a Libra I thought she was a Libra sign somewhere in my thirties I finally like ran an actual copy of her charm. She was a scorpion was like oh no wonder she made so much more sense like no wonder she never was a Libra so yeah but the thing is always interesting I found that people who feel like they don't identify with their sons sign off and do with like a rising or maybe they're Moon does that have something to do with how their personality expresses themselves because you mentioned like son is who you are rising is how you present yourself and moon is your inner self with your emotions roughly roughly could it be that they may be identified with that another side of themselves more strongly yeah there's a lot of things that can fax you know there's  the time of day you were born people born at night the sun is below the surface and it's not as outwardly expressed people during the daytime it's more outwardly Express it's like Jenny and I that do the YouTube videos together we've known and worked with each other for so many years we both our sun sign Leo but she's a night Leo and I'm a day Leah and we kind of get a laugh about that a lot I'm a lot more out in the world and she's a lot more internal and you know we're both Leo's but if you met us I probably show up more Leo then she does see since I'm up like an aquarius sun and moon Aquarius rising and I think I've got a couple more aquarius's in there does that explain why I am so much an aquarius probably I do remember you had a lot of Aquarius do you remember if your mark is your mercury in Aquarius  you look when we were looking at mine at one point I think my moon is Aquarius and I think you both had a bunch of Aquarius to make spend my other child all over my chart okay so one of you is moon in Aquarius that's okay moon in Aquarius has sun and mercury and ascendant Aquarius oh well we don't really know because you don't have a hundred percent sure so we don't know your birth time but the Mercury Mercury in Aquarius is one of my favorite things to see what does that mean when Mercury is your mind your thought process is how you think what you think about you know how your mind works and Aquarius is  yes we are Aquarius is the sign of genius and not in terms of the highest IQ going but the ability for the mind go places that nobody taught it to go so that's why I was a bookworm always go down rabbit holes and Aquarius is all about Innovation it's the ability to see into the future of the ability to go into the future I had my son who's 35 years old now his Mercury was in Aquarius and I always think about him I might have even written about it in the book but when he was like seven years old had this huge piece of poster board and he was trying all these intricate little symbols and like what are you doing and he said I'm solving the problem the how did she say it and solving the transportation  albums of humanity with magnet Theory where do you get these ideas and screwed up his mind and I see people with Mercury in Aquarius sometimes can lose other people feel like you're talkin talkin talkin people are following you and all this and it's like where'd she go just went somewhere where and with your shell your moon in Aquarius emotionally you can follow her thinking intellectually be following her thinking but emotionally totally keep up  that sells Mercury is in Gemini I feel like we're the most discriminated like group of people people think you're like do you like to gather information I do you're going to follow her thinking because you're just gathering information you know they're both AR sign so they're both intellectual signs Gemini is an aquarius. Both are signs both intellectual signs and the difference is that the Aquarius is innovating going to the Future and the Gemini's just gathering information just gathered and then figure out what to do with it later that must be why we keep making you describe the first thing I thought when I looked at the two charts it's like oh they know how to work together on that level and go that's always been true a million things there  you know the last 10 or 15 years we've kind of is Pluto a planet is it not a planet are we going to keep it or we not do you count Pluto indefinitely Or what do you say about the people who leave it off the chart because it doesn't count as a planet anymore anyone who does who leaves It Off the Chain off the chart because it doesn't count as a planet anymore I don't know where I don't doesn't answer thank you like traditional traditional Western astrology that only use the planets Sun through Saturn because that's what it was based on before we found these other outer planets Pluto as a planet definitely it's one of the outer planets it has more to do with you know it's a generational plan  it has more to do with the outer bigger picture but no Pluto's planet Pluto the planet of power on team Pluto planet as well so lately when I started saying Pluto wasn't a planner it's like what the heck it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what they say I agree it's what's working and it's been working so where am I going to let it go I was looking through your book it's very workbook e and it's right next to me cuz I feel like I want to explore my whole thought process of doing these readings by looking at the charts and I'm really intrigued by it but other than journaling that type of progress that type of learning progress is there something that I or our listeners could do on a daily or weekly you know some type of regular basis where they can get in touch with it with this energies of Their Stars Beyond looking at the grocery store horoscope section make an appointment understand  some real understanding talk to a real professional astrologer I I think that you know aside from studying for a long long time that's the place to start really I I do a lot of mentorships with people as well I do consultations like consult with people all over the world around their natal chart around what's going on in current time impacting them and also the piece that I love to do more than anything right now is helping people understand themselves and the people they live through this perspective not necessarily you know everybody doesn't need to learn astrology to this great depth but if you find an astrologer who is able to really help you understand the core of what the natal chart tells you and the difference it can make in your  Shep's you know I have two different mentorship programs one is for people that want to learn astrology and one is for people who want to learn about themselves and the people they love and that's what I love to do more than anything is help introduce you to your children to your mother to your you know whoever when when I you know I have this process that I go through and I go 1-2-3 in I basically the the guideposts in the book I do that process with a chart and I get to a point where I feel the person and I know them in this very intimate place and at one time I was probably in my thirties I picked up my mother's chart and I did the process and when I got that feeling I was like what the hell is that that's not my mother  and I went from there to interviewing All My Siblings about who they thought their mother was  and it was as though we each had a different mother because we all see people from our filters and then taught me so much about you know how little we know the people in our lives and if I can help introduce people to the people they love and help them understand who they're really working well it's a very powerful gift I love that that's beautiful and that that is a fantastic way to bring this in into personal life and an even just on a more superficial level I mean you can do that and it's such a cheap way but I mean she'll and I have had lots of conversations just talking about her being a Gemini and leaving an Aquarius and what that means about our relationship and just in kind of a fun way but I understand her better after having those conversations  and when you meet someone and and they tell you what their sun sign is almost everybody's excited tell you what their sign is and if you know just a little bit about that they're basically trying to share a part of themselves with you there trying to say this is who I am that you might not see right away but I'm such an Aquarius and you can get an idea of what they're like from that and so I think that even if you don't want to work the math is Scary or it's not interesting to you if you just interested in just a few of those little Parts I can really help you find so many connections with people whether it's people in your family that you can learn another side of like you did with your mother you learned many different pieces of her or someone that you just met at a party it can be a way to get to know them and kind of talk to them and and find that connection and if you want to go to the next step after the sun is the moon you know because the Moon is our emotional nature and you know if you meet somebody and you can't make any sense out of their emotions  nature it's you know you won't understand that I mean between the two of you that's the one piece that's a little oddly off his arm around your moons yeah because shows moon is it aquarius so it's that intellectual like there's a way in which the emotional nature is kind of cool it's cool there's a little bit of Detachment there and then he was known as in Virgo that's very different Virgo is really service-oriented they're grounded so you know one of you is very grounded emotionally one of you is very intellectual emotionally that's where things might like not always feel totally aligned interested in you know I mean we all know relationships can have every piece that works right there's always going to be something that and that's what makes us curious about each other I think you know I think that my Virgo  South which is very different than the than the Aquarius nature kind of helps keep me a little grounded and I think that helps me connect a little more with shell sometimes because she can be very good about the list and the note taking and taking care of things and I relate my Virgo side relates to that very well where is her aquarium Moon allows her to let go and be a little more wild and a little more emotional and out there with me I think so maybe that kind of helps us in different areas I love Virgo it's a good sign that has a bad reputation I know nothing of something came up in my mean to me cuz I don't know what that conversation that's a big conversation but no little access kind of tells us the the Soul's purpose okay  okay that's a different podcast we'll have you back we'll talk about sole purpose of many things there's so many ways to look at these things that you know we can find ways to look at however you want to look at it whether you want to look at it as past lives or ancestral lives and how they impact us you know there's just so much available astrology is like one big onion and you can just keep peeling back those layers further and further however you want to go like so many things you know like what you guys do with really going in and understanding is levels of witchy Ness and Witchcraft and I mean there's no end to those layers that's good point you know I said that to someone recently I said you know this is one of the things that I love the most about astrology if I can study this everyday  my life from the time I was 7 years old until however long I live and I never will get bored or never come to an end and that person was talking to look at me as he isn't that the same with everything and I started thinking actually anything that's worth putting our passion into is going to open up those layers layers do still feel like you learn new things strategy after all this time yes I feel like I learn new things about my own Char yeah it's what keeps getting deeper and they don't stay still they don't stay still and as they move they change the change our perspective on our own internal processes you know most people I work with i c m at least every six months and over time there is really an ability to track the cycles and see what's being opened at this period of time and what's being shown  at this period of time so what you're saying is it's important to journal those readings and keep track of them that's never go piece I loved I do have one last question is all the hype about Mercury going retrograde really all that they make it out to be or is it just an internet scare tactic I go to work and Ethan on which astrology is that really the case here's the thing I love Mercury retrograde I love it I love it when I know Mercury is turning retrograde I get very excited you have to learn to work with it you know there's a lot of things about astrology that people throw out for clickbait for Scare Tactics there's so much of that and it's very frustrating to see it but what I thinking  I've really worked with Mercury retrograde for many years and how I tell people to work with it is when you know Mercury is getting ready to go retrograde if you're paying attention you want to know a couple weeks ahead of time and you want to sit down and you want to make a list of every single thing in your life that has been left undone that you've started but not finished and we know there's a million of those things right projects that we've started things that we started haven't gotten to make a list of those things for the three weeks that mercury is retrograde don't do anything new stick to that list go back and clean up the things on that list that Mercury retrograde. Of time will be the most powerful time to get stuff done that's great advice I love that it works so well I get so much done when Mercury is retrograde I don't start anything new but I get a lot done  Mercury going retrograde I'm going to make a list yeah do it do it make sure you pay attention when people get scared of it it's just like ya know Scare Tactics it's almost like we got to get used to it in the meantime while you're waiting for the next Mercury retrograde start something new check out this book how to read and interpret a birth chart get a little deeper into your own birth chart and I'm telling ya as someone who's not very good at this stuff just looking at my birth chart that I generated online and then going through this book helped me understand it both the book and my chart so much better so much information has intrigued me enough to make me dig a Little Deeper without too much math fright it don't be scared of the math it's really not a big deal and this is a lot of fun I'm finding a lot of fun in this but I did not  back so again thank you for that as well Lori and thank you so much for coming on the show we really appreciate it been really fun talking to both of you absolutely well I Lori Farrington.
