the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and on this episode we are welcoming in 2025 this is our very first episode of a brand new year and I'm shell and you know how exciting is this I feel like this is the year you know shaky start whatever nobody cares we are all going to rock it this year each and every one of us every one of us this is it I feel it I'm hoping I'm hopeful I'm trepidacious there's a lot to be worried for in America this year there's a lot you know new changes things changing everything's weird all over the world things are a little bit weird so I think we're all kind of tiptoeing into 2025 maybe I'm not sure yeah but you know it it's kind of like life it's what you make of it man just have a have a good attitude and it'll all be good I don't know I guess I kind of have my Shields up but I'm still hoping for the best that's kind of how I'm looking the whole brand new year so I feel that way every year there you go I wouldn't say cautiously optimistic I would say cautiously cautious but still kind of hoping for the best let's let's talk about this new year because you know magically what are our plans let's talk about this what can people do for the new year let's talk about that too hopefully you did your New Year's Eve fun things maybe you opened the back door to let the old year out and open the front door to let the New Year in and Chuck that cinnamon right out that door right maybe you cleansed your house right before mid night uh whatever your Traditions are I hope you had a great time and I hope you didn't have a whiskey headache like shell did you know it happens what I like to do and what shell likes to do at the beginning of the year are ttings hell yeah whether it's a little one or it's a big huge one you know actually shell I was looking at a Tarot spread that's pretty common it's like the the wheel of the Year tarot spread right it's like 13 CS it is really super common and you know I had thought about trying to come up with a brand new New Year spread but that's just been my go-to for so long that I just I don't know New Year wheel I don't know it works it's a great spread but this year it made me think of the movie do remember that movie we talked about tarot tarot right where they combined tarot and astrology in kind of a murdery Killy people way and they and they did that spread so now all I see when I look at that wheel of the Year 13 card spread is that that movie and the slightly cheesy way that people died because of that tarot spread you know and that is a version that I do like I do like using 13 cards not as a significator but I do a card for the 12 months but then kind of like a and what does this all mean card yeah the culmination card right the the tie it all together card on top yeah you could start with a significator if you wanted to and then do your 12 cards in a circle and your 13th card on top of your significator yeah and you know obviously if you get any jumpers everybody loves the jumpers lately that seems to be it seems to be such a big thing but there's a difference okay there's a difference between you're a shitty shuffler and cards are falling out exactly okay like there's definitely a difference between the two and I think that sometimes people have issues telling a difference or sometimes people want it to be special they want something magical and extraordinary to have happened happen so cards that quote unquote jump out of the deck fill that for a lot of people I'm not going to say that that's not a thing because 20 30 years ago when I was reading for clients there were times when cards fell out I was like oh that's important let's put that here right because like you said you can tell the difference like we said a couple episodes ago not every damn thing has a sign though that's right and not every card that falls out is because it's magic it might just because you're a shitty shuffler bingo so the 13 card and I know this is a Ry 2 do you start putting your cards down with month one January at the 12:00 position on the clock or the 1:00 position on the clock I do it at 12 o'clock I never thought of that why are you saying that now you're confusing me have I been doing a song no no you haven't I think you can start anywhere you want to and I'm pretty sure that depending on Whose wheel of the Year spread that you look at you can either start your first card at 12 or your first card at one but to be honest you can start it anywhere on the wheel I do whatever the hell I want we know that's what we love about you I guess I never thought about it that way I guess January 1 would kind of make sense but yeah I just kind of plump and then go around yeah but also that Northern position that top position on the clock also feels like a very natural place to start a year as well so either one works it feels like you're starting you know I try to do things and and kind of think about what direction I'm in you know and you know if I'm sitting in the north wouldn't I put the first card down in the north I don't know that's what I'm doing are you making me second guess myself I'm not it's because I always did it wrong I like to start with the first month on the first number I guess I wouldn't exactly say I was doing it wrong I just wasn't doing it the way that a lot of other people did it the way my brain works the 12 ain't the first number to you I know well it's not the first number the other thing that I could do is sometimes I like to do that wheel of the year we've talked about it before as a birthday spread so I'll start it on the number of my month so I'll start at the two position or if I'm feeling super numerology and fancy I might start my birth number is four so I might start it on the number four of the wheel I usually for my birthday I like to do a spread in the shape of the year I am turning yeah I remember when we talked about birthday spreads last year and we came up with a birthday sigil layout together that's a good one you could do that as a New Year's spread a birthday sigil spread of the age you're going to be for the year I'm gonna need a lot of damn cards this year by the way there's also biddy tarot we did have the lovely Bridget on here from biddy tarot love her she's great and she has a New Year's tarot spread on her website bitty tarot.com and this one is um also 12 cards pretty common theme right yeah I but I put that 13th card kind of dead in the center yeah I do too hers is more of an inverted triangle and she has a meaning for rather than aign a month to each of these 12 cards she has a a different meaning for each position oh like hers goes in an inverted pyramid so there's five cards four cards and then three cards and so like number one is the previous year in summary and then number two is the lessons learned from the past year so you could do your wheel of the Year spread and get an idea of each card correlating to the corresponding month for the next year and then you could do the bitty tarot New Year spread and get you know a little bit more of an in-depth reading on you know lessons things standing in your way um relationship you know that kind of thing I do not need the tarot cards to tell me what lessons that I chose not to learn last year serious you just need me seriously obviously Journal it mostly because it's really really nice to look back over years and years of New Year's Eve spreads or New Year's Day spreads that you've done and see what worked what didn't work what came true see how far you've come but I will say we talked about this on an episode I don't know how far back um but we got a Tarot journal from Red wheel wiser and you know that is a great thing that if you haven't already started to start this time of year um I as much as I am anti your journaling concept I do agree with journaling tarot damn it yeah you know if I want to get you to do anything if I just throw tarot into the mix it makes it way easier I know but like when you when you do that you can kind of see patterns and and you can get a better sense especially if you're new to tarot it can give you a better sense of your cards um of your intuition you know it's it's a good exercise to learn tarot but it's also a good window into what's coming if you are already an experienced tarot person and it can also help you identify patterns like I can think of a time right when I had kind of gotten out of college and I was reading a lot of cards and I think what was it the page of Pentacles not sure exactly what card was kind of following me around but every time I did a reading for myself I'd swear that page of Pentacles kept popping up and at the time I knew that it meant you know there was some new opportunity coming for me I knew I was going to be changing jobs and I didn't want to I didn't want to be leaving where I was I didn't want to be doing these new things and this card kept popping up to remind me that this was going to happen anyway I was gonna say life ain't always about what you want that's right it's kind of about what pass are you on and I wasn't recognizing the signs but I started to look back over some tarot journaling that I had done and I saw the card repeated and if I hadn't been journaling it I might not have noticed the pattern didn't help because I still didn't listen to myself or the cards but at least I notice the pattern oh see there's your mistake we're not telling you to listen we're just tell to journal it to see Journal that's right we know you're not going to listen to yourself we we know you're going to have to kick yourself in the butt repeatedly but you know at least Journal it so you have evidence I guess I also find the beginning of the year a good time to kind of catch up on some learning it's a good time to read books it is a good time to maybe try new things especially magically because you're home you got nothing better to do it's cold out at least here in the northern hemisphere you know our southern hemisphere folks I hope you are getting Sun Sun Tans and and Beach time because I am jealous so jealous but here we have time to do things things like Journal our tarot readings and Brew lovely pots of tea if you don't want to take a lot of time I've got a simple three card New Year spread for you shelle past present future uh no not exactly okay the first card is what to leave behind in 2024 the second card is what lessons things you have learned should you bring forward into 2025 and the third card is what should you prepare for what do you need to expect or look out for or what can you anticipate coming to you in 2025 just three cards see for a whole year I need more detail than that yeah me too I like the bigger spreads but if you just want something simple do that as one of your evening three card Tarot polls you know what's also fun what's also fun is if you can get your hands on have you ever seen those little packages where you can basically buy like a three card spread yeah I've seen that online didn't we get a gift in our mailbox we did get something like that and I'm gonna bring it up I'm gonna shout this person out Patty Woods yeah from Patty woods.com Patty sent us these cute little three card readings honestly it looks like I got my invitation to Hogwarts I was really excited for a second yeah I know JK Rowling's kind of a but it I want to go to a magical school but anyway so yeah I loved the whack seal and everything it looks so great now to Patty Woods if you are listening I need you to email us at back on the broomstick gmail.com and tell me what deck these cards are from because I need it I will die with without it the Hologram ones yeah Patty I need to know email me yeah so Patty woods.com is one of the places that will do that so you can do that you can go to a company you could have somebody else do it but you you could just do it yourself or have your friend pull three cars for you just do it just pull cards just do it whenever in doubt pull cards especially at the beginning of the year if you're not going to do any tarot readings at all for yourself the rest of the year which is just silly you should do it all the time but at least just do one just do one do one at the beginning of the year and do it now do it now do it right now go get your cards unless you're driving wait if you're driving but other than that go grab your cards grab your Journal you deserve this you deserve 15 minutes of time just for you and your cards even if you have to pull them in the bathroom hey sometimes the bathroom was my best friend it was the only place I got any privacy you know it was it was the only place my kids would leave me alone mhm so going forward for 2025 shell what are your wishes what are your hopes and dreams for 25 for your witchy self that we just keep doing this and keep doing what we're doing yeah that's an easy one that is an easy one one of the coolest things I did this past year I'm looking at right now was one of our first episodes of 2024 was a try it where we did Money bowls and I am still using the exact same money bowl that I put together January of 2024 and I'm kind of excited because now it's got all these little wax clusters and interesting things that I've stuck into it throughout the year and one of my rituals for January is going to be to clean this out and refresh it decide what goes back into it what I'm going to respectfully dispose of or or repurpose to other spells and then have a brand new yet kind of still the same money bowl for 2025 so my money Bowl didn't Faire as well because I think my cats knocked it over a few times and then my grandson came and like grabbed it and threw it across the room like like my money Bowl has been struggling but I have pieced it back together each and every time yeah hey sometimes that's what we got to freaking do with our finances right energetically I guess that's kind of the same thing P that  back together put it back together some of the things that I'm planning on doing this year for new years are a little bit different and you know Michelle how sometimes when you start thinking about something magically or an idea or something comes to you you start seeing it everywhere everywhere yes that's because it wasn't really your idea okay that's right that's right the goddess has definitely got plans I know for you this year the owl was a big one you know you've mentioned on a previous yeah absolutely so you've mentioned on a previous episode how that owl just keeps following you around for me for the last couple months you know every once in a while people would talk about New Year's and they talk about resolutions right if you're gonna make Bullit you know how I feel about resolutions the yourself people lies to yourself so I was starting to throw around the idea of an era I was going to have 2025 be the era of something for Lea you are so Taylor Swift right now I think it was one of those drag queen shows that I got that from anyway so I was going to have it be an era and then I think one of my kids was watching um an old James Bond movie Golden Eye maybe oh Lord and one of the characters was talking about her personal motto and I thought oh maybe it'll be a motto and then just recently again I know we've talked about her forever but I have the biggest witch crush on Irene glass and she was talking about a word she likes to pick a word for her year you know and so I've been really playing with this idea and I'm really loving it not to make a a commitment or a resolution but to to pick an idea to pick a word or a motto or a phrase that that's my Touchstone for the year that's that's who I want to be that's what I want to be the vibe for the whole 2025 I I don't go into the new year like that I kind of I'm going into this year cautiously optimistic every year I always say you know this year I'm going to be a little more witchy a little more magical and you know that's always the goal but I'm definitely going into this year a little more cautious but I am very motivated going into this year in a magical kind of way and that cannot mean anything other than great things but that that's probably how I'm headed into this year is very magically motivated feels like there's a lot of tension this year but it also feels like this is going to be the year to double down on the witchy feral side of me you know I've pushed that down and tried to make that normal for too long and I'm done doing that you are my Nomad friend so in that light a lot of the things that I'm doing this January are you know basic witchy things to prepare for the year cleaning the house using simmer pots to use scent to clean using Moon water and simmer pot water to refresh Wards in cleansing spells in New beginning spells and I do have a candle spell that can be done in January that's supposed to kind of give you an idea of what your year will look like okay and take a taper candle and you slice 12 lines in it just cut 12 horizontal lines in the candle try to keep them as equal as possible and if there's room you can put a letter or a Sigil or a symbol to symbolize a wish or an intention 12 of them that you have for the year so you make your line and then next to it just make a DOT or a tiny little symbol or write the word however you want to do it to represent your wish so you'll have 12 wishes like health wealth Prosperity whatever keep going till you have 12 then take your candle and put it someplace safe and burn it uh let it burn all the way down and here's where the Divination comes in after you light the candle take your journal and sit with the candle watch it you know get into Alpha state if you want to maybe chant if you feel like it or just sit and watch the fire if you can't burn it all at the same time I like to use those little um Hanukkah candles or manora candles they're a little bit bigger but they'll burn for less than an hour sometimes they'll call them three-hour candles but they only burn for like an hour and then as you sit with it and meditate as the flame melts down to each line notice how it's burning see how you're feeling see if you see anything interesting in the way that the wax is melting see if you can see any symbols in the way that the flame Burns does it suddenly burn up higher does it start to gutter does it try to go out is it smoking more now notice how you feel and anything different about how the candle is burning and that can give you some insight into either that month of the year or that particular wish or goal that you put into the line and then once the candle has burned all the way down finish writing in your Journal how you feel about it and then you move on to putting the wax on your altar in your money bowl or thanking it for its service and disposing of it properly and there's your spell there you go simple candle spell I'm so basic within like the I might not do it on New Year's Day it depends on how the night went before but within the first couple of days I always do kind of a a wheel of the Year spread you can find them anywhere online that spread but kind of that 12 card wheel just to see what these months are bringing me yeah I mean I'm always I'm always is down for a good tarot reading it's a go-to for me but I love your candle spell but I'm just concerned that if I am not home long enough to burn it all in one shot does that mean because I was only home for an hour that an hour's worth of stuff is easy and the rest is hard like I don't want that either like then I'm gonna be locked in the house because I don't want to leave then I think that means that your next year will need to require a lot more pre-planning because you shouldn't do a spell where the candle's going to burn for 3 hours hours if you're only going to be home for an hour or patience or patience yeah yeah but if you're going to be home for the afternoon that's when you're going to do it if you're going to be home for the evening that's when you're going to want to do it so it doesn't have to be on New Year's Eve right around New Year's is fine but pick a time when you're going to be home long enough to let the whole thing burn there you go otherwise pick a different spell but this episode kind of is the last of our I wouldn't say forgotten episodes or you know lost half of the year but we're about ready to get back into uh work mode yeah now that the new year is here and the holidays
