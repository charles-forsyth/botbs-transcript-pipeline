any who anyway let me uh get a bowl here and maybe we'll do an intro and then we'll talk about something I don't know what but we'll talk about something I have two things I want to talk about oh you freaking rock all right one of them is a current news story and then one of them is a story of a similar nature okay awesome you are so prepared I love it all right okay okay hold on hold on hold on Zen right I need some Zen like I seriously do more than I need weed at the moment I could really use a hefty dose of Zen it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's for 420 a.m. hi and welcome to the stoned Witches Hour on this show we tell spooky truish Tales of ghoulish happenings haunted hotels and paranormal events while getting [ __ ] up while getting seriously high on some of the country's finest cannabis I'm Leila representing all things spooky on the west coast and as usual I'm hi and I'm shell and I'm on the East Coast where am I yeah East Coast by the water there yeah hey I'm by the water too that's not necessarily a good marker shell well that's true but I think your water's warmer why is the water warmer on the west coast than the East Coast I just don't get it I don't it's the best coast blah blah blah it's definitely not the spookiest Coast might be the warmest might be so on this episode 22 of the stoned Witches Hour I'm actually going to be talking about a haunted hotel and a quack cure for cancer by a gentleman named Norman Baker who was really a big-time charlatan and thought that the American Medical Association was out to get him and I guess they kind of were because he was selling [ __ ] as a cancer cure but above and beyond that he thought they wanted to assassinate him well I'm going a different route today I'm going to talk about some cryptids in Connecticut oo always love when you're looking at Cryptids I'm going you know the haunted hotel due to some shady history and you've got us some cryptids in Connecticut spooky things people animals I don't even know what they are but we're going we're going crypted in Connecticut today is this another like Soul stealing I'm going to kill you and torment your soul forever type of crypted or is this like a nice fuzzy I just stink and tap on trees crypted like a Sasquatch I'm gonna kill you what oh okay we're going the bad route again all right yeah we're going a bad route again deadly Cryptids love it but you know what led me to that is going to be a different story but I want to talk about weed first and then we're going to tell we're going to talk about what led my stoned brain to this crypted story ah weed what are you smoking today like first of all first of all let's just put this out there two episodes in a row we were not together I was away and you had a special guest and then you were away and I had a special guest so like here we are back together it's like bringing the band back together hey hi Shell how have you been I have been good I've missed you I have missed you too life has been pretty crazy lately we we've actually both had a lot going on so it just kind of worked out somehow that it was like back-to-back episodes but we're back so people we're back shell and Lea it's us love it it's the shell and Lea show I am back in my nomadic ways and doing a lot of traveling this summer but it should not interrupt our recording schedule or our hang out and tell each other's spooky Tales schedule and it certainly hasn't interrupted my getting high schedule nothing interrupts that talking there's really not a lot that interrupts that that is true that is true it's getting to be kind of beachy weather up here in Massachusetts so I actually today G GED my beach bag stuff together that when it we're supposed to have some 90 degree days in a few days so I will be heading to the beach yay well hot now in Massachusetts can you smoke on the beach people do I mean I haven't like technically looked into the laws but people do so I know that in some states if you can smoke cigarettes somewhere you can smoke cannabis in the same places I think m Massachusetts might be one of those places I'm pretty sure New York is one of those places California you're not allowed to smoke pretty much anything anywhere so there's no smoking of any substance on the beaches in California you know it's kind of funny because you would think that I would old enough to know better but don't um I don't really pay attention to the laws and just kind of live my life and I'm not saying that anybody should do that well yeah I mean if you go to the beach and you're staying away from some kids or whatever if you're you know if you're off by yourself on the beach there's nothing like having a bowl or a joint what's your favorite Beach or hike goto is it the silicone pipe that you just recently got or I love that silicone pipe and I'm Still rocking that damn thing it's so cute but typically what's your beachy goto for for cannabis probably with a beachy goto thing would be a Chillum just because it's small it's discreet you're not just sitting there like Blaze and glory on the beach um I agree I I usually like a joint but again that's kind of like the constantly you know it's got the smoke going constantly so that smell is around you a lot if you're trying to be discreet you know keep it on the down low a little bit a Chillum is perfect it's that perfect size hold it in your hand nobody's going to see it you know it's just puffing pass it's nice actually what you see a lot of around here um especially on the streets and on the beach and pretty much anywhere in public I've seen it in damn Target for God's sakes people vaping weed in their Vape pens just any all wear any all wear Vape is definitely my go-to for being discreet I mean it doesn't smell like anything so yeah definitely Vapes are nice for that for me personally though the Vapes after a while tend to make my lungs fill with fluid and then I get this whole like lung chest issue thing I'm not a fan of Vapes just give me the damn weed we've talked about this just give me the damn weed stuff it in a pipe as hard as you can with your thumb and just go you know you're not the first person I've heard say that I do have uh one of my brothers says the same thing about Vapes he he's not a fan yeah he doesn't like how it makes him feel so he kind of stays away from them a little bit I get a very deep lingering wet cough just not a fan of Apes just not I am sure there are people out there that Vape their lives away God bless you just not my thing not my thing I do really love dabs I like dabs in all forms more so than Vapes we'll have to get together and test that the we most definitely will I know that some of my travels this summer will take me out your way there's some festivals out that way and so we will be together and recording together at least once if not multiple times this summer for because the east coast is the best coast and all you want to do with all your vacation time is come back to the east coast obviously hey there's something to be said for going back to familiar stomping grounds for going back to the places that you know and love and where all your friends and family are so you know yeah I have to say I'm going to be doing a little bit of visiting I'm looking forward to it so today I this is something I've never smoked before what you smoking shelle I am smoking this stuff called end game Oh I like that name how fun what is what's endgame do you know any of its parentage I don't know [ __ ] I I don't know [ __ ] I just know it's got me really high right now um so I went to Happy Valley love Happy Valley one of your favorite places shout out to Happy Valley yep in GL they still have the key the key to happiness they do they do they do and it is the key to happiness no lie so I go in there and I'm talking to the girl because you know as we've said in the past these people are very chatty very knowledgeable and very willing to talk your off about weed and so you know me what do you got that's good and she's like well you know she goes The Growers out back seem to keep smoking this new crop but they're not talking much but that's all they're buying she goes so I started smoking it and it's really good and I'm like really well give me a bunch of that then whatever that is I want some no joke good stuff I didn't ask any questions I just got it but it's like 30.4 THC but I feel like it's got to be a hybrid if I'm guessing because you can manipulate the high if you want it to be an up energetic High it can be and if you want it to be a lazy High it can be see what I'm saying you you can either you can kind of use it either way you can use it to Mellow yourself out or to get [ __ ] done very versatile High definitely something I go for for sure but rule number one if the Growers are smoking It Go yes always go for the grower stash I highly recommend it and you know it it's a little dense and a little sticky it's kind of one of those borderline better off if you grind it up and not just chunk a big damn bud in your pipe which you know I love to do I know you do this is definitely stuff that you really should take a minute and grind up which I actually did there is something to be said for how you pack a bowl or you know the different types of weed have different smoke ability I guess some are definitely stuff them shove them right into that bowl and smoke them as is and some this is it some aren't I I'm still smoking the bako gelato I'm kind of in a rut and I can't help it I love this weed so much it is my current favorite I love the flavor I love the high it gets me stoned as [ __ ] it's pretty and you know I love a pretty weed it's so crystally it's purpley oh my goodness I can't stop smoking it and yeah so I'm stuck on the Bako gelato for for a little while anytime I try to think of that for some reason I think of calling it baklava gelato hey that's how I'm packing it hey Lisa an Lisa an she did such a good job filling in for me by the way shout out to her did shout out to her and shout out to your son doing an excellent job oh my gosh you guys are so cute together I love it we definitely have really great friends we have fans oh my gosh while I was on high while we were on Hiatus we got an email let me see if I can pull up for you shelle we have a fan again we do a whole one fan oh my God okay there's more than that but this particular one fan wrote us and they have a tip for us I can't remember if it's on your side of the country or mine so we'll both be surprised I'll be surprised all over again all right here we go let's see they say this is is from K hey K first I love your podcast and have been binging for a few days I was originally going to catch up but I'm to episode 14 and I just had to send you two some love you two are super entertaining and I love your Stoner Antics I'm a 31-year-old married 420 anniversary hey happy belated anniversary mom and you guys just speak to me I'm from Michigan and I know you two are west coast East Coast but shell I know you represent Midwest you have got to research State Hospital in Travers City Michigan hold on I'm writing this down I'm writing this down because we are gonna give Kay her story here in the next couple of weeks so let me write this down okay all right Kay I am

about this place listen to this Kay says it closed down in 83 I think but had a new Hospital built next door the old hospital remained empty of business but full of spirits and US young kids being absolutely insane we used to walk through them I only went once heard a door open on its own and left it was enough but there's a list of documentation on how active it was but it has been redone done in the last 10 or so years to be a goddamn apartment complex and stores they did that here too I can't remember who but someone on my Facebook years ago made a post about how haunted the apartments are and how her family moved out y'all they rid an asylum and it and its rooms into apartment it's a fun dive if you find if you find yourself time also look up the Happy Tree which is on the property it used to be a party spot for teenagers oh yes me included but we always hear voices and party with strangers that would show up there was always a rumor of ghosts coming to party sometimes I don't know if it was just my group of friends but we always light up a joint in hopes he would show thanks for reading I hope you two have an amazing day at some point I'm going to write about the time I made a Ouija board with someone and we got a free ghost roommate thank you and much love from K why K [ __ ] around and find out Kay I bet they didn't pay rent either K you've listened to up to 14 episodes come on I we've talked about [ __ ] around and find out do not touch Ouija board you know Shell's first rule first rule of shell do not bring a Ouija board to a haunted location just don't don't but if you do and you get a free roommate do write us about it you're gonna [ __ ] around and find out yeah so K uh give me a couple weeks and I am going to look into the state hospital in Travers City Michigan and we are going to give it a go I'm kind of jealous you've had two people suggest things for you and I have had not a one yet so if you're out there West coasters come on tell me something you want me to you know why look into why the West Coast sucks that's why it's it's not as haunted and it's not as cool and all the coolest hauntings come from the East Coast that that's why people have east coast places oh that is so not true there's so much history and so much cool stuff out here you're just biased sh I I'll get some people it's all right that's fine it's okay I'll just be lonely here on the West Coast with no stories now I want to I want to talk about what led me to want to do the story this week about the Crypton oh yeah what uh what Drew you to this story sh it's kind of technically from your side of the country hey are you poaching something from me I'm not poaching a story I'm poaching a current news story that led me to the story about Connecticut okay so something on the Best Coast LED you to a cool story on the boring East Coast all right all right I'm following I'm following fine I fine this one time okay so I don't know if you keep up with the news I don't know if our our our listeners keep up with the news but I don't watch the news because it's very depressing and it's really not good for your mental health but I do read dailymail.com and this is like a combination of like celebrity news regular news and kind of offbeat news I come across this story the story was dated June 9th 2022 so like we're talking this month this month not like a hundred years ago like this month let me read to you the title of the news article is it chuper Cabra a skinwalker Texas City officials are stumped as they try to identify strange humanlike animal seen on surveillance footage outside its Zoo okay no no all right so it's a good thing you warned me that this West Coast story was what inspired you because chupacabra and Texas are mine that's my territory you're right you're right but something is going going on in Texas right now and it's in the news right now so this is it this was from Amarillo so there's a zoo Amarillo it's probably cool by the way the zoan Amarillo caught this thing on its like night video surveillance so the article this is so funny because this is actually like a credible news site and they think they may have seen a chupacabra in Amarillo Texas the the first line of the art article says lock your doors at night a chuper cobra may be on the loose no [ __ ] so wow so actually Amarillo uh Texas City officials have been stumped by this human humanlike animal seen on zoo surveillance footage and they actually took to social media in their search for answers yeah like right now it's kind of considered an un unidentified Amarillo object is what they're kind of calling it like they're bringing some kind of humor a little bit to it but I've seen the video and you're like what the hell is that Amarillo residents kind of are are weighing in a little bit that they think it could be a skin walker which is a Native American mythological shape-shifting creature I'll find the I'll find the video and put a link to it in the show notes absolutely now in the video like because obviously they've they've been able to capture like still footage it as well it almost kind of looks like I don't want to say this because it'll sound dumb but it kind of looks like it could be like a werewolf like I'm not kidding some people think it it looks like a werewolf no I do personally oh you do me personally well you know I guess that's what a skin walker and a chupacabra look like anyway so kind of shouldn't be surprised some people have even put on Twitter that it's clearly a skinwalker phasing between two densities SL Dimensions clearly it's clearly that like they have seen it obviously I don't even it's crazy but the Amarillo parks and recre recreation uh Department director told Newsweek that the zoo found the startling image while casually reviewing recent footage with staffers and reported the creature never got inside the zoo it was on their surveillance but it wasn't technically within like the confines of the zoo it said the creature was walking near the park which is located inside Thompson Park early in the morning at around 1:25 a.m. the guy like the actual Zoo director told Newsweek that he thought it was kind of an anomaly and a unique picture and he thinks it's exciting and interesting to have something like that at a zoo great reaction buddy wow yeah definitely I mean that certainly sounds like uh something out of I I I just saw some pictures online after trying to look up what you had mentioned and that's weird just kind of unexplainable I don't know what that is I mean some people um actually uh some websites have described it as a wolflike uh human creature again chuper Cabra news 18 in Texas called it a mysterious alien creature caught on camera I don't know call it what you want but with my personal eyeballs I think it kind of looked like a werewolf wow not that I've seen one in person it kind of looked like it had that doggy kind of head and then weird legs I don't know like human legs you know how you know how the goat legs like that but standing up like a person but with a dog head I don't know look at the video people part goat part dog part man well sounds like a chupaca so there we are this is this is current news and events there's some [ __ ] going on in Texas people I mean the Cryptids they're out they're about spring has sprung chuper Cabos have sprung they're here and they're in Texas right now wolflike doglike chupacabra likee creature in Texas that is just really strange and and I know we have listeners in Texas because I remember we we've talked about that before so if any of you people in Texas know what the hell is going on outside the Amaro Zoo let us know because I really need to know is it something the zoo released to try and get publicity or something did they make some sort of hybrid creature and put it out there just to go viral who knows but like the weird thing is is that it was like right outside the zoo like was it looking to like eat something or was it trying to bust out a relative yeah right maybe they've got something in the zoos at want out how creepy interesting because that crypted was in the news lately I was like oo let me check out another crypted in the Northeast so what did that lead you to I'm curious now now this I came across this a while ago and I was like what the hell in Connecticut there are what are called don't laugh by the way oh great now I'm already primed now I have no okay fine what is it they're called Melon Heads yeah they're called Melon Heads like lemon heads like the band it's a shame about Ray I mean come on yeah yeah so Melon Heads Melon Heads it's funny and they're not just necessarily confined to Connecticut okay so I'm guessing that it's descriptive melon head must be they have big heads some people think that they kind of resemble the little gry men oh aliens so it might be a crypted Al o a crypted alien okay because they basically have like those bulbous heads you know what I'm saying okay are they gray too no they're not no they just have big heads and they other than that do they look humanoid pretty much and they like I said they're not just found in Connecticut apparently they're also in Michigan and Ohio which is weird because it's not even like they're in a relatively close proximity so Michigan Ohio Connecticut but obviously I'm GNA talk about Connecticut today okay now as you can imagine every New England town can pretty much claim a ghost or many have a witch in their past you know the ghosts and the witches so it's Dam Ouija boards it's K's fault all in the Northeast yeah they they tend to do that a lot there but the Melon Heads um are only in a handful of places in Southwestern Connecticut and they kind of as you can imagine live on the outskirts of town on heavily wooded Country Roads generally known as melon head roads such a common thing to see them on these roads they actually call the roads melon head roads I guess I mean they look like small humanoids with oversized heads and they rarely come out of hiding you know like most cryptoid it's like they're like Bigfoot you know they love their hiding but most of these Cryptids really are sneaky they're super super sneaky and heidy they survive by eating small animals stray cats and then check this [ __ ] out human flesh now ew so they eat kitty cats and humans sound like bad guys and there has been cases of runaway teens and hikers that have disappeared and literally the town's people explain it away as The Melon Heads got them oh my goodness ew eight them how do you like go knock on a parents door and be like The Melon Heads got I'm sorry don't know what to tell you maybe somebody is telling people your hitchhiking missing son got eaten by a melon head and we thought we were smoking the good weed they're smoking something they finding nod bones are they just finding nothing and being like oh nothing must be melon Head Case Closed apparently or are they finding they're not soup bones they're not they're not finding a thing not really all right okay well so the stories about these deformed country people who keep to themselves go back you know centuries to Europe you're not too far off for example um a large family of Melon Heads supposedly lived in Bavaria Germany um in like the mid 19th century and of course do not laugh at this because I I I'm totally being that and it's like priming me to laugh fine I will try again take two an inbred family of Melon Heads known as Weeble heads Weebles wobble but they don't fall down we're said to live outside of are these named by gen xers who are just like missing their childhood or something no because the Weeble heads lived outside wberry England around 1900 and US gen xers weren't around then oh that's true Weeble head heads yeah there that's the inbred family of the inbred version of melon oh boy now according to another theory the term melon head may stem from a melian which describes mixed race people in Appalachia that have ancestry of European outcasts freed slaves and Native Americans and these folks also kept to themselves so maybe it was more of a you know hey where jerks and there's these people over here that we don't like so we're going to give them a weird name and so it could be like just a racist thing not necessarily a supernatural thing or at least the origins of it the origins of the people yeah and then you know you're inbred enough and you get big heads I don't know so the melon head stories started to surface in Connecticut after World War II kind of when people moved more away from the cities and into the suburbs it it was kind of a they were were trying to get away from that prejudice of the isolated Ro folk so so people started moving out into rural areas and started coming across these people one Theory claims they came from a family accused of Witchcraft and banished Into the Wilderness where they survived and in were inbred now why do you got to accuse every goddamn person of Witchcraft every time every time they see something different it's witchcraft oh you're a witch it's witchcraft your hair is the wrong color your eyes the wrong color your Skin's the wrong color it's witchcraft you like cats you're a witch but they're saying through centuries of inbreeding that they kind of mutated into Melon Heads which honestly is a totally reasonable conclusion listen to some of the other theories another another theory states that the Melon Heads escaped from the Fairfield Hills Hospital which is now an abandon mental institution or that they were escapes from the Garner Correctional Institute which specialized in inmates with mental health problems now what happened at the correctional institute was that the place like went a blaze and burnt to the ground and everybody died like all of the worker like all the corrections officers died and most of the inmates died but there was like a handful of like maybe a dozen inmates that they never found their bodies and could never find them oh no they think that they could have disappeared into the woods and started this wood Society wood people Society maybe they escaped and were unaccounted for and no one ever looked for them and they just kind of went off and started their own little families and their own little town correct and and this is outside of uh Newton Connecticut but yeah so again you know in this was in the 1960s when the building burned 1960s when that building burned and they said that when those those supposed inmates potentially escaped that they probably turned to cannibalism which could be another cause um of their heads to swell oh start of maybe that was the start of the rumors is they they didn't have enough food and they were already had mental health issues or criminally insane correct and so they started eating each other correct so not only were they cannibals potentially but also inbred wow this place just is getting creepy and creepier and it sounds like it might be a real thing this is starting to sound like it it might have its roots in in something for real real and there's also another theory that there was um because remember I said that one of the theories was that they were they were people that escaped from Fairfield Hills Hospital one of the theories is that an evil Dr Crow supposedly conducted experiments on orphans oh no and that the children escaped burned down the orphanage and retreated into the woods and created like a again like a woodsy society so kind of like a Lord of the Flies kind of situation why is there always an evil doctor why does there have to be an evil doctor at least in that situation the kids you know rescued themselves and ran off but then went all Lord of the Flies and cannibalism yeah guess now supposedly um back in the 80s a group of girls after a Friday night football game decided to jump in the car and look for Melon Heads uh oh I'm guessing this didn't end well this sounds like something I would do it does sound like something we would do it does it does it does I'd be like hey Lea let's go look for Melon Heads you I like sure yeah let me grab my stash I'm there because I'm an idiot how bad could it be how bad can it be what kind of trouble could we get into we'll be fine okay what happened to these girls the girls park the car they they get to the area where the Melon Heads are supposedly at park the car leave their headlights on and go into the woods so they walk a couple hundred feet and they hear their car door slam what what the hell oh no then the engine started and the car headed towards them and they could oh no they could see figures inside the size of children but with large heads Rags for clothes in an orange GL in their eyes well first of all why would you leave your keys in your car cuz your freaking teenage girls driving to look for Melon Heads I don't know and well maybe the Melon Heads hotwired the car maybe they know how to hotwire stuff could be so apparently they slaughter the girls no no no no they didn't just take the car for a joy ride no they actually they actually found shredded pieces of clothing and B no shell oh no no no no ew and they people believe that to this day that those Melon Heads still drive around in the girls car in their car oh oh that's sad oh that sucks oh they're crappy Melon Heads e people have heard voices in the woods they've they've seen fig like people have made Like Straw figures and made it look like like masks and it looks like there's like these straw figures lurking in the underbrush it almost seems not necessarily like a cryptoid but like a like you said like Lord of the Flies Community because and but again they're in like three different states it's not just confined to Connecticut right it does it almost sounds you know less crypted and more crypted is a a paranormal thing that's a right you know a creature that we don't understand this almost sounds like like maybe deformed or mutated humans yeah like maybe a a pocket of people who have just inbred so much over the generations possibly already started out with mental illness and and with problems this just sounds terrible if it's true they eat people it's awful they eat they eat people that's all I got to say is they eat people now a number of Connecticut based Legends Around The Melon Heads have one characteristic in common a secluded rustic or single Lane usually dirt road running through wooded territory Fairfield County uh is is kind of where a bunch of these are um and New Haven County so a lot of the sightings kind of are between Fairfield County and New Haven County so kind of a limited area I mean that almost lends Credence a little bit to it being possibly a a pocket of people a group of people well that's one part that's one part of Connecticut though that's Rural and for Ed and you know have a lot of rural roads running through a lot of dirt roads right or or it could be you know some form of crypted that is just in that small area and you know maybe that's what happened to the people that escaped or the kids that escaped from the the hospitals maybe those cryptids in that area kind of pulled them in and ate them or or you know pulled them into their brought them into their Community or something maybe I don't know a lot of the towns that claim to have these Melon Heads near their Town such as Oxford Milford Fair Fairfield New Haven southberry Stratford the roads that these creatures or what have you tend to be near they call them Dracula Drive Dracula drive because basically they're gonna come and suck your blood and eat you in off the ew e e because they're cannibals yeah it it basically some Legends claim that the Melon Heads would either bite or consume whoever enters their territory so it's kind of like a territory thing almost like if you step on my property I'm gonna eat you a lot of these Cryptids do seem to be territorial you know they they they do seem to only attack you if you kind of enter into their domain yeah so of course what's shell gonna want to do let's go to Connecticut and look for Melon Heads man sh wants to trespass on a crypted I know it I do I do but the thing is is that this I'm not so sure you know when you kind of delve into it a little more when you're looking for when you're when you're online and you're looking up like different Cryptids and stuff around this does pop up I'm not so sure it's a crypted I'm skeptical I do think that it could be potentially a um pockets of mutated humans and for whatever reason they're mutated is neither here nor there but if there's a pocket in Michigan and a pocket in Ohio and a pocket in Connecticut I think this may tend to be more mutated humans and not necessarily A paranormal creature like I don't think this is a Bigfoot or whatever the hell is going on in Amarillo Texas right now or chuper Cabra or any of those this is I think this is something a little different that is basically being accused of being a crypted I see yeah I don't know do you think the three pockets are related to each other I mean Michigan and Ohio are relatively close together Connecticut is just kind of Connecticut isn't as close I could see a geographic connection if they were closer together right but I just don't I I I don't know I don't know that sounds pretty creepy like what if you're camping in the woods and you just happen to like come across their territory and you didn't know that this was melon head territory and now you're there then you're dead and then you're dead and then you're dead and you had no idea do the police really just sit there and say oh yeah the melon Huns probably got them is that a thing like are they actually allowed to do that I don't think so I hope not I really don't I don't I mean especially I mean if there's nod bones and barbecue sauce and like a pot right there you know and you know the person's clothes are part of some sort of Stew I guess then you could say yeah sure Melon Heads got them because here's evidence that they were eaten but without that I don't think you can I don't think you can say Melon Heads there's not none of Heavens lawyer Lila says no yeah and even though they found the shredded clothes and the bones when you're talking about a wooded area like that that could be coyotes that could be you know that could be a lot of things that's true you did say that they found the girls clothes and bones but not their car because apparently the Melon Heads are driving a 1980s freaking Ford Granada but when you're talking cannibals and then you find nod bones and shredded clothing that does kind of give a little bit of evidence that maybe some sort of maybe I don't know maybe not a melon head or maybe not a crypted but something ate those poor kids if you've encountered a melon head please email us we want to know we'd love a picture right so so just another interesting tale don't go alone on dirt roads the forest apparently don't stop your car don't get out of your car you could be melon head food if someone tells you you're on a Dracula Road or a melon Head Road don't stop correct correct not a good place to go camping I'm not saying it's safe but I'm also not saying it's paranormal okay so we'll put this one in the bin of definitely not safe and certainly spooky we just don't know why and partially true crime I think little True Crime little crypted hey stories got it all certainly spooky I mean those poor kids it's it's definitely intriguing yeah with all the history around it and since it's like in three little pockets who knew I know right now I've got a story for you about what this is about a hotel but it was also at one time a hospital o you don't like those I don't this one was a cancer hospital actually where they said that they would cure you in six weeks without surgery oh God when was this in the 1930s I Goa yes so this is called the Crescent Hotel so this is the most haunted hotel in America really because I feel like a lot of places say that I feel like we might have said that before right this is yet another America's Most Haunted Hotel and it is also it has a gateway to Hell can I tell you a funny story please here in Massachusetts everybody likes roast beef I don't know I'm from New York I don't know roast beef ain't a thing really in New York but here roast beef stands everywhere and do you know they all say world famous I'm like how the how the hell can you all be world famous are you all world famous basically this is kind of like Roast Beef in Massachusetts there you go every single Hotel haed Massachusetts roast beef the most haunted correct correct that's right so most roast beef of hotels so the Crescent Hotel is the most haunted it's in Eureka Springs Arkansas I've never even heard of it what what it's the most haunted shell it is the most haunted hotel in America Stephen King didn't even do a movie on it you're not [ __ ] if Stephen King didn't do a movie on you right however this hotel was built in 1886 and it was built originally as a hotel and it failed I shouldn't laugh I don't know if you've ever heard of Eureka Springs in Arkansas but the the water here this the spring water here is supposed to be very healing uh from the time of the Native Americans up through now the place is purported to be magical it's supposed to be a very healing place and the waters themselves are supposed to have healing properties oh I want to go sounds nice right I love it it does a hippie town and everything I feel like I'm gonna die if I go there though well you would have if You' had cancer and you went to the hotel back in the 1930s but before that before that it was a it was a hotel and then it failed it's beautiful it's like big Gothic hotel but I guess maybe they built it too big or something and they couldn't take care of it and after just a few short years um they didn't have enough money to keep it going after a few short years they just didn't have enough money to keep it going and it fell into disrepair then it was bought up by a girl school oh and as it was being built there was tragedy as this huge hotel is being built an Irish Workman named Michael a brick layer fell to his death oh and landed on the second floor where room 218 is now and he is one of the ghosts that haunts this most haunted hotel in America oo people often say that they see a a young man in overalls with red hair walking around looks like a Workman and that's Michael so after it was built like I said it became a hotel and it didn't last for very long and then it became a girl school and there are some rumors about this girl school that it wasn't a very nice place there is a ghost I couldn't prove that this actually happened but the rumor is that a young woman committed suicide by jumping off one of the towers and she was possibly according to one story she was pregnant or she had been found to be have a boyfriend and be sexually active and the shame of all of it was too much and she left to her death and people will report seeing her usually on foggy nights usually right around 10:30 p.m. and they'll often report hearing her scream as she falls oh so the the hotel just did not have a good history after it was a girl school um I guess it was a woman's college for a short period of time and and then it completely fell into disrepair around the same time a man named Norman Baker was making a fortune for himself as a he started out as a a machinist but he was so good-looking and so well spoken that he quickly became a he did hypnosis and did shows like a like a psychic Entertainer he was very flamboyant dude he came from a wealthy family his father was a machinist that was kind of boring for him and he he became a hypnotist which was kind of the thing back then it was and he was very very well spoken he had like a godville show he saw traveling mentalists when he was a teenager and that completely changed his life and that's when he joined a troop of other performers and became an Illusionist and a hypnotist so after being a hypnotist for a while he joined a Vaudeville show and married another performer he then made a fortune I guess being an inventor he he invented some sort of um musical thing like some type of kopy thing Kapone I guess it was called oh and made over like two $100,000 back in the early 1900s which is is that a lot yeah it's over $3 million today oh I'll take it yeah exactly he had a lot of money so in the 20s when radio started to become a big thing he decided he wanted to do that too and so he made a deal with the town and he got this station ktnt know the naked truth and he made himself famous because he said he was going to appeal to the common to the every person to the farmer even though he himself was super rich and super flamboyant I mean he loved the color lavender and he would often wear purple suits or lavender suits or lavender shirts his car he had like a hand hammered Bentley or something and it was purple oh and he would you know drive around in this and just be completely flashy that sounds kind of cool though he just liked to wear light colored clothes purple light colored purple purple clothes Norman Baker Mr I love lavender decides that he is going to have this radio station and appeal to he's going to just tell the truth but really his version of the truth is people he hates you know what he doesn't like ah you know what he wants to [ __ ] about for that day you he was one of the original radio shock jocks I guess kind of like our podcast a little bit I guess he was supposed to only broadcast at like a certain wattage but he would usually double that and they would wait and if the FCC people were coming around he'd dial it back so because of doubling his power he had like a huge enormous reach and people loved this show by some accounts tens of thousands of people would listen to his show on the regular oh wow and he loved conspiracy theories he would just go on and on having been in Vaudeville having an Illusionist a mentalist he could talk to people he knew how to talk he knew how to work a crowd so he made a a lot of money spouting his version of conspiracy theories and [ __ ] about people that he didn't like he even thought that the government was out to get him he was one of the original antivaxers and he even there was a thing called The Cow War I guess tuberculosis in cows was a big thing at one point oh through his radio show he got people so worked up he said that the government was trying to steal their cows and so they weren't really testing for TB in the cows they were just faking it and they were going to tell them that they had TB so that they can steal these perfectly healthy cows from people what he had so many people believing this that they would literally run the veterinarians out of town and wouldn't let them test their cows so this caused like the cow Wars and the tuberculosis and the cows was running rampant because everyone listened to this guy that's just weird he was very very persuasive by all accounts he was kind of racist he was anti-semitic he was very fiery and a little bit of an alcoholic but he was very very much against any medical advice and the government um however he did get to be friends with Herbert Hoover and apparently was so much of an influence that he helped Herbert Hoover win the Midwest that's weird President Hoover even like did a publicity stunt for this guy's uh tabloid paper the Midwest Free Press oh wow a sitting president so he had a lot of influence with this radio show very rich guy but of course he railed against rich people and big government and everything even as he's driving around in his lavender car with his Diamond jewelry and his lavender suits like what year is this roughly this is in the 20s wow 1920s so this cow War right it was only it was only finally stopped when the governor sent in the state militia to allow these cows to be tested for TV oh my God one of his big rants was that the government had the cure for cancer and they weren't letting it out because they made too much money with the so-called cures of the day the radiation treatments and surgeries I could see it now he had dropped out of school in 10th Grade he met a doctor actually in 1929 he met a fake doctor Dr OAS in Kansas City Missouri uhuh now this fake doctor was was one of those snake oil salesmen and he had his own special blend of snake oil that he said would heal people of pretty much anything much like you know quacks did at the time right now he decides along with this doctor that hey I'm a self-taught Healer and I can cure cancer and this Elixir that you have with my special ingredient carbolic acid oh no oh yes will cure people of cancer now carbolic acid is and I quote from cancer.gov says carbolic acid is a very poisonous chemical substance made from tar and also found in some plants and essential oils it is used to make Plastics nylon epoxy medicines and to kill germs also called phenol so the first part there says a very poison chemical substance why would you do that and that was Norman Baker's secret ingredient to Dr oas's snake oil and this snake oil called formula 5 or something I guess had uh corn silk Clover ground watermelon seeds water and then glycerin and now car carbolic acid oh wow they decided they were going to cure five people with this mixture who promptly died but they then told everyone that they lived and that their cancer was cured he would do shows where have you ever seen like fake Faith healers you know they do that all that thing where they pull stuff out of the body without leaving any incisions in the body now some of that might be real I don't know but I know a lot of them especially at this time was absolutely fake and he was a very good Illusionist and he could make it look like he was pulling all sorts of sick nasty things out of people's bodies and quote unquote curing them so he kind of gained a following and he used his radio show to push this but the American Medical Association was on him and he would do things like have shows where he and this Dr o OAS would cut people's skulls open oh on stage in front of people the hell is the matter with them I I don't know he decided he was curing cancer I guess even though everyone died stupid or serial killer I don't know yikes so he opened a clinic and began curing people with any ailment pretty much and people were believing him people believed him he would only charge $10 I say only that was a lot of money at the time yeah thousands of people heard his show and got his newsletter and they would come from all over the place to be cured because again he was such a good talker he could tell people anything and they would buy it they wanted to believe what he said and he he would use his radio show to say that like when the medical association would try to shut him down for quackery he would use his radio show to say that they were persecuting him and they were sending assassins after him and that it was all lies and viciousness and they just hated him you know that they were his enemies he even said this one article on medium.com says that baker said on his radio show that the American Medical Association had sent assassins to kill him and the only reason didn't succeed is one of the Assassins recognized him from when Norman Baker had supposedly cured this Assassin's friend and so the Assassin couldn't go through with it and called off the assassination that's crazy absolutely he spouted lies and people ate them up they loved it but you know back back then though people were really wanting mediums to be true and psychics to be true and Tarot I don't want to say ter AR and hypnosis and psychics and mediums were kind of becoming mainstream but kind of yeah it was pretty popular then right you know a lot of the Parlor readings and all of that were happening back then and and people just wanted some sort of Hope and Outlook and connection with lost loved ones and whatever and there were a lot of charlatans that took advantage of that at that time but they put their whole heart into these people and so and with this guy having a radio show they could sit in their living room and listen that gives a lot of authority you have a radio show with that big of a following especially with someone who's such a good talker and that lends that lends a type of authority and he definitely relied on that he did get run out of town from this you know his fake clinic and he ran away to Mexico and he blasted his radio station even more powerfully from a Border Town in Mexico nice he tried a couple times to run for office and that didn't work and so he decided at that time he figured you know what I'll just go to a different state and start over no one will know so he decided he wanted to do another clinic and he he looked around for a state where he wouldn't be so well known and that maybe already had a reputation for being healthy Eureka Springs Arkansas that had this whole you know healthy water thing going for it so he goes and he buys the rundown Crescent Hotel and fixes it up and calls it a Cancer Clinic oh Jesus and he still has his formula 5 which is you know the crushed watermelon seeds the the carbolic acid you know basically nothing his magic Elixir and that's really all he gives them he has like two formulas of snake oil and he just injects everyone who comes to his Cancer Clinic with it and of course he is blasting it on the radio waves thousands of people from 1937 on come to Eureka Springs to the Crescent Hotel and are injected with his snake oil several times a day and killed essentially I would imagine pretty much now people were promised that they would be cured of their cancer in three to six weeks with no surgery we cut out no organs they have posters and even video of some of his advertisements still exist they're just gonna he's just gonna poison you no surgery you'll just get poisoned pretty much he doesn't tell them that he says that if you if you don't get cured you can come back and have free of charge treatment you just have to pay for your room and board you just have to live long enough this is during the Depression and you know people are poor people are sick and he's all flashy he paints a lot of the rooms in this hotel guess what color purple purple because it's his favorite and he decides if that's a healthy color he takes these people in and again he's promising to cure them of their cancer and of course it's not working so as people are getting sicker he has this whole One Wing of the hotel built with like a reinforced door and he would just put them all there and kind of leave them oh [ __ ] to drown out the screams of the dying he would play music really loudly in the rest of the hotel oh [ __ ] and they would tell the other people that that they had been cured nobody ever left died he would tell the people that were there that they had all been cured and so the orderlies would take these people out in the middle of the night like 3 4 a.m. they'd be Wheeling the the dead bodies out all covered then sometimes they would go down to the morg where reportedly he would do experiments on them or cut them up and then keep their body parts in a freezer Frankenstein yeah this guy made over $10 million oh my God promising that he was going to cure them with their cancer in six weeks when really all they got was injected with poison day or night and then left in a in a ward to die so for two years this went on until it was finally shut down and he didn't even get shut down because of operating without a medical license or anything like that it was because mail fraud he got caught for wire fraud because he had mailed these advertisements to people saying that he would cure them of their cancer and because that was a lie that's what they got him on are you serious they didn't get him on any murder charges or nothing it was freaking male fraud no I mean dozens of people died there and I mean I mean come on that sounds like serial killer stuff to me he injected these people or had them injected with poison you know he killed these people so I don't know I have a hard time thinking that just ignorance did that you know this is someone who had a 10th grade education who felt that the government was hiding a cure for cancer who made one up with some other Quack and then tortured people with it for two years and was brought down on male fraud I don't know I think I think the takeaway here is never mess with the US Postal Service because they will take you down like for real the mailman he's on he he's like above all King King so yeah don't mess with the USPS exactly so for this male fraud Norman Baker served four years in lenworth prison when he got out he retired to Florida and he lived there until he died of therosis of the liver and cancer in 1958 Karma right the hotel then went back and into disrepair it was a hotel again for a little while I guess in the 90s it was bought by a couple and they kind of embraced the whole haunted side of it because it had had quite the reputation for people seeing uh all sorts of different ghosts Michael the stonemason that fell to his death into room 218 is often seen and people would also see someone known as Theodora room she lived in room 419 and I've heard three different stories for Theodora so this couple that that purchased the hotel in the 90s they had a couple psychic mediums come in you know just kind of take a look and and see what was going on and they found a ton of activity there are children there there are men there there are women there they're Victorian people from the time it was originally built and unfortunately a lot of the cancer patients never left and even some of the orderlies and the the nurses people who found out afterwards that what they were doing wasn't helping anyone it was killing people a a lot of their Spirits are still there as well so it's a pretty active location a very active location and one of the psychic mediums a gentleman named Carol Heath he felt he had discovered a portal a portal to the other side or a portal to Hell in a location kind of in an entryway Annex of the crescent hotel that just happens to be a few floors above where the morg and the cold storage was when Norman Baker was using it as a Cancer Treatment Center so in the 90s they bought it and then they started having ghost tours in the early 2000s one of their tour guides reported to them that he was having a lot of trouble with with guests on the tour getting very pale and faint and some of them even fainting all in the exact same spot oh when the owner asked him where it was happening the tour guy took him to this spot and it happened to be the exact same spot where Carol Heath had said was a portal to the other side and that people on the same frequency could feel it and it was only happening in that location in the hotel and on the tour No Other location interesting now there have been a lot of other paranormal experiences there are a ton of orb sightings people will show there's a lot of photographs on their website where you can see different streaks or what looks like uh Shadows or ghosts of people and and room 419 I mentioned Theodora she is a woman there's again three different accounts of this woman Theodora but everyone says that they see an old woman often fumbling with her keys around room 419 she also doesn't like it when people argue she gets very upset and will slam doors and lights will flicker on and off and she doesn't like messes she will pick up and straighten rooms and a few people that stayed there during Co reported that um there was no housekeeping allowed for Co restrictions housekeeping would only happen after you left the room but they would come back to the rooms to find them straightened up even though they knew that no housekeeping had been there and Theodora so the three different stories are the one I heard most often was that she was a friend of Norman Bakers possibly a nurse or someone who did nursing type activities and thought that she was helping people and that as time went on she realized that what they were doing was actually killing people and she got more and more stressed and more and more upset and as PTSD set in she supposedly got more concerned with cleanliness and was constantly straightening things up and was very very concerned with keeping things clean as she got more stressed about what was going on in the hotel all three accounts say that she passed away in the hotel the second account is that she was a housekeeper from prior to when it was a cancer treatment place and that she died in the hotel and she likes to keep things tidy because she was a housekeeper there the third story is that she introduces herself to people as a cancer patient of Dr Baker's and then after people say nice to meet you she vanishes oh so I don't know which of those stories is true but they all revolve a woman named Theodora who and usually people see her as an older woman fumbling with keys around room 419 and she likes to keep it straight there's a lot of artifacts still in the hotel like the autopsy table the walk-in cooler uh where Norman Baker would keep body parts and would do some of his what they think might have been experiments and some of the ghost activity centers around the morg people will report seeing children ghostly children in the morg asking for help they'll also very often see what looks like a an orderly or someone pushing white covered tables or white you know what could possibly be bodies on tray or what do they call those like trolleys like I know what you're talking gurns gurn GES they see what look like orderly pushing gurns down the hallways late at night there's a ton of ghost hunting activities that goes on there because it you can take your get your EMF readings they have you know EVPs that happen all over I guess it's been on 15 different television programs oh wow and uh travel channels Ghost Adventures oh and um what is it sci-fi does Ghost Hunters so those are two of the big ones but it's been on a lot of those and they have seen a ton of activity here but you with with someone like Norman Baker you know just kind of some fast talking con man just injecting people with poison it there's bound to be a lot of a lot of ghostly activity there I think yeah like that's that's just weird so is that a place you'd go to with a Ouija board shell yeah of course you would of course you would why lie I absolutely would you know I would you would and I would go with you I'd be like hey I got a great idea uh I would definitely go with you you'd come you absolutely know I would of course I would I would I would so be there of course you would I'd even put my fingers on the planet because I'm an idiot you would you would I would that's just kind of weird because I feel like that's just a lot for one property it is it's so much I just feel like that's a lot for a lot for one property well it's a really big hotel and it's had a lot of you know it's been a hotel it's been a girls school it's been a women's college it's been a fake cancer curing Center and now it's a it's a hotel slash paranormal Event Center a paranormal Event Center it's just it's it's interesting that all the things people got away with back then claiming in the medical interests of people but yet some sick [ __ ] went on like not just there but a lot of these like asylums and ination mental hospital institution type places yeah in the early 1900s it seems like all these places that were reportedly supposed to help people were pretty scary shitty places they were they were definitely praying on people and people's people get scared stuff and they were praying on that I feel like yeah there it was it was a pretty scary time I mean it World War II had ended it was the depression and yeah yeah but it was a it was a really shitty time it was hard for people and and you know so they they were looking for Hope anywhere they could get it I guess and and they were easy prey for charlatans right and there was a lot of it going on and there was a lot of money to be made if you were that type of person and he made so much money just basically lying to people and telling them what they wanted to hear while being exactly what he said he wasn't yeah being exactly what he said was the problem and it's just weird to me that people couldn't see that I mean he drove around in his flashy car wearing his flashy jewelry and his lavender suits railing against you know rich people and the establishment and and they ate it up you will only see what you want to see I guess that's true in a lot of things yes and these people wanted to see something that I guess in their minds they saw I don't know I guess they did a lot of these ghosts um people say seem to be kind of interactive maybe it's because they died in such a such a horrific way I don't know but a lot of times they'll talk to you there's a ghost of a gentleman in the bar it supposedly has will tell people that he's waiting there was a woman that he met there and he's waiting for her uhhuh Theodora will tell you know will introduce herself and some of the ghosts will ask for help you know so it's interesting to me that you know maybe it's because of the desperation that these people had or the hope that they were looking for that that they seem to be as Spirits they seem to be more interested in communicating you know maybe that's because of their desperate circumstances I don't know it could be I don't know I don't know but you can go there and they have a lots of ghost tourist I love it so is this like Hotel California you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave I certainly hope not because a lot of people they do kind of say that a lot of people have checked in and not ever checked out but well you kept saying that so that's why I was like Hotel California Jesus oh and I forgot to tell you just recently I guess it was in the last couple years they Unearthed the the dump site like the garbage site uhhuh from when it was the cancer hospital oh jeez apparently when the when the feds like raided the place before he went on trial they emptied out everything and kind of threw it away and the Rumor was it had all been taken to the dump and I guess what they meant by the dump was the dump on the property so when somebody was kind of digging for a garden they found all these glass jars and stopped digging and so they brought in some you know uh archaeologists and forensic people and they found some intact jars medicine jars from when it was the cancer hospital with his crappy snake oil in it so they can test it and see what was in it and they also have some specimen jars because he would show people like little floating Blobs of stuff that he says was cancer that he had magically taken out of people what did they find it to be I believe they're testing it and I have not seen any results yet even though this happened in 2019 but I'm still looking so we'll see I think this year might have Ben last year they had a uh a seance an event where they had psychics come in and they were going to actually try to contact the people that the stuff in the jars had been taken from oh and they were going to do uh so they had like a you could buy tickets to go to that event so I know they have all sorts of different events at this hotel oh you can go to the creepy Crescent Hotel where Norman Baker the quack doctor every time you say that I think you're gonna say Norman Bates kind of is like Norman Bas I think he was a serial killer I don't think this is just a case of of a greedy dumb [ __ ] I think this is a legit serial killer wow wow how could you not be like how could you for two years and prior to that he had the other Clinic where he was fake curing people that ended up dying for two years he ran this hotel Clinic where he said he was curing people of Cancer all he ever gave them were these two slightly different mixtures of poison I mean how was that not a serial killer you know like those sick people that they're not just like hack them up kind of people they're more like injec them with poison and watch them slowly die kind of murderers yeah like the nurse ratchet kind of thing you know yeah yeah yeah yikes so Twisted yikes we we both had kind of weird stories mine is more like weird humans yours is like some serial killer SL wantanabe doctor with a temp gr education so creepy so he's like hey the government's got a cure for cancer but I'm going to make [ __ ] up and give it to you I don't know whatever the worst part is is people bought into it people bought into it people you know and it's sad to pray on people who just want a little bit of hope you know that's terrible
