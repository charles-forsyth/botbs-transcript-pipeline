welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and this is part one of our three-part series on spellcrafting in this episode we talk about Spell components and correspondences what do you need what they mean and why are they part of spellcraft and I'm show and I am so excited because I think that this is going to be super fun we're going to talk about correspondences and associations and what all these charts mean that you find online and in books and I'm just really ready to get to the nitty-gritty of magic this is one of my favorite parts of magic is creating spells and finding all the ingredients and everything to put together for it I have a lot of fun with this it's very crafty recipe like to me that kitchen witch feel even though it's not necessarily kitchen witchery per se but it's kind of got that let me find the meaning of this and this is like a recipe you see it all the time  discussion boards all over the internet people are wondering what spells do you use what do you use for this spell or that type of spell and people like to follow what they see on Tik-Tok or YouTube but a lot of times they don't know how to adapt it to themselves or they don't know why they're using the different ingredients that they're using the flip side of that you know we get questions on our discussion group via email in person I have a specific intention what do I use and I think the issue with correspondence has four people initially is oh my God I have to memorize all this stuff and that's just not the case that's just not the case I think and it will get into this as we go that you need to adapt and you need to get that base knowledge and then turn it into your wisdom really what you need the most of his imagination  journaling but the reason for that is because correspondences are all about association's what does something do what does it correspond to you'll hear us say and other magical practitioner say it like for like magic or it's sometimes they'll even go very fancy and call it the doctrine of signatures  doctrine of signatures in like-for-like magic is pretty old the idea of using different ingredients in spellcraft and choosing them according to their properties has been used in many cultures around the world for thousands of years and we even have written evidence of people talking about different ways to use herbs and other items in like-for-like ways and you know that that kind of goes back to you know my little anecdote about kitchen witchery you know it's almost like following a recipe per say if you want a vanilla pudding these are the ingredients you need to add to get a vanilla pudding you know if you need a Prosperity spell these are some ingredients you might want to consider to use for that Prosperity spell so I kind of look at them almost maybe that's just kind of how I compartmentalize it in my head is like almost like recipes not baking recipes because baking recipes have to be very exact so maybe think of those more like eyemed  but most of this is a good healthy recipe and I'm glad you said it the way you did because sometimes I might add a pinch of this 4-2 that and that's where I go astray from sometimes traditional listing as whether it be books internet list what have you because sometimes it feels right to add a little black pepper even though the book doesn't say so what we're talking about is the ingredients that you're going to use in your spellcraft what do you choose what herbs do you choose to make your incense what color candles do you use do you use a candle what other items might you put in the spell what type of stone type of symbols and how do you choose them we're going to talk about all of those things and why you would do that as well and you'll hear she'll say a lot intention intention  and people that are full on intention know that you don't technically need any items or ingredients to cast a spell exactly having them there is definitely a big part of helping you to get into your magical frame of mind especially if you're not someone who has done this repeatedly where you can just put yourself into an alpha State and it and just bought a spell with intention and energy most people need more than that just at the stage so to speak and just as much as you Harper on journaling iHeart for an intention to Step One really needs to be what is your intention with your speller you're working because that's what's really going to determine where you Branch out quote-unquote materials Wise from there so you have to think of what is the whole purpose of what I'm doing what am I trying to accomplish and then probably the next step is  going to be how elaborate I guess it's the best way to get for me to put it and by that I mean am I just throwing together a couple of things I have handy or do I need to go to the store and what these ingredients do for you and do for your spell work is get you into a magical frame of mine it's set and setting they have to set everything up for you so that your magic can be at its most potent so that your intention can be at its most pure and your spell can be of most power you are basically getting all of your senses in alignment with your intention you're using everything that you have all senses you use smells site textures you're using sound all of these things to put you in the frame of mind for a money spell or just a spell or a love spell the way you layer and set your area your altar and your spelling gredients is going to put your mind into a certain mindset and that will help to empower your spell and then  also did you know some of the things you may need to use could be determined on what type of spell you're looking to do we talked in a couple previous episodes I like to burn things so obviously if I'm doing something I can do is going to be one of the color and the way you choose those things is going to be by symbolism we talked about like for like magic and a doctrine of signatures and what that is goes back to 65 see a Roman dude named Gaius Cortese he basically wrote about medicine in Rome and he said that herb that plants the way that they looked they did medicinally Heroes of the herbs Scorpius resembled a scorpion's tail and so that meant that this herb would help with a scorpion sting  interesting Theory now this goes on to later in the 1400s this other guy now he's spun a philosopher named philippus aureolus theophrastus bombastus Von hohenheim thank you for not asking me  even more interesting he gave himself the name paracelsus easier to say so paracelsus he was born in the 1400s he was an alchemist and astrologer and philosopher and he believed that a person was more than just their body that they were Body Soul and a spirit that connected you to the universe and he believed that healing should be both physical and spiritual so we had a lot of cool ideas but he was also someone who believed in the idea of like for like magic and he coined the principle of some of its current or like yours like you're saying a lot of the last one is Jacob bomb and he was born in 1575 and he was a cobbler actually and he had a mystical Vision when he was about 25 years old and he claims to know the relationship between man and God and he talked about the doctrine of signatures in a book that was called the signature of all things published in 1621 and he said  when God created all objects he marked them with a signature that showed what their purpose was and so this concept that the Divine has given everything a clue to its you mix up the doctrine of signatures is very animistic it's very much everything is connected like take the Scorpion weed that the original Roman dude talked about right there look like a scorpion's tail comb actual plant in the Mediterranean and it's seed pod looks like the spiral Corkscrew of a scorpion's tail it will not cure you from a scorpion sting right but it does have anti-inflammatory properties it does have wound healing properties so it's not exactly true medicinally but the concept is sound very animistic in nature and that's where we get the idea of like for like magic because maybe they can't physically do this thing but magically this idea that what it looks like what it does wear it come  from the color of it how it makes you feel all of these things contribute to what it does in the magical realm there are a lot of different people just sick of herbs or colors or candles of correspondences I just want a listing of of things that you could use in your correspondence table because as much as I poke fun at Layla and her journaling I will say that one of the first things I did back in 19 was created my own correspondent stables in a book of shadows or Journal because I figured that was kind of the basis for my magical working was kinda to start getting familiar with you know what do I use this for what does this mean what does it symbolize what energies are emanating from this one of the absolute  things to use a book of shadows for is your own personal correspondences I had Cunningham's herbal encyclopedia you know I had a book of those books at Krystal's but I needed that kind of compacted 15 books should I kind of formed my own quote unquote magical meanings and magical correspondences for things was experimenting with Angus writing things down creating my own and you know it's not going to be just you know herbs and crystals and candles and colors remember things like metals and days of the week have correspondence flowers have correspondence his numbers have correspondences items like acorns and keys and pencils and animals and all things have a core everything every item has  when you're doing the journaling I have several questions that you should ask yourself with the item what do you personally feel know or think about the item write those things down what does it make you feel what do you know about it then write down what is the most common or most well-known idea about it what is it saying books about it what if you heard about it would have other people said about it then the last thing that you should look at is how is this item this tree this object this moon phase whatever it is how is it shown in history and stories and in folklore you know what do you know about the use of lemon in folklore what have you ever heard about anything you know their stories about people using willow switches or you know what have you heard about these objects when what can you find out in history because a lot of times that is what will give you the basis of what it does magically I want to interject with an example  or I feel like we live in a divided world over this particular topic I am going to bring it up I forever and a day have felt that an ass or sword represents fire and I know we had this conversation as it relates to Terro but I'm also talking in a magical correspondence way and I know that there is a portion of the magical community that view that as an air sign I think that that is a key example of ghetto take what you find in these tables but what does it mean to you what are you getting from this object or from this this particular plant or animal what have you what are you getting out of it because there are a big group of people who get air Vibes out of swords and in Athens  and the reason for those differences in the magical correspondence is because of a difference in how it's viewed people who say stores are representative of air say that is because of Blade's Edge cuts through are they talk about the phrase of intellect being sharp and the air is the element of mind and thought And Then There Are People Like Us who say that swords are representative of fire because swords are forged in Fire and that becomes part of their nature they also say that stores are used in combat and combat is Mars fire angry energy my point is that when you describe an object when you personally write down all the descriptive words of what an object is and does the characteristics that you find important enough to mention are the magical correspondences of that item to you so definitely write your own feelings in your own correspondence his first and then write the known correspondences and Mark which one's feel correct  to you and feel like they work to you and work with the ones that you're not sure about and see how that fits and you know I think creating your own table is a good way to keep it organized for future use because I still to this day frequently go back to some of my correspondence tables because you know that is a lot to to keep in your in your little head when you're got a lot going on in life and having your own notes about that and I'm I'm not negating book buying but having your own notes in your own journal thought your own feelings on these things are going to make spell work become like secondhand nature because instead of being like okay so I want to do a spell for inner strength and Clarity but now I got to spend a couple days figuring out what I need to do use you're going to get to a point where you like you know what I need to work on some Inner Strength I'm going to pull this candle  this this Stone in or just going to put it all together and it's going to be second nature to you specifically to you is that depending on what culture you're from they might have a slightly different meaning there are a lot of things that are archetypes and we'll get into those in a second but some things like they say the color white and United States of America white is a very traditional wedding color and it is in other cultures as well but in some countries like China and some African countries white as a color of mourning very different meaning the color pink used to be like right now it's pink for girls blue for boys right it used to be pink was considered a masculine color it was just maybe for boys because it was a diluted form of red it was considered too powerful and spiry because it was associated with Mars and blood and dangerous it was too powerful for girls  and blue eyes like the sky area and saw it and was associated with the planet Venus so blue was for girls so again depending on what culture you come from what time. You come from different things will have different associations and that's okay but you need to know when those associations are ingrained in you and and what it feels like to you there are some things that seem to be very Universal symbols we know that symbols can get into our subconscious in a very strong way because some of these are our Universal around the world like circles almost always represent bonus or a woman's belly it represents no beginning and no end they have a lot of the same representations Frost Road exactly the idea of the universal mother is an archetype the trickster is a universal archetype  far from Union psychology and the idea is that there are some symbols and ideas that are Universal that all people everywhere at all times will recognize yeah no matter where you go you kind of recognize these now some that aren't quite so Universal but are still very easily recognized our say Santa Claus Santa Claus is an archetype a lot of things will have an archetypal correspondence as well that'll be just kind of an innate idea and some you can just put on it yourself like she'll side with those sword being fire instead of air depending on who you are that will make a big difference in our old Community almost every single time someone called fire they use the same and that community in that space it was coming but in other communities swords might be are so really depends on where you are you know to give an example of how archetype scan kind of play in to spell work  I want to do a love spell I may grab a I'm a bird a pink or red candle and I may use summer all pieces and portions of rows and more often than not the roses that I tend to use my car either a light red or a dark pinkish color so you see my same here I'm doing a love spell and I got this red pinky thing going on witch in our Collective Minds again you know red hearts red is love a red is romance so you know even sometimes you don't feel like it's kind of that archetype it is and you can add to that you know in our culture pink and flowers and hearts and roses are all love related are all romance related you can take that one step further what's romance related to you maybe if your lovers cologne maybe it's  specific foods that you like to eat together maybe you only wear silk when you're with them and so those things now have to do with romance and sensuality because those other associations that you have given them on top of what they already have and so you can bring those into your spell as well. I did a nice little romance see things for me and the sweetums I put a little splash to the Dior sauvage in their jackets back into the idea of layering your space layering your spell with all the things to get every part of you focused on your intention Aleister Crowley one of the best books okay I save best but only if you're really a masochist it's Aleister Crowley I mean really but his book 777 and other qabalistic writings he has a lot of  correspondences there are a lot of tables and that's where a lot of these ideas come from and he says in that book quote since the student is a man surrounded by material objects if it be his wished Master one particular idea you must make every material object about him directly suggest that idea in the ritual quoted if his glance fall upon the lights their number suggests Mercury you smells the perfumes and again Mercury is brought to his mind in other words the whole magical apparatus and ritual is a complex system of mnemonics and quote and mnemonics are our Memory aids are things to Aid you in your magic to bring to your mind to your senses all the things that remind you of your purpose your intent and give power to your spell some wise words you know yeah he wasn't always crazy sometimes he said some cool ship  in the end of Mystic idea all of these objects want to help you you're asking them to Aid you in your spell work in your magic and so you want all of them to be of the same mindset I guess and that's like you were saying show with the different pink things in the flowers and bringing all things that have the same purpose as soon as gold together if you were going to write a money spell what types of things just off the top of your head would you throw in it and I'm cheating cuz I'm looking at my money Bowl so I would put in rice because that is a traditional symbol of money and a lot of cultures plus I love rice cinnamon again also used to be very pricey spice and it is fiery at lights a fire under your ass when you're lazy you need to get out there and make some money if that hustle going I also like to put in an interesting money and here's where my correspondence  how many people will feed their money bowls with actual money and I like mine to be real money fake money will work as well again as long as that fits that Vibe it gives you that intention of real money that works but I like to use interesting money so I have like a $2 bill and a really old $1 silver certificate cuz they're interesting and different and I want my money to be interesting and different I have my British coins in mine I hear you and I also like to have star anise in there because I like the star and the idea of you know shooting for the stars and and again that is a slightly different correspondence star anise might not be something you normally see in a money spell but because it makes me think of reaching for the Stars it's in there for me since you had to bring up the whole Moneyball thing and then I'm going to circle back to buy I asked I actually have one of these cowrie shell in here  because there used to be back in the old days tribes that would use these calorie shelves as a form of currency is opposed to our traditional modern-day metal one paper coins in dollars and cowrie shells are also a great example of the doctrine of signatures because cowrie shells were used in African Traditions not only as money but also as a fertility charm because they look like a Volva and then I'm all about color correspondences so I have to greet adventuring stones in here just because they're green I also have acorns because remember that day when we were at Central New York Pagan Pride day there had to be 10 trillion billion acorns on the ground when I think of acorns I think of abundance and in things being plentiful I go back to that day that we were at that Park and it was just  everywhere so I think of that is kind of a prosperous thing so you might not find it in a traditional correspondence but that's kind of a weird shelf because from a small seed on Mighty Oak grows so if you want to grow an idea grow a business grow your money in your savings account using coins know what I wanted to ask you was was there a particular day of the week that you would do this and why I don't stay at the beginning of the year it's kind of like one of my New Year's traditions so I don't pick up reticular day but I do have a time of year I guess that I like to do it and the reason I came to the point I wanted to make is that everybody has their own way and there's nothing wrong you know like you would like to do your money bowl at the beginning of the year some people refresh at weekly  start wanting to get on monthly I don't necessarily follow correspondences of days of the week maybe I should but I don't currently but I do need to follow the moon phase correspondences void of course but yeah so there's certain thing as you know like I will always pick certain things like an herb in a stone and then everything from after Urban stone is kind of a crapshoot depending on what I have available my mood what's going on in my life at that particular point and how much time I have so there's no wrong way and it's not that you have to pick something from every group  it's more layering your space it's more layering in these items that are going to help you this is your team you're assembling your team right now your clothes out of your toolbox trying to get everybody together you're letting them know what their position is what their part to play in this whole thing is and they're enthusiastically ready to go they're going to lend you their energy like a football huddle exactly what energy are they lending you ask them so you're going to do a spell for me Justice say somebody at work has wronged you or whatever you need a little Justice in your life until you can start with Santi di here here is a God of Justice you could start there what things does tier like you could start Gathering those things you could go with a Libra you could be bruh the scales of Justice right what things are associated with Libra you can start to gather those things together what do you associate with Justice  is it a bad is it handcuffs maybe write down what you want to see bring all these things together that say justice to you and have that in your environment you could even set yourself up for those things where something maybe that makes you feel like a lawyer or is it makes you feel like a judge the superhero I don't know makes you feel like you're going to bring this justice but layer everything so that's the whole idea is you want your space and everything around you to be focused on your intent and I have to go back to the stones and crystals to be like all right these for associated with Justice and truth let's do this thing is is that it says that purpose to you if your purpose is money the object the herb the stone needs to save money to you and this is where don't ever bring this up again okay  but this is where is a hundred and 10% agree with you on the journaling or like a science project you do you want to write down okay so I use the Black Candle and I used valerian root and I rub some eucalyptus on my can you do you want to write these things down because if this ends up working for you you want to let you know repeat and he was this necessary and if it doesn't work for you you want to be able to say okay what can I adjust and maybe what can I use more of less of change out for something else next time so you really want to kind of keep track of this for the sake of did it work did it not work from here for the next time a hundred percent  and once you do have those correspondences and they are working for you don't let anyone tell you that you're doing it wrong because as long as it works for you it doesn't matter what they say you're still working out there's exactly to add two shells example of the sword being for fire many many moons ago when I first met witches in Salem for Salin I became friends with them and I was able to visit them and there were two different covens in Connecticut and I was lucky enough to work with them a little bit which was really really cool and one of the rituals that we did I was asked to call West and as a little witchling I was super honored and super scared because here are these big powerful third-degree witches who've been doing this shit for so long and they have titles and hereditary shift going back now they could trace their lineage  yeah I was very intimidated but hey I get to call Wes so yay Bluewater West I'm good right so in the center of the circle is a big circular table there is all sorts of different items on it they started in the East and the person would reach to the table and East pulled up in sense and did their call South there was I think it was a candle I don't remember I'd suspect then it came to me I saw no chalice I saw no she'll just what's going on here I've done nothing blue I didn't know I was supposed to have an object I didn't have anything ready I did see a stick and the stick was Forks on one end like a dowsing Rod so I picked it up and held it as a dowsing rod and called West and boy did I feel that energy run right up my arms I can almost feel it now  thinking about it it was wonderful it works great I was so proud of myself as I got this is perfect good job no that was not to be at the end of the ritual I was pulled aside by The High Priestess and her high priest I can't remember her name but it was a coven of fire and snow just saying they pulled me aside  I did it wrong I did not use a chalice or a shell I use the stick and how dare I and that was so wrong and so bad and they are going to tell me why it was so wrong and I've been typed up hey that was in Rod calling water bubble made total sense did you not feel the energy and I did have quite a few of the other of the coven who heard this back me up energy was great they knew the dowsing Rod reference even the ones who didn't and still felt the energy were like oh that's why it works so don't ever let anyone tell you that your correspondences are wrong if it works it works all it needs to do is get your magical brain activated that you and magical space to raise the energy and to do that spell and that's what counts and that's why you have to write it down  I would have accepted my you know my shame and you're lashing your traditions and covens around the land that they have a certain way about things and that you have to respect that you know if you are going to to be a part of a tradition or be a part of a coven are a group that to them you know Bluewater West and there's no no talking about anything you know you have to go with that or maybe that's not the group for you you don't have to follow along with traditional meanings but you also have to be respectful that people do have their own version of what these things mean to them and maybe you'll learn it that way like who's to say that we associate stores with fire because that's what our community did and that's what we did  for years and years and years and rarely did it any other way so who's to say that that wasn't formed because of that community and that's okay you know that's that's what tradition is for that's what culture and Community is forced to teach these things in the past month if it didn't feel right we wouldn't continue to do it and there are some things that you will ask them you know say you're doing a love spell and you reach for sulfur it might tell you no no I don't really want to be in this Louis though I don't want to be a part of your bullshit man right this isn't exactly the right energy you want to bring to that love spell it right and you're not sure why maybe it's because you know so there can be correspondences they are even if the traditional meaning might look a little different I think we're really most recently about how correspondence  I mean different things to different people is taking it back to our episode on Charmed cast I have since that time collected a vast amount of little trinkets from a little charm bag there are signals that they made me and something in particular to me but are going to have a completely opposite meaning to you or the next guy or the lady down the street because those charms were picked because they either reminded me of something in particular made me feel a certain way trigger to certain thought or memory and you're not going to have that same thought that same feeling so I think the charm bag really kind of put it in the Forefront that correspondences are so individualized and yes please buy the books read the tables follow the charts but also use your own  intuition because if you don't trust your intuition where the hell yeah yeah and it and it's so much easier than you think you already have a list of ideas about everything you already have a list of ideas and feelings about every color and about gems and about plants and about objects in your house all you have to do is name them that's that's why I shall stay and put it in a journal have to keep pointing that out because sometimes you don't know what those connections you have in your brain are until you write it down till you say it out loud so next time you do a spell don't look one up ask yourself what do I associate with look what do I associate with success and then start to gather those things and bring them together and then put your spell together if you want to go look it up go look up what you wrote down and see you know hey this is what I felt and thought what is the quote on  call Textbook correspondences and how do they cross paths at all at all or am I just totally different than what these tables are saying use your imagination use your feelings let it just let it go let any preconceived ideas go and just go with what your gut says and what you're feeling say you are basically creating order out of chaos you're creating a system to get you closer to your intended result so everything that you can bring in that matches that intended result was going to make your spell more powerful so just start grabbing those things that match that idea and bring them into you and then write your spell from there you'll be very surprised at how well that works was a wonderful part 1 because we do have a part 2 and part 3 so Layla give him a little heads up on what to expect for part 2 of a spell working and I always talked about how to gather your items for the spell next we're going to talk about how to  put them all together how to actually write the spell from start to finish you've gathered the things that you want you've layered all of these feelings and ideas to help you get into that magical headspace now what exactly the next episode of Abby now what how to write that spell and then the third one after that will be had a power to spell times get your supplies and we're going to talk about craft in your spell so thank you all so much for listening to this episode of back on the broomstick and we really hope that you're not offended that I see swords is fire  join us next week for part two of our spell draft summer series and in the meantime stay wise say Wicked keep drooling and keep it with Chi
