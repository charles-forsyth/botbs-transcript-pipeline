welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and today we have the fantabulous Amy Blackthorne back with us again we are very very excited she has two two amazing books that just came out who writes two books at the same time by the way seriously you're very much an overachiever one of them social media spell book 366 ways to get witchy on the web sounds absolutely fabul and I have questions and the second one that just came out I believe on the fourth is called sacred plant magic spells rights and rituals for living an aromatic life so busy person how are you so busy oh my God sleep Amy do you sleep I don't like two hours a night is is the most I I got I just want to point out to our listeners not only have you put out two books at the same time and I'm not saying anybody can do that cuz nobody not everybody can do that but people other people have done it but you are putting out two kickass quality books at the same time that's different than just putting out two books at the same time like you're putting out kickass books that's a lot you're busy um I am neurod Divergent is amazing because I'm like I need to procrastinate doing this thing because I don't want to do the thing until I have enough pressure to do the thing so I'm going to procrastinate writing this book by writing this book so I literally wrote them both at the same time nice you're telling my secrets so that's how I get things done I'm like well I'll procrastinate this important thing by doing this other important thing yeah that's the only way I get workshops written man seriously you're not wrong like people need to know this is what we're doing these are the secrets behind the scenes two hands same time now not only have you just put out two kickass books but we were just talking before we hit record about Temple Fest you were just recently at a festival as the main presenter the headliner keynote speaker tell us a little bit about that experience oh my God it's it's so mind-blowing that authors that I've read since I was a a teenager are saying hey how can I help you reach your goals for the next five years how can I how can I support you how can I you you're you have something here how can I nurture that it is it is mindblowing I might cry if that were me if that were me I'd probably just fall into tears Who Am I who the hell am I yeah it's awesome at the beginning of your sacred plant magic book I was reading the long list of amazing authors that are recommending this book and talking about it and you know it reads like a who's who of the current magical world and so that that shows that you're really making a difference and that that you know you've put something out there that is helping people that's touching people and doing good magic you know and we need that in the world right now for sure and one of the big things that I took away from Reading uh sacred plant magic thank you for including cannabis I very much appreciate you stepping out of the you know the yeah the Box not a lot of there are weed books out there but not a lot of traditional herbalists are willing to touch that plant and so I'm very glad that you spent several Pages very methodically categorizing cannabis as as a magical plant did you have any push back on that how did you feel about including that in your book I was really nervous about it I wanted to do it but I was so nervous that I I was deadlocked for about three days I couldn't write anything because I knew I wanted to include it but I was worried how many people were going to be Ry May sure yeah because it's still has a stigma yeah I was worried about overseas sales I was worried about here I was worried about anybody getting mad at me and I finally decided that this plant has been reaching out forever for people to have that develop that relationship and work with this plant so I'm like you know what I'm it's my obligation is to the spirits and so I have to include it yes I kind of look at it as you would include marijuana into any herbal encyclopedia or magical tomb of sorts just like you would Rosemary or chamomile just because different states or or governments find it legal illegal whichever side of that coin you're on it is still a plant yes it is still a plant you don't have to like it you don't have to love it but it's still part of that Plant World which is exactly what you Encompass and it was important to me to make sure that there were ways for people who especially here in the US where there states where it's still illegal to develop a spirit relationship with that plant without ever touching the physical plant that could you know land them in jail absolutely I love that you mentioned the spirit of the plant because I am a huge advocate of the Green Goddess of meeting the spirit of that particular plant it's something you can do with all plants but for me for anyone that's taken any of my workshops I very often say that cannabis made me an animist it was growing that plant 30 some years ago that I truly could feel that relationship that symbiotic spiritualness of this plant and it it literally made me an animist I could see the personhood in all things the spirit in all things and it developed because of growing such a spiritual plant and you you talk about some ways to connect with plants in this book uh one of the ways you say is you take nine basil seeds because nine is sacred and Basil's sacred to the goddess and you plant those seeds and talk to them and this is not a fast process this is a slow process so can you tell us a little bit about creating relationships with the spirit of plant absolutely that specific spell is a spell for love I volunteered for 12 years as a uh mediator as a as someone as an expert with all experts.com for 12 years so you could volunteer in different areas and so you could the adult witchcraft section you could volunteer in the teenage witchcraft section so you could get questions from all over um at any time day or night you're checking your email and I got a lot of questions from people who said I want a love spell and I'm like okay here you go here's this thing and my and a lot of my DieHard friends and fans would say oh my God it's a love spell you're taking so it's free will absolutely not absolutely not I told them to gather nine basil seeds to gather soil and a clay pot and some water and to plant these nine basil seeds because basil is sacred to Aphrodite so what you're doing is you're you're growing and you're talking you're developing a relationship with basil in order to show that you're ready for a loving and committed relationship with whoever is the right person you're not saying I want Johnny Joe to fall in love with me and marry me forever no we're saying that there is space in your life for another relationship for another human being for you to dedicate your time space and energy too and that's the kind of magic that we condone absolutely I want to make sure that people understand that this was a way to a demonstrate how uh easy that connection is to build but B not just the understanding of who that plant is and who that person is that you're connecting with in in yourself but it's that if you don't have the time to plant the nine basil seeds if you don't have time to water if you don't don't have time to tell that basil plant about your day you don't have time to dedicate to another entire human being with thoughts and needs and feelings and desires Bingo beautiful and I think people want things that are quick and so I liked that spell because it's not it takes time to build these relationships in the real world and in the magical world there's not a quick fix for any for everything in this lifetime and that includes magically just because you're using you know some sort of spiritual force or spiritual relationship ship to create Magic doesn't mean that that shit's instant this isn't mck Magic no absolutely not so it was really important to demonstrate that these relationships are worth your time and energy and effort I got so many people when Botanical Magic first came out said I can't be a green much I kill all my plants my love you're speaking to one of them right there but on the flip coin of that in my defense I have also been a practicing herbalist for pushing 30 years even though she kills plants there is a difference between that and the fact that I currently cannot even keep a spider plane alive I'm desperately hanging on to it the cat's eating it Ila don't be mad at me are they both dead just tell me they're not dead they're not dead I'll send pictures after this they're not dead grp of Life they're they they're not dead but they're not well okay oh sh sh cat has eaten them there's mushrooms growing in it and I don't know what the hell is going on here people but they're still green they're still green it's not it looks like you mowed it it looks like you mowed the spider plant it was the cat Okay was the cat I've tried spraying him I've put them up on top of my dresser and like I'm trying okay all right all right we'll talk after the interview so yes so you can be an herbalist even if you can't keep plants alive so so tangent aside you were saying that you had a lot of people that told you I can't I kill all my plants and I had to I had to let them know I had to remind them that there's nobody checking there's no Licensing Bureau for green witches there's nobody checking your ID at the door develop these relationships with plants that you already know that you're already working with go into your spice cabinet and look at what's in there and see who's popping up if you grab garlic with every meal guess what garlic is reaching out to work with you tell me more about this because sh's in love with the chapter on herbal divination that you put in there and this sounds very suspiciously like that so talk to me about your cooking or you're in your place and stuff's jumping how things could be quote unquote speaking to you or reaching out to you tell me more AB yes so when we look at the things that we count encounter in our daily lives people say oh well I I door Dash every meal that I don't cook anything that's fine there are still plants that are actually reaching out for you so are you always door dashing Indian food is the question exactly so if you if you if you want cumin with every meal guess what your body is telling you that this is something that you need your spirit is telling you this this is something you need if you are reaching for garlic with everyone it's a lot like the uh a lot of the magical perfumes we talked about with Botanical magic when we are reaching for a specific perfume or we're reaching for a specific essential oil it's telling us something happening in our body because it smells so good that we want it over and over and over and over again if you keep reaching for a frankincense and clove perfume you might need a spiritual connection to someone outside yourself you might be looking for that spiritual connection so the things that we body is telling us we need are things that we need not just physically but emotionally spiritually and otherwise it's really just listening better and it's listening to the plants and the herbs and things along the those lines it's more body too it sounds like yeah absolutely we have the innate understanding of our bodies when you say oh you know I could really go for some chocolate and you realize okay my magnesium's a little low I might I might need a little bit more of that chocolate is an herb but it's more about not just the plants that we are thinking about but the things that our body is telling us that we desperately want and need the next portion of that is the ones that are popping up when you don't expect them to so if I go out into my front yard and I feel I find Lilia INF flat in the front garden bed I definitely didn't put that there it put itself there okay well it's really close to my front yard what's the message that luil is giving me it's trying to bring air okay to the front door H what do I need to get rid of what is what is needs to be expelled out of my out of my home out of my spirit or my space okay that's a great one you said something about you know if you notice something different in your space now talk to me a about plants of place you know what what do you suggest people do to get familiar with their quote unquote plants of place look around you is the very first thing uh these plants are reaching out for us to make a connection so if that means that you living in a city and there's you say there's absolutely no plants here everything's dead I just want to get from point A to point B the hotel on the corner has a window box out front with little shrubs in it you going to and find dandelions growing in the cracks of the sidewalk these plants especially those that aren't that really they're where they're not supposed to be should definitely be a flag for you if you say I especially if they're catching your eye or something exactly if you are having a difficult time you say I need to go for a walk I need to clear my head and you see three dandelion in a five block walk maybe there's a a message in the tenacity of dandelion growing up in the cracks and the sidewalk especially if it's in the fall because have seen them dandelions growing in the fall they're a little bit out of place they don't grow in the fall exactly so a little out of time a little out of place and so that can really be like you said a flag you can do the same thing from inside your home and inside your um we call it in our landscape I've cleared my mind I've said the intention that I want to meet the spirit of a plant that wants to work with me and so I Envision going through my mind through this inner landscape and I'm going to go through a walk in the woods I did this with with um Susan RS Rego like 15 years ago the way that you know that your journey is a true journey and not a projection is the element of surprise so if something pops out at you and it just really like oh I that didn't even occur to me at all that surprised me definitely pay attention to that I was walking through this Wooded Path that we had outlined in our uh magical journey and the outline of the path was actually had little uh wineberries running a little garden fencing of wineberries along the edges of the path and I'm like oh I've never seen a forest path that was actually fenced in for me that must be something to pay attention to yeah I I've talked before about going through my space once a month or so for full moon or New Moon depending on my schedule and checking on the plants in the around the house and so I left out the front door and I'm pouring my Libations and I'm drumming and I'm singing and I'm doing all the the full moon things to check in and I get around the back side of the house and there's a stand of poke that has popped up between now and the last time I did this hm and it's not just one plant it's a whole little line of poke plants that are about chest height so they they're they've been there for a bit okay poke is poisonous so if it can protect itself it can protect me but it's in the backyard so what's behind me that I can't see that I need toit protection from what do you need to watch your back for exactly so it turned out I had a stalker and it was a very very dangerous person oh and I honestly believe that if poke had not warned me I would not be here today oh wow definitely plant allies giving you signs things to pay attention to yeah those of you who aren't familiar with poke it is bright like magenta pink purple red the bres are very very purple it screams poison warning red flags so this was not a this was not subtle this is not oh hey just in case no this was a great big billboard that said that screamed danger with pointing flashing Arrow I had a similar this this isn't quite as dramatic but just recently I'm I'm still recovering from my first and very crappy about with Co and I don't have a lot of herbal per se remedies on me but lots of tea lots of Honey lots of lemon but just recently I found out my neighbor was going to be mowing a field that's right next to my house and so I decided to go walk through it and just see what I could find as I'm walking through this field and I discovered you know all these brilliant blue corn flowers I saw beautiful purple flowers I had no idea what they were and of course the Golden Rod that's everywhere and uh I decided you know what I'm going to make a healing spell I'm going to make a directional color wheel using these plants they're all going to get mowed down tomorrow anyway so I'm just going to pick these beautiful flowers and make a a very pretty healing spell for myself in the woods so I I go out and I make a little circle and I quarter it with sticks and I start filling in the directions with different color plants that I discovered and my lovely Neighbor comes by and he's like what are you doing he's like I saw you picking things what are you picking and I showed him these beautiful purple flowers that I've been picking he said oh that's B balm you're getting beebalm and I'm like oh my goodness I could take this B bomb home I can dry this I can put it in my tea this is fabulous for healing It's a Wonderful plant you know it it's got magical associations of Vitality and healing and vibrant life so without even realizing what I was picking I was actually picking something that could help me I have a ton of B bomb that I picked out of this field but that just made me really happy to know that I was picking something accidentally that was very abundant in this field that I could take home and use to help me get over this terrible cold but I don't think that's an accident I don't feel I feel like that plant was saying hey this is something that you need your brain your body your spirit was saying you know I need this so you started picking it because it whether it appealed to your eyes or your your sense of touch something said hey this is this is exactly what I need which is how we come into the plant divination there's a there's a section in sacred plant magic where we talk about divination and the one that really enjo that I really enjoyed was the idea of taking my bottles of essential oils and using them for sorage using them for drawing Lots just like you would runes or Stones I was so intrigued by this in the book I was like essential oils for divination freaking genius thank you to so when you look at it you've taken three four bottles at random and and cast them onto your space well what's closest to the center where you are where are they in relation to each other what what does that pattern look like so if you have the very center of your working cloth um is lime what is that going to say about where you are right now and if Rose was the furthest thing from you on this on this cloth how is that going to affect the reading so keep in mind that as the intuitive person as the person interpreting it the most important interpretation of that is yours because if my guides gave me a message in French my French is real bad so I'm not gonna get the the correct message so I need my guides Spirits whoever to use the language that I'm currently speaking so we're going to have to talk about lime in the current context of how I feel about lime and how I feel about Rose the idea of people putting their readings online to say can you interpret this for me understand where it comes from because we were all new ones but the most important thing is how you view it because the message is for you you you talked about new and I wanted to kind of just touch on you know you do have a lot of correspondences and and and magical definitions in the book and I wanted to I kind of Look at You me personally I kind of look at you as like the modern day Scott Cunningham and by that I mean you know back in 1991 when I picked up my first herb books and I got that Cunningham's Encyclopedia of magical herbs you know the thick green book oh yeah you know back then and you know when he wrote that and when I was that 18-year-old newbie I kind of I I latched on to his definitions his meanings his correspondences his symbolism I'm not 18 anymore okay and you have kind of modernized that and Leila and I were talking about this before you came on almost like the next generation of herbalists and you've kind of given it a good new fresh look at symbolisms meanings correspondences and not that old school male only perspective you know I I I like how you kind of you've become the modern day Cunningham to me that is so kind thank you so much like thank you your books are very accessible and they're very interesting and they're very fun I love reading your personal stories as you as you write these books makes it very easy to read but they're so dense with information as well they're perfect but the thing is they're perfect for for new folks who haven't been exposed but they're also equally perfect for seasoned people who want a fresh perspective or need an update or I've never worked with that herb before it's it really is good for a whole range of people and that's why that's why dubbing you the new Cunningham so I'm writing the the next next book and I was looking for do you breathe no I really don't um but I was looking for a specific um intention in the essential oils I was working with and so I I grabbed the nearest book that I was that works with emotional aroma therapy and so I was looking at this piece and I go to the index and I'm scrambling for the thing and I pull up this recipe and it just lists ABC you know benzo and Puli me and Anis and I'm struck by how much it leaves out of the story why do the why these plants why do they do why why did you pick them so when we talk about black Thor sacred plant magic every single thing that I put in there I want you to have the reason why I want you to learn why so you can do this yourself if it's black th's Botanical magic if it's black th sacred plant magic it doesn't matter I want you to be able to take the inference that I've given you these are the some of the key words and the reasons why so you can figure this out for yourself I don't want you to feel like I'm asking you to hold my hand for the next 30 Years I want to I want to empower people to do this on their own because magic is agency and if I'm if you're waiting for me to sit there and hold your hand and tell you it's okay to do this like I'll stamp it in the book I want you to know that it's okay for you to take control in your magical practice and do it for yourself your guide them you're not telling them this is the hard and fast way it must be done right you even say in the book that in when you were researching some of these things for this book and for other books you would often find conflicting information depending on where it came from and I think this gets back to when you were talking about the Divination using the oils or using herbs I love non-traditional divination methods because it makes you use your own correspondences it kind of forces you you to say okay well this oil means this particular magical thing but when I smell it I feel this way and so I'm going to assign this particular meaning to it and the perfect example of that being so personalized is what might be off-putting to me might be the sweetest scent ever to you right you know maybe I grew up making chocolate chip cookies with my grandmother and so the smell of vanilla and sugar makes me happy you know maybe shell you hated making cookies with your grandmother so the smell of vanilla and sugar is bad to you you know so that's going to have a different correspondence to you than it does to me even though some things are are somewhat Universal it forces personalization yeah it gives people agency and in this book you give the um I love that you have the lore you have the folklore and you know that type of information because that's important you know these these herbs have chemical makeup they have medical uses they have scientific grounding and we know what are but they also have information that's been passed down for Generation to generation yeah there's a spiritual side that goes deeper than just the science so I love that you have the folklore and well-rounded things in there so people can kind of read that and make their own correspondences you know make your own ideas about things with a basis in where it comes from exactly now I have a question for you Amy what's the last spell you did using herbs oh um uh dear dear friend of mine experienced a loss their sister died very very suddenly with with there was no warning oh jeez um and so they they are the older sibling and the loss of a younger sibling is unfathomable you know we expect that our parents will outlive us but we don't expect our younger siblings right to to predecease us and so they were inconsolable as understandably understandably as as we would expect and so they were so stricken that they could not move or think or breathe or eat or sleep or or function at any level grief debilitated them literally basically it really did so I went to them and I said I I would love to help you if if I have your consent I will I will develop something that will work for you personally I want to make sure that this is something that is not just here but that you'll reach for um I talk about the process in Botanical magic because it's important that the person who is receiving this not find it orally ma magically nasally offensive because then they won't reach for it you'll have wasted your time your energy your spirit it can't do the magic if you won't work with it like there's a whole bunch of stuff that's going into here back to that personalization yeah so I went to them and I said hey is there anything that really bothers you that you don't like that you won't use that you're allergic to I wanted to make sure I get the the bound the boundaries the of the levels and so I took um a nasal canula and I made an essential oil grief support blend for them that I put into a nasal inhaler so they could take it and have it in their office in their car whenever they had the need of that support and so it was 10 drops of Frankincense 20 drops of lemon balm for that that help Express the grief that lives in your body that lemon balm is so good for that um five drops of Cypress again to help with processing through the grief that comes in waves it will help ground some of that and mang to uplift so five drops of Cypress and five drops of mang and They Carried that nasal canel around for about the first month that they were really in in depth with their grief and it really helped them process and move to a place where it was bite-sized chunks instead of a massive wave of grief manageable manageable exactly so I asked every one of the spirits of these plants are you willing to work with this friend for this purpose they said yes so even if they they accepted it as a gift and were like ah not really my thing I'll just tuck it in my pocket and I won't tell Amy I don't want to hurt her feelings I would feel that that was a successful spell because each of those Spirits said yes I want to lend my Aid to this person so even if they never smelled it which they did they they really enjoyed it even if they never did the spirits of those plants were stepping forward to help support that person in their time so frankincense Cypress and mang are all Woody so it really would give them the stability that they needed to move forward through that grief they they had parents and they had younger siblings to support and I really wanted to make sure that they had the grounding and the stability of those heavy Woods to make sure that they understood that it wasn't their magic to support alone they didn't have to do it by themselves but we're still rooted in the ground yeah now do you find that when you work with the spirit plants that it turns into not just a spell but more of a ritual oh absolutely there's the timing and the depth and the amount of energy that's put into it there's the actual energy of going through your book of shadows and saying okay this this plant works for this and this plant works for that but then there's the actual creation of say a Talisman raising the energy to empower that Talisman so there's something for those people to drive that spell later on making that connection absolutely can can turn into a full scale ritual it all depends on how much time I have how much material what's needed and what's really driving the need for that spell I like how you said you you woke them up and how you asked them if they wanted to be part of this spell you asked the oils because that I find is something in any spell if you talk to your tools particularly anything that used to be living like herbs but if you ask them if they want to be part of that um and ask them to lend their energy to that working that that can really add add power add oomph to your working is that something that you find to be true as well Amy absolutely when we look at how we talk about our our our spell work as a community there's one word that gets thrown around 99.9% of the time and that's the word use and as an animist it is anathema to me to think about this as an inanimate object that has no agency and it has to be part of the spell because I said so the word use I try and strick it from my vocabulary because it's important to develop practices that acknowledge the agency not just of myself but of the spirits of plants that we're working with the spirits of stones or crystals those Spirits are lending themselves to this working and I don't think that there's really anything that could be harmed by involving and invoking the agency of these other Spirits as well as moving that energy forward just saying oh I'm going to use some lemon balm this thing it just feels super duper icky yes I am guilty of doing that however I'm not guilty of that when I talk about cannabis when I talk about working with cannabis energy and with the goddess of that plant with the spirit of that plant and so I I guess I'm trying to say that maybe I'll be a little more careful about that we it's something we both need to be more cognizant of some habits are hard to break but they are worth breaking so it's definitely something to be cognizant of because I surely wouldn't say to someone well I'm going to go use Leila for a ritual I would never dare say that so you don't say you know just that's the same vein of I'm gonna go use basil for this a lot of people lately talk about how hey I saw this spell online and I tried it and nothing happened and I think it's because you're just seeing the surface of a lot of these spells and rituals you're not actually see yeah you're not seeing the the talking to the plant the waking up of your tools the adding your energy the asking them to lend their energy and empowering that spell and empowering that working and and so I think that's where a lot of times when people say hey that spell didn't work for me it's because they they don't know those underlying steps yeah if you don't have someone you can you can physically learn from it's a lot of it's different when you say oh I I read sacred plant magic and I did the ritual and and nothing happened because those don't make for good Tik toks those don't make for good sound bites so when you see someone anointing a candle and praying over it and it just looks like we're we're just handling material objects you can't see the upwelling of energy coming through your feet and coalescing in the core of your being until it creeps out into your hands where you can Empower you're driving that power into with the materials that you're including in your spell so yes it's especially hard for newer people because they don't get that portion from the book that they're reading they don't understand how to drive those spells through sheer force of will you know you have to learn to draw up that material from the earth and and push it out into your hands and that's hard to teach and it's very hard to you know grasp from a 10-second video online right right and I think that by being more mindful with your herbs with um whatever components of a spell that you have if you if you're talking to them and asking their assistance you know that's one step towards you know pulling up that energy and Awakening that energy in your Spell components so I I I loved that you talked about that I thought that was really good we didn't touch too much on your social media magic is there any social media magic tip from your book that you could share with our listeners so needed by the way such a needed book a needed book um one of the Keynotes that I that I did at templefest was to talk about the connection that we need as far as social media is concerned when we put something out into the universe especially if it's if it's magically charged the number of eyes that land on it are going to offer a little bit more magic and a little bit more attention a little bit more intention for the spell that you're working with so it's not that you have to tell the world all your secrets and you know boundaries are important boundaries are healthy and boundaries are safety what we're doing is we're allowing the collection of this disperate energy that lurks out in the social media Stratosphere to guide it to our Our intention so even if you just have 250 characters in which to explain what a spell is and what spell can do for you it's important to make sure that you are empowered to take the agency of that and make it your own so if I say the spell for January 1 is to clean off your altar and Empower it to cleanse it to give yourself a new space to work with where that next calendar year you're not going to see someone taking the time to draw up that energy and to cleanse it magically you'll see someone waving an incense stick around the next step is the part that you cannot see with your eyes and you have to feel it with your heart with your gut with your hands with your skin and that is the the raising of energy I want the hair on your arms to stand up I want you to feel it leave your body like a blast of heat and go out into the universe for whatever empower in and beautiful magic that you're choosing to work for yourself or others but you have to give yourself the opportunity to fail at something in order to really be good at it absolutely yes yes oh yeah that's deep I hate failing thank you that is my least favorite thing but that's a good one especially part of my neuros spiciness is I'm a little bit of a perfectionist and sometimes if I can't make it perfect I won't do it at all and so I need to give myself permission to fail at these things because that's part of the process and that can be very magical as well absolutely there's so much we learn from failing at doing something that's why having a book of shadows is really important even if it's difficult at times because if it doesn't work we've got to figure out what we did wrong and the only way you can do that is if you can go back and look at your notes and say oh oh I Oh I thought the I thought the moon was u in Virgo but it really was actually void of course so there was there was no magic getting to point B and that's why I think books of Shadows are important not everything can be read in a book it has to be written in a book it does exactly yes so this means that Amy Amy herself is saying you all need to journal ha M yourself woman I am right everyone should be journaling I'm gon I will
