join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode we're celebrating ostara and she'll and boy were late this year is typically in March right around the 20th right when if I ever been on time actually you're pretty darn good about being on time to be honest but this is no exception I am definitely not on time for ostara but it feels like spring now so I'm excited and you know there's lots of different reasons why you might not necessarily be able to celebrate a holiday on the holiday and a star is typically celebrated on the Spring Equinox which is usually right around March 20th and it celebrates balance and the beginning of Spring Persephone is back and her mother is excited for that really balanced on the Equinox but if you do  can I see if I remember correctly it snowed here to Spring at all but before we get into that I had an idea and I swear the last time I talked about Sacred Space so prior to going away I went to the little old PO Box I love that PO box and I love when you guys send mail it like literally makes my day you guys are awesome thank you so much for all the mail and everything you sent not only does she'll love checking the mail we love reading the mail we have some very creative very interesting very cool and witchy listeners you know some of the stuff that we've we've received has been mind-blowing but anyway back to my story I go check the mail wanted to make sure I checked it one last time before I left town and got AAA armload of things and I packed my suitcase I kind of told you I was going to bring you some  mail but I don't think you realized so I show up to Leila's house with a tubby full of mail she brought a very large plastic box all of mail from you wonderful amazing people and goodies don't forget gifts in there they're good birthday cars and goodies and candy and oh my goodness and also you finally got some of your usual gifts which for those who sent you a gift to Layla and I please know that I sent her pictures I showed her on video she did not have them until recently I feel now and I have my birthday cards and I've started going through them and in probably about a week or two will be putting up our very first male call Solari I'm so we'll be talkin about all of it so everybody who has sent mail if we have not already given you our thanks and appreciation stay tuned folks cuz the solarium is all about mail call  thank you and somebody I think the last thing that you got out of the mailbox before we left for secret space was a bunch of candy oh sweet Jesus we got some peeps and chocolate bunnies they had to be two pounds of Lindt chocolate bunnies and while they were delicious and I think and I offered you some but you said I could eat them all so here I go home so thank you Nancy so much of a Candy cell is very much enjoying it and hopefully she'll stash a little so that next time I come out I can snack on it too I will I will I know I'm not going to like it but I will kind of reminded me that I hadn't really celebrated I mean on the Equinox I thought about it a little bit you know what I had a little to you I thought about how cranky I was it was cold on the first day of spring just because the calendar told us to  it was definitely not spring so getting V osara type candy in the mail kind of reminded me that it's starting to feel like spring now especially when we were down in Maryland the weather got warm right after the snowstorm we started seeing flowers so now I'm kind of itchy I want to do some of those star things well and you know what warms my heart the other day this week I saw my first baby of the year and I also saw a bunch of robins like packing worms send an alarm to enough that yes it is spring and Asura is all about New Beginnings it's about that freshness of spraying it's all about starting new things planting those getting ready for them to ripen typically ostara is when the days and nights are of equal length this is Celestial event but our ancestors first of all didn't celebrate something  call the stara and if they did celebrate the Spring Equinox they would have done it based on gut feeling and Vibes I think trying to figure out when the days were equal they more likely would have done it when their crops started growing in the little animals started coming out and I think that at least here in America most of America cuz I actually not all of America does This Thing Called daylight savings time I have a love-hate relationship with daylight savings I really do feel you I like I like fall but I don't like that sense of my day can't technically end until well after dark I want to live like my ancestors but  you know Daylight Saving Time Savings Time kind of  gets me more in that spring mood because you know you think of spring and summer when it's lighter longer and in the days are getting longer and I think this year I don't feel like we're starting to get longer  instantly like I haven't passed years you know it's like oh you know it's March 21st all the sudden tomorrow is longer I can feel that this year you know I felt like  January to now has dragged both literally and figuratively and that's kind of how I felt about it kind of dragged well past March maybe a lot of people weren't feeling it this year because a few people mentioned online and I and a couple of our listeners asked as well you know hey I didn't celebrate on ostara for whatever reason is it okay to celebrate a few days later or in our case a couple weeks later and yes the answer is absolutely yes osara isn't just a name that Aidan Kelly gave to the WIC in celebration of the Spring Equinox it means the whole season of spring ostara is the whole spring time and if now is when you're feeling that energy if now is when you're feeling that Springtime come up and go ahead and celebrate it whether you did or didn't celebrate on the date when you're starting to see those first stirrings of spring you can celebrate ostara again or for the first time you know I also have another point to ponder and that is we've already established  published that you know I was not raised with any Hardline Christian religion but in the same respect I raised my children to celebrate the bunny and you know the season of candy and colored eggs and egg hunts with Easter not being until 4:20 it'll most makes ostara seem like it has to be later in my personal mind because of my personal mind Easter and I'm star or generally close together and it's kind of one Big Spring thing the color eggs the baskets you know I used to take my kids for pictures with the Easter Bunny I just think that this year especially with Easter being so late it kind of made ostara feel late to I have the opposite view actually I don't like when ostara and Easter are closed Easter actually was the first holiday that my children brought home from school  we always celebrated pagan holidays we celebrated the wheel of the year my kids came with me to celebrations I mean I didn't push anything I just wanted them to make their own choice when they got older and Easter Easter I think it was Kindergarten or first grade my kid comes home from school with coloring pages about Easter and wanted to know why we didn't celebrate Jesus oh yeah I know I didn't have that she learned about this in school in public school in New York state we usually celebrated ostara and the All-Star fairy you'll start a fairy would come to our house and the children get little baskets and they kick candy and usually something to plants or something to grow you know things like that we would do the eggs but after that time in school and then the next year when it happened again they really wanted to celebrate Easter and I didn't like it okay  so even now that my kids are older I like to keep them separate and we did revert back to the astara ferry only once they grow out grow their Jesus face but I still don't like it I don't even like to color eggs I do like to have eggs in my wrists are things but coloring them feels to eastery to me and so I don't like the co-opting of my religion and I really didn't like it in public school I totally got that and I'm not looking to defend the New York State Department of Education my kids are so went to obviously a different Publix and it usually was about bunnies and eggs and duckies and you know they do really come home with like a styrofoam cup that had something planted in it but you knew me back then when my kids were that age you knew I would have flip shit if that's actually I caused the scene at the school  you know I ain't right and that particular teacher understood what had happened the second year it was other students it was other kids kind of pressuring and it wasn't the actual teacher and hand out yes it was why don't you celebrate Easter where is your Easter basket what do you mean you don't know who Jesus is like when I was in seventh grade and want to go to CCD cuz that's what all my friends did after school one day a week bible study thing I don't know somebody can give a better explanation than I but it's like a religious studies and all my friends my friends and then when I realized what it was I was like okay I'll see you tomorrow it can be hard I mean when the mainstream religion is not yours it can be very difficult especially for children but that can also be a source of strength  saying a lot of the overlap is joyful to some people they can easily celebrate because you can find Easter / ostara / spring things everywhere and so that can bring a lot of safety and comfort and joy to people because of the overlap and for some reason I don't know why it was ingrained in me as a young child but there's something about Easter I feel like it has to involve hats pretty dresses and white shoes play my grandmother until you mentioned it I completely forgot that we hadn't already passed Easter and I was going to talk about how happy I was that Easter was already over and I didn't have to worry about it in my ostara I take pleasure in the fact that this year Easter's on 4/20 so I know you're going to be celebrating that's hilarious I did okay will be having a party on Easter and they'll be a lot of greenery there let's just the memes  Facebook related to that arapik I'm just saying so although I did kind of poopoo on Easter later I do have a set of star a spell that involves an egg shell so there's a little bit of crossover I'm okay with no I want to just for a minute let's talk about the people who think we're crazy that's probably a lot what are your thoughts and it how do you combat people who say what the hell are you guys doing talking about him celebrating ostara I do me and here we are but like how would you combat someone who thinks we're kind of nuts okuku know I wouldn't say that if you want to celebrate the moment of the Equinox that's great but like a full moon think of a full moon you can celebrate it before or after the actual Celestial moment of the full moon  wheel of the Year events are way bigger than that so I feel like you can celebrate ostara throughout the entire spring season on our once honor it twice every single day if you want to and do it whenever you would like at the beginning of the episode we were talking about how now we're starting to really feel Spring & C spring and I can do some of the things that say spring to me like planting seeds and working on my land and you know going out and cleaning up my outdoor altars those only just recently were possible so that's what I would say is I'm celebrating the season as it appears where I'm at you know I have the same to you but I kind of simplify it down to the Equinox is a moment where is ostara is a season beautiful I know what I mean randomly I do every so often not every single year on the equinox  phone with my dad might be like a week later I mean and standard sometimes we celebrate had a ritual on a Wednesday after work and Community celebrate the Sabbath on the closest weekend to the Sabbath on a Tuesday night was 2 weeks away which I have to say I'm very excited our former Pagan Community gathering together for Beltane this year so I'm super stoked about that I'm really actually going to try because I felt when I found out I felt yes I went two years ago there wasn't one last year I'm thinking this might be the Rumblings of trying to get back together or get the band back together man  the wonderfulness of that group and getting the band back together the world is Shifting back to a sense of community in unity we do need each other especially now especially with all the tax on paganism on anybody who's different we need to stand together but we need to get together and community community is wonderful. So usually I'm spread lady do not  stop yourself please resay that line so I don't put it in the way it just sounded tarot spread lady  I kind of like spread lady myself all right I'm leaving it in then it's okay I will indeed I have signed both our faith so you said that you have the tarot spread I want to hear it the listeners want to hear it what is your spring to spread so I was kind of bumming around on the internet the other day I was supposed to be doing emails and it said I was going down internet rabbit holes and I came across a couple people on Reddit talking about you would read it I know I love rabbit hay shout out to the read it back on the rim stickers love you guys if you're going to jump in the Reddit are Reddit group is a good one it's small but it's very good the witches on their amazing I pop in once in a while I was in right on read it and I saw a couple people mentioned that they hadn't celebrated ostara and they were wanting to and that got me thinking about how you and I haven't  talking about celebrating ostara late and then bumped into a very old on Tumblr if you can believe that tarot reading it's called the seed sounds fitting right and specifically for ostara it's by someone called tarot dreams taradash dreams on Tumblr and the seed has 5 cards and I'll put up a picture on all of our socials but it's basically two cards in like Saginaw 12 diagonally and then in another diagonal line just to the right of that 345 going down so to diagonal lines interesting pattern the first card you put down one and two the first card is the soil where have you grown the soil is your past where do you grow from what do you grow from and what lessons can be learned from the past is the weed and you want to  grow and be strong but there's something that stunt in your progress what are your obstacles and what's holding you back like that so then the first number three and that's a seed and in your immediate future what area of your life will you first start to see signs of growth what seeds have taken hold number for is the Sun and that's love and support from other people but the will to grow comes from within the sun is a reminder of what you need to keep in mind in order to help yourself grow so energy from other people that you internalize and a kind of used to grow and then number five the last card is the rain this is a blessing in disguise and it asks you to understand that things are not always as they seem sometimes when the skies are gray you might feel sad or depressed but rain is just as necessary as the sun  so what blessing in disguise Is On Your Horizon I love that spray either too of course I tried it out as soon as I saw and I absolutely love it this is a fantastic so I will definitely post that and all the different positions and meanings on our socials and on the website I usually put them in the block so if you're looking on their website or things I say in the pocket that usually in the block area so Springtime in Salem we very often say is one of our favorite times and Salem I know but I've got I've got something that I don't think the listeners are ready for what do you mean so you know how during the spring time you know one spring is officially sprung Home Depot goes crazy okay that's true all the different garden stores and everybody absolutely Home Depot turns into like the mecca okay and I found myself at Home Depot and I'm glad you're sitting down  because I wouldn't want you to fall and pass out and get hurt by this but I bought 3 more plants that I'm going to try to keep alive you did what do you even want to I didn't think you would like to taking care of the two I gave you  I didn't mean no as an answer to your question but loosen like I've had this weird like I've had a change of heart or an epiphany or I don't know what it is or if I just feel like I need to spite everybody and prove a point that could be it too cuz you know how I am I want to do this and you've known this that you know every year I do plant a little herb garden and it doesn't do too bad because the outside is controlling everything got me so I didn't plan to go get seeds which I got I got my seeds but I walked out with three plans and then I was searching for what do you call those things you put them in pots those things like I found two gorgeous ones I was having fun at Home Depot but I did buy things that I don't know what they are I'm not going to lie to you folks  cashier did tell me that they were for the inside and the outside I think I can do this folks I have faith in you and here here's why I'm starting to think I could do this what is that plant you gave me that has the heart shape a heart leaf philodendron that thing is like all of a sudden there shoots coming out I put it in a window near son who knew who freaking meal so it's like the chutes are coming out in the leaves are like these deep green leaves and I'm like oh my God and then first of all I put it in a place where the cats can't bite it fantastic into new shoots now that haven't been bitten by cats so you're feeling to grow things bug and you went out and got three more no I haven't told you the biggest part of that she want you to remember the mushroom Fiasco yes mushrooms were growing in the plant  in some of our listeners bless their souls they were so patient with me we're giving me different reasons on why they thought that these mushrooms could be randomly appearing in these plants and somebody said more actually more than one person said this that I should take them out of the dirt and put them in nude like I know what that means so I cut them out of what they were and I just shut them a little bit and I peeled off very gently without hurting any Roots peeled off a lot of the dirt not all of it cuz you know I can only do so much I'm a plant killer hear people and I put them in new dirt that's wonderful I'm so glad and it's been 5 days they didn't die because of it was practically an expert I love it I just think I could do this I think you might have this I don't have to post pictures because no one is going to believe this right now now and three new ones I'm impressed  any pictures I want to see I'm going to have to send them to you because I don't know what the hell I bought except for the lady that was the cashier said there for the house while I will help you out I did confirm with her also that the if the Caps tried to eat a my cats would not die perfect pull out house plant Horticulture and we'll have a little plants fashion will take a look that sounds like a perfect thing to do to celebrate ostara people please send me and the plants your blessings we need everything we can get right now that's actually my favorite thing to do this time of year everybody knows so I am in the middle of repotting all my plants yeah but it's normal for you that's very true and we set up a little station outside on my front patio and I very much like when I'm doing see when I'm putting the dirt in the cops or in a new pot I like to just fill it up a little bit and then draw schedule in the dirt or maybe put a little tiny bit of  eggshell that I have put a little spell on or if I make up a little herbs not an incense cuz I wouldn't burn it but if I mix a little herbs a little crushed eggshells and put some intentions in there for prosperity to grow to grow Serenity whatever I want to grow and put it at the bottom not enough that it's really going to affect the plant but enough to set my intentions with the growing thing then as it grows that can of carries that intention up so I'll do that when I'm reporting my plans and start a new season and it just really gotten me into the ostara mindset herbs I have a conversation with them and I'm like oh please just gross and you know I've actually been pretty successful at the whole 2 years but I don't know it's a big step with these plants I'll keep you updated so you can do all of those things honey there's all sorts of lovely cooking things that are great for us  have fruit with honey just things that make you think about outdoors and freshness and newness open a window open a window and set your intention when you do it so think about all the things in your in your house all this stagnation you know think about the winter and everything is kind of just been sitting there that you want to get rid of and then as you open the window switch that energy out and ask your land Spirits your ancestors the energies of the universe to take all that negativity all that stuffing is out the window and replace it with fresh spring new and that's just a little mini spell you can do right there spring cleaning isn't just for the house it's for your soul to you and I do have a spell I was thinking about how I'm not a huge decorate eggs fans will do eastery for me but I love eggs as a symbol I think there are fantastic symbol for ostara and for spring you know that the new bunnies are being born  not eggs I know but babies are being born eggs breakfast eggs shells and protection spells because the shell itself is protecting new life right it's keeping it safe while it grows so I think that is a fantastic item to use if you're going to be making black salt you can use instead of the salt if you're going to be putting it outside but it's a great protection ingredient so I thought wouldn't it be great to do like an ostara egg thing as a spell have you ever taken an egg in poke holes in the top and bottom kind of blow it out and keep the eggshell intact my mother was a craft of course I have blown eggs  this spell requires that so you put one little pin hole and one slightly bigger hole on the other end of your eggs but not too big not too big no but you definitely wanted to be big enough that you can easily put like a rolled-up slip of paper and some seeds and herbs into it so small but not too small and you let all the insides out make yourself some scrambled eggs and bread whatever you want to do with it now you have a vessel basically you have a jar to put your spell in so you take a little wax and seal up the small pin hole and then in the larger you're going to put your spell ingredients so the idea is to set your intentions for a spell reason she'll make a Prosperity spring ostara spell in this shell so as you were cleaning out the egg you think of all the negativity going away think of starting new think of starting fresh and clean and then  have your eggshell take either a bay leaf or a little piece of bark or a small piece of paper and on it right prosperities money comes to me easily write I am inspired and work hard whatever it is that you need for Prosperity write that down then take some herbs flowers seeds anything natural that corresponds to your goal the green-eyed make a little green paper right right dollar signs on paper for abundance maybe I put mint calendula maybe some basil and for the seed sunflower seeds are great for attracting success and poppy seeds are also good for that carrot seeds are really good for grounding and for supporting long-term goals so you can put some of those seeds in the shell pick up a whole are you putting in this thing you're thinking of the teeny tiny holes that are put into eggshells by Crafters we're putting a teeny tiny hole on one end and a kind of bigger hole on the other  so not too big but big enough to put things in this is intended to be a jar and so it doesn't matter if one hole is a little bit bigger we're going to cap it later anyway so grind up your herbs roll up the paper real small and tight and put it in that little hole and just drop in one or two seat so trust me they'll fit everything in your shell you can steal both holes with wax or you don't have to if you don't want to hold it in your hands and push your intention for Success think of all the things that you have gained all the success that you have think of it as an if you have it right now and push it all into that egg and put the egg on your alter and let it sit there for a couple days and every time you see it think of abundance think of success think of money and prosperity and all those things coming to get your teacher I have a Twist can I tell you a Twist I would love to hear twist go for it okay you're going to hate me because it's it's it's mixed in that damn Easter thing so okay  like I said crap after we had to blow a eggs and the reason we would do that and what would be a perfect thing for this is so I follow you up until you seal your egg okay so you seal it with wax on both ends and then what I would do is a kid and what my mother would have us do is we would take a white crayon and we would draw things on the egg now obviously can't see it cuz it's in white cran so you can put your sigils any symbols or whatever but then what we would do Flipping it back to Easter is done we would dip them in and done anything that I wrote in with the white crayon came out as white and didn't get done that way not only can you put all of your things inside the egg but you can put sigils on the outside as well and you can do that either before you put the things in it just let it dry first or after  you don't have to color it I just had to add that inks I love colored eggs I think you have to now it fits perfectly for adding that in there so you have to so after you leave your beautifully decorated inside and out egg on your altar for a little while three days is traditional but 9 days 5 days whatever works for you when you're ready to release the power of that spell take the egg concentrate on your goals and concentrate on that energy and then take it to an outdoor space someplace that's okay for a little bit of organic litter maybe your backyard something like that and then concentrate really hard pull all that energy up from the ground from the universe from the sky and push it into that egg you're going to throw the egg and as you pull your arm back almost thinking it like you're pulling back the string of a bow like a card draw that energy back with the egg in your hand and then throw it as hard as you can. It's somebody not if somebody  not if somebody not even if it's to get the fuck away from me spell preferably don't throw two people but throw it like at a tree or in the ground or in a rock as you let it leave your hand let the kinetic energy of your body add to the magical energy that you're pushing into it and feel that energy push the egg out of your hand and then as it smashes against whatever you've thrown it again that releases all the spelling ingredients all the energy that you have pushed into it from the time you created it until you filled it with all that energy and through it and now releases it out to the universe for your spell to do its work make sure everything in it is organic and biodegradable and then go ahead and throw that shit absolutely die I think that's fantastic you know sometimes crafts are made to break when I make cakes and I would make a labret amazing cakes and people be like it's too pretty to eat know the point is to eat it  stop Chop Chop that's right in this case the point is to fill it with things and decorate it and the point is to break it so that I can work I love that so eggs are great as a container jar for spells but in this particular case it's designed only to be held for a short period of time while it absorbs energy and then to be shattered to release that energy to do its work sometimes using an actual physical representation of energy in this case kinetic Force physical energy of a throw that's energy that can be useful in a spell so that can help you visualize the energy because you're actually doing physical energy to add to the spell work so that I can help sometimes if you're not able to maybe feel psychic energy or magical energy as well as you are literally putting it out there literally throwing it with kinetic energy of your body hurling it through space on its own it magically flies by itself so that's how is right there you can even if you want to I know some people like to after a spell  is Donnie like to see how their candles burnt or how their incense burned in and kind of do Conjuring or do divination from that so once the spell has shattered you can go and see what kind of patterns is broken into like a Tea Leaf reading if you want to and you can do a little divination from that and give you an idea of the direction to spell might be going in if you throw really far and hard can't do that that's just like a bird hatching like I love to watch The Big Bear bald eagles live in California I watch them on YouTube two little babies you literally made me watch that when I was at your house not too long ago and this year they have two little chicks who little baby eaglets but just like a a bird hatches from an egg that's that kinetic energy that potential energy new life is springing from this shattering egg that's the same as your spell this this new beginnings this new life comes from this breaking of the egg  so there you go there's a spouse now we've got a spell that you can do for a star as well or for your Springtime well after this chat I don't feel so bad that I wasn't in the groove of a restaurant in March I hope others feel the same that even if you're not feeling it on the calendar date that doesn't mean I'll let you know I was busy or not feeling well or had other plans or wasn't into it on March 21st I guess I just am not going to celebrate it absolutely not do that and even if it's something as simple as doing a craft or lighting a candle and saying thank you for the season if you're repotting your houseplants it's okay to just acknowledge the season add a little bit of extra energy to something you're already doing and call it that's all right you're still awake you're still honoring the season you're still working magic it doesn't always have to be elaborate small acts of magic are sometimes the most powerful and it might my last part  Scott is 12 our listeners please add my plants to your prayer list I'm going to give it my best effort but they're going to need all the love and support you can give them I think they're going to be great you've done really well all things considered your cats being plant murderers hey I've still kept that sings someone to live life been like 6 months so I think if you kept those two alive I think you're ready for these I think he got this show I have faith in you.
