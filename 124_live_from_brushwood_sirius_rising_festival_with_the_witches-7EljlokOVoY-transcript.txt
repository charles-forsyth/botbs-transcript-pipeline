back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick today we have something interesting in special for you we are going to take a break from our regularly scheduled programming and Layla and I are going to give you an update from the Brushwood folklore Center and happy Festival moon today I Michelle and I'm Layla and I am really happy to be at the festival I mean it it's hot but we're still having a really good time and she'll and I did some amazing workshops here we're going to talk about that we're going to talk about everything that's going on here and had to give you a little bit of a preview of what festival life is like with tell us for a minute where is Brushwood folklore Center Brushwood is wonderful it was 110 acres I believe of gorgeous face is in Sherman New York which is way on the western edge of the state right near Lake Erie literally on the New York State  a lot of Rochester Buffalo and Syracuse represented so hey we do there's still some listeners here so high guys hi Julie and I mean it's just amazing tonight is the earth ritual during serious Rising everyday represents a different element starting with Monday with air Tuesday is fire Wednesday water Thursday is Earth and then Friday is Spirit Saturday is the combination with the big huge tree story tall on fire do you get a radio show  and we did okay so Brushwood radio 90.3 FM has been going for quite a long time and it has morphed now from just a local radio station that you can pick up if you're on site to they have it online this year's the first year that they're recording the show so that they can replay them online throughout the year I've been doing radio shows for a little while now and she'll and I got to do one this year this is my first time do you want me to tell you that you are so good at that soundboard by the way Frank gives me a little bit of help every year but yeah I'm starting to pick it up it's a lot of fun so shout out to Frank from Brushwood thank you so much for letting me have my first DJ experience but unfortunately is some of our listeners who tuned in know I had a workshop halfway through our radio show ya scheduling was not the best it happened sometime so I stayed behind and continue the playlist that we collaborated on which I have posted  couple places I think I put it on Reddit and we will be putting up on some of the other socials as well if you want to listen but yeah you had to duck out for a workshop what was your first Workshop so my first Workshop I did what was herbal Turtleman say so this was a a fun little thing that you and I fell across literally a year or two back to space space where we mix herb throwing with terros so it was a great Workshop it was nice it was a great day a lot of people had mind-blowing experiences which I always loved but then I missed the second half of the radio show shop so talk to me about your Workshop was on charm casting with everyday objects and we've done is show before and I linked it in the in the show notes about charm casting this is basically the same premise and we went into the his  if I'm passing and what different charms mean and how to do a layout but this was specifically about random objects asking a question and grabbing a few random objects the call to you in the moment to then cast for your meeting so it's just a Twist on the classic herbs to integrate into a little more pre-planning involved but I think the most fun part of your Workshop was the things that people were picking on the Fly for doing their charm casting someone was picking Plantation leaves someone brought a harmonica I mean it was just interesting the things that people were using his charms yeah I really love him some people use their jewelry at there was one I did the workshop a second time and there was one person hear their name is Gage and they wanted a few extra charm so they're try  chipolo ring off and the rain just was stuck and didn't seem to want to come off and gauge says 0 g maybe this rain doesn't want to be in the rating and I kind of laughed and moved on to help some other people and I came back and Gage had thrown the charms down including the rings that they've had trouble getting off but that ring landed so far outside of the board I want to participate yeah we were like yeah I really told you in the beginning you knew it didn't want to participate and you tried it anyway and it said it again and I don't want to be in the street so it was a lot of fun we had a great time inch worm participate in my workshop we did a reading we through the Arabs and an interpreted the herbal meanings based on the cards they landed on in such and then a little inchworm wanted to participate so we we had a little fun with which cards The Inchworm was going to and kind of put a little bit of twist into our reading as far as that way you know what does it mean  The Inchworm went to the sky on this card so it was a lot of fun I like doing outdoor stuff because little weird twist get added that you don't really expect that's one of the joys of brush when is you are mostly Outdoors again I think it's like a hundred and ten acres and had to check their website Brushwood.com to be sure but there are buildings there's a lot of feelings or like the pool house there's the North Pavilion there's a stage in those cabins that you can rent but a lot of it is open and so you get a variety of covered areas where you can have workshops or like she'll your your workshops were over in What's called the East Shire which is a nice big field it's over it has summer seasonal campers and some rental cabins do my workshops is called the storytellers Pavilion and that is right near the radio station and it's some it's more of a like a picnic Pavilion like a picnic Pavilion basically like the cover the tents that you use  show me like permanent made out of wood it's a nice spot this one has electric so you know I tend to do my notes on my laptop so it's nice that I can plug it in if I need to show is fabulously known for note card that's right index cards I love them and I make slideshows but I do also write it in my yeah it's true but I do love journaling especially here doing my schedule is everyday and Terrell journaling about all of it there's just so much stuff and I absolutely adore looking back through old journal entries from you know a year ago or two years ago or five years ago from when I was here and kind of looking at all of it again in and seeing what things kind of changed or don't change or don't change like The Roundhouse in the drumming which is absolutely fabulous every single night  tell me is there a ritual to each element but after the ritual they go to let me backup every element has their own space at Brushwood and they have their own small fire Circle they are dedicated to that elements do each ritual has held there but then there's the roundhouse which is the oldest sight of all of them and it is also the biggest and that's where the drumming happens and the main fire every night whether it's fire ritual or not and fire tribe of Brushwood is is part of the fire safety fire building they're not just the elemental tribe they also take care of everything fire-related fire Spinners at the Brushwood exactly yes they are and somehow as soon as you become part of fire tribe you get sexy and hot as hell I'm not  yeah I don't know if I'm qualified but I'll work on that will develop we would but it's a lot of work in the hot sun like they're slinging chainsaws and big huge trees and log building these fires are everything I've ever seen in my life so with great hotness comes great responsibility is that just the way the world but after each ritual no matter what element is everybody goes back to the fire Circle and there's a big bonfire there there's tons of drumming and dancing and there's what's called first shift second shift and 3rd Shift so first shift is in the morning or morning first shift is about 10 at night right after Sunset and that's the fire-lighting a thoroughly Birds early bird that the family is the kids everybody's just a little drama and everything's nice then there's usually a lot right around midnight and outcomes second shift this is  rum and gets faster the dancing gets Wilder The Outfits get more amazing and you know there's usually some adult beverages and things going around maybe I might have a kid now never know they should all be in bed by now curfew thank you then comes third shift right around 3 a.m. or so and third shift will go to Don and you fall asleep every night if you go to sleep to drumming a fresh Whip and it's an idealist you know there's nothing like that first night I went out at like I don't even know what time I woke up I had to have a cigarette you know how it goes was like 4:30 in the morning and I'm like there's still drama the drumming time is third shift is really going they just gone wild on those drums and it does not slow down at all  and I mean I know we've done an episode or two or maybe three and talked about festivals in the past but you know I do want to reiterate from those episodes there's something to be said for attend at least once in your life go somewhere you do get with a group of like-minded folks especially if that's not what you normally are able to do you know and yes these opportunities are more plentiful in the summer but maybe think about going to a festival next summer or or getting out and doing something with a grander community get out of your shell and go meet other like-minded folks it's fine you know it's worthwhile and I know people live in areas where they don't exactly have these opportunities and I will put a link to a mandragora Magicka which is kind of a new which box and that has links to all sorts of places but it's not complete I had to add serious rising and Sankofa for Brushwood to that and they've been going for  ever so if you know of something in your area put it on mandragora Magica but definitely check there if you're looking for events or groups in your area plus the other wonderful things about Festival is meeting people meeting people that have all sorts of different ideas and Views and things to teach the workshops here are fantastic they are and it gives you an opportunity to maybe get a little bit of a taste a little bit of flavor of something that maybe you weren't exposed to previously or something that you never even heard of before so things like festivals like this really do give you an opportunity to come to expand your practice because you gain different knowledge and experiences it surprised me a couple years ago how many people from Rochester where I was living at the time came here you didn't know any of them when you lived there which I was trying to find them and I couldn't find them anywhere Rochester I had to come all the way to  I'm in New York to find them you know it's it's I guess a lot of people are still a little bit in the broom closet so hopefully things like this can help people get out more meet each other more because you have not been good for a little while and I loved having you here so that you could reintroduce yourself to people I could see people when you go up to their faces we like I know I know you and then Ryan everyone be all happy and meeting new people and being able to connect replace the networking exactly exactly and I cannot tell you how many pop-up wonderful things are happening they have music every night like boom boom shake will be playing we had riverglen we had Brian hanky that they just have so many people Frenchy and the punk is going to play it's just a lot of fun. There's so many things going on for everybody to have a kids village where they have kids programming and crafts and things for kids to do as well  the place to play there is no supervision you have to supervise your children yourself they must be supervised at all times but sounds like it's a family inclusive event we do all of these things here there's vendors I know you might have gotten a thing or two would I you know what I got to say though and I think every listener is going to be proud of me I want y'all to be proud of shall here for a moment because I did not I repeat I did not buy a Tarot deck you didn't I am I am her witness she did not buy a single tear duct not one not two not many none 0.0 you won't talk about other things like your dirty clothes what tell me one wonderful beautiful thing that you got one wonderful beautiful thing I've got is actually not closed it was a wood-burning of a goddess figured that was the most amazing I don't know if I want to  a picture of burning wood a Michelle Mitchell is an artist here I have some of her are as well on paper I don't have a wood-burning my guy I'm looking at some cuz my going to she's great but yeah that is a gorgeous piece I remember we went to the art show and you went outside and I came out and you're like guess which thing I want to go and I knew exactly which one it was dead and I couldn't even believe it was the one I wanted so I knew that was it was perfect I wasn't going to buy it there so I was really glad that you did because one of us needed that one of us but there are a lot of vendors hear some very creative people and you know that's another thing that you can do is you know support artist support take an artist here so that wasn't the only Workshop that you did now you did one that was a little more serious you want Elsa like did I did I did I didn't do a workshop that  slow deep and it was more to inspire conversation and it was called appropriation vs. appreciation walking the witches line and you know the whole appropriation thing has gone in and out of the news for the last several years and I wanted to kind of open a discussion for people because I think there's a lot of accusations of appropriation out there that aren't necessarily accurate I think it's just sometimes an easy word to throw around but in the same respect there's also that balance of there's a lot of appropriation out there that needs to stop using there is and so you know it was it was not so much a lecture but to open dialogue about appropriation for depreciation what can we do to appreciate that doesn't appropriate or come across this appropriation we had great discussions a lot of the participants had a lot of valuable stuff to say  I think that sometimes having conversations in person with a group of people is the best way to kind of get some ideas going forward and get the greater the greater Consciousness kind of come together you know I just think that it is helpful for people to have dialogue would maybe you are a solitary you are from you know you don't have a community around you or group around you and you know what it doesn't hurt to get together again with some like-minded folks and have some creative conversations yeah and that's another thing that these festivals are absolutely wonderful for us to get people from different backgrounds and get them together and talk about all sorts of things and from for appropriation and versus appreciation all the way to Diana PacSun is here giving a talk everyday on different Norse gods I mean there's a little bit of everything here you can go to Beth and Zeeb who do the the clay have Clay workshops every day making fairy  dry eyes I mean there's a little bit of everything for everybody here no speaking of fun stuff a little for everybody Layla what was your next Workshop my neck starts off as a lot of fun we got to play with chalk talk with you I'm like I love but this one I really love Labyrinth so I did a workshop on how to create labyrinths and we talked a lot about why they were good what they can do for you in your practice and and then we got into how to create a simple Labyrinth because they look very complicated but I found a very simple way to create a labyrinth and I didn't believe feel because I am like the most non artistic person on the planet and you kept telling me this is easy and I'm like no it's not no it's not I who can make a Lab Rats besides Layla now yes you can and so can everybody that came to the workshop we had a great time so I started everyone with the Labyrinth on paper and show them how to draw and basically it's like  connecting the dots I will try to do a short video and we'll put it up on social media so you guys can see how to do it it's that simple but we had everyone do it on paper and once they got it they're removed everything off the floor and Drew it in chalk and then we use cornmeal where it went off into the grass to make the lines and cornmeal and we actually made a labyrinth I would say maybe fifteen feet across and all directions that's actually pretty darn good gas because it was roughly about the pants were about a foot across and was a seventh circuit Labyrinth so yeah I think you nailed it shows about 15 ft yeah but it's not that hard and I will do a video so that was a lot of fun to be able to show people how to do that especially because one of the elemental shrines here is the spirit Shrine and that's taken care of by a group called The Archers each Elemental Shrine each area has a a different group that's basically in charge of maintaining and doing the ritual for the festival and so the archers are  charge of the spirit Shrine and not only do they mow and take care of this giant Labyrinth every year which is stunning by the way they also have in the past built dragons they've built a large dragon puppets that were built to burn we have some pictures of us in front of the very first wireframe of the Dragon the Dragon Shrine so we'll be putting up a lot of pictures from our time here so if you folks have any questions about festivals questions about brush would shoot us an email I'm sending a message because this is truly one of Layla and Ice most favorite places on the planet and we'd love to give you more information about it and talk you into going next year she'll
