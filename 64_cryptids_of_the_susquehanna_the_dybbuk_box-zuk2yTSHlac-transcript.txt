it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 64 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast to best friends from way back get together to tell each other's spooky paranormal Tales from across the US of a all while smoking copious amounts of the finest cannabis they can get their witchy little hands on telling you a spooky story of A Haunted object I'm Lea and I'm just like flabbergasted that we're on episode 64 and I'm shell and I'm just like what right me too I cannot believe that we have gotten this far I'm super impressed with us go us and uh all these scary stories I have a backlog of stories I'm constantly finding Spooky Spooky things and getting scent spooky things from our listeners thank you by the way keep them coming now I would just like to point out that after after 64 episodes you know you think you know a lot about the country you think you know a lot about ghosts this is kind of opened my eyes to how haunted America really is coast to coast you know north to south east to west you kind of always think that like Europe is really haunted because it's old older no I've learned a lot about America I've learned a lot about just events and cities and places and people it's been great it has been great and it's really funny that you mentioned that because one of the things I wanted to chat about today was the most haunted states in America o I read an article recently published back in 2021 and it said as of that time there were 62,400 Nationwide all right so you need to tell me can I do you have a list because I want to I want to guess the top three yes I do have a list I can God oh my God okay let me guess let me guess okay go ahead so I'm gonna say and part of this it's not just because of where I live it's because of the age and how long and blah blah blah so I'm gonna go with Massachusetts I'm gonna go with Connecticut and I'm gonna go with New York you're wrong what on all of them Savannah Georgia some place where there was gold mines out west okay you tell me actually the most haunted State drum roll Texas Texas Texas really really followed very quickly by California what see I don't buy that I don't buy it California no no no and it's funny the two of those States blow all the other states away Far and Away Texas as of 2021 had about 7,100 reportings and California had a little over 6,500 how could California beat Gettysburg right the next highest state is Ohio what with 2776 so a big big difference all right I'm gonna have to start investigating Ohio I need to find out what the deal is with Ohio right you mentioned Massachusetts and they're kind of in the middle bottom of the pack with about 1,00 sightings Michigan is higher with 20 600 sightings no [ __ ] no [ __ ] let's see Georgia which I would consider an extremely haunted state has about 1,700 sightings wow right little strange just because I'm a weirdo does Hawaii rank on there uh let's see so this list that I have here is recorded sighting since 1972 they say that Delaware has the lowest number of sightings because it's so small followed quickly by Hawaii Wyoming Vermont and Alaska all of them with around 200 give or take I would have thought with uh the old Hawaiian culture P that whole deal that Hawaii would have had some rage in number you'd think but you know I guess I'm not surprised every other thing I find is in Texas I swear Texas siiz ghost stories I'm no I'm on a binge now I'm actually going to write this down Ohio you have place number three I know we have listeners from Ohio you first of all email Ila and tell ilila because she checks email more you tell Ila you're Ohio ghost stories because I am down and I'm gonna write this down because what has made Ohio number three I gotta know we gotta know there's too much there so yeah that I thought that was a pretty interesting list I have loved going all over the US and my story actually you kind of sparked it last episode I talked about the ghostly ball that people would see going down the hallway from playing with it was it you or I that said that I don't even remember we were high but I remember us talking about it we were talking about whether objects could have could be haunted yeah yeah yeah okay I remember yeah whether an object could be haunted or whether it was just really a part of a like a ghostly sting a replay partly replay yeah yeah exactly and so I kind of started looking into that for today's episode and I found a haunted object that I want to talk about that is actually currently owned by none other than Zack baggin no [ __ ] bans is it beIN I always call him Zack baggin if we're wrong dude please email us contact us but if if you are listening and we did pronounce it wrong please go back to previous episodes where we thoroughly discuss how I never pronounce anybody's name right so here we are that's very true so yes it's currently owned by our friend Zach no no no no before we delve before we delve yes if I got something for you oh I'm excited what have you got today sh so remember how I've been on to this new store yes mission on a mission to get to mission I was like oh time to go to Mission so I go I'm looking at the menu and usually the way the menu goes is it's like like as far as pricing you'll have like what what do you call it I always call it a flavor what is it a cult bar or stra strain we'll go with strain easier to say so you'll have a strain and then it'll have the prices it'll be like an eighth a quarter a half and an ounce so I'm scrolling and I just I see this one and it only had the pricing for an ounce which we'll get into the pricing in a minute because that's also part of this okay so I saw that it was only an ounce and I was like oh well I'll get that now you want to know why I got that why because it was freaking $151 now remember I told you last time I had the two 10% off coupons yes so after tax I paid 148 for an ounce which if you're in Massachusetts that is unheard of I know our listeners our listeners can't see this and I do apologize but um one package whoa one package now usually if I get an ounce big jar usually if I get an ounce I get eight8 right and we always [ __ ] about packaging and how I'm like what the hell are you giving me all these so I'm holding up a normal eighth container and then it's big brother and it's big brother which funny says small badge this is GMO it is 29.75 THC so I got 29.75 th see whole ounce 148 what that is amazing nice price right there how is it is it does it look good does it taste good how's it smell how's it smoke it smokes really good it's one of those brand one of those flavors that's kind of like how do I describe it I don't want to say grassy because it's not grassy I don't want to say weedy because it's not weedy but it has that like plant-based taste okay yeah it's got that kind of green kind kind of taste you know I know what you mean when you say kind of grassy I like that taste here's a problem with this weed I'm going to explain to you a big problem I had with it smoking it last night okay so I'm smoking I'm up late because you know it was a weekend I had the day off it's about one in the morning and I had smoked a bunch okay all of a sudden I had no choice like I had no choice my mind had no option in this scenario I had to have a KF C mashed potato bowl so here I am at4 to 2 in the morning eating freaking Kentucky fried chicken mashed potatoes and gravy um popcorn chicken and then I had a freaking what do you call it a ho ho you know those chocolate cakes filled with icing freaking two o'clock in the morning and I am stuck in my damn face you know it's good weed when it dictates the munchies then I start eating my sparkly wild berry pea and then I think to myself I'm like it's 2 in the morning and I'm eating peeps man I need to go to bed so like it's good but like you just start wanting to plow you want KFC you want peeps like it's bad that sounds good to me that sounds like you got some good weed yeah well you're not sitting there eating a freaking KFC chicken bowl at 2 amm either that's true I did not have to deal with the belly that you had to deal with later that day Downing KFC and sparkly peeps in the same sitting put it this way when I woke up today I was like man a I don't want to eat a thing in PE why did I do I'm too old to eat that [ __ ] at that time of day you're picking up past you and slapping her across the face be smarter next time that's worse than a whiskey hangover I think Uber Eats has been very damaging to all the Stoners out there because now when you're too lazy to go get that KFC Cate in the middle of the night just bring it to you yeah we're doomed we're doomed sh there's nothing we can do about it so it's really good and I really like it and it was really cheap but the only way you can effectively smoke it is if you got some peeps and KFC on the ready absolutely well I wish you were here oh you're gonna kill me because I had a lot of fun at the Lilac Craft Market I'm just G to cry you are going to cry it was at this beautiful old brick building with all these wooden floors it looked so cool inside it was awesome and as we walked in there was nothing but weed vendors hom Growers and Farmers as far as the eye could see now I got a question for you because you texted me this while you were doing this and I'm sitting here crying reading your damn text I remember responding to you saying they don't have those around here and then it dawned on me how did you find out about this how are they advertising this because maybe they are around here in Mass ches and I just don't know it I highly recommend that you hook up with your local Reddit board I know you've all heard me talk about Reddit and subreddits before and also Instagram those are two of my favorite ways to find local people wherever I go as you all know I'm quite nomatic and I tend to not stay in one place for too terribly long and so finding new plugs can be a little difficult you know you don't always want to go to the most expensive shop right down on the main strip right like I do plus I like to hook up with other local Growers I want to trade some of mine for some of theirs and you're not going to get the same quality in a store we've often talked about my distaste for stale West Coast weed on the East Coast right you get that in the stores a lot so I like to find local Growers and Farmers so you can find the really good good you know the kind crystally sticky icky that we adore yeah they had that here in Spades I loved it there was so vendors I got to meet a local Superstar a woman who has a business called cookie smack what makes a superstar let's just start there why is she a superstar on the subreddit for the local city that I'm currently staying in I I look for a few code words obviously you can look for cannabis marijuana smokers but sometimes people kind of keep it on the down low and one thing you can look for is ANS e n TS because the ants are the tree people in the lord of the Rings books and movies and so an ENT is someone who smokes cannabis so I was able to find the specific City ENT board and there you hear a lot about some of the local farmers and crafters and cookie smack was well known for her delicious cookies that would smack you upside the head with their THC potency so I was very happy to meet her and her lovely husband fabulous people super nice oh my gosh so sweet un fortunately I embarrassed her a little bit because I asked her to be on the podcast and although she's very social at events I think she's a lot like me and it's not as maybe comfortable being social as we might first appear but I am so sorry you guys are wonderful love your product fantastic weed fantastic cookies so yeah cookie smack and I found out about her and this event on the local subredit I'm writing this down I put Salem ANS for weed farmers market so you can and find some local things there check out your local Instagram signal if you're on Signal you can check it there and and and your local subreddit but anyway so I found them advertised there went to this wonderful event they had a local musician comedian there uh we saw some fabulous local Crafters that make the cutest little stash jars ashtrays anything you could want and tons and tons of locally grown cannabis now I of course had to pass by the Frat Boys with their cute little lit up Amazon jars full of beautiful weed no offense Frat Boys it was gorgeous weed but right next to them was a nerdy looking dude and his adorable nerdy looking girlfriend and their whole table was filled with weed jars and Dungeons and Dragons books those are your people your so I had to apologize I walked right by the Fret boys they're like hey we have weed too and I'm like yeah but he's got D and D I was gonna say but but he's got DND d man yeah oh yeah the marketing totally sucked me in oh my God it looks like a dye it is it's a D20 it's a 20-sided dye and it says D20 groco and that's their name and it's got like a a sword going through that just the greatest people and they grow some amazing weed they had some Tahoe OG some white rhino oh my God I haven't had white rhino in like a couple years in addition to those he also had something I have never heard of before a cavar called Orange milon delicious sativa dominant high THC but the flavor shell oh my good Gideon you know that I am such a sucker for a taste flavor yeah I am a sucker for a good flavor and this had the most delightful literally tasted like a grapefruit Citrus flavor so so good it's almost gone and I am super sad oh I have a little left but tiny bit purple beautiful color light green color very crystally very well grown nice nugs from a local grower Bravo love it and The Taste was delicious so we apparently both have great weed today I do I'm smoking some of this right now and oh my goodness the flavor is off the hook I cannot wait to get in touch with these guys again and tell them how amazing their weed is maybe share some tips swap some clones because I need need to grow this in my garden it's fantastic and you're such a good grower thank you so much I'm so happy to be going back to photo period I I do love the ease and convenience of autof flowers but photo period all the way but as much as we could just go on and on and have a whole podcast about weed truly yeah don't out of tangent you know how sometimes when you're smoking you get really kind of woo and then you start looking stuff up on the Internet oh yeah I totally do I was looking for haunted objects I got super high and went down amazing rabbit holes but what happened to you I did the same thing I wanted to do a story in a certain area so I was like I I searched that area and I found a place and I was like oh wow this is really cool you know I'll talk about this this week all the listeners will love it so I start researching it I see a link on a story and I click on it well that's where I just did a left turn I have ditched my original story so it's one of those things you went down a rabbit hole and then you got sidetracked by something by something more interesting put it this way me while I cough a lung up this will explain everything to you in one sentence I started investigating a a haunted location and found a freaking and plethora AC Cryptids oh my crypted queen stumbled upon some Cryptids Color Me surprised so as you can imagine guess what went to the Wayside The Haun place and you followed the crypted trail of course you did this also you know it has kind of a a tie into you know what we know and love my bery land and your transplanted land we're going to talk about some places along the Susana River you know I was I was born in a town along the sus gu Hannah I said to my I said also a Coal Miner's Daughter oh I'm not I'm not I'm not I swear to God but I I did say to my boyfriend today I said you know how you can tell if someone's from upstate New York and he goes how no although this would go for Pennsylvania too he goes how I go because I can spell susqu Hanah yeah and I don't even have to look it up you so I was looking at this place that happened to be on the Susana and it led me to find that the whole susqu freaking river is like rif with crypted activity really except for the town except for the town where we're from are you kidding of course that's why we never heard of it I just happen to move to the town that has zero Cryptids zero but every other stretch of the damn sasana now this is an interesting history lesson too that I'd like to point out to you apparently I found and and you know [ __ ] me not this is on Wikipedia um the Susana River is one of the oldest existing rivers in the world it is older than the mountain ridges through which it flows really hell yeah who this river goes from right around Cooper toown you know where Cooper town is right yeah so it goes from right around Cooper town all the way to the Chesapeake Bay it's like 480 miles long I mean we just think of it as the river in our town yeah it's just right there this appar is like 485 miles long and it is like one of the oldest existing Rivers who knew I had no idea that fact that it's one of the oldest existing Rivers first of all explains all the Cryptids but I had no idea never heard either NE neither did I but I you know I was like holy crap how can you live next to this River your whole life and not know that not know here we are folks so just a now like I said none of them are from our area of course that's the luck but there's a couple uh because like I said more than one one of them is called The Kettle Creek monster or they call it the West Branch Duong or they call it the Susan seal oh okay I love this interesting it is said to lurk in the waters near Lock Haven in Clinton County which is in Pennsyvania and basically this creature dates back over a century there's an article from The Daily Democrat dated February 27th of 1887 that describes this freaking creature going up and down and like eating people on the Riverbanks it said it had the bulk of an ax or a hippopotamus but obviously we know that Hipp they don't live in the S Guana right nor are they native to America no I mean we just don't have hippos lying around it was described as the monster was not the form or image of anything else on Earth so it's something they've never seen before now in 1897 obviously there was a different perspective but they pretty much knew all major big animals and they said it make a horrible howling noise and it would be like thrashing at night and it would capsize Lumber rafts because that was a big Transportation River that's creepy and because there was a lot of Transportation going on it you know they would be traveling goods and this thing would like sink sink boats apparently wow can you imagine going down the river and then like some unknown creature capsizes your raft I'd be so scared weirdly enough it says that reports of the creature became less and less frequent in the early 1900s many believed it died or escaped to the ocean through underground Caverns are there underground Caverns that connect the sasana to the ocean well it takes you to the Chesapeake Bay that connects it to the ocean so yeah basically oh wow well I know that senica lake has underground they don't know how deep senica lake is because of the underground caves that connect it to some of the other Lakes but I didn't know there was some in the Susana too apparently that's wild so then there's called the mystery thing Susan's mystery thing this one is from North umberland County this is another one that is said to lurk in the waters near the river's Confluence seen as recently as the 2000s it's basically like this um I don't even know how they described it almost like a a small submarine about to surface wow that big but like that shape too so in the early 2000s there was an outdoor guide named Ken marer again I might be saying his name wrong he had seen the creature described it as a small submarine about to surface he says it pushed a wake that made waves that lapped up on the Shoreline then it sank out of sight and over the next year or two he saw it several times and it would always sink out of sight before this guy would get close enough to kind of see it clearly it was absolutely impossible to be a fish impossible to be an eel it was basically described kind of like as big as a small boat all I could think of is lochest Monster without the long neck yeah it sounds like like a fat short Lochness Monster what another one and again you know how am with pronunciation I think it's called the squank squank in northern PA in the hemlock Forest they call it a sad mythical creature with a pig-like saggy skin covered in warts and blemishes does sound sad I would be sad no but it spends much of his life weeping oh even sadder It generally hides in the Hemlock Woods but it does go into the river and they actually caught one in a lumber yard oh [ __ ] yeah what did they do with it it escaped oh and they don't know how so it's like a crying warty thing yeah it look human no it looks like kind of a pig-like creature but it goes in and out of the water weird then in Northbend Clinton County they have What's called the swamp angel that I don't know when I think Angels I'm thinking these beautiful winged creatures pretty Angelic swamp Angel does this one also look like a pig no according to Legend Escape slaves captured a Native American Brave and Maiden they killed the man the women the woman was able to flee but being stricken by grief she drowned herself in quicksand a and so basically the swamp Angel is this Native American maiden and her spirit would help you if you went to the swamp and asked so like if you had I don't want to say a wish per se but a wish um you could go to the swamp and ask her and she would appear over the swamp you'll love this you'll love this more than anything she would appear as a glowing orb it's like a lady in white and an orb story all in one all in one I love this you'll have to go to Northbend in Clinton County oh it's on my list right now we are going now the most famous account of the Swan Angel originated with a man named Isaac gains he was kind of like one of those witch SL Monster Hunters during his time and he is said to call upon the aid of the swamp Angel to break a Witch's Curse I don't know that sounds hypocritical to me but whatever yeah but you know what how he summoned her oh he burned Foxfire remember Foxfire different podcast so the rumor in that area is the next time you find yourself in a pickle make your way along the West Branch section and ask the swamp Angel to help you wow and maybe she'll help you out that's pretty wild are there any accounts of anyone who asked her for help and she she gave she gave them help well this guy Isaac yeah well I meant anyone else like does no no not that I could find anyway wow that sounds really cool a lady in white that shows up as an orb and I'm counting her as a lady in white because her story means the whole thing you know it's a tragic love story where she commits suicide and now haunts the area fits the Trope Clinton County part of Susana River must be a hot spot and you know how I love these damn crypted names that are crazy these are all awesome the next one it's called a g waggle oh a GW I still like squonk okay squonk is awesome but G waggle is right up there G waggle and squonk are like my new best friends now the G waggle holds the title of the official monster of Clinton County oh so there's several unofficial is that what they're implying well I guess the squank is like number two and this is number one okay now this is described mostly As a mish mash of animals it was called upon by local witches to wreak havoc and Mayhem on farmers who offended him okay I can see that I can see that described to be about six feet tall shaped like a wolf but stood on its back legs and instead of front paws it had bird Claws and instead of back feet it had horse hooves that sounds terrible so body of a wolf front claws of a bird back claws of a horse Okay this sounds like one very confused animal why would witches do that it doesn't sound like a witch thing I don't know okay anyway I don't know so what did the wolf what did the wolf horse bird thing do nothing really oh just ran around terrorizing people yeah it just freaked people out and wanted to be left alone okay all right now another another thing in Clinton County like I said I think Clinton county is a hot spot they have what they also call the water witch oh okay maybe she made the horse wolf bird thing she is said to have power over the wind and weather often appearing to Sailors like apparently she's like deep in history there was a guy named Henry Shoemaker who did a a book called The ssoh Han Legends in his book he wrote about the old Mountaineers saying that the water witch was an Indian girl who suddenly changed her mind towards her lover and having influence with the gods the deserted made her into unchanging water and in her helpless State she mocks Petty aspirations of mankind so she's kind of a mocker but she kind of like brings people to a dream like dreamlike Destiny they say is she trying to lead people to their deaths or do she just trying to like give them dreams there's people that have disappeared that they've never found let's just put it that way but there's other people that had like epiphanies with her oh wow okay so one those that could go either way kind of hauntings it says basically if you journey to go find the water which think twice you may not get the fortune you hoped for I feel like it's a be careful what you wish for you just might get it yeah or word your wishes carefully because they will give you your wishes based on your wording not your intention I gotcha you know like a troll you always should be careful with wishes anytime you and a supernatural being of any stripe are making a deal be very very careful with your words there's also called a elbow witch Elber witch this is from Columbia Lancaster County there's more they have a it's called a no no this I can't even I can't even with this one they call it a Mini Apple munching Sasquatch what is does it Munch mini apples or is the Sasquatch mini both that sounds adorable I want one can I have one as a friend I'll make him a little house in my backyard it's described as a four foot tall hairy eight man who's fond of apples that sounds great it he's thought to drive from Pennsylvania Dutch which is even funnier that's like your uncle they used to call him the Apple snitch he'd steal apples from picnic baskets like freaking Yogi Bear oh my goodness so your uncle is like cousin it apparently but likes apples yes I see I see okay they have Native American um like you know how they still have some of the paintings and drawings from the natives yes they have freaking Native American drawings of these damn things he has an indigenous history then so basically you know what we think of as Loki yeah some of these Native American drawings have depicted this in a Loki like State like almost a trickster like a mischievous trickster yeah um so think of like think of like a trickster version a trickster Sasquatch a mini trickster Sasquatch that eats apples how much cuter could you get I mean come on how could you be afraid of this thing yeah like what's there to fear here is it just because he snatches your apples or what yeah basically like no harm no foul unless you got apples with you and then it's like game on I'd be leaving apples out for him I'd be like here's your apples man go ahead leave the rest of my crops alone here's some apples for you but he's been known to torment people with apples oh like throw the apples at people no he will do stuff mischievously to be able to steal them from you if you have not willingly offered oh so it's like a trick-or treat type of situation but with apples and a mini Sasquatch correct that sounds awesome makes me want a freaking go to Lancaster man damn it anybody who's got an Airbnb in the area and some apple trees let us know the stoned Witches Hour gmail.com because all I'm thinking of you know in Star Wars there's those little creatures that are those I'm thinking yeah eating apples me too and getting all silly mad and throwing apples but with that little tricks on people with that Yogi Bear mentality give me your pick AIC basket you know here I am I was going to do this freaking haunted town and I end up reading about baby Ewok on the SS Guana adorable haunted Ewoks I love it that's so cute wow so quite the range there that was my rabbit hole this week you go from a bird clawed horse hoofed wolf to Cousin It stealing your apples I love it that's adorable that's the one I'm gonna remember that that just lets you know the ecosystem diversity along the sasana river and none of this is in Upstate New York mind you that's true that's true they're smart enough not to go into Upstate New York weirdos here thank you that was another thing I noted um so I mentioned in the beginning that the Susana is like 485 miles long and it goes from middle Upstate New York all the way down to Maryland and if you just if you just paid attention here folks which if you're high like me you might have you might not have all the Cryptids are in Pennsylvania just saying interesting that's a lot that's a lot of Cryptid along One River well I'm I'm just pointing out that the river is also in Virginia Maryland and New York and there ain't no cryptids in Virginia Maryland in New York only in the sus only in the Pennsylvania portion of the Susana is the Cryptids so what's up PA right weird what's in the water there why weren't you sharing your cryptids in Upstate New York damn it the taxes are too high they they're not going up there touche touche well you have lots of Cryptids in one area along One River I have one haunted item that's been in lots of states and passed through several hands so is it a doll don't say it's a dollar I'm gonna cry it's not a doll although I almost went there did you do Robert the doll I think we did do Robert the Doll you did Robert the Doll there's also Annabelle the doll which I still go back to Chucky but no no this is a cabinet a wine cabinet a haunted cabinet a haunted cabinet this one has a famous name it's called the diic box now how does a cabinet get haunted well this one's haunted by a Jewish demon called a diic a demon a demon well it's actually a diic is a spirit of a person that was a sinner in life according to Jewish folklore aren't we all aren't we all so this was a person who's an unredeemable unrepentant Sinner and because of what a bad person they are in life they're not allowed to pass on so they have to become a cabinet sort of their soul will then inhabit usually a person I believe the diic box is the only known case of it inhabiting an object although Zach says that there are 10 diic boxes in the world and he has um two of them or 10 maybe haunted boxes so maybe not necessarily diic boxes but a diic is a Jewish demon of a bad person in life usually it attaches itself to a person however in this particular case it was said to inhabit this box and okay so the history of this box starts in 2001 when it's purchased by um a an Antiques owner named Kevin Manis and he's in Portland Oregon going to estate sales and he happens to go to an estate sale of a 103-year-old woman who had been a holocaust Survivor oh geez the estate sale was being put on by her granddaughter and the granddaughter says that the grandmother had lost everyone her her parents her siblings even her first family her first husband and children one of the things that she brought with her when she escaped and came to America was this wine cabinet the granddaughter said that she was absolutely terrified of this box and that her grandmother wouldn't let anyone touch it and said no one was ever to open it because it was possessed by a diic why hell did she bring it to America well she was trying to keep it safe I guess she didn't want it to fall into the wrong hands so the grandmother said that it held a diic and was to never be open after he bought it he offered her to open it right then and there and she was adamant that he not open it and certainly not anywhere where near where she was and she was quite upset about it and then he was like well if this is so important to you maybe you should keep it and she insisted no no you bought it I don't want it to stay here take it away with you you just keep it and asked him to leave and then started crying and walked away from him just I guess really wanted him to take it so he brings it back to his shop his antique shop and he puts it in the basement and he leaves to run errands for the rest of the day and he gets a frantic phone call from his um employee while he's out and she says that it sounds like someone has broken in and is wreaking havoc in the basement she can hear a man's voice swearing and glass breaking and he of course tells her to call 911 and he'll be right there as she's responding to him his phone dies he gets back to the shop to find his employee sitting in the corner sobbing and shaking she just gets up and leaves he finds that the whole shop reeks of cat urine did they have cats no so like the lights were all off he couldn't get the lights to turn on and so he discovered that all of the bulbs were broken in their sockets and in the basement he had 4 foot long you know those incandescent lights right 10 of those four foot long bulbs were on the ground shattered there were no signs of any Intruder in the shop nothing to indicate that someone had come in nothing stolen he didn't associate it with the box at this point and he uh when he spoke to the employee later she just said that she wasn't coming back so all the lights in the shop kept blowing anytime he'd replace a light bulb very quickly it would go bad or would literally explode and this kept happening the entire time he had the divic Box in his possession he did open the box and inside of it okay there's a [ __ ] around and find out moment right inside it he found two wheat pennies a 1925 and a 1928 a lock of blonde hair a lock of very dark brown hair tied together with string a slab of granite that was engraved with the Hebrew word uh LOM which means peace a dried rose a Golden Goblet and a black candlestick holder that had like octopus tentacles made of iron that just gives me a Vibe hearing about it and I haven't even seen it touched it blah now he did not associate the odd occurrence with his employee and and some of the different strange things that had happened at his shop since he got the box at the time he did not associate it with the diic Box what a silly man right a few months later he gave the box to his mother just happened to be on Halloween of that year now I just want to say who I would do this but we all know how I am who gives their mother a demon box besides me well again he thought it was just kind of an old he just thought it was like an antique he really was very skeptical immediately upon receiving the Box she had a stroke oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] what do like what do you do do you take the box back do you give it to Goodwill like what do you do at that point she was not able to speak after this for quite some time but she was able to point to letters and communicate and the very first thing she spelled out was n o g f t no gift then she spelled out hate gift how do you not start seeing coincidence here right so then he decided to give the cabinet to his sister this guy hates his family doesn't he this guy just hates his family right so then um she gave it back after one week she said that the doors on the cabinet would not stay closed and she kept finding it with the doors wide open there's no springs it's just very simple hinges so nothing to indicate why it would spring open or she would find it open all the time and she kept having nightmares so she didn't like it in her house and gave it back he then gave it to his brother and he kept it for three weeks I love this guy and he said that the cabinet itself rre of jasmine flowers and he said his wife said that she could not stop smelling cat piss it's almost like some people smelled the sweet smell and some people didn't smell the they smelled the urin smell and I think it might be either the box was okay with you or it wasn't okay with you maybe that's quite possible um so he tried giving it then to his girlfriend and after two days she gave it back and said sell it he hates everybody in his life oh my God so he decided to sell it at his shop and a nice couple came in and purchased it and three days later when he came to open up the shop in front of the shop with a nice little note on top of it box you know I wonder if it's one of those items that like you know how um sometimes there can be like a haunted item and it it like it's yours like I don't give a [ __ ] what you do it's yours and it keeps coming back like maybe this is somehow destined to be his maybe the note that the couple left on the box said this has a bad Darkness take it back take it back that's he kept it at his house after that and he kept having recurring nightmares where he'd be hanging out with someone that he knew or a loved one or a friend and they would be doing something normal and then that friend would turn into a dark evil demonic looking old woman with like sunken black eyes and that's what you get for giving a demon box to every member of your family literally right and he would smell the intense scent of Jasmine and cat urine anytime people would come to his house they would also have the same type of reaction same type of reactions they would feel sick some people would get physically ill he didn't have any pets but people would report smelling the cat urine so after some family visited and all had nightmares he said he started to see black shadows in his peripheral vision and um other people that would come to the house started seeing the Shadows more and more often as well he put the cabinet in a storage unit outside but the smoke alarm in the unit kept going off in the middle of the night and there' be nothing burning but the unit would wreak of cat urine and so he decided to bring it back in the house and would kept waking up every day at 4:30 a.m. smelling cat urine and feeling like somebody was watching him so he felt like it was getting worse he then decides to sell the box on eBay I love it I love it I love this guy I got a demon box that gave my mom a stroke let me get my ass on eBay I love it he detailed all of this in his eBay post and at the bottom of it he said help me Zack baggin sees this on eBay well no Zack baggin didn't get it there sold it to a young man for $140 and this is so this is still like what earliest 2000s early 2000s he let's see the first owner Kevin Manis had it for two years I think from 2001 to 2003 and then it was auctioned off on eBay and purchased by a gentleman named ysep nitzki his username was spaz mic he started having the exact same type of things the smells of cat urine he said his roommates he and his roommates started to have one of them got like bronchitis out of the blue someone else broke a finger people would wake up after having nightmares of being attacked by an old woman with literal bruises and scratches on their body yeah they said that the box would repeatedly just like Kevin's sister he and his roommates would find The Box open after they had and latched it so my first question is who's the old woman probably the dick I'm guessing that's stuck to the Box you know the cat piss smell and the jasine that sounds like cat lady with Jasmine perfume or something you know we've known a few of them so that sounds like that may be the spirit that was tied to the Box the very next day after he got the box home from the auction he woke up one of his eyes was bloodshot like he had pink eye bright red and weeping and just terrible that was just the first of all the different maladies that happened rashes the broken finger people getting sick Oh [ __ ] he had the box for eight months and he said the entire time it rre of cat urine and he had nothing but bad luck the entire time and he had to get rid of it so eight months later he sold it again on eBay that winner was Jason Haxton Jason says he won the auction in June of 2003 from the moment he got the box he knew it was bad news so Jason haxon paid $280 for the box and immediately upon receiving it felt the felt terrible effects he said he felt stabbing pains in his stomach and started having dreams of the creepy old lady that other people had had when they were in possession of the diic box it's also rumored and I couldn't find anything corroborating this but I did find a couple stories that said that Haxton eventually put the Box in his basement trying to keep it away from people and at one time they found it someone who had broken into the house was dead in the basement next to the Box oh [ __ ] and that was reported by the original owner Kevin Manis so I'm not I'm not sure if that's true or not but I I have seen it reported a couple times after this hack Jason Haxton reached out to some rabbis and some different people to try and figure out what was going on and he says he was told to put it in a box that was lined with gold so he had a box made of aasia wood lined it with gold leaf and put it in there hid it away he didn't take it out until Zack baggin no no no but even before Zach he's contacted by Sam Ry who directed Spider-Man movies and so he contacts him about this story The diic Box story and writes the movie The Possession that came out in 2012 based on people's experiences with the divic Box oh no [ __ ] now I'm GNA have to check out that movie right and so the diic box then comes to the attention of Zack beins and he decides to get Jason to kind of uh let him investigate he takes this box out of storage for Zach and and to show it on the show Deadly possessions and so they put it in what's like some special containment room some Spirit containment room I guess that Zach has which by the way Zack baggin is my favorite [ __ ] around and find out guy sounds like it from this he's got a whole room built for it so he puts box in the room and invites Kevin Manis the original owner who had all those paranormal experiences with it to come back and kind of open it in that room in a safe space when he opened it everything was still in the box wait wait wait before you continue it so this this guy opened it originally before his mom had a stroke had anybody else opened it since until now you know it it opened itself at like Kevin's sister's house like nobody else like will opened it I don't believe so it wasn't opened again it was put away Haxton put it away it locked it in a a box a Gold Line box to keep it safe and then brought it out for Zach after this whole movie thing I believe he brought it out for Sam Ry and everything for the movie but then brought it out again for deadly possessions I don't okay what happened with Zack baggin I gotta know I gotta know so Kevin Manis the original owner is in this room with it and as soon as he opens the diic Box all the lights in the building started going on and off and everybody's hearing all these strange noises and then Kevin himself in the room his face like went blank and his voice changed and they said he kind of like turned to face the wall like very Blair witchy he started to almost sing song tell a story about a shadow man I don't I'm not trying to sign off foofy but did he basically kind of get possessed for lack of a better way to say it it very much sounds like it because he started speaking in a strange language anguage he was making strange sounds and physically Zach said that this man's body started sweating and he started coughing uncontrollably almost like he turned into an old woman almost oh my God so Zach of course purchased the diic box of course it was Kevin sold it for $140 and then it was sold again for $280 and then Zach purchased it I'm not sure for how much no one will say now it's in his Museum and it's covered in glass its story has not ended it's actually caused some problems with a very famous person post Malone well okay okay what does post Malone have to do with a demon box owned by Zach Baggins so apparently Zach has owned this box for a few years and prior to the pandemic uh post Malone came over apparently they're friends post Malone is also interested in paranormal and ghost hunting and UFOs and I didn't even know that actually yeah and he's had some experiences himself they were in the room that holds the diic box and they both heard a little girl talking Zach says that something kind of made him open the box like take it out of its protective case and open it up he says that he touched the box and he got like this overwhelming sensation of anger and sadness and panic and he started to cry and scream and he said post Malone touched him on the shoulder and he felt something go from the box through him and into post Malone oh [ __ ] when they were able to leave the museum post says he saw a shadow figure go across the parking lot the very next day he sent pictures to Zach of bruises on his arm the arm that he had touched Zach with while he was touching the diic box right oh what what did he feel anything in those spots at the time or just did bruises appear the next day post Malone does say that he did feel something dark pass into him but he didn't necessarily say he felt anything in his arm just that the next day there were bruises all along that arm that he had grabbed Zach with while he was touching the Box oh [ __ ] one day later so two days after he he touched Zach who was touching the Box he's in his private plane getting ready to take off as the plane gets up to speed the tire blows oh that's like my biggest fear oh my God they had to make an emergency landing I feel like I saw that on the news or something uhhuh three days after that post Malone's old house was broken into by robbers who were demanding to see him and took $220,000 worth of cash and valuables from the current owners because post Malone had recently moved out okay dear post Malone sh's got an idea for you you get yourself a priest you get yourself a rabbi you get yourself a [ __ ] Shaman and you get yourself a witch and then you sit your happy ass down and you have some Mega freaking Exorcist [ __ ] going on here okay like this is what we need to do post long give me a call we'll hook you up then the third thing happened he was involved in a serious car accident oh my God I remember that post Malone man get your spiritual people you got you got some exercis into them demons to do yep the car accident totaled his rollsroyce wraith which is a cool name for a car by the way he was in the passenger seat the car collided with a Kia I believe it rolled over his assistant was driving it after it collided with the Kia it went through a fence in some bushes no one was hurt but the The Wraith was total I have this in my head and you know that scene in uh Practical Magic where they got all the neighborhood ladies with the brooms all intertwined and they're trying to push out the demon Spirit from from Nicole Kidman that's all I can picture post Malone in the middle of that Circle push out the demon ma'am right so let let let's fast forward here to to 2023 yes who owns the box today is it still Zack Baggins it is still Zack baggin he um purchased it or it was donated to him in 2016 and he put it on display in his haunted Museum which I believe is in Las Vegas it's under a protective case and it is circled by salt to keep it safe I was going to say protective case what the hell is that doing for you but then you added a circle of salt okay okay okay I feel better baggin was going to have a um a Halloween special where he opened it up and he said it just wasn't right it wasn't the right time and he ended up not opening it up at that time he has filmed himself for his show walking around his museum with it open and he said he felt himself like a ton of anger he felt a lot of anger and and pissed off atness bubbling up inside him but nothing paranormal happened at that time who knows what's going on it definitely affected post Malone for sure but I don't know I'm worried for the poor guy like dude we'll help you right it's still owned by Zach Baggins who now says that there are he says there are 10 boxes and he has two of them he's acquired a second box a second divic box this fucker's just asking for trouble I'm just saying I'm he's creating a Gates of Hell in Las Vegas right he's like building a building a new gates of hell for future Generations now there is some uh there are some people who say that it was all made up by the original seller Manis of course there is yeah but that doesn't explain all the horrific things that happened to anyone who has owned it including Zack Baggins the current owner and his friend post Malone we'll see see I could see you know okay so maybe a guy lies about it and gets another guy to lie about it with him but you're not going to start from one Rando guy all the way to Zack Baggins and post Malone going along with your lie so yeah no this has got to be legit now another fun thing is that um when they started production on the movie The Possession I believe that they had actually seen the cabinet the diic box and shortly after they started production uh one of the warehouses that was holding all of their props for the movie burned to the ground you know I I got to give you a funny little side note tidbit here what's that you know sometimes we have episodes where we take notes sometimes we don't I have a sticky note for today and i' just like to share with you what I have on it right now this is this is the gamut of our episode today I have Ohio ghosts ANS because ANS is for farmers markets and and then I have The Possession movie well hey you know you got some really good things out of today's episode it sounds like those are really great rabbit holes to go down right right so you know I mean I gotta check this movie out because I I can't even fathom that he has one but he got two and you know you know damn well if that [ __ ] had access to a third one pick it up oh certainly from what I understand he says that eight of the boxes eight of the 10 of which he has two are accounted for and there are two that are completely unaccounted for now okay so like is there some like sacred text that says there's 10 like how does he know this where did he get this information I'm not really sure hey Zach email me please at the stoned Witches Hour gmail.com I have questions tell me about this diic box tell me about the 10 we need to know and I want to know who are the other people that have them why do they keep them do they have any experience like I got questions people me too and I'd love to go to this Museum and see the Box because I understand that sometimes people just walking into the room can feel so such a strong Sensation that they get physically ill like literally throw up on the spot now here's the reason I have some of these questions because I have some freaking inkling that the cathol church has one of these oh you know they do in that basement of the Vatican they've got so many cool things I'm dying to get in there because you know damn well as much as they tell the public they don't believe it you know the Catholic church is all about possessions and [ __ ] like that oh I'm sure I know they have one like I have questions I have a few questions myself and I just kind of the idea of a diic is very interesting and and you know if it is something that can possess people I think that can be made to possess an object as well any Jewish Scholars out there please let me know if that's true or not but I have to wonder like why who is this woman what happened like what's her story now is this only a Jewish thing the diic a diic specifically yes is a Jewish thing then I I bet you there's some Temple Jewish temple that has one too I'm sure why is it specifically Jewish is there a reason I just I don't know I'm asking just that term itself the diic that particular term is a Jewish term okay but it doesn't necessarily mean that the spirit is of a Jewish Heritage or descent I would guess that it is because again the term um comes from yeah and I would guess that either someone who was Jewish in life could become a diic a demon like that um or possibly if you were cursed by I don't know if it works that way I guess I would have to to speak to a Jewish scholar to find out I'm curious this is like this is turned into a whole second episode now are we here's the real question today are we cool enough to get Zack Baggins to come on and talk about this course we are well we've covered all our bases there you know I I think I'm G A muster you know I I'm I have social anxiety we all know this but I I really I feel like just shooting that guy an email just shot in the dark and being like hey are you willing to come on and talk to us
