welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and today we are doing a fun thing a try it episode yay this time we get to do something really really fun we each picked a type of divination that we're not familiar with and I have to say I fell in love with mine you know mine was interesting I wouldn't go so far to say I fell in love with it tarot is still my BFF but it was interesting I may do this again I may do it on occasion but I wouldn't say it was something I love loved enough to do more than tarot oh all right so on the count of three let's say what we did okay one two three bone throwing and nobody's gonna understand either of those no probably not I researched bone throwing and I did pendulums very cool now I have done pendulum work before my father a long time ago gave me one of those solid Crystal Suncatcher things I very quickly learned that it was an amazing pendulum so I've used them before and dowsing rods too which I think is a similar kind of magic I like the one I have and and you know it's got I like green Green's my favorite color oh that's pretty oh that's got a pretty chain and then the chain has like little shockra color stones on it you know actually I'll get into it in a few minutes but I kind of found uh almost different use for it that wasn't really divination related but I'll talk about in a minute all right well while we're showing off our stuff I'll show you mine so you can get kind of an idea really bones like real bones yep there are a couple bones oh no  but you'll notice that there are a lot of other things right other charms like trinkets it looks like a TR P yeah so one of the things in American osteomancy or bone throwing is it's gotten very much mixed up in another type of divination called cleromancy which is basically found objects that you use to do divination with why do we have to use all these big crazy damn words why can't we just say bone throwing well we can but I like the words you know me I'm a nerd but yeah so it's bone throwing some people will call it charm throwing because it's more than just bones see I was under the impression that like bone throwing was like bones it is call me I do have a couple different kind of bones in here and this is a very new set as I go on I'll get more pieces and I definitely need more bones I have bones on my altar I'm a big bone person but I didn't have any that were appropriate for my bone throwing set so I just have a couple there are so many inappropriate things I could say right now about how to obtain bones how about quiet and you just keep talking well how about we uh we take a step back and we go back to your very very pretty pendulum and we talk a little bit about pendulum magic and pendulum divination funny story so my first thought when I was doing this was this is very Ouija board like minus the letters in the actual Ouija board but like I felt like it was like the sister of Ouija board type thing you know um maybe it's the whole yes no thing I don't know but in the beginning I felt like it was my hand movements moving it but then after a while I I was like hey there might be something to this but this is a form of divination that isn't going to give you the inde depthness that tarot does and I think I think that was kind of my sticking point with it I feel like it's very yes no well there are other uses for it I I don't know if you remember but a couple times in the past the coven and myself have used pendulums with you once to find out the gender of your second child which was so spot-on accurate by the way it was indeed and once when we were talking about places to live and we were using it over a map you know refresh my M the baby one I do but I feel like the baby one was very yes or no because when I was very bulging pregnant it was kind of like you know this way if it's a girl this way if it's a boy kind of the same yes no thing but refresh my memory on this moving thing Vaguely Familiar well with a pendulum basically you hold your Crystal held by a string or chain or a cord and you try to hold your hand very very still so the pendulum itself can move in a linear fashion up and down back and forth or in a circle and you have to talk to it and ask it which way is yes which way is no and which way is maybe what we did you can also put it over objects and ask it things about the object in our case we put it over a map we were talking about possibly buying land for a covenstead way back in the day and so we Ed the pendulum over the map to try and find different areas where the pendulum would be more active and we would Mark those down is that where we came up with the Appalachian Mountains well that was part of it it was also part of our um super secret bugout plan but we won't get into that here but with the pendulum I don't know if you've ever done any type of water dowsing not really not really to be honest pendulum magic is very similar to using sticks or or bent wires or crystals to dowe for water and I was introduced to that first before I was introduced to Crystal divination and if you've ever done that if you've ever dowsed for water or done water witching you can feel that energy when I held those bent wires and walked across an underwater stream they moved on their own to point in the direction the water was flowing I didn't know that there was water there and you can feel some sort of energy I don't exactly know how to describe it now th this is how I kind of like with tarot I feel like it's the tarot cards giving you the info for lack of a better way to say it but with the pendulum it was almost like like you know how my grandfather's always around I felt like kind of this my grandfather was here and he was the one answering the questions and moving it not that like with tarot that tarot is telling you this feels like it is a device for Spirit does that it can be yes very much it does does feel like there's an outside force moving it anytime I've ever used a pendulum it almost feels like when like the OU board yeah yes when you hold that pendulum or the dowsing rods and it starts to move on its own it literally feels like an outside force is acting on that object whether the bent wires or the crystal at the end of the cord it literally feels like something else is pushing on that object and it's a very strange feeling that's kind of why I equate it to the we board because it does feel that way it feels like the ghosties are moving it you know you know what I mean like there something like you're interacting with a spirit more than the pendulum being a divination piece and maybe that maybe that's why I didn't quote unquote fall in love with it like you did with bone throwing because it just feels like you're using a tool while communicating with Spirit as opposed to actual divination I know you have other ways of communing with spirit that are probably much more expressive to you yeah where this was kind of like a time consuming I'm just like hey is supposed to you know pulling out all this and you know hey is this going left or right or in a circle you know it it just I don't know if I really got the grasp of the Divination portion of this I just felt like communing with Spirit was really more what I was doing and I think it can be a great way to commune with Spirit or to use with ancestors I think that's a lot I did with the crystal that my dad gave me that was not an actual pendulum it was just a Suncatcher lead crystal piece on a on a string right so it was never intended to be but the first time I took it out of the box I could feel that outside force moving on the Crystal and immediately realized that it was a type of dowsing Rod or a type of pendulum right but it felt a lot like my my grandparents uh particularly my grandmothers were speaking to me through it um my grandmother and her mother so you didn't really feel like it was a divination thing either then it is a divination thing we I I have used it to ask questions about the future yes no but it is also a good way to commune with spirit and and sometimes they can give you things about the future but don't you feel like it was the spirit giving you the yes no quote unquote divination sometimes yes I do feel very much like ancestors were there with me sometimes it just felt like energy similar to when I would do a tarot reading and you kind of get in the zone and you can feel that univers energy kind of flow through you as you're doing a reading you know I would feel that same thing I I I don't know I guess I just maybe I just didn't feel that as much I don't know maybe that's not the right pendulum for you that could be because you know me I pick things for pretty and it's very pretty maybe this is like adventuring maybe that isn't the right stone for me to be doing it even though it's green and I love green I don't know but with the chain it's got as you can see the different chakra beads on it and I actually tried a little experiment with this and did a Shakra alignment with it which I felt worked better just nice so I would probably going forward be more apt to use this for chakra work more so than divination because I don't know I'm just not picking up the Divination piece man yeah I wonder a little bit if it's maybe that tool is for chakra clearing because you can also Al use pendulums to if if you're into chakra work you know or energy work and you need those energies to move in a certain direction you can use that pendulum to help direct those energies to you know remove blockages or sluggish energy to be honest here when I bought that pendulum a while back it was for that purpose ah okay that makes sense maybe it won't let me use it any other way that's possible because when I got it that's kind of what I got it for and now that's kind of keyed to that kind of locked to that it might be it might be I recommend find something super simple mine was literally fishing line with a Leed Crystal Suncatcher that was it just solid hunk of Crystal was very cool try that and you can also you could put it on a Ouija board you can hold it over a Ouija board or over a piece of paper with letters or words or phrases or pictures and you know I thought about doing that but then you know the holidays and I was busy and but I was like you know I bet you could use this damn thing on a Ouija board yes I also thought you could you know the crystal grids I had thought about also the possibility of using it over a crystal grid oh that would be very cool so that'll have to be my next part two of pendulum triy it but for me I just I feel that there are a lot of uses for pendulums but right now the Divination thing just ain't working for me with it I'm glad I tried it though my biggest piece of advice for pendulums is to find one that that you can feel that strong pull of you know whether you feel it's from Spirit or universe or the future or whatever find one pick it up hold the cord hold the string and ask it a question and see if it moves for you see if you feel aligned with it before you get it actually I like your your other idea better is to make it who gives a  if it's fishing line in a quartz crystal you body at the mall maybe that maybe I should try that making my own and see if I have better luck you've always done better with things that you have handcrafted I do I do so you know maybe that would be a good route but definitely worth a try I mean maybe folks to get a better sense of the Divination piece than I did useful tool I just I'm having a hard time with the Divination part of it being useful I can see that so talk to me about bones because honestly I love love Trinkets and I I I didn't realize that this involved trinkets it does it does it's so wonderful this is I think you would actually like this you might go for more of the cleromancy which as I said earlier is charms it's it's divination using charms this is very heavily influenced by hudo Culture by root work culture however it's also very heavily influenced by American folk culture appal Lan Hill People culture bone throwing osteomancy comes from from all over the world first of all where are you obtaining bones I have to get this out of the way because that's that's that's a burning question I have he just had Thanksgiving oh I didn't even think of that I'm an idiot okay chicken bones are very commonly used in in hoodoo and in root work so I don't partic I don't have any chicken bones here I was just thinking about that ex you had that I haven't seen in a few years and I'm like where she getting these bones from what the hell no no I do love bones and shell knows she's known me for a while I have lots of Bones on my altar I have which creep me out and always have by the way I think that bones are magical and I think that they're pretty cool they some of them are around no they're awesome it's like this magical system that Pilots our meat suits man I'm not going to put that on the podcast I'm probably one of the few witches on the planet that that is like I I don't want to say I'm scared of Bones but like I wouldn't touch them without a rubber glove you know they should definitely be cleaned and there's there's a way there's ways to clean them oh I'm not talking about cleanliness I'm talking about my own like I have an like ah like somebody ah that was somebody's body and skin was on there ah like ah I can't do it bravo bravo it's I I do feel that they are sacred to the creature that they came from I do feel that I mean leg bone for God's sake yeah and they can last for a very long time I mean we have dinosaur bones for sake some of this stuff has been around forever now have you carve have you carved like symbols or sigils into them yes I don't think I have one right here to show you but I'll put up a picture later so you can see and I have some that are like this one has like the hag the hole in it that I got the bone yeah exactly is that a thing yeah it can be bones do last a very long time they can contain people's DNA I just think they're super magical and very very important I think they're cool now have you ever heard of dice the game of dice be called knuckle bones absolutely not you never have you've never heard it called knuckle bones wow never in my life I know people out there have so I have heard bones referred to as knuckle bones particularly in gambling and the reason for that is because way back in the day they used to be made from sheep Knuckles what dice yes you're K me I am not back in Greece and Rome I believe they were made from actual knuckle bones of sheep and they that I'm gonna use that for trivia next time I play Katan and they were used for dice games as well as to tell the future they have dice that have been found that date back to 3100 BCE in Scotland damn they know that Dice and and different Bones have been used for div the world round it's one of these types of divination that every single culture can claim a little bit of credit for because I mean bones are cool as man and people have known that for a while and they've kind of always been around just saying exactly so osteomancy and cleromancy Bone throwing and charm throwing have kind of melded together to be a type of divination if there's a mancy name for pendulum work I don't know what it is just I don't either but because I was already drawn to Bones I thought this would be a cool thing to try and it's even cooler because it includes found objects now unlike tarot cards or even your pendulum these objects do not necessarily have specific meanings like do they what like do they have to be like certain objects or can I just be like pulling from everywhere to use you can be pulling  from everywhere to use now is so what means what to me yes very very much so now there are some meaning I mean just like in dream interpretation or Tea Leaf reading there are some archetypes that are General guidelines yes I mean if you say Santa Claus to a generic person in the USA they're all going to come up with a somewhat very similarl looking figure that's an AR that's right and that's an arch type we all kind of know what that looks like if you tell most people draw a picture of a wicked witch also an archetype they will all Draw Something resembling the wiard correct so some things do have symbolism like an egg most of the time is going to mean New Beginnings possibly babies you know fertilization fragility that's right could be fragility all that types of thing if you have a you know something with a tree it could be longevity it could be Generations it could be family so some things have General meanings but it's still very much depends on your connection your correlation you pulling this out of a bag like runes or what and that's another thing you'll find all sorts of different ways to do it some people like all right I got to I have to reference the song while I was doing some research I came across an old Dolly Parton song it's so ridiculous people I swear to God you got to look this up on Spotify because it's so ridiculous I almost peed myself laughing I'm gonna put a YouTube link to it it's called these old bones and I love me some Dolly don't don't get me wrong I love but this song Just Had Me Like bent over laugh oh it's so twangy be prepared for some twanging but it's a great song and she starts out with these old bones will tell your story these old bones will never lie these old bones will tell you surely what you can't see with your eye and she talks about them being shaken and rattled and being kept in a burlap sack and that's all pretty true kind of like with runes there's different ways you can throw bones and that's going to vary from reader to reader my particular way that I ended up doing it is I like to keep them in a bag and I will grab a handful or a double handful of them and literally throw them onto a surface mine is just marked with four quarters east south west and north and they each have the same types of correspondences so depending on where the charms or the bones lie in the quarters will influence kind of like in a Tarot spread like where in the spread that card sits will influence its meaning right right same thing with the charms and the bones where they sit and how they sit in relationship to each other might change the meaning of it do you throw do you throw all of them or just part of them I'm throwing all of them because my set is new I've been collecting charms and bones for this type of set without even realizing that's what I was doing as soon as we started talking about doing this I knew exactly the jar on my altar that had all these little bits and Bobs and trinkets in it that apparently I've been saving as a bone throwing set without realizing I swear to God your part fairy anything you see that sh pick it up and put it in your damn pocket pretty much and okay I'm going to admit another embarrassing fact when I was a kid one of the books that I read that had a huge impact on me was the valley of Horses by Gan M all it's the sequel to Clan of the Cave Bear I'm sure everyone's heard of that I never did until I met you and then you made me read them all good books actually though Awesome books the reason the valley of horses had such an impact on me is because the first people in that series have a very earth-based goddess centered religion that I resonated with really hard as a kid who had never heard of paganism or witchcraft ever I just knew I wanted a religion like that one and one of the things that they did was people had animal spirits that were attached to them and the main character Aya was taught to look for signs from the spirits to guide her and that's something else that resonated with me I too sometime sometimes you know you'll see something and you'll know that that really cool little stone is meant for you or you know that little Trinket in the shop that you just have to buy it was supposed to be yours that kind of thing they all scream my name right seriously you with your pretty stuff same thing so I already mostly had a set and they're all things that have meaning to me like this little Rune right here we got from a belan at Community I think it was the first belain that I took my daughter to that she was able to participate in all those trcks through all those rituals that they'd give us stuff I have all I remember you would wear that all the time I remember that charm yeah this is an M charm that I used to wear constantly um I have all sorts of things this is a sanova symbol that was made at Brushwood I think from back when we had our seasonal there this is a Order of the Golden Dawn gosh I can't remember it's the it's the women's Masonic group that my my hundred-year-old grandmother who passed away this was a piece of jewelry that she wanted me to have and it has the five-pointed star on it so that's also in there and you also found a very special special charm didn't you I did that is not in my bone throwing set but as I was going through looking for pieces I did happen to find my old coven charm which is ironic because like about a month ago I found mine too I love that so much I am so happy I feel so much more at peace now that I have it back but no that's not going in my in my set but I do I also have this fish bone this is a spine from a fish see that's creepy I don't want to touch a spine from a fish my God people you know where this came from oh that's from Patricia canel Morrison yeah when she came and visited with us and hung out for a little while hail the traveler but yeah that was one of the gifts that she gave me after she left for hosting her so yeah I have a lot of things that mean something to me in this bone throwing set plus her chicken bones from last Tuesday's dinner I'm just kidding so some of them have markings to you know because I sat with each of these pieces and and you know kind of felt the energy from it to decide some of them needed marking some of them needed carvings some of them do not but you know you have to sit with each piece you have this quarter grid here and you throw it so a fishbone goes in the north what the hell does that mean well honestly it's all about the energy of the moment so I could give you a generic idea of what that would mean to me but I mean are you talking like Earth is like like yeah North would be Hearth home it would be the North Star it emotions and all like going along with that so where they go depends on where that that aspect but that's my personal grid that might be different than someone else's grid that they throw on oh I got just so there's no necessarily there's no this is fairy chess all the way down this is like make up the rules as you go along I gotcha this is very much you have to connect with the pieces it's like the opposite of tarot structure yeah yeah I mean tarot is very structured and the sounds very unstructured it is but to be honest you know me I I kind of do that with tarot too I mean you have to go with the flow just because a card means a certain thing doesn't mean it will always mean that but you always have to do a spread whatever that spread is it's up to you but like there's a certain Conformity to ter it seems like there's no Conformity with this that's correct whereas tarot has a lot of Conformity and then the rest is your own energy and intuition that's like zero right this has a lot of energy in intuition and just a little bit of Conformity there are general rules there are General guidelines like you have to have a connection with the pieces you know some of the pieces will have similar meanings I mean there's guides out there I mean that you're going to find books and lists of correspondences and peace meetings all over the place but you really have to know it yourself it's very personal and and I think that it it involves a lot of magical energy whenever I would throw these bones kind of like when you can feel that pendulum move from the outside Source I felt a deep connection and it's kind of like when you get in the flow with tarot readings and they're just speaking to you and the words are coming and the stories are flowing I felt that when I would do bones for myself or when I would throw them for other people and it's just very intimate and I really really liked it ilila I can't even touch raw chicken without being queed out you never do the cooking when we're together that's true I mean I I I feel like I'm coming across as such a princess but gez Louise man you don't have to have any bones at all in your bone throwing set make a charm throwing set and call it a day just make sure that those all resonate with you that you feel something for those pie do you have to have a certain amount of charms like do you have to have 20 or like 10 like whatever you feel like I'd recommend more than three and probably less than 3,000 but I've also heard from some of the the bone throwers that I researched and talked to people have different sets for different reasons they'll have a set where they just talk about relationships they'll have a set where it's about family or health sometimes they'll have different sets that resonate with different types of situations um sometimes they'll have a set that's too personal for anyone other than themselves to use and some people have very very large sets that like you said they dig in grab a handful and throw them down because that see that that seems to make more sense to me that you would like have a ton of them and grab a handful and throw them because then that way what you're grabbing is by chance and you're not grabbing everything you know what I mean kind of like with tarot you only use certain amount of cards and then the rest weren't applicable to you yeah my set is relatively small so I use all of it or almost all of it granted not everything would fall in my grid and there were times when I didn't read everything but you can always add to your bag already oh yeah I feel this is definitely something that I feel I am going to continuously add to sometimes people will choose themselves the reader will grab and throw for the querent sometimes they'll have the querent grab from the bag and and throw themselves again dep I like that better because it's like tarot if you're doing a reading for me I'm the one shuffling if you're throwing my bones I should be the one picking out you know what I mean to put my whatever my energy into it yep I spoke to someone named rabbit and she has a bag she's just been doing bone throwing for about a year or so but she uses a um like a velvet bag from a jewelry store and she puts her charms in there and when she has the people ask question like fondle the bag to mix it up and then she grabs from the bag and throws onto her scarf but she doesn't have them chew she just has them kind of Shuffle the bag I guess you could always use a Crown Royal bag just saying I did see someone on YouTube do that but yeah again the bag is personal we wrap our tarot cards in different scarves or put them in boxes to protect the energy same thing with these and I really like it because of the ancestor connection to it the the connection to the spirits of the objects to the energy of the objects themselves it's um again it's a very intimate type of divination and it feels very magical you know to kind of read these stories and to make the connections I know you've you've done a reading where you were really in the flow and it seems like every reading with the Bones is like that well the next time we are together in person in the flesh you my sweet loving friend are going to be giving me a bone reading just out of curiosity I'm curious I'm no yes I owe you one I made you read my tea Lea so I definitely owe you a bone throw I would prefer if I didn't have to actually touch a bone no that's okay that's all right I won't I won't make you touch any of them I'll pull everything and just throw it down you got it I think our triats were successful even though I didn't fall in love with pendulum I I do find very good magical uses for it I just maybe need more work with it maybe a different Stone I do like the concept of it it uh I just need a little more time with with me and my pendulum and I think you're in love with bones very much so I think they're fantastic I think this was a successful try it don't you very successful I'm pretty happy with how it turned out and uh I'm really glad that we were given the idea to try a couple new types of divination so keep the ideas coming I'll be honest with you I'll probably still go back to tarot no lie not gonna fake it but like I said I I will maybe delve a little bit further into this I might actually use it with a Ouija board oo I'd be curious to see how it goes I just think that that that might be the Avenue that might work best for me say what you will about Ouija boards but I'm a fan and hey if you're just using it for letters to be pointed out with a pendulum what could go wrong right all right thank you so much for listening to back on the broomstick and thank you all so freaking much for all the likes and love and comments ments and all of it we love it
