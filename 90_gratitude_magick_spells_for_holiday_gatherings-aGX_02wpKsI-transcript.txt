the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and on this episode we'll be talking about gratitude magic and how to survive the holiday spells and I'm shell and boy do I need this because you know this year is a little nutty to begin with but let's face it and and Lea you know my family this is a trying time every year you got to get together with these people you know like like I love these people I have deep love for these people but wow sometimes by the end of the day I am done I am done November in the United States brings us Thanksgiving and we're not going to get into the problematic origins of that holiday in this episode but you know it also brings friendsgiving events and a lot of family and getting together with co-workers and relatives and people that we love let's not lie I'm looking forward to getting fat okay I just want to eat my face off eat my face off the carbs the gravy it's just Sheer Heaven P pie let's talk pie oh pie so many different kinds of pie my mother sets a whole day aside to bake pies before Thanksgiving I love it I'm gonna throw you under the bus here in front of all of our listeners oh and a little a little fun fact about Lea in her life and I always found this a little weird about you when I first met you like years ago but as I got older I totally got it your family actually treats Thanksgiving as the major holiday of the year yes here in North America whether you are Christian or not pretty much Christmas is the big boom of the year we all we all do our Christmas thing with our families but for you that Christmas never really meant anything to your family and Thanksgiving was like that's your jam for your family that's like your your your big gig it is you are absolutely correct you know me very well how stressful it is it is but it it's a little less we have two thanksgivings which sounds even more stressful but it's usually about the third Saturday in the month my mother will have a big Thanksgiving at her house and everybody's invited it's the entire family entire extended family you know that big you have to have three big tables cuz there's 35 40 people there remember that I remember those days it's that kind of Thanksgiving that she likes to have and there's a bunch of traditions involved but she likes to have that as her big holiday and there's a lot of Christians that go you know and there's people from every side of the political spectrum and we usually try to leave all of that at the door but it can get a little it can get a little nutty and it can get a little stressful and I'm sure a lot of people around the country even if you don't do it quite as big as my mother does and make like a whole two weeks celebration out of it you know it can still be stressful you know I've I've transitioned to a new phase in my life and I'm very pleased with it I live in a different state as my father and I also live in yet a different state as my mother you know we've talked about my mother spends spends the winters down south so I am now the center of Thanksgiving my children my children come to me my sweet little grandbaby comes to me and I set the tone for Thanksgiving now you know it is not any of the stuff that is stressful anymore because my kids know you know you you you you only go so far with Mommy we don't talk about certain things at at dinner and we're all here to love each other and I don't want to hear your you fight later you fight later because right now we're all together and I don't want to hear it and you know I do like that but I also know that on the heels of thanks giving is the Christmas season the UL season the Hanukkah season and man I can't run from it then this time of year in the United States people go out to dinner at someone's house or they make dinner at their own house they have a big Feast there's also a lot of holidays that come up in December there's Hanukkah and Quanza there's uul and Christmas there's so many different holidays going on right now so that means there's a lot of family gett togethers going on right now so this episode is going to be how do you keep that Spirit of being thankful and being grateful alive when you have to deal with family and stressful situations that try and steal your joy how can we magically as witches transform that energy how do we protect our peace and bring joy into the holidays and let's be thankful we're talking about abundance and celebrating all the good things in our lives with our families and all the things that we have how can you keep that alive in your heart as a witch when everything is crazy and stressful and there's family everywhere I I I need to stop you I need to interrupt you for a second because I got a really great message a reply to a comment on one of our I don't even it might have been our Facebook discussion group I think I had a listener who who said that they were apprehensive about the upcoming holiday because you know how Thanksgiving is everybody wants to know what you want for whatever you celebrate Christmas you Hanukkah they're like what do you want for Christmas I need to know by Thanksgiving and you know this listener is kind of struggling with with parents on a different side of the spectrum than they are um we all get it we're all feeling that wrath right now and and the question was what if I want something witchy for the holidays but my parents are kind Christian Maga you know and here's my response so for all you folks out there the a don't know what to get your family members who've pissed you off this holiday season and B don't know what to ask for so that you actually kind of get what you want but they're not thinking you're like some spawn of Satan get your parents pajamas leave it at that and I've gotten I've had this started having this fascination with wooden stuff wooden bowls I guess it was technically made to be a wooden wooden cutting board not what I'm going to use it for ask for wooden quote unquote kitchen wear that you will absolutely not use for kitchen wear o I like it your parents will think they're buying you wooden salad bowls but you're not using them for salad bowls okay I'm going to go on this tangent with you because I'm excited I love this you can also ask for bundles of candles ask for just regular small tapers ask for a bag of emergency tea lights oh my God a freaking spice rack ask for a spice rack and then use it to make loosen sens and teas I love that ask for teas ask for a beautiful mug look for um cast iron look for a small cast iron pot it doesn't have to look like a cauldron to be a cauldron it could just be a small cast iron pot or ask for a gift card to HomeGoods mortar and pestle you can get a lot of alter stuff at HomeGoods okay now a lot of you know that I am kind of a nomad I move a lot one of the things I do when I first moved in with the love of my life that shell introduced me to I remember that day our very first house together my sister-in-law brought us a black marble mortar and pestle and I love it this was 25 plus years ago and that's one of the few things that I have carried to every single house with us house to house state to state to state once that mortar and pestle is in my kitchen I feel like I'm home and I use it all the time not just for Magical things but for mundane kitchen things as well so ask for a really nice mortar and pestle so that's that's my holiday tip for all of you that are being trapped for having to produce a gift list on this upcoming Thanksgiving season yeah just ask for some of the supplies that are a little less obvious I think I call them quote unquote kitchen wear or find your local book shop and ask for a gift card to that book shop and then buy yourself tarot cards and Books Galore right right now I have a couple ideas to help keep the peace in your house if you're going to be hosting here's a couple things that you could do and the first one comes from Lilith dorsy whom I adore love her fantastic person now this is called the sweet not sour lemon magic spell and I love it because it's super simple so you slice up a lemon and for every guest you take one slice pin it you know just take a little tack or something or some tape whatever you've got and stick it under their chair at the table and what that does is the Lemon will soak up all the negativity it's going to like cut that negativity right through just like the acidity of the lemon any sourness any nasty attitudes the lemons are going to soak up and then after dinner take all those lemons and put them outside either to compost under a tree or someplace under the dirt or just throw them away but that way you can dispose of all that negativity outside but just like kind of lemon scented cleaners or like cleaners with lemon in it helped to wipe away the dirt better this is going to help you to clean up all that psychic dirt all that psychic negativity is that going to keep my adult children from arguing like four yearolds at the dinner table absolutely simple yet effective if you put it down there with intention you're going to have the happiest Feast ever of course liberal applications of mundane with your magical are the best way to go about these things so make sure to keep everybody occupied keep the food going and of course my all-time favorite responsibly keep the Cannabis flowing never hurt okay okay make yourself a little smokable spell joint beforehand to share throw a little mug warart in there a little lavender little rose petal and everyone will be in such a good mood no one will be able to now one thing that we do and it's just because I don't know why we do this there's no Rhyme or Reason to it but we all end up doing everything you know my my sweet love will be peeling potatoes my daughter is the apple pie maker my son will sit there on his phone watching all of us complaining that we're not doing things right and I AMV oh no wait so he's the assistant manager is that it he's the assistant manager but I didn't hire him okay okay so you know we'll be doing stuff and then I just want everybody to stop bickering because my my my adult children literally bicker like they're four because my daughter feels that he doesn't do enough so I make them all tea and I think tea is also a good kind of bring it in for everybody because not everybody in your family is as witchy as you are true very good point and not everyone is is a cannabis smoker nor is it good for everyone even though I might want it to be right you know and and you got to find a common ground without maybe being totally overt about it but you can make a different a different blend of tea as opposed to say using a tea bag you know make a a calming peaceful tea and make everybody drink it here's a tip chamomile is very mild you can throw a handful of that in every single tea bag like just toss it in everyone's favorite tea whether they know it or not that's now how's that going to how's that going to mix with the uh what's that stuff in turkey tryp toine or something triptan like is like people are going to be passing out face down in their potatoes if I give them chamomile and turkey well that's better than arguing right no that's true that's true I should have my camera ready for this dinner you should indeed it's going to be the most relaxed chill Thanksgiving ever right teas are fabulous for that cannabis teas whether it's a smokable or drinkable you can also mix these spells into food or Shell's beloved simmer pots you could create a Thanksgiving themed or holiday themed simmer pot and make it a spell before people show up it's called turkey Ila it's called turkey the day before when you're cleaning or the week before when you're cleaning and you're getting ready we just had an amazing full moon and if you have your full moon water or if you have unlabeled full moon water sitting on a shelf me that's me it's you it's me I have unlabeled Moon water but I know it's from a full moon and I know it's great so I'm going to be adding some of that to my mop water and you know when I mix up different cleaning stuff I'm going to add a bunch of Full Moon water to that and make sure I also add the intention of a peaceful home of Harmony in my home of that fullness and abundance and gratitude that beautiful light of the full moon in that water I'm going to add that to everything I use to clean my house and you know as you said this is this is where I shine in simmer pot season like it's literally simmer pot season for me and you know I'll do kind of more of those types of things because I feel like you know remember when you were younger you you'd walk into say your grandmother's house for dinner and just walking in and smelling a a particular maybe food related smell of her cooking that dinner that you're coming for it kind of brings that I'm here to celebrate with family I think everybody coming into a a loving welcoming peaceful family gathering smell there's something about smell magic this is there such a thing as smell magic but there's there's something about smell magic this time of year right now I started burning those um Balsam fur candles I know I'm I'm jumping the gun on the holidays I get it but some of these smells invoke a certain I don't want to say mind set but kind of yeah and it 100% yeah smells are very heavily tied to memory and to thoughts and it's an excellent trigger for spell work right some smells can take you back to your grandmother's kitchen or if you walk into a house and it smells like pumpkin and Nutmeg and cinnamon and poultry seasoning then you know it's Thanksgiving and it's comfort and it's it triggers that it triggers that internal magic so exactly but I also kind of use intentional ingredients obviously um make my little witches stew but then in a way that's going to evoke something for the people that are coming exactly so again maybe if you're going to do your simmer pot a couple days before people get there or maybe the morning before people get there while you're cooking go with pine go with the pine and the Cyprus put in Orange and cinnamon because that's going to be cleansing for your house you know use the Balsam fur use your moon water put your moon water in there to do that simmer pick your ingredients intentionally to use ingredients of the Season that will evoke good memories but also that will bring Harmony and balance and cleansing to your home to your space but also you know as part of of your your gratitude and and your thankfulness I like to maybe later in the day everybody's passed out watching football on their phones whatever the case may be I like to kind of take a little bit of something depends on my mood what I'm doing where I'm at and and kind of give an offering give an offering to the deities that I'm grateful for you know and the elements they've put in the Long Haul for me you know I I try to be gratuitous to everything not just family and friends and you know me I tend to my offerings tend to be pinches of weed so you know I I will put a a pinch of weed on my hiate statue I'll go put a pinch of weed out in the grass for the land Spirits kind of let it blow in the breeze you know put a pinch of weed up in the air and let it kind of blow out of my fingers for the elements so I try to also be thankful and give that gratitude to not just family and friends but to the deities to the to the elements and into the spirits around me and if you have time to sneak out and kind of do that being able to offer some of that to the land spirits and to the energies around you you it's a really good way to first off get yourself a little bit of alone time and away from all the people that's right and secondly that's a really great way to offer gratitude and honor to your genus loai to your land spirits to your spirits of place love that I think that's perfect I just I I feel that you know if you're going to be thankful to half the people be thankful to all the people go big or go home you know thank everybody in your sphere whether that your mother or your deity you know right now I have a spell that I kind of modified a little bit from a mirror box spell interesting do you have anyone in your family other than your kids that comes to your holiday events or maybe it is your kids that is a little bit obnoxious in some way maybe their opinion is really out there maybe they hug people a little too long you know I don't know do you have one of those relatives that comes I absolutely cannot say who but yes okay we all have one of those relatives that you want to invite and include for whatever reason and love and adore to Pieces but I just wish they they showed up with their mouth duct taped shut there you go exactly you know maybe they won't stop talking about baseball maybe they're newly a vegan sorry vegans but some of you new ones are really bad maybe they just started some sort of ping scheme I don't know whatever reason you just don't want to hear it or they're the ones sit they like oh you're still doing that witch thing yeah Bob it's been 30 years I'm still doing it still doing that witch thing Uncle Bob thanks so here's what you do you ever see those little holiday boxes they come in all different sizes you can get them for Thanksgiving you can get them for Christmas you know it might be a little wrapping box that looks already predecorated but you can find them anywhere you can find them at craft stores you can find them at big box stores are you talking like empty yep little empty boxes okay okay I follow you decorative whether it's for wrapping presents or it could just be a plain box it doesn't have to be one of those holiday boxes but I say those because you can leave those out like on a table or a mantel piece or as part of a decorative display and no one will know what it is you know so it's out there everyone's seeing it it's Gathering energy from the festivities but it's undercover it's hidden no one's going to know it's and then line the inside with aluminum foil or mirrors you could also you know glue mirrors in there if you want to get oh my God I want die if you say put a Rusty Nail in there no shell not this spell how much does this person annoy you anyways not that holiday we're not going that far no all we want to do is we want to just keep them quiet for a little bit so write the name of that relative that you need to put duct tape over their mouth put it in the box and if you want to use any herb if you want to use crystals you know if you would like to do a full spell and add some Spell components to that for peace tranquility shut the up you know whatever you want to put in there you can then as you close the box say may this person think before they act may they see themselves before they act may this person's energy remain en closed whatever you want them to do may you may you have duct tape on your mouth you know may you keep to yourself may your energy only be seen by you uh may you get what you give whatever you want to say just keep the idea in your mind of basically putting them in time out until the end of your Gathering I also have a little spell you could say something like by mirrored glass and quiet flame I bind the spark that bears their name reflect their words their deeds their will let harm be stilled let peace fulfill what say their name sends out shall they reclaim as I have spoken say their name is Tam but just pass the damn apple pie that's right and then at the end of it just uh open the box take everything out if you're used aluminum foil it's perfect just wrap up the herbs and the name all of it into that aluminum foil crumple it up and throw it away in the garbage and that ends the spell but the idea is for them to sit with their own energy rather than spread it out to other people you know we do a little thing and it it's not like a spell per se we go around everybody says something they're thankful for and the rule is I'm not allowed to say my kids or my grandson jerks they don't want me to have an easy out basically but it's it's kind of interesting you know we all have the things that we're all grateful for but it's interesting to just sit there and take it in for a minute what the people you love are grateful for I'm stealing that that's just neat and interesting to kind of to experience and it's also a good way to make your kids feel uncomfortable and I'm pretty sure that this year my grandson is is grateful for candy I think grandchildren are always grateful for candy I I am also grateful for candy but you know I think there's a lot of upset people right now there's a lot of people whose worlds have been turned upside down and you know we we did recently talk about that and ways to get through that but another way to get through that is to not to sound like my grandma but count your damn blessings take a minute and and realize that you do have stuff to be grateful for if nothing else your ass woke up today and that's pretty amazing so you know it's a good time to just take stock of things are shitty but there is some good there for you and and appreciate that for a minute and I sometimes think that the more you look for things to appreciate the more you find oh I love that you do that as a tradition my family has done that in the past but not regularly and I think I think I really want to your your tradition has kind of given me an idea for a new a new witchy thankfulness tradition that uh I might try to sneak under the radar and Implement in my family I'm not going to tell everybody what it's for because not everybody needs to know that my whole family are witches they don't need to know that ex I me probably already do but why point out why point it out again all right so pretty much everybody knows I'm a witch I'm not very quiet about it but if you are in a family where people don't know you are wit you can also do this so what I'm thinking about doing is I have this big beautiful wooden spoon that I absolutely love it's a kitchen spoon and what I'm going to do with it is cook Thanksgiving dinner with it clean it obviously but when we do our go around the table and say what we're thankful for and express our gratitudes I'm going to pass that spoon around to people and just basically tell them it's the speaking spoon and so you'll hold the spoon say your gratitude and then pass it to the next person and what they're really doing is charging that spoon with their gratitude and with their hopes their intentions whether they know it or not I mean if they know it it's obviously better but if they don't know ity witch I love it right and then just keep that spoon in a safe place with your Thanksgiving things and then next year cook again with that spoon and you'll be putting all of that gratitude all of that energy back into your Thanksgiving feast cleaning and then bring it out and do it again and it's the speaking spoon right so they're holding it and they don't even know they're putting all that gratitude into the spoon you know if I tried to do that a my kids would laugh at me and be like Mom we're doing our witchy stuff and then B my daughter would beat my son with it but they know it's witchy I bet they'd still do it they would but they'd laugh at me and they'd be like oh goes again but that's why I'm saying if you tell people like everyone's kind of uh accustomed the idea of a talk stick you could just say this is the this is the Talking Stick and then you can kind of slly get it in there but then what do you do with that like great aunt Who Won't Give Up the spoon but I'm not done yet I'm not done yet no yes you are yes you are Aunt Betty you're done you're done Aunt Betty that's when my you rang from the last episode will come in handy right now one of the things I just want to point out that I am going to be extra thankful for this year and I am going to put on my list of things I'm thankful for is always you obviously I was thinking about you I
