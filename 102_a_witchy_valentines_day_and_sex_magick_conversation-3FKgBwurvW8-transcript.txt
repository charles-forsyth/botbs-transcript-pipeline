we'll address all the wonderful mail you guys have sent that being said today is Valentine's Day this episode is coming out on Valentine's Day you know I Valentine's Day has a storied history it really became what it is because of American pop culture um some people actually literally say that the Hallmark card company the greeting card company created Valentine's Day it didn't though but I I think that Hallmark created a sense of guilt for couples across the land they most definitely did yeah Valentine's Day also did not come from luri Calia which is another holiday that happens right around the same time Valentine's Day is February 14th and lalia is February 15th roughly and they have some themes that cross over with each other but they're not exactly the same thing a naked baby that has a a bow and arrow Cupid I don't think he had anything to do with lupercalia okay lalia was a Roman Festival celebrating faest the god of Agriculture and also the she wolf that raised the twin founders of Rome ramulus and RIS and so this Festival is to bring prosper it and to bring fertility and they would sacrifice animals and then they' take the hides of these sacrificed animals and they would whip them lightly I don't think it was really hard but they would lightly whip them on women in the streets and it was supposed to help bring fertility that sounds kinky kind of yeah and there was also they also supposedly women would write their name like on lots and cast them into this well or something and men would come through and pick one of the Lots and then those two people would have to couple up for the festival or for the next year you know probably not the time or place but I'm gonna say it anyway that reminds me of like a 70s key party you know I kind of had the same thought when I saw like this sounds an awful lot like a key party it really does you know was really to promote fertility to promote not not really love not romantic love for sure but definitely fertility ritual but Valentine's day came more from a legend of a man named Valentine but this was also in Roman time supposedly around the 3rd Century BC there was an emperor and he was trying to build a really strong Army to do that he said that no one in his army none of the young men who came into the army could get married because he felt that if they were longing to go home to their wives or to their children to their families that they wouldn't focus on war and killing so he said no marriage but this priest Valentine decided to let people get married in secret and then when it was found out they sentenced him to death oh damn yeah right how come back then no matter what she did you were sentenced to death I don't know that they pretty much were like let's just get rid of the problem entirely I don't want to deal with it off with their head literally he was sentenced to death by beheading very romantic so Valentine became a saint in Christian theology for daring to perform marriages against the will of the emperor he was a champion of love sounds pretty Pagan to me just saying it really does we do like people who subvert Authority I guess right but Valentine's Day didn't really become a thing until Jeffrey choser talked about it in one of his poems but was about birds that birds would choose their mates on St Valentine's Day and that's really the first written history we have of Valentine's Day okay that's that's a little weird and I'm not gonna lie why are why are we writing poems about birds mating well you know it was allegorical choser liked to do allegorical things okay so basically it he wrote a lot about sex and love in and and hid it in other ways so there are multiple I don't want to say celebrations or holidays but there are multiple things in in February that have to do with with creation and and love and things of that nature so it's this is kind kind of the designated lovey doy month well think of imoke you know we're already looking at the lamming season right like in the belly and and the fertility is about to start so it makes sense everybody's about to start making babies so let's make sure everybody's really fertile before we go do it so this is what that's all about right sounds like a plan in the 17th century is when people started passing notes around and calling them valentin's a yeah and there was actually the mother of the American Valentine was a woman in the mid 19th century her name was Esther Howland and she was from Worster Massachusetts Worcester wer I it's Worcester which I learned it's Worcester so for all of our which by the way we have a ton of Massachusetts listeners I am learning how to say your words in your in your cities in your towns it's Worcester Worcester okay Worster not Worster hey I didn't say Worchester let's let's just start there I I was close kudos to you for that kudos to you for that Esther howand was from Worster was from Worcester Massachusetts she was known for making these elaborate Valentine's Day cards she's the one that really put the ribbons and the lace and the pictures she's the one that really kind of made the idea of giving these super elaborate cards very popular I've actually seen some of these on the internet and like these are fancy super fancy but she was actually kind of commissioned the way I've heard it I heard it she was actually commissioned by a a greeting card company all I know is that she's called the mother of the American Valentine and made super fancy crafty Valentine that's that's the extent I know about her and then Hallmark came into the picture and then she got bought out by Hallmark yay I hope she got good money for it now I do understand that people look at at Valentine's Day is kind of corporate America trying to cash in on your love I do look at that way I do and I hear you but I am also all for we live in a [ __ ] show of a world no matter what country you're in right now shit's just weird and to have one day designated for either you and the person you love you to love yourself you to Love Thy Neighbor have a what what do they call it now a gallentine you loving your friends whatever it is setting aside a day to be appreciative of the love you have in your life is not a Bad Thing damn it that's true and I also learned about April 14th which is called black Valentine what's that never heard of it it's in South Korea I discovered that in South Korea they have three different Valentine there's Valentine's Day there's white Valentine and black Valentine and the black Valentine is April 14th and it's when singles people who didn't get any gifts or didn't go out with anybody on the first two Valentine's they go out and they have this comfort food dis dish of black noodles and they'll eat black foods and dress in black and it's the whole idea of caring for yourself taking care of yourself on this day if you didn't get a valentine SS like a funeral of love right I don't know I just kind of liked the idea that there were different types of Valentines depending on who you were I thought that was kind of cool I don't like how it is guilted especially on Americans it's like you're guilted into celebrating Valentine's Day or you're like shamed if you haven't and I don't like that but I I do like there being a day where everybody just loves everybody and I kind of celebrate to we'll call it to Valentine's day too we all do I know you do your anniversary I mean we do the same thing on Valentine's Day as we do it's like our two times a year where we celebrate loving each other you know what I mean yeah you know my partner and I don't necessarily celebrate Valentine's Day too terribly much we never really have done much of anything for it at most we might get some good takeout but I don't think we've ever really done anything for Valentine's we do the card thing yeah you do nice cards cards and chocolate a but I also I have no use for a $100 Dozen Roses that's ridiculous when in March you can get a dozen roses for 1995 like that's Corporate America taking advantage of my relationship and I don't like that but a nice beautiful card that I know he sat at the store and read read everyone and found the perfect one there's something to be said for that in my world you know there's no real pagan origins people like to say lalia is the origin of Valentine's Day and it's not exactly just like Groundhog's Day is not the origins of imul just because they're kind of have similar ideas and they're close in date doesn't make them the same yeah and the same thing with lupre Calia and Valentine's Day so there's no real pagan origins of Valentine's Day but that doesn't mean that we can't take that energy of every everybody thinking about love and relationships and sex and channel that energy into spellwork and it doesn't have to be spellwork about sex or relationships in order for you to use that energy to empower your spells now we're going to shift into the good stuff here folks but I want to start out with a couple of misconceptions real quick and and I don't want to put you on the spot but I I want to talk about a couple of things that sex magic is not yes let's do it and maybe I'm not starting at the right point but this is where you kind of veered me in this direction is Sex Magic doesn't have to be magic with love it doesn't have to be magic with creation or procreation Sex Magic can be for Prosperity Sex Magic can be for financial things for for worldly things you know I'm trying to get a job yeah Sex Magic is just a way to raise energy Sex Magic doesn't have to have anything to do with sex or relationships or love it is merely not merely but it is one more way to raise energy you know just like in the past we've talked about you can raise energy singing you can raise energy chanting you can raise energy dancing drumming having sex when I think of Sex Magic I look at it as as sex as the the tool the conduit to gauge that energy get it all kind of bundled up into one big ball and shoot it out to the universe absolutely and we're going to talk about different ways to do that how to focus that energy why you might want to focus that energy in a little bit but another thing that your witchy aunties here want to remind you of is that this does not have to be heteros sex this does not have to be group sex this does not have to be anything other than what you're comfortable with this can be any kind of sex this we're just talking about raising Sexual Energy in a consensual in a fun in a pleasure way just say it you're what you're saying is it can be with a partner or you can be Han Solo that's right with a partner any partner as many partners as you like or as few Partners as you like or no partner or no partner as long as everybody involved including yourself is having a good time and is all on the same page I don't know why everything about this episode is making me think of songs but all I can think of right now is pink it's just you in your hand tonight that's okay too well yeah that's actually a really easy fast way to uh rub out a spell you know oh uhuh there you go right no yeah actually that's probably the easiest way to do sex magic is by yourself one of the things that you just said shell got me thinking because Sex Magic is the tool and and actually having sex follows a lot of the same patterns that casting a spell does it's very similar to the steps of a spell or a ritual yep you start out slow maybe there's breath work maybe you're gazing into each other's eyes or a mirror you start out very gently very slow and you're building that energy and that's when you're kind of stating your intent can I stop you right there and and let me back up just a little bit further prior to that you're going to want to create a space and you're going to want this you're going to work magic this is like you said either a spell or a ritual that involves in my opinion the whole kitten Kaboodle yes setting the space setting the space you're going to want to cleanse your space you're going to you're going to want to have that altar set up whether you have a separate altar or you make your bed or hey if you're a lot of fun your kitchen counter um your altar you're going to want to create that magical space and then get into the things you're starting to talk about it's the same thing in a spell that's what you're doing you state your intent you set the space for your magical working same thing with ritual yeah yeah so they match and so they they work very well to do sex as your spell so like shell said setting up the space is going to be your first thing it is a magical spell so some of the things you should start out with is making sure that the space is sacred that the space is set up to your intent you know and and it can be all of the fancy pancy romantic things too you know light your candles what I would suggest is let's say your intention is for I know maybe you're trying to get a new job um and that's what you're raising energy for you might want to surround the room and say green candles um things that are related you know just like a spell you're going to want to use all of those corresponding things whether it be you're going to burn some incense uh in in your space make that incense or buy that incense that is conducive to your goal let's say getting a new job and then you know if you're going to light candles make sure the colors correspond lay out some crystals again build an altar or if your if your bed or whatever it may be your kitchen counter is your is your space where you're going to raise your energy make it feel like an altar do the things that you would do if you were going to create space to do that ritual or do that spell by another means you're going to do the same things yeah treat the sexual act just like you would a spell and and just like you said make sure you can use blankets or pillows uh sheets that are in the color that match you know like like you said maybe you want gold and green for success and for money for this and it's easier for people especially in a sexual situation to kind of Go off into sex space you know you're having so much fun that you forget the purpose of why you're there so setting your space has the the double intention of it's helping you to get into the right heads space the right magical vibration it's also a good reminder when you're starting to get really aroused and having a really good time and and you know you're starting to lose connection maybe with reality and just think very sexy happy Feelgood thoughts being able to see those green candles and that green scarf hanging off your headboard will remind you oh right I'm raising this energy towards getting a new job and so you can direct that energy towards that I got another tip for that because this is more about the magic you're working and the energy you're raising to direct your purpose and not so much about the actual Act of sex you can say have a picture you know maybe if you're trying to do something that involves success um or something of that nature maybe you're looking like I said a job or or to buy a house maybe have a picture of that house or or have a picture of what that intention is because we all know that sometimes in the throws you are just your mind goes left turn when you're not thinking it's going to and if you have like a A visual representation that can be what keeps you on task so to say I recommend tape that right to your headboard tape it to your ceiling over your bed tape it to the mirror at the foot of your bed but put it somewhere where your eyes will naturally Gaze on it so that it's easy to see yeah um another good thing and I I know that you are a big sigil person is body paints are fun by the way I just want to put that out there yeah you could take body paints and maybe paint sigils on each other of again it could be something success related or or whatever your end goal is whatever your intention is and use sigils you can use body paints or you know if you don't want to write them on paper and stick that paper up on your headboard but the nice thing about sex magic is you can get super creative and have have a good time doing your magic and speaking of preparation like you were talking about preparing the room earlier you can also prepare your symbols earlier it's a really good idea to meditate ahead of time to create a Sigil for your intent to pick a picture for your intent ahead of time and kind of charge that image with the goal that you want for the spell like pre-charge it get it all set up and ready and if you're going to have a partner and if you're going to be doing sex magic with a partner you definitely want their input and and and all of that as well because really you're both working towards this goal obviously if you are doing this solo rock on with your bad self but with a partner go over these things prior you know make sure you're both on the same page because if you're directing your energy towards one thing and your partner is directing it towards something different you're going to kind of negate each other and then it's just sex at that point because you just killed the magic you negated each other's other's intentions so if you're going to do that prior do it with your partner so that you're you're both on the same page with with where you're directing this energy the other good thing with using a Sigil for that is that if you follow the chaos magic the Austin Osman spare version of sigils he really likes the the create it and forget it idea where you create the sigil and then you try to forget the exact wording you try to forget the reasoning why you created the sigil so Sex Magic works well for that because if you create the sigil ahead of time and then put the sigil somewhere where you'll remember it or write it on your body in Lube or in body paint then as you're having sex and raising energy through Sexual Energy you can direct that to the sigil then if you kind of forget where you're at or why you're doing the sex magic a little bit that's exactly what you're supposed to do with sigils anyway so it'll help make it work even more I could tell you from personal experience you want to be prepared prior to because you ain't going to be thinking this stuff out during that's a good point and when you're doing sex magic when you're raising energy with a partner it's a really good idea to follow some tantric breathing historically Tantra and calini energy has all been associated with sex and sexual magic and there is something to be said for starting slow with some breath work at the very beginning especially if you're doing this with a partner because that's you can really set your intention while you're just kind of playing with each other a little bit where things are still kind of slow and you can focus on your breathing a little bit more you can intentionally breathe you can say certain words to trigger your spell but that's where you're a little more mentally present and you can really set the intention for this act and for your spell so that later when you're really raising that energy and you're really having fun and you're focusing more on your pleasure and their pleasure it's easier to direct the energy set up the framework ahead of time like I said there there ain't a lot of thinking going on so make sure the less thinking you have to do during the better yeah and you know maybe you don't have things like you know maybe you can't go out and get you know sheets that are colored to match what you're doing or things like that it can just be turn on your your monitor to your computer and have it just light up your room gold or light your room up purple you know you can you can do these things with color and that is that is one thing I like is is kind of the color aspect cuz color it's the same with the sigil you know I don't have to think about you know XYZ but yellow it's almost like my brain can associate yellow with with the intention of you know what I'm saying so absolutely I love that I I really like your monitor idea because I was going to say like those LED strip lights that you can set to different again you might not be able to afford those and if you don't have those your computer monitor is a really great idea I love that I'm all for cheap solutions here that's a good one shell I like it but the color I think color Association is another good thing for folks especially if you maybe you can't have C maybe you're in an apartment and can't have candles um you know maybe you can't burn incense whatever the case may be that's where I think that go basic basic is just as good as long as you have something to Focus your intention on okay and speaking of focus intention that's the next step of this whole process so now you've created your idea you know what you're doing the spell for you know why you're raising this energy and you've set that you've set that down you're you're getting ready for a little self Love Session you've set your intention you're ready to go now is when that energy is going to start building you know you're going to start building towards orgasm hopefully you're going to start building towards really good feeling and so that energy is going to be raising and you want to direct that towards something there's two different things I recommend for this part do tell one is Raising it and directing it towards an object like a candle or something uh like say we'll take your idea of doing this for a new job so ahead of time youve created a Sigil for your new job for money for success and you've got a green candle to represent that success during the initial phase of your sex spell you can take the candle and envision that as being the focus of your energy maybe take your lube and write your sigil on the candle in lube and have it someplace where you can see it and then as you're pleasuring yourself as you're raising this energy direct it all towards that candle push it all into that candle and as your arousal grows so to grows the energy direct it all towards that candle then later once you orgasm and you push that huge powerful bolt of energy into the candle come down ground finish your spell now you have a candle every time you light it is releasing some of that energy over time to kind of help you get a little bit of oomph every day when you light it what kind of oomph well in this case the oomph is directed towards your job right the second one is an energy ball and we'll talk about that in a minute now I I wanted to mention something that I was doing a little research on this prior and I came across the grand idea that I never thought of and that is you were talking about raising energy and masturbation and stuff and I wanted to mention charging any extracurricular toys you may have under the full moon oh yeah charging your tools for this spell before you go into the spell okay right but it might be a huge dildo it's still a tool that's true it is I mean maybe maybe you don't want to dildo on your window sill but you'll figure out a way but you're going to want to treat your your tools just like you would any of your other magical tools yeah charge your Lube just like you would Moon water under the full moon sure exactly exactly because again this is more about magic and a spell and energy work and not the focus isn't on the sex at that point even if you have like say you do charge Lube maybe that's the lube bottle you use for Sex Magic and then you have different that you'll use for Tuesday night you know honestly I think you should because I do very much believe that sex is magical that all acts of love and pleasure are her rituals sex is it's Primal it's magical and I know in our culture we have a lot of Shame and a lot of Hang-Ups and there's a lot of pain around it because a lot of us I don't know if I want to say I'm one on the episode but a lot of us have had a lot of pain and a lot of sexual repression and assault there's a lot of bad things but I want to reclaim it trauma a lot of trauma and it took me a long time it took me working with Lilith actually which is a different episode but to reclaim a lot of that sexuality so I am not afraid of any part of sexuality any longer but I do understand that people can have a lot of Hang-Ups about it part of healing from that part of going forward from that I think is embracing the idea that whatever you use to help you get pleasure whether it's a toy or Lube can be sacred it is sacred it is part of your magical tools and there's nothing wrong with that they are sacred and magical is like Florida water there you go that's my that's my statement for today Lube is like Florida water please don't use Florida water like Lube it'll sting like a m that'll sting really bad don't do it you might itch but reclaim these things there's power in that and and I know it's not as easy as just saying that trust me I've been there done that but you can find power here and and you should treat these things as sacred and as magical put them out under the Moonlight cleanse them with smoke cleanse them with with water and just like with crystals make sure you're cleansing them with something that's not going to harm them or you and if you aren't sure ask your local adult bookstore and they'll tell you how to clean there you go that's a good idea but charge them under the full moon charge them with your intent before you get into the sexual situation and just like your other magical tools they will add their energy to your working you know I think and I know you've already touched on this a little bit but I think my biggest point of advice when utilizing Sex Magic is we're not we're not running you know we're not running a 50 yard dash here folks like this isn't jump in and get to it like you're in it for you're you're in it for the slow go the most effective way I have found personally it's a process you know light touching light kissing then you move on to kind of heavy petting geez I sound like my mother you're building up to it you're not just you know jumping right in the river you know you're you're climbing that Hill slowly before you jump in that River so you want to you want to build it up you're not just going to smack start right in with full-on energy you got to gradually build that up and I think the misconception is let me cast a circle and let's [ __ ] people you know no you know you kind of have to I almost want to say foreplay is the biggest part of Sex Magic honestly in eastern mysticism there's this idea of tantric sex and there's um the idea of calini energy and Tantra is a practice that originated in India in both Hinduism and Buddhism it's a way to connect yourself with a Divine in witchcraft in wiah sex is also considered to be a way to connect to the Divine and to be divine it's the idea of sacred sexuality and in Tantra specifically they talk a lot about breath and breath work and meditation and like you said it's a slow process with a partner or with yourself in the beginning you a lot of times focus on breath and on being centered and on the idea that this is a spiritual practice and with calini you start with your root chakra the base of your spine and You Begin by moving that energy up each of those energy centers from the base of your spine all the way up to your crown at the top of your head you awaken that sexual serpent that calini serpent that's dormant at the base of your spine and you wake her up and she climbs these energy centers till she reaches your enlightened Center at your your third eye and you do that before you slam it all the way back down to your root chakra and you know so it's a process you do that whole process and that will help bring you to these higher energies so in the time that I have delved into and practiced Sex Magic there's been kind of two if you want to call them guides so to say that I've gone back to one of them is going to itely be the Kamasutra for everything you just said all the reasons you just said but another one and this is a book that I've had for a long time and honestly I don't even know if it's still in print but it is modern Sex Magic the secrets of erotic spirituality by uh Donald Michael Craig those two books combined kind of what gave me my basis for My Views and practice of Sex Magic the Kamasutra that is a very indepth book I guess boy if you need a new position check out the K Sutra but those those two books kind of gave me the basis of how I Incorporated sex and sexual energy into my magical workings and I'll list those as well as sex sorcery and Spirit by Jason Miller uh the saders Kiss by storm fairy wolf there's also oldie but a goodie Celtic sex Celtic Sex Magic for couples groups and solitary practitioners the ethical [ __ ] always a good one but we will put all of those books in the show notes as well a big idea with Sex Magic is to really feel yourself as Divine to really understand that that you yourself in all your forms are Divine and who's to say that the Big Bang wasn't a big orgasm to start the whole world right like sex is creation the act of sex is creation doesn't always have to be a baby or a child you know this Act of Creation this Primal energy can be used to create all sorts of things in your life and and that's exactly where your intentions are going to come into play because that is what you are creating you are create you're taking your intention and creating a path for it to come to fruition exactly just like in any spell and I mentioned earlier I talk about the second way to raise energy and that's more of a thought form that's more of like an energy ball that's not as fun instead of putting the energy into a candle you as you're having sex as you're feeling this energy rise up in your body you just push it into the idea of a an energy ball either at your Center or above you you yourself or you and your partner or Partners just push all of that energy into this idea of an energy ball kind of like the wick and cone of power like the idea of a wick and cone of power but this is just a big ball that you push all the energy to and then at orgasm you fill that ball with that powerful energy and push it out to the universe for your manifestation to cast your spell you know I think the key to this is visualization honestly and that's an art form and and you know you're not always going to I don't want to say practice makes perfect but damn it practice makes perfect it really does you know you kind of have to if you are not a good person at visualization and and this is a path you want to go down you know you might not be 100% successful the first go round because you have to kind of hone in on that which again circles back to setting up the atmos you know pictures yeah if you're not comfortable with yourself it might take a few solo times or a few times with a partner that you trust until you feel comfortable enough to incorporate that into your spellwork you know maybe you don't feel empowered when you're naked or When You're vulnerable like that maybe you're not feeling that deity energy within you that feels sensual and strong you know that might take time to get there to find that I just like saying practice makes perfect there are a few misconceptions about sex magic one you do not have to have sex with someone to enter into their coven okay I'm sure there's coven out there if you're into that cool but don't let anybody force you to have sex or tell you it's a requirement if you're not feeling it right for real how do you feel about this one shell I hear a lot about people being worried about creating soul ties by using the energy of of Sex Magic or having sex with someone to bind them particularly when you're on your period how do you feel about that that if that is true someone should have told me that when I was 23 years old I don't think it's true little too late to the game no I don't think that's true I think that you can manifest that to happen yeah but is that just Rando happening with every person who you're poking and prodding no yeah having sex with someone certainly can increase chemically the connection with them you know that raises that what is it oxytocin or whatever the kind of love hormone or chemical so it can do that it can definitely help but you're not creating soul ties out here just by having sex with someone on the full moon or you know when you have your period or when you really want them to have a soul tie with you that's not necessarily going to happen if that was the case like I said someone should have told me that when I was like 22 I do feel that sexual fluids your bodily fluids are very powerful you know after you come if you take some of that and write that sigil you know with your own come on on the candle then that's pretty powerful you know if you use your period blood if you use semen whatever you use those can be powerful ways to charge sigils or to add to your spell but be ethical folks don't hijack other people's bodily fluids and don't give other people bodily fluids without their intention I know there's some spells out there that call for that so there's a lot of goddesses out there that you can call to Aphrodite is a big one that people talk about the uh Greek goddess love and S and romance this is where I'm going to disagree with you for a sec what's that you know how I am I I I can't I just I am a one deity kind of gal okay I understand and I get it trust me more so than a lot of folks hkat is not really a love goddess okay but we have a relationship and that is who I call on for everything no matter what it is so I I get that that that's Aphrodite specialty but someone like me is still going to call hiate okay monotheist if you are not monotheistic like shell and you would like to call upon a different goddess you can certainly call on any deity that you like Shell's going to call upon hkat for any workings that she does my my point is is it doesn't have to necessarily like if you have a if you have a a relationship with a specific deity it doesn't you don't have to Veer away from that you know if you're doing love magic it's not like it's going to be less potent if you're not working with Aphrodite I guess is my point and I'm going to disagree disagree I do disagree I do I do I think that hiate embodies certain energies and I think she is brilliant and fabulous and wonderful for that but if I want to do some type of Love magic I'm not calling hiate I'm calling afite or Anana I'm calling Freya calling Venus I'm calling aarte I'm calling a definite Goddess that embodies that energy not hiate do you think I'm wrong no I think that definitely works for you and I don't think you're wrong at all I think that for some people if you have that one-on-one relationship with a deity and you want to call them for everybody that's your prerogative you have that relationship with that deity for me I like to call a deity that embodies the specific energies that I would like to work with so that would kind of like feel like when we talked in a episode just recently about trying to use a chalice for Earth it would feel wrong to me if I'm trying to get I'm trying to get all sexy with my partner I want to embody Aphrodite I would not feel sexy and hot and ready to go fool around embodying Pate powerful [ __ ] yes but sexy not necessarily yikes I almost feel like you can be a warrior goddess and be sexy oh absolutely and I agree with you I think that's great maybe I just need to expand my my Horizon you I and you know this I I've been so entrenched with hkat for so long that it just could be a convenience thing for me but I don't I don't want to spend too much time on this but maybe I need to explore your options more I do think if you do have a specific deity that you are working with that deity more than likely unless they're a celibate deity I don't see why they wouldn't be willing to work with you for love romance or sex just because that's not their thing right so yeah but I did hear a couple cool things that I wanted to share tell particularly in Norse culture did you know that being sexually satisfied was considered to be like a vital part of marriage and there is actually in the sagas in the edas there is a tale about a woman who asks for and is given a divorce because her husband's not able to uh make her happy in bed damn right here in America we're not very sexually breed but definitely in history people were and Freya apparently got her pick of bed Partners from any new soldiers that went to Valhalla Freya would get to choose her bed Partners first out of all of them lucky girl right fun stuff sex and paganism is considered to be a natural part of life it's considered to be powerful and magical it's also considered to be sa and equal everybody is equal everybody is allowed to have fun everybody is allowed to have their own boundaries in paganism we tend to be a little more free and open and ready to accept sexuality in all of its forms even if it's none right you know I think that is one major thing with the Pagan Community is whatever floats your boat floats our boat too yeah as long as you're not hurting anybody you're not hurting yourself as long as you're getting consent as long as everybody's there and present and making good choices for themselves go for it we're not going to yuck your yum do what you want you do you you do you if you have to you do you that's right that's right and for Sex Magic it's really a lot easier to control the energies or to direct the energies when it's just yourself to be honest it's way easier that way like I said referring back to Pink it's just you in your hand tonight that's right I think you know I I think we did Cover a good chunk of this but obviously this is a very personal and and deep subject that if it is something that you're interested doing is we say with anything else do your research make sure that above everything intention is key you always have to have the intention for any magical working and this is no different and my big my big thing is set the setting setting is everything and for people who have trouble visualizing setting is extremely important the more your space can remind you of your purpose the easier it is to Direct Energy to that purpose you want to have the whole mood be set and ready for you and I think that's vital in Sex Magic because you don't want to Veer off course and it's easy to do when you kind of get caught up in in that energy is it's very powerful energy so set and setting is really important have everything all set up ahead of time make sure you have some food and some water for hydrating and grounding afterwards to help you get back into your body and back out of that energetic space and check in with yourself you know check in with your partner check in with yourself make sure that you know you still feel good about all of it afterwards and things are still going well because this is pretty powerful energy that's a lot of energy to be throwing around and then you know again like with any ritual type setting like we've always said you know there's going to be like okay now we've had an orgasm now what you know the the same things you're going to want to ground you're going to want to Center that same process that you would do with any other working M and I think that again it's kind of interesting how having a really fun time fooling around with someone and having sex just this the natural things you would do there how easily they follow along with doing a spell so get your groove on folks you know I think communication is key intention is key and you know if if you're keeping those things in mind you're just going to have to give it a go and practice makes perfect like I said yeah so you know Leila's going to put some books in the show notes I would suggest maybe checking some stuff out reading up on it a little bit if you're going to utilize as a partner again be open talk to your partner set these intentions and above all else be comfortable and have a good time because if you're not comfortable and you're not having a good time um you're not going to be able to reach your goal reach your orgasm and you know everybody needs a good scream every now and again by working with Sex Magic by working with this energy whether by yourself or with Partners it can be a really wonderful way to get in touch with yourself literally and figuratively to really get in touch with that type of magic and to feel that energy there's something very powerful about doing breath work either concentrating on your breath on your own or with a partner and the magic is in taking your time being intentionally sexy and seductive feeling that delicious deity energy in your whole body that life force of creation that rises up and down your spine and pulls in your root chakra like like sunshine or or like warm honey and whiskey working with that energy can really help you to get in touch with the Divinity that is within you the Divine spark that is always in you damn so I hope you guys all enjoy your Valentine's Day whether you get into the commercial aspect of it and are getting those expensive roses and dinners and jewelry or if you're going a little old school and maybe whipping yourself with a soft leather whip you know you know we're not going to judge I'm voting for freaky decky that's all I'm
