come to Salem Darlene if you are out there it's me it's not you I just want to say that you know we don't we don't really delve into our our personal life issues here different podcast I've had some stuff going on in my personal life I've been very distracted lately there's been times where we've kind of had to almost fight to get air time I just it's me it it's been me dear friend it's not we suck at responding to people let's just put that out there we're we're kind of socially inept and it's just us there is no production crew there's no social media team it's just the two of us so I just I just want to specifically apologize to Darlene because it's totally my fault and I've just been caught up in my own family drama and I am sorry sweetheart and I promise you if you come to Salem again you and I are going to smoke fat joints we're gonna stop at a coffee shop and I will buy you a damn Tarot deck on me I promise so sorry Darlene it's me not you I hope you had a great 420 anyway it's totally us it's us yeah that's one of those textbook definitions of totally my bad so so I'm ping a bowl for Darlene because you suck and I'm smoking this beautiful Jack hair in her honor because it is delicious well because I'm such an [ __ ] I felt the need to apologize and let her know that it's definitely me okay You' apologized enough it's okay I'm likeing now totally graving now stop graveling hit that beautiful crocus purple pipe of yours while I smoke my lovely Jack hair you I was gonna say are you still on that damn Jack hair [ __ ] this is New Jack hair [ __ ] from a different person yes so how do you know it really is Jack hair it tastes very Jack hair it's got that yummy spiciness that I like of a jack hair it's got that kind of middle of the road good Stone I wouldn't say this is bake you into the couch or launch your brain into the stratosphere Stone but it's a good heady high stone makes me happy now you said this was friend weed or store weed friend weed well new friended this is a a local grower that I met not too long ago you know hooking up through local social media and they are super nice super sweet very shy and do not want to be on air thank you very much but you know who you are my nice little Jack hair grower thank you it's delicious uh very green and one of the things that distinguishes a jack hair to me is this spiciness taste it almost has a an incy taste to it and it's very delicious a little black peppery a little in sensy and it's very distinctive once you taste it you kind of know what to look for so sometimes when someone tells me it's a Jack and it doesn't have that sativa high and it doesn't have that spiciness I question kind of question whether it really is a jack hair or not but this one I'm pretty sure is damn you got standards well I know you always grab for the heaviest hitters and while I love a high THC I love a flavor even more get me a little baked but give me that Aroma that taste give me something delicious and different and that's what I'm going to reach for every time so yeah I guess I do have a little bit of Standards I I like flavors I I don't want it to just be gassy and smack me upside the head I wanted to have like a nice delicious taste is that so wrong A girl's got to have some standards I can't just be a smoke everything Stoner okay maybe I can so I'm loving this Jack hair it's definitely delicious this is what I'm racking today it's called Midnight oh now did you go back to Mission oh hell yeah with prices like you talked about last episode I am not surprised that was a great deal especially for Massachusetts and it's on the rag this wasn't just like a one timer really although Mission if anybody who works at Mission is listening it it's time for coupons again folks coupons we like the goodies give out the goodies with each purchase please this brand if you want to call it a brand I guess we have Brands nowadays is Legends so Legends is the brand I really like like this it kind of gives you that now you said it was called midnight Midnight so is it dark is it dark green does it have any purple you want to hear a funny story I've smoked a bunch didn't even look I've literally already smoked a whole eighth of it and I cannot answer your question without looking stuff and smoke stuff and smoke that's no I've been grinding I've been grinding oh nice well nugs nowadays you can't get away with stuff and smoke anymore unless it's somebody's slightly fluffy homegrown because most of the time nugs these days are so freaking dense you have to grind them up to get a good burn I feel like I couldn't survive if I didn't have a grinder remember how against Grinders I was because it was so new my bother you didn't really need one back in the day [ __ ] we didn't have Brands back in the day you had Joe's weed or you had Bob's weed and they had either kind or swag remember Hydro yeah if you were really lucky they had hydro which just meant really good weed did not mean grown in a hydroponic system all you listeners Lila's laughing and she's mocking and she's talking [ __ ] but don't think for a second she didn't show up at my house on several occasions and be like hey sh you want some Hydro or you got Hydro do you know where you could get some Hydro so don't don't don't let her Giggle and fool you oh I was so looking for the hydro I knew what what it meant didn't care wanted to smoke it anyway but this is like a dark green like you know how there's like really light green weed this is like a dark green but crystally as [ __ ] that super dark piny green yeah very crystally but love it like it I had to lay off the stuff I had last week because I was eating too much munchy weed for sure that [ __ ] man yeah anything that's going to make you eat a KFC bowl and sparkly peeps in the same city is bad news right right you got to save that for like right before Thanksgiving dinner or something J but yeah this this is a a 29.5 so right up my alley this is one of those weeds that I Define as you can manipulate the one where make it up or make it kind of mellow I mean maybe because it's like I probably bleed weed at this point I don't know this is one of those I can manipulate and I have manipulated it to get a whole bunch of [ __ ] done and I have manipulated it to put my ass right to sleep so I love it for that because I can gear it in the direction I want it to go in yeah I like those weeds too that's kind of why I like things like this Jack hair it tastes really great and I like to smoke pretty regularly so something that's kind of middle of the road for the day so that I can keep my emotions kind of on an even Keel while I'm getting [ __ ] done I like a middle of the road lower tee phc for that so I can kind of stay functional and then later in the evening or when I can relax on the weekend that's when I'm going to want to reach for you know my personal top shelf stash and grab the really high THC and if I want to go out I'm going to feel up if I want to stay in and game I might be Zony and you know I love those manipulatable weeds well this particular weed I'm loving at the moment because here in the Northeast Mother Nature is a [ __ ] okay call a spade a spade Mother Nature is a [ __ ] this this particular one not only does it have the higher THC but it also has a 1.7 CBD oh nice that would be good for you because I know you sometimes have a little back pain as you know a lot of my back pain has to do like I get really bad when it's like rainy and damp and wet and well they didn't call it April showers for nothing so it's really kind of it's easing the pain from that atmospheric pressure that my back does not like and that dampness that irritates my back I can manipulate the high and it kind of lessens my back issue I love that a little bit of CBD is always nice in my book well usually that's not what I'm looking for as you know and I didn't even notice and I was like o wow I had a back ache and now I don't and then I looked at the jar and I was like oo good call yeah you say you don't notice shell but over the last several episodes you've been asking more and more specific questions I think you're more of a Savvy weed Shopper now than you think you are I blame you oh yeah totally my fault I'll take that I Blame You blame you and the you know the market has been a lot of fun there's so much out there to explore you know it's just really great to have all this information I absolutely love legalization well also one of the great things about legalization is all these awesome people are getting jobs at all of these awesome dispensaries and they are so full of knowledge and so happy to talk to you because I finally can just talk about weed all day yeah they need to keep up with the social social justice aspect of it as well and make sure that they are pardoning people that you know had jail time and and had you know were incarcerated over prohibition fune records yeah they really need to make sure to continue to do that and to make sure that these people have opportunities in these businesses other than outside Mega Million Dollar companies so hopefully they're doing that part right I I'm curious I have one more weed question um and then we can get spooky sure is spring which is essentially what we're in right now is this really where more weed comes out do you do you think I'm not really sure I know that the end of fall when we start having the harvest vegetables you know you have llamas and mabin and sin I know right before sa right after mabin is when most of the weed gets harvested like the outdoor October yeah most of the outdoor weed gets harvested September October um but I don't know if there's any particular fluctuation to indoor weed I think that it pretty much people just grow when they grow so I I don't know this time of year if there's more could be in your area if there's Growers that are all kind of synced up I'm not sure but the only time I know when there's a big predictable influx of weed is in the fall when people are harvesting their outdoor and do you have any news updates on any states going legal or anything with anything new with federal law no but I did just hear that somebody was it Delaware that just went legal o go Delaware but over their Governor's uh yeah actually it was yeah Delaware became the latest state to legalize recreational weed even though their governor was against it yeah he's just one guy right what does he have to say anyways we are a democracy every voice counts so at least he said that he wouldn't veto it so yeah as of like April 23rd is roughly Delaware became the latest state to legalize recreational marijuana I know I'm I'm not putting pressure on you by any means but what are we looking at now like a third of the country legal oh I think it's more than that let's see how many legal states okay let's see here 21 states so we're pushing half the country 21 states are recreational that was as of November 20202 so there's even more now so we're probably pushing 25 now I mean probably yeah not that I want to get all newsy on our listeners but sometimes I like to add tidbits of what's updated and going on if you are from Delaware light one congrats this bowl is for you so now that we've covered our weedy weed now we got to get spooky spook yeah what have you got today I've got something pretty good you know I have like some hidden dream to be a princess in a castle absolutely you love the royal family right which by the way I'm so gearing up for the coronation coming up in a few weeks so to all of our friends in the UK I will be watching don't you worry I will be watching she will she will and damn it I'll be drinking tea oh yeah she'll be doing that too hopefully smoking a joint too in honor of the king well you know he is quite the environmentalist I'm not so sure he's against weed interesting interesting I guess it will remain to be seen could they go legal recreational marijuana in the UK in 2023 I don't know if you're from the UK give us your opinion at the stone Witches Hour gmail.com let us know so princess what is your story about I found a haunted castle no way I don't know why I know we said we'd switch it up and go all around the country but I'm still stuck on the East Coast so this is in Vermont oh oh I love Vermont that's okay I am also in the east coast I'm in South Carolina o interesting the south is like super ghosty so super ghosty this is not a lady in white story oh my God thank God it's a lady in red story you know I'm gonna go back to the 80s and start singing Lady In Red yeah that's a good one but this is like Vermont's only real castle the first thing that I laughed at and all I could think of is you when I found this me most haunted castle in America of course it is of course it is I love mine is the most haunted theater in America you know I I I'm reading about this story and you know my sweet darling love is here and he's like oh what are you doing and I tell him and I go yeah it's the most haunted and he goes yeah is there a portal to Hell there because there's one of those everywhere too and I'm like well there might be orbs I mean yes orbs wo wo for orbs yay for orbs no portal of hell though no portal of Hell how can they call themselves the most haunted and they don't even have a portal to Hell the Belhurst Castle in New York that we talked about has a portal to maybe hell at least well we both lived in New York at one time in our lives so we know that just the whole state of New York is a portal to hell okay you're not wrong anyone else from New York stay if I am wrong email me because I'm that's true it's true okay good point good point so you have a haunted castle the most haunted castle the most okay this is called the Wilson Castle oh I love a place with a name again Vermont's only real castle it is in Proctor and you know that they've had a little something something because they have had had the History Channel and sci-fi and the Travel Channel actually go there they did Paranormal Cod on camera there wow a lot of people have been there that's impressive quite the pedigree if you've got that lineup of people you got a little bit going on obviously yeah if that many different people want to come and do research there something's up what have they found what's going on there first of all I have to put it out there that you can go overnight really [ __ ] yeah this fall oh Vermont is gorgeous we should go up there oh my gosh road trip shell imagine spending sin in a haunted castle in Vermont holy [ __ ] it's a date let's do it holy [ __ ] that's probably the only way we could top sa in Salem that we did last year it's like sleep in a damn haunted castle Lord oh my gosh we need to make that happen as much as I'm [ __ ] around and find out I'm also the first one freak out and crying ah yeah that's funny I always grab Lea like somehow she's going to save me um but anyway this I can't remember at the moment how old it is but it's been considered haunted since Cornell Wilson bought it in 1939 part of this Castle had like a children's quarters okay like you know how back in the day used to do that right they had like a whole kids Wing right once they reached a certain age then they went to like their regular room but until then they were in the children's Wing God I wish my parents did that in the children's Wing they would talk about these old women who would come and like tend to them and play with them and sing songs to them some of their nurses or something well they weren't there they were ghosties oh creepy I never really found the origin of some of the ghosts but the children would always talk of these women that they would come they'd read stories they'd sing songs rock them in the rocking chair oh I hate those now did the children know that they were ghosts or just think that they were caretakers they just yeah oh wow so then they'd go and they'd be like oh you know Ann read me a story and they'd be like who the [ __ ] is an okay wow one day one of the kids went and told one of the parents the parent went to that side and wanted to see who this person was they found one of the other children rocking in the rocking chair in a position that looked like they were sitting on a knee holding someone but there was no one in the rocking chair with them that's so creepy now [ __ ] if a ghost wants to [ __ ] around with me I am all for it I am game I am I'm I'm [ __ ] around and find out but leave my kids alone my kids yeah no no no no no no no not my kids not my kids come on and don't rock in the rocking chair that's like the creepiest thing you can do that's bad don't do that every time you see a ghost story with a rocking chair somebody dies oh it's awful so he kept saying the owner guy kept saying that the kids were playing tricks because he didn't want people to think it was haunted because this was actually a 32 room house now when you're thinking back to like 19309 32 room house like what the hell that's a lot of house so he would try to rent out rooms now back then nobody is going to rent out a room in a haunted place uh hello have you met us well we would but not in 1939 good point good point this is well past the time of uh spiritualism in the United States I joked about a portal to hell okay there is is a supposed portal here not to hell though it has what they call six or seven frequent flyers I don't know if you'd want to call a ghost a frequent flyer but hey everybody just a weird turn of phrase do they mean just like ghosts that keep coming back yeah okay I would call them ghostly residents but they call them frequent flyers whatever so they have like six or seven that haunt these 32 rooms but they think that there's a portal in the upstairs closet Narnia that allows other spirits to go in and out of the castle so there's six they think that stay there but there's a portal that allows even more spirits to kind of come and go yeah oh damn okay and they describe it as in quotes it's not like you're gon to be scared at the door but the door will play tricks on you oh like what kind of tricks is a door playing on me right seriously is it just swinging back and forth is it locking and I mean we've heard of doors that lock on their own what's it do I don't know I don't know so creepy maybe we have to go there to find out guests have reported hearing voices um music being played and when Travel Channel and those folks went there they actually confirmed all of this stuff wow I don't know if Zack baggin himself went but there are 13 listen to this and you know how like you and I are superstitious the castle itself is 13,31 square ft it has 13 fireplaces this almost sounds like it had to have been done on purpose the guy it says 13 doesn't have any significance here dude I'm sorry but it's the same backwards and forwards really there's like servants quarters as well and really this guy just wanted to make this go away because back in this particular period you're not making money with ghosts a 2023 where you're doing ghost tours yeah right nowadays people probably snapping those properties up left and right in the 50s and 60s they were taking pictures a lot that's when kind of Photography where the everyday Joe was able to take pictures Kodak they were able to go back and look at some of these pictures and could see a CH a child standing behind someone who was at the mirror oh wow a child that wasn't really there I'm guessing yes almost like the child came from the mirror oh super creepy so because it was so big and and how they had it kind of like a little not really a hotel think bed and breakfasty was really how it was described they had servants bedrooms they believe that the servants areas had like more of an evil energy than the rest of the castle and because like I said I couldn't really find the origin of the ghosts or when the castle was built that could be in my opinion and I'm just pulling here out of thin air there could have been some slave usage around that time workers not being treated well we've done stories where hired help was treated horribly and came back and kind of haunted the place I think that what they describe maybe as evil could be angry right we found places that have that type of long-term systemic abuse really does hold on to that negative energy and can kind of just contribute to perpetuating that type of energy and you know people kind of feeling that negative vibe whenever they're there right and and they think that there they do think that there is a woman named Sarah Johnson who see and this is where kind of the history of the castle itself gets a little fishy some call her the original homeowner and some say that she was like the second or third owner of of this place but she did own it from 1885 to 1892 and she's considered one of the frequent flyers kind of the this is my house I live here just because I died doesn't mean I'm going we found that a lot with people who build particularly the these older grand houses they tend to stay there even if they didn't happen to die in the house a lot of them are so connected to it that they stay and then I did read that she did have two children and one of her children ended up dying um of spinal menitis so again the children ghosts maybe that ghost in the mirror I am going to assume is probably that child that would make sense if her child died and kind of stayed in the house when the mother dies it's like you're not leaving your kid your kid's there you're staying it makes it much more likely that her soul would stay there as well as you can imagine I mean we're both we're both moms and thank everybody out there we never had to experience this but I'm sticking with my kids in this life and the afterlife period y absolutely it's totally a mom thing to do for sure done deal so I think that that some of the ghosts maybe Sarah Johnson and her her child didn't get the child's name they also think that she's watching over this portal they believe that she stays in that top bedroom where this like doorway is they don't say where it's a portal to just that it's in the closet yeah that's why I joked and said Narnia do they know I might be getting ahead of myself but do they know what caused it no not that I'm finding I mean Lord if there's anybody around from Vermont who knows the history please because now I'm intrigued um but they just think that Sarah Johnson is with her child watching over the portal interesting that's weird all I can think of and tell me if I'm crazy in this particular thing not overall please think of like sin where they say the veil is the thinnest and and Spirits can kind of travel in and out more freely yeah all I can think of is this is like a permanent open Veil yeah that's what it sounds like maybe it's like a thin spot between this world and the afterworld maybe there's been times where they've had even most recently um in the early 2000s they've let people stay there and it got cold at night and the people woke up in the morning and thanked the hosts for turning up the heat and they're like we didn't turn up the heat oh wow so that portal gets hot no I think it's the ghosts like oh it's cold in here let's help everybody out by turning up the heat for them oh helpful like the ghosts literally turn up the heat but there is a story the guy who currently owns it he had a group of women stay overnight and they stay stayed in Sarah's bedroom where the portal is remember and the next morning they made a comment about the Heat and they said that they heard the furnace kick on in the basement and felt the hot air coming out of the grate and the owner said the furnace broke three weeks ago and we haven't gotten it fixed yet the furnace couldn't have kicked on it doesn't work and they heard it kick on and they felt the hot air through the gate no [ __ ] furnace my jaw is on the floor no heck that is so creepy but like they're doing it in like a caring way they're like oh you're cold let's make you warm they've had investigators there they actually don't think they ever got to speak to Sarah but one of the investigators for the first time ever their grandmother came through to the point where that person was in tears that person try but the kick is that that investigator had spent many years trying to reach out to the spirit of the grandmother never made connection until they were in Sarah's bedroom in this castle at this house so that portal is such a thin spot that even a difficult to get a hold of spirit can get through there apparently wow like a really easy Gateway I mean they spoke some of these investigators there was an investigator called Jackie Kurt and she's from ghost hunts USA she took in pendulums dowsing rods she felt like she spoke to a ghost named Christopher that was in the Navy but again no real backstory on who Christopher is he could have been someone that rented a room there at some point because it seems like from the late 1800s all the way up until around 2000 that this was kind of like a I think hotel is over glorifying it bed and breakfast is minimalizing it but somewhere in between a hotel and a bed and breakfast you know what I mean yeah some people they have had a nightlight on and it just went out wouldn't work but then when they left there and used a nightlight somewhere else it was fine cell phones all the sudden don't work when you're in that bedroom near this portal well we found from our own experience in haunted location that electrical disturbances are one of the first signs of some type of strange energy in an area now I know our listeners can't see this but I just I have to show this to you because this place just reeks haunted oh wow that's really cool doesn't it just wreak ghost activity yep you need to put a picture of that up on the Instagram for sure because you look at it and you say oh yeah that that house is definitely [ __ ] haunted don't you feel like something should be looking out a window at you that's not really there that's what I I feel like there something's looking out a window at me that's not totally there I'm pretty sure there are at least three ghosts in that picture alone and you know Vermont very wooded very I mean I am not down in Vermont but very desolate kind of the whole state very wooded it's like the ader andex on steroids it's like to have a castle like that in the middle of the woods it's beautiful it's haunted as [ __ ] you can tell just by looking at it bucket list oh yeah for sure it's pencil it's penil then sh when we do our road trip we're there you know people don't talk about nothing mean or hurtful it's like I'm getting poked I'm hearing singing um someone's turning the furnace up when it's not even working I think these people are just home yeah they're there to stay and it sounds like there's a lot of visitors there too nowadays this is owned by a guy who is more than happy to do ghost tours aren't they all nowadays I know they are like this is just one of those you know not a lot of crazy stuff but like why did they build it at 13,113 Square ft why 13 fireplaces why is this built on 113 acre estate exactly who the hell buys property that's exactly 113 with 13 fireplaces in 13 131 Square ft you can do that backwards and it's the same and it looks haunted they built it to be haunted something's up here I need more history like I need to know was the original Builder like a Mason did he have some sort of paranormal connection I got I got one more thing I have to tell you about this place just off the hook so you know how a lot of these places like to restore back to its authentic original blah blah blah yeah those [ __ ] keep a wicker casket in the ballroom why is there a wicker casket in the ballroom I I got no words no reason it's just there that's the most morbid decoration I mean that's just strange when I was researching this place it just talks about the Wicker casket in in the ballroom it doesn't give any other freaking description and then I read something else where it says you can rent it out and have the perfect wedding of your dreams but the Wicker casket stays apparently I mean you and I would have a wicker casket and a haunted casket have stuff that looks like Halloween stuff up all the time but a casket in the ballroom for some place that doesn't tout itself as like a spooky well maybe they do I don't know they have a whole spooky theme going on maybe that's why well they have a lot of Far Eastern and European Antiques and Museum pieces and I'm a stickler on that you start bringing Antiques and Museum [ __ ] in you might as well be given ghosts an invitation oh yeah absolutely you're asking them to come in that's still doesn't explain the Wicker casket though weird I kind of like it I want to see it or the whole 13 13 13 stuff I know I need to know more so if you're from there please let us know the stoned witch isour gmail.com so as as much as I didn't find all the answers I was looking for I sure as hell want to go there now me too I definitely do I want to stay in that room I want to research the Builder I want to go in Sarah's portal where are we going yeah we're going to be doing the board in the closet in the closet if we took our our homemade Ouija board in the closet our asses will be a Narnia oh yeah we'll be talking to a lion Before Dawn right so what do you got what do you got well I don't have any talking Lions but I do have a lady in red ghost Lady in Red so I did not know that lady in red ghost were kind of a thing but according to Wikipedia they are are they like the opp are they the opposite of lady and white a little bit lady and whites tend to be women who died tragically around their wedding or with their lover or their lover broke up with them or their children were murdered and or murdered by them lady and red ghost tend to be women of the night o I like those type of women and this particular ghost is no exception so we're going to South Carolina Charleston South Carolina to be exact what year it started out as a theater actually and it was first built in 1735 and its grand opening occurred on February 12th 1736 oh [ __ ] that's old it's touted as being the first theater in the USA that was actually built to be a theater prior to that most theaters were in somebody's home or in a bar or a Tavern type of thing right so this was the first building legitimately built to be theater and it is called the doc Street Theater now was this supposed to be a legitimate theater or one of those hey baby kind of theaters it's been both it started out as a theater only was there for about four years and it burnt down in the Charleston fire of 1740 then it was replaced with another theater that operated for about 40 years there and that closed down in 1780 mostly because a bigger theater was built somewhere else that is when it became what is known as the Planters Hotel so it was purchased by a couple Mr and Mrs Alexander Calder and they renovated it to be the um the Planters Hotel they decided to do that because at the time Charleston was really big with horse Racers and with a lot of the different plantation owners in the area people needed a place to stay they needed a fancy place to stay and to meet with their fancy high class class hookers and do all their racing bets and that type of thing so the planter Hotel was created can I just say I love high class hookers so after playing the ponies all these rich wealthy plantation owners would stay there and get up to all sorts of antics in the planter Hotel they also still had uh roving theater groups would perform there and they had art shows and all sorts of different things like that happened as well so during this time one of we call we'll call it a cultural center yeah there you go that's what you could call it if you want during this time one of the most famous actors that came to the Planters hotel to perform on its stage was a man named Junius Brutus Booth who at the time was a very famous Shakespearean actor who was much sought after and I see your face you're trying to place where you know the name I'm going John wils Booth here he's John wils Booth's dad ding ding ding ding ding no [ __ ] no [ __ ] none other than the infamous John wils Booth who went on to shoot President Lincoln in a theater by the way in a theater well John wils Booth was an actor also just like dear old dad and dear old dad was also known to have a very quick temper and a huge f fondness for alcohol a lot of people did in that time though that's true so at one time he was headlining at the Planters hotel and apparently was had a little bit too much to drink and went off about something I'm not sure what and almost killed the hotel's manager in an altercation if I say like father like son am I mean no no it's kind of true kind of true in this case I mean [ __ ] John wilss Booth I mean ser you anyway right now one of the ghosts that's said to haunt The Dock Street Theater is Junius Booth even though he did not die there he died in a whole different state but it said that he loved that theater so much and performing there so much that his Spirit could not and I believe that yeah that that there can be an attachment yeah now some people say that's a stretch but his ghost is seen backstage it's this is an older man that's often scene kind of hiding in the shadows backstage it could also be some other actor that died there but everyone is insists that it is Junius Booth again he's mostly just seen kind of lurking on stage um in the audience sometimes people will feel him kind of breathing down their neck because he was known in life to be kind of a close talker and in particular he would lurk behind people and kind of loom over them I hate that type of person oh my God so his ghost is still known to do that to this day um and sometimes he's even known to touch people inappropriately or to touch them in the audience I know people like that that are still alive whatever right I guess he's no better as a ghost I'm just stuck on he's John wils Booth's father right now a few years after Junius Booth got into the altercation with the manager there was a woman named nety Dickerson who came to town nety was about 20 5 years old and she came to Charleston from like the surrounding Countryside a poor girl you know from the country didn't know much of anything in the 1840s to be 25 years old and single that was kind of unheard of she was you know on the Shelf she's an old maid and she was hoping to find a husband in Charleston but unfortunately what she found was a whole lot of snobbery a bunch of [ __ ] and people who considered that she was a good seven to eight years out of date at 25 at 25 I mean [ __ ] makes me feel cow now Lord that that's a [ __ ] idea then and a even more [ __ ] idea now so she's heartbroken you know she's still got to find work and she she manages to befriend um a priest of one of the local churches I believe it was St Phillip's church she gets a job there as a clerk and she gets room board you know just a little tiny bit of pay which she consistently saved because she doesn't have anything else to do nobody wants to go out with a 25-year-old woman even though she's said to be quite beautiful and that's when prostitution comes into play folks they won't marry her but they'll screw her right St Philip's Church apparently is very close to what at the time was the Planter's hotel and so Netty with her little tiny room had firsthand view of all the beautiful women and the fancy men that went in and out of this hotel she knows everybody's gossip that's right she does she saw these women partying they had drinks they were on the arms of the most wealthy men in town and they seemed to be well-respected nobody cared she decided that she wasn't going to take it anymore so she took her savings and she went downtown to the fanciest dress shop she could find and she picked out the most gorgeous fancy dress that that shopkeeper had in a deep Scarlet Red so that she would be as noticed as possible my kind of girl right she put on this gorgeous dress and above the priest's objections she decided to head on down to the Planter's hotel and make her way as a lady of the night you go girl you go girl nety became an immediate hit she was smart she was funny she was gorgeous but not good enough to marry for some reason [ __ ] good enough to have a great time with now Net's living the high life she continues to go to church every Sunday at St Phillips and sees the priest who had befriended her and he keeps trying to talk her out of her life of sin at church is where she sees the men with their wives that she has been sleeping with all week that's how it was back then that is now these women like to look down their nose at poor netti and she's like yeah well who who's giv the booty to your man you're not wrong and she wasn't quiet about it nety was tired of being the little church mouse and was not about who killed her well we're getting there I mean I'm just theorizing here this was the beginning of the end because she didn't keep her mouth shut she was more than happy to remind those women where their men had been spending their night loose lips and ships man yeah she had kind of a Sharp tongue and was very full of herself and not afraid to give right back to these snotty women and these duplicitous men just what they were giving to her and unfortunately this started leading to a loss in business oh yeah so as her business declined and she she started having less and less fun and of course there's no marriage proposals coming she got more and more distraught so one night she snapped and she apparently she went out on the balcony of her room that overlooks the Main Street wearing her gorgeous Scarlet dress and started going off about the snotty people in the town the shitty men who were Liars shut them out down the women who were catty and [ __ ] and would never accept her even when she was prim and proper you know how terrible it all was and the priest from down the street heard what was happening and you know ran down the street to try and talk her out of this like you said meltdown that she's having in the midst of it it starts to downpour the priest is like Netty you know you can things can change it can be different you know let me help you and Netty screams you can't save me and is struck by lightning ah ah what did she know that she wasn't saying I don't know but right there she died and she is still in the hotel she is seen walking the second floor back and forth on the second floor in her red dress and she's often also seen in the theater now the creepy part shell what she's not seen as the gorgeous prostitute in The Scarlet dress oh my God she like a freaking zombie yes that's exactly how they describe her they say her dress is tattered and she looks terrible like a zombie her face is sunken like she got struck by lightning in the rain like she got struck by lightning exactly all right that would freak that would freak me out okay yeah yeah people say that these sightings are very frequent particularly by people performing in the theater there's even a foreman that was doing renovations in 2008 his name is Isaiah Nesbit and he said that he saw her every single day that he went into work oh [ __ ] recent sightings people said are really strange because they only see her from the knees up not that she's floating from the knees up but almost like she's in the floor and they just see her from the knees up weird yeah until you find out that in 1939 there were Renovations that were done that raised the second floor about a foot she thinks she's walking on the original floor ah isn't that wild that people that don't know that are like it looks like she's kind of floating through the floor at the knees she's walking on the original floor she's walking on the original floor holy [ __ ] interestingly enough no one one that I could find has been here no amateur groups no professional groups I could find no one that has gone is it open it is open there is still a theater there we should definitely go and do an investigation oh man I want to see her halfway through the floor right so the site there is also sightings of a woman in white but nobody knows where she comes from and they just see glimpses of her wandering the hallways but no backstory story to this ghost just that they'll see a woman in white gliding down the hallway that's a lady in Red's territory man exactly moving keep them moving it's definitely Net's territory and uh you know for for a a prostitute in a red dress to be arguing with a priest and struck by lightning is kind of an interesting story poetic very poetic we need to kind of ask her what's going on and and why she's stuck there and is the male ghost in the backstage of the theater is that really Junius Booth or is it some other poor soul that got trapped there I want to ask the lady in red if the priest was a client oh sh you went there I did I did well he sounds like at least he was a very nice guy and cared for her when nobody else did so at least he was trying bet I bet yeah she was popular until her sharp tongue ran away with her well I think we got two new bucket list items tonight we definitely do Vermont to South Carolina quite the road trip I'm down let's do it I want to go sleep in a castle and chat with a lady about hooking up with a priest man go be a princess and be a [ __ ] in the like the span of the same week I'm totally down right up our alley right up our alley absolutely I remember that red dress you used to wear
