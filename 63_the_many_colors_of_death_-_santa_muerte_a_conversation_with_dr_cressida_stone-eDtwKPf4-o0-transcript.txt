welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode shell and I are joined by Dr cresa Stone cresa is a doctor of anthropology from Oxford University she's also a devote of Santa muera a witch a Tarot reader and the author of the book secrets of Santa muera a guide to the prayers spells rituals and hexes hi and welcome Dr cresa welcome thank you so much for having me on the show it's an absolute Delight Santa mua is a Mexican folk Saint a goddess who is the literal embodiment of death she is a guide across Lial spaces from this life to the next she is a protector and she's a granter of wishes if you keep your promises to her and she is considered a benevolent if Stern mistress she is very popular among the disenfranchised and is rising in popularity everywhere now shell and I were talking a little bit before you came on about how the topic of death in the United States is almost Taboo in a sense and our culture regards death with more fear than reverence so a goddess who is literally death is fascinating can you tell us more about her and about the practice that she comes from well I think she's a beautiful goddess because she allows us to reclaim our connection with death which is you know ancient primordial atavistic you know that connection has been there for All Humans since time immemorial because all of us you know our ancestors for centuries and everything on this planet is essentially you know going towards death we're all mortal and we try not to think about it but you know every single living thing around us and even inam inanimate things you know like the computers that we're talking on right now nothing is going to Pure nothing's going to last forever and I think being able to accept that that death is part of life makes us a very powerful faith and and in my mind it's sort of non-dualistic because in the west we kind of try to separate life from death and death is seen as this negative thing we all want to avoid and you know we're all very focused on on life but but in a way we're we're blinded by that and I think it I think it stops us from being grateful in a way for the dayto day because connecting for me with Sant Mor has made me grateful for every breath for every day not just for myself but but the people that that I love and that I care for and then for the many devotees that I've met during my time you know who this work my work is dedicated to Santa and and also to the devotees I've met because so many people that I've met in Mexico and and more recently even in I went to California to to visit devotees in the Inland what they call the Inland Empire and I didn't realize how dangerous it was and how tough lots of chos you know Mexican American people have it there and you know lots of people living on the knife's edge of of life and death and so I think that being able to be grateful for for people being alive every single day and trying to to understand that is is a very very powerful process now I wanted to ask you you know when I I've known Absolut I went into this knowing nothing about this subject I will admit that and so when I was doing some research I had found a couple sources that stated that this was kind of a relatively new thing which obviously it's not but it seems to have become more mainstream could you kind of touch on maybe the the Resurgence of worshiping Santo Marte sure and that's a great Point uh shell obviously it's not a new thing you know and if we look at uh Mexican history and even our global history there' have always been death deities you know and particularly in Mexico we can trace them back really far to pre-colonial time so this is not a new thing but I think there's been a resurgent Resurgence as you point out sh because we you know we're living in tumultuous times and and I think that furthermore some of the the religions that you know we sort of have on offer on the menu and not satisfying to a lot of people for example you know Santa what is a form of sort of folk Catholicism it Blends Catholic practice but also Witchcraft brara and Indigenous beliefs and I think that's a lot more appetizing to people who want to return to sort of the more ancient spiritual paths people who are also interested in in Witchcraft and I and I think people seeking to reclaim as I said earlier that connection with with death which we all have you know and that's a univers connection that we all have and I think that people are very tired of some of the mainstream religions like Catholicism because of the scandals there in right and I think that a lot of people have gone through I mean a lot of devotees that I've met that work with Sant what they have been through trauma of some kind right whether it's a near-death a literal near-death experience right where you nearly die or a loved one nearly dies but it could also be a severe trauma in your life you know your business going bankrupt um sexual harassment right um a terrible breakup with someone that you love all these things can be very distressing and and it can almost feel like you die right you can hit rock bottom and I think that Santa mu because she is not just death She's also life because this is non-dualistic allows you to kind of be reborn but not in the Evangelical sense right more in the sense of kind of accepting that death of the self but to emerge stronger almost like nature you know what does not kill me makes me stronger but I accept you know that that I could potentially you know die tomorrow that things could fall apart but I take strength from from this I really love how you put that you said it's transformative and we're all tarot readers here we all know the death card in Tarot and it doesn't usually mean physical death it has many other meetings a lot of them around major transformation or change major changes in your life the ending of one phase and the beginning of another and like you said some of these major changes in life can feel like death you know what a relationship ends it feels like the end of everything and even though death can be scary in a lot of ways it's also transformative and I think as tarot readers we in inherently understand that and with everything that people are going through the last few years I mean we had covid and everything people are coming face to face with death or maybe their own mortality or with a major changes that we're all kind of going through more often the world as a whole has been having a lot of trauma the last four or five years oh it's been so tumultuous right people who maybe have not had death in the Forefront of their mind so to say have in the last few years whether they like it or not because the the effects of what been going on you know Rich poor third world country first world country like like everybody like you said has been on the knife's edge for the last several years whether we like it or not yeah I mean the economy right inflation global warming I mean in in some Hindu Traditions they talk about this being cuga right that the sort of end times with this figure of K that some people have compared to Santa Muerte although I do believe they're very distinct but you know kie kind of is is connected to death as well so we're living in in very difficult times where we have to deal with so much and S allows us you know as you said Lea to to take the these very intense feelings and transform them into strength and gratitude and all of this but I mean she can just offer you so much she she has this very complex character so she can offer life in so many facets so you know bringing love life you know whether it's a new partner into your life or sweetening things with perhaps someone with whom things have gone sour she can give you economic success riches help you with your business you know uh improve your finances abundance all that kind of thing she helps a lot with with healing in Mexico they often call her the Santa sanora which means the healing Saint I mean it sounds better in Spanish right because you've got that alliteration of the double s I guess you could say the salubrious Saint in in English so she helps you with that she can bring pregnancy you know to a Barren womb if you're struggling with that but at the same time she's non-judgmental she's sort of an amoral figure because you know death comes for a death is aoral right so you can hex your enemies you know you can do a lot of banful work as well with with Santa W you can get revenge and and I think that's part of the appeal as well of this religion is that there's no judgment and I've been thinking a lot about this cuz I've met devotees from all walks of life anybody can be a devotee of sant no matter what color you are what sexual orientation because death comes to a soul she judges nobody and I think you know and you can have any job legal illegal any vocation you know have met everybody from lawyers Housewives fishermen Farmers you know to to people who you know have have problems with drugs who who worship her and who work with her and I I was thinking about that and I think the reason is that you know she is a female figure so she is a mother a mother to us all the oldest mother death is like you know the mother to us all right because we all return to her and I've I've thought about it a lot that you know a lot of religions don't accept people for who they are but everybody no matter who they are needs to be loved wants to be protected by a mother who will take care of them and that can be very hard in certain situations because of perhaps sexual orientation or if you have you know drug habits that perhaps make it very difficult for perhaps people in your family you know to to be close to you or be accepted but she just accepts everybody flaws and all and and I think that we you know in this day and age people need that because it's very hard I think in today's society to abide by religions that are very strict you know about Notions of sin you must do this you mustn't do that it's very hard to be on the straight and narrow in a society that in you know which I say in most places is very corrupt right and where for especially people living in poverty and for all of us sometimes you may have to do things that you wouldn't want to have to do just to get by I think that's one of the things that I really loved about senta muera that I learned in your book was that she is so all-encompassing it's not just that she will love you no matter who you are she belongs to all of us but there's so many different aspects of her so many different faces that she can show you depending on what you need in your life or what you're looking for in your life I was very surprised to see the pregnant belly Santa mua but I guess I shouldn't be because she is life and death you know from me you proceed and unto me you shall return that type of goddess you know and so I liked reading about the the red senta mua where she is about lust and love and sexuality and and you know the healing aspects of her and you can even go to her for fertility and so I was surprised but then when I reflected on it I wasn't so surprised because she is everyone she is everything and you know can you talk a little more about her aspects and the different colors that go along with her yeah I would love to thank you that's a great question so let's start you know there the three basic colors that you know sort of encounter in all religions they're pretty much Universal which is white red and black you know which is a sort of holy Trio in in many places in many uh religions and and sort of correspond to the same things across the world more or less so white is really the color for you know healing peace cleansing Harmony and you know in her white gown I would say that's sort of the safest form to work with and you really can't go wrong with with white because you know if you think of that color it's just so calming you know and you can imagine her because she wears this white gown just covering you with that gown and cleansing you and bringing you your loved ones your home peace so you can turn to White for any situation you know perhaps if there have been arguments in the household or or with your loved ones uh to cleanse as I said things and just finding equilibrium Harmony so in her white gown she's sort of very I say almost Angelic you know like an angel of death in in that color because it's such a Pure Color and then you have red which you mentioned Leila which is all about passion love sex desire you know sort of bringing spiciness uh and can also be used you know as a power color as well I mean I've met some devotees who use her for power um because red is a very powerful color and obviously links to blood right where white you know we know that's the color of Peace red is the color of of blood passion you know fire as it were so you can turn to her for you know finding love and passion and desire you can turn to her for sweetening a relationship as I said kind of gone sour where you want things to get Fiery and sexy again uh and you can turn to her you know for Same seex Love as well because there's no sinful Notions around this and strictures or anything of that of that nature and and and like I said people use her to get power to feel more strength to to feel their their own inner fire so definitely you want to work with red s what for that light red candles give her apples uh honey candy you know those sweet and and sexy things that perhaps you might want to give a lover as well like a box of chocolates red roses that kind of thing and then you have black Santa Marte and you know black of course in most cultures is associated with Darkness death you know potentially destruction what's interesting in in Sant is that she can be used sort of in two ways for protection against enemies uh you know keeping yourself and your loved one safe whether that's children you know us women keeping ourselves safe in in difficult and dangerous situations um but also for revenge and also to bring death to your enemies because as you said Leila you know from me you come and to me you will return so she has this kind of dualistic side where she can grow things and bring life but she can also wither that life away I brought you into this world and I can take you out as many 90 these mothers would say right exactly exactly so and you know in her red aspect she was kind of sexy flirty she's very feminine in her black aspect you know a lot of people have told me in Mexico that they respect her like very strongly in her black gown because she's so she can be so lethal so potent so powerful she can just take your enemies out in one Fell Swoop so in that aspect you can turn to her for a lot of ban magic hexes you know and and literally i' I've seen people ask her for the ruin of their enemies and you know people can judge this but again coming back to us as women since we're a trio of of women a trifecta um you know I've seen people turn to black Sanam what you know people like sakaros Naros um asking for Revenge but at the same time I've seen women use those same prayers and those same ways to ask for protection from you know men that would threaten them or men that have hurt them or their loved ones so yeah I mean there's hexing and then there's hexing you know right yeah so I just find that very very intriguing and very powerful as well I don't know if you have any more questions on black santam I do think it's very consistent though that it has the three aspects just like a lot of of female deity um across the world that that Maiden mother Crone that triple aspect that triple face so I do find it very interesting that Santa Marte has that triple aspect as well and you can ask you know literally you can ask like if you want someone to get vices like if I've heard a women say that you know this guy mess me over he cheated on me I'm G to ask S where to ruin his life make him go you know crazy uh hook up with women that are bad for him that take all his money uh turn to drugs alcohol have everyone in his family fight with him so he has no more support I mean you can ask her for that and and obviously you know she will help men but I've heard women say well because she's a woman like us she understands the suffering that we go through and she will support us with that do you think that she is a deity that can be equally worshiped by men yeah I mean absolutely and I know that many men sort of turn to her as a motherly figure and I mean of course as women do and for a lot of people you know and I've started writing about this in my academic work I think she's the mother that they never had you know or the mother that they want wanted to have right because a lot of us have had difficult some of us have great relationships with our mothers some of us don't or some people have lost their mother but she's just this Timeless mother there are other colors so going beyond the three main colors you know and the colors keep expand Bing um you know that the color on my book is the purple Sant and the reason why I chose purple is that that's the color not only of healing again you can turn to purple s for healing but the color of magic witchcraft you know tapping into your psychic side getting Visions from the great beyond connecting with the astral plane you know and I absolutely love working with that color and in fact last night I had a dream of purple santam the because I'm a a university Professor I dreamt that I was with a group of mature students walking through the woods um just for a sort of field research trip and I found a shrine of purple Santa morte and and in the dream I had a student who was smoking a blunt and by the way yeah you can offer marijuana to Sant along with other offerings so I had a student who was somehow smoking a blunt and I was like let me grab that I want to give some of that smoke to Santa Mor and I started breathing the smoke on to her and they were like I want to do that too I was like hey are you a devotee and they're like no I was like well maybe you shouldn't so anyway it's just a little segue there but it was it was a really interesting dream so purple Santa is all about mysticism and for those of us you know who are into our our witchy side and want to connect with that more she will help you with that and obviously you know working with dreams and and other Realms is very important in this Tradition now you just you just mentioned mened um the difference between being a devotee and not could you could you talk to the point of what would someone do if they are just being exposed and want to start being a devotee what are the steps to kind of get yourself to be a devotee of Santa Marte well if if I'm going to be you know uh utilitarian by my book but apart from that now a more note I would say just start a small Altar and you don't need to buy a statue you can literally you know I know a lot of people whether it's in Mexico or you know in in Europe or UK US Canada wherever it is that have simply started with a printed image of her you know if you have a printer print one out if you don't go to a print shop I know people even just painted an image of her right she loves creative devotional art so you can paint a little picture or draw a little picture of her all you need is to start with that and some basic offerings this is not as I've said repeatedly in my book this not a spirituality about money you know though you do need to give offerings even if those can only be basic such as you know just putting a little tealight candle on your altar buying an extra Apple when you go to the supermarket you know and giving it to her a little piece of candy that is sufficient a glass of water right so she always loves her booze if you're a smoker a cigarette um or a cigar cuz you know tobacco has been sort of an indigenous offering for a long long time you're GNA pinch of marijuana give her a pinch of marijuana now you know you can give her other drugs I've heard of people giving her cocaine but I have been told by users of hard drugs that she doesn't particularly always like those drugs and even though she's been framed by the press as a narco saying even though she'll support you even if you do take drugs perhaps she's not okay with you putting that on your altar and she does try to support people in her amber color we haven't spoken about her amber color and I will go through the other gowns the amber color is to try and break addictions and vices so if you have a bad habit whether it's drugs drinking gambling you know it could even be spending too much time on amazon.com and ordering the stuff that you don't need gu guilty is Chang you can work with Amber Santa morte and Amber candle and and ask her to break bad habits it could be an unhealthy relationship right with someone who is bad for you you know um that is how I would suggest you could start off with just a very simple alar and just you know slowly slowly moving forward and then with time if you want to expand that by statues then you can I really loved a couple points you made about starting an alar to Santa mua shell and I talk a lot lot about intention and how you don't need fancy tools to do magic and I loved seeing that Santa muera does not care if your candle cost $50 or if it's a recycled tealight the intention is the point she likes nice offerings but she really wants them to be something that you have given from your heart an offering that you've given because you want her to have it right and I just love the idea of offerings from the heart rather than the bank account you know the intention is more important than the price tag and also she sounds a little bit like a jealous goddess she has to have the biggest statue and she wants to be the only goddess on the altar but other than that she seems really good with what you're able to give her your offerings don't have to be elaborate but they do have to be heartfelt is that true from what you've experienced exactly absolutely and she should be the only one on the altar I mean like if you get more advanced then people in Mexico may put other sort of figures that kind of get along with her on the altar but if you're starting out you know she is a jealous figure she wants your attention you know I always think of her altar as sort of her house she doesn't want to share her house with other people right she wants to be queen of of her castle and so she should be because she's queen of death I mean death is so powerful so Supreme and you're absolutely right and and thank you for reminding us of that things don't have to be extremely expensive but spending time with her praying to her daily you know showing your veneration respect reverence for her is more important than any dollar SP yeah yeah because you know you can buy her the most expensive bottle of tequila she does love tequila mcal you know people also like to buy her whiskey and other hard Liquors she does love her hard Liquors but let's say you buy her really expensive bottle of booze but you're not praying to her every day when you walk past her altar you're not like oh hi Santa you know don't sit down and talk to her Noby for not yeah and she is she does listen and I I think you know in a way there's so many reasons why I called my book secrets of s what and people often erroneously think it's because I'm saying oh all the secrets are in this book yeah there's a lot of great information in the book but it's also about the fact that you can share your secrets with Sant and you should do you know you should talk to her you should tell her everything and I think that's the beauty as well of of this spirituality is that from what I've seen people can share things with death because you know death takes things to the Grave right nobody death doesn't tell so trauma that you've gone through feelings that you worry about you can share them all with her and because there's kind of no sin there's no judgment and so you can pray on that you can talk on that and she will also share her secrets with you as to how to overcome things or send you messages like I said in dreams as I put in the book in in animal and insect Omens as well so I think this relationship with death is is very intimate now beyond the red and the white and the black and the purple and the Amber what are other colors yes so we also have yellow and gold which are similar but kind of different so gold obviously for abundance right abundance especially in finances but you know you could use that for abundance in in other areas in your life yellow is more for sort of success um sort of positive that positive almost sunlike energy right breathing that into things so it doesn't necessarily have to be finances so yellow is is more of that kind of energy and then you have blue as well which is often used with yellow to sort of as a sort of abic aminos Road opener type energy because blue is the color for clarity communication wisdom in Mexico um and and I've even seen one of my Mexican students use this blue is used for like success in exams right doing well in exams studies I I just saw the other day on social media one of my my students my uh former students at UBC post a little picture of her blue Sant wor the statue saying I'm praying to her that I can do well in my exams and you know I've seen kids in Mexico as well put a blue scent and what the statue by their side when they're studying for school or trying to write a paper right and and she can support them with that so really good for Focus Clarity wisdom and like I said you can combine that with the yellow right because yellow is success and that's a sort of Road opening combination um the other colors are green for justice legal work and you know Justice here is perspecti so that means maybe you broke the law right but you feel sorry or you kind of felt forced into doing something illegal or Now you kind of feel bad about it and she will take your side you know I had a very interesting interaction with someone who reached out to me who had just been freed from jail and who had had my book in jail uh and my book had really turned things around for them and and really furthered their connection with s morte and and they said to me that they had turned to Green Sant and whereas other prisoners you know and I have some spells in the book of you know including law spells like legal spells to win your court case and stuff like that and they said whereas other prisoners were having like drugs smuggled inside or other you know things that they shouldn't have smuggled inside for for various purposes they were getting like Twigs uh you know spell like roots that I had suggested and little ingredients and ele El I had suggested in the book smuggled inside so they could do this work and and they did after seven years of being in jail um there was a change in the law somehow miraculously and they were freed um from their jail cells so and they had committed a very very serious you know crime which I I won't go into but you can imagine for seven years you know you you you didn't just uh you know break the speed limit yeah yeah you didn't just take a candy bar from the local store you mentioned people petitioning Santa wera for certain things you know they would do spells or prayers to her to ask for justice or maybe a better job or or in the case that you just mentioned getting out of jail from what I understand she requires some type of reciprocation for that you know a thank you an offering to her or blessings and prayers to her is that something that she requires after answering a prayer for a devotee yeah absolutely and you know many devotees I mean depends how you want to work with her and I really advise you know even though I give instructions in the book I tell people find your own way of working with her I mean it's like you know with any relationship you have to develop it along your own lines right I mean even if in your couple you can read self-help books you know how to have the perfect marriage but you've got to figure out how that works with the person that you're with right and I'd say it's the same with Santa so I found that some devotees when they're already working with her and asking for something they'll already give her something you know as as a sort of sort of almost I'd say an incentive or a thank you for even listening you know like some candy or you know whatever's within within their budget some flowers but if she comes through it really is important to thank her and if you've promised her something you should definitely come through on your promise you know I mean it's like with anybody if you promise somebody something your best friend whoever it is and you don't come through how disappointed are they going to be yeah that's just a life thing everything is a give and a take you can't just take take take you have to you have to give you know and it's an energetic thing right because you know she is death and you want to feed that energy so in a way by giving her things especially living things you know that have like flowers and food has you know energy to it you're kind of nourishing that relationship but I want to point out you it has been pointed out erroneously and and I started out you know in my academic career misunderstanding these things because some authors and and I even said that this this was a quidd pro quo which which is absolutely not I mean that's just a complete sort of capitalistic misund understanding of of this is not a quid proquo you know it's about building a a loving and caring relationship and as you just said sh that's about give and take in any relationship right it's not like tip fortat it's more like I care for you so I'm going to give you these beautiful roses and I'm going to give you my attention right right absolutely absolutely absolutely so it's really like any other relationship it's just this is a deity as opposed to a human standing in front of you be respectful and don't take things without respect and thanks in return yeah and that comes back to our point of you know that it's not about expensive offerings it's about spending that time it's about intention it's about bonding you know and and it's just like with any relationship you know let's say you were dating someone and you thought you could just keep on throwing gifts at them for them to love you you know how deep is that relationship going to be it's it's not going and you know and you're not even talking about a person here you're talking about a powerful datus they're going to see straight through that so it's really just like in a relationship with someone that you care for giving that love giving that attention and and especially because you know she's a powerful Supernatural figure showing that reverence showing that humility showing respect and I think that that's where you know that differentiates for me true devotion you know and truly understanding what you're working with here now are there other colors Beyond blue yeah so the other color you know there's a whole plethora of colors now uh one I want to focus on before I move on to some of sort of the the newer ones is is the seven colored Santa morte so that represents the sort of the seven colors of white red black uh purple blue um Amber and green so they're all in one and they're all in one in one Statue and that's a really great statue I'd say apart from the white statue for a beginner the seven colored is amazing for a beginner because she sort of has everything there in and it's sort of asking so you can there's two siid that you can use it for to sort of represent any color just like my person in that you know the person that reached out to me told me you know they couldn't necessarily get a green statue but they were able I think to print out a seven colored statue and then they'd imagine it all in green so you can kind of do that because in some ways you know you can use any color and project the color you want onto it but with the seven colors you can particularly do that but you can also with the seven colors ask everything to align for all her powers to come forward so you know to sort of make everything go on your side because maybe maybe in one situation you need the forces of the universe to align right in your favor so by calling on those seven colors you're getting all those seven Powers working at the same time to make things fall into the perfect harmony balance or exactly how you need things to go for your outcome to be to be successful so the seven colors is is amazing that way and often referred to as the PO or poas and it also seems for someone new to this if they're not sure which color to pick the seven color would be the best CU it is all-encompassing exactly exactly and it sort of encompasses her seven powers or as they often say Her Seven Virtues right her seven gifts now there's sort of been sort of newer colors as well that have emerged so there's the silver Santa mu you know and silver has sort of a very ancient history in Mexico because silver was the main pressure mineral there and you know then when the Spanish came in you know they were mining for silver so that again is associated with abundance with finances but also linked to the Moon right and in the Silvery color of the moon so you if you want to tap into that Moon energy silver a great color for that uh there's also as well pink santam who is similar to Red Santa Mar this is about love but it's more about tenderness you know when you're seeking that kind of compassionate love that's less based on passion but more based on sort of sweetness and pink is kind of like Grandma love and red is like lover love exactly so you know maybe you want a relationship where you maybe you don't want all that passion and fireworks cuz that can even be shortlived right but you just want that more deeper compassionate tender sweet loving care TLC type relationship so you might want to turn to pink for that and I've also heard a lot of women and equally men turn to pink Sant for self-love and self-care you know when we've been through a rough time or we haven't taken good care of ourselves like pink can really just be a very healing color in in that sense another really interesting color combination because she often comes in color combinations is the red and black Santa which they call the reversible Santa Mor Santa Mor revers and that's especially for returning hex's painful magic H you know could even be love magic done to you that you don't you didn't want right so you can use a red and black candle or a red and black santam so the red and black santam is typically but not always one side red and one side black so it's sort of almost combining the black and the red the power of the red with the protection of the black to just return hexes it's kind of like a Return to Sender color and I found that very very useful I'm very intrigued by the color combinations when you were talking about pink senta and the couples I was thinking how great it would be to ask pink and blue santam muera and maybe yellow santam muera at the same time to maybe bring in those energies to you know say for example Foster better Communications or loving conversations by utilizing the power flowers of three different colors of Santa Mora this is when I can tell you're a true tried and trusted witch Lea because you know this is absolutely the way to work with s and what they is even though you may not be able to buy you know those color combinations together the ideal way to work with her especially when you have these kinds of complicated situations is to use as I said in the book multiple colors of candles and like you said appeal to multiple colors of sant statues so that you can benefit from those different colors those different virtues and ask for those to combine together so absolutely that would be a a great great example and you know it's really up to the practitioner and you know clearly you know you know what you're doing uh is clearly up to the practitioner to tune into what colors they think that they they need and what would be a good combination and often you know as you just pointed out one candle or one color may not be sufficient so turning to those multiple colors multiple gowns can really better resolve the situation I think she's really a Great Goddess for everyone because there are so many aspects to her like you said in the beginning she's not a dual goddess she's so much more than that she's everything she's the beginning the end and and all things in between and I think that's lovely It's a Wonderful way to approach that kind of energy yes she's absolutely amazing and there are even more colors you know I've seen copper Sant somewh they emerge and again that's kind of for bringing Harmony peace especially into a business or a place that it feels like the energy has either been stagnant or unsettled that's a very good color there's also Santa mu I've seen her in her gown of dollars you know and this is the idea that the dollar is particularly strong right because especially in Mexico the Bessel is quite a weak currency or people see it that way so the aspiration you know is is to have American dollars so if you're really wanting money then you might want to to use santa mu in her in her gown of of dollars so I just see more and more gowns emerging you know and there there's probably some that I I haven't even mentioned right now that that are out there or or emergent oh yes and one I should mention very importantly that that now comes to me is Santa in her Aztec form or in her indigenous form often called La AA so this is when Sant appears you know with the symbology the iconography of you know indigenous costume and symbols so you know typically with plumes a plumed sort of headdress uh often with glyphs and icons you know related to indigenous people such as the Maya the Aztec Etc and in her Aztec form you know she's sort of a queen of magic also so connecting with that primordial very ancient sort of death energy and at least in Mexico where I've been to uh you know people turn to her for a lot for brara for witchcraft but also for connecting with ancestors and sort of ult ancestral Realms and and so you know she's sort of I would say more for the advanced practitioner and typically that there needs to be a lot of reverence there to to work with her and and for me she's just one she's just absolutely mesmeric you know one of the most beautiful and captivating um aspects of Santa Mar that that I've seen it definitely has to be a give and take relationship though it sounds like yeah and she's the kind of almost trickster like figure so I've been told you know and that sort of comes back to the indigenous deities a lot of whom were tricker like figures where you know even I've been told with the black Anam what as well you know you need to be careful working with certain aspects of her I mean I wouldn't say white santam what because she's so caring and gentle but these different aspects each have a unique Persona and so there are some aspects that you need to be very careful and you know in my book I say you know I give warnings and some people like oh you know why are you giving warnings blah but this is death right it's a very powerful force and certain aspects of her are certainly not to be played with or you can you know learn some hard lessons as I found out firsthand so I would say azte is one of those aspects where you want to be very humble working with her and and and you know coming through on whatever you have said that you will do for her take it seriously yeah take yeah this is not something to be to be played with okay one last question or well actually two last questions say someone wanted to connect to one of their loved ones that has passed on is sent MUA someone that they can call on for that can she be a conduit for that type of communication with the dead and how would you approach her if you wanted to receive messages from a loved one on the other side that's a beautiful question yeah absolutely she is because she's you know one of her roles is as a psychopomp right and in Mexico they say that she is the one that opens the window the portal between the living and the dead um so definitely you can work with her for that and in Mexico I've often seen as I mentioned in my book pictures of of deceased loved ones ancestors you know on her Altar and obviously they shouldn't be you know more important than she is but you can put a picture of them or something that they they left you you know I have um I have a momento from my grandparents a letter they wrote to me when I was a small child that I keep on my Altar and I connect to them and I honor them through that and so absolutely you can totally do that I mean you might want to work with with the white aspect but I don't think you really really need to appeal to a specific color with that because she is death you know she connects us to our dead loved ones and and you can absolutely ask for messages from them whether it's in dreams or in Visions you know and in the book I talk about things you can do to get those dreams to get those Visions um you know and to encourage those but even just praying to her for that is a very very effective way or to get signs from loved ones you know we all have our unique signs right from our deceased loved on so absolutely that would be a very beautiful way of working with her and definitely something you can do in the back of your book you have some very beautiful prayers and spells and things you can do to honor Santa muera are there any particular prayers to her that you like or that you find yourself returning to I mean I I work with her sort of in English and in Spanish so one of the things I just like to say to her is Sant which is simply and I think I put that in the book although the rhyme in English is not as good of my heart do not your protection from me part is basically what I'm I'm saying there so you know Santa Mor of my heart don't don't abandon me you know keep keep protecting me and that's something I often say to her and I try to be cognizant you know every every night I pray and you you know you don't even need to be at your altar if you can't be be at your altar it could be in in in bed or it could be wherever you are every night I try to remember to just pray to her and I'll take you know one of the prayers from my book which is in there which is a daily prayer but I kind of adjust it and I say to her you know I thank her for specific things especially for life for the food that I've had that day for the opportunities I've I've been given and I I think you know every day we have something to be grateful for and you know my work here in Mexico and as I said more recently um with with Mexican Americans in in the US has has made me all the more cognizant of that and of the privilege that that I have you know and the luck that I have to be in a safe place and not to be you know fearful of my life on a on a daily basis I mean when I do feel work things can get very dangerous and I've been in some very fearful situations and it makes me all the more grateful that I have the ability to come home you know to a space that is is safe that is not plagued by by violence and so that's one of the things that I try to remember to thank her for every day and also to thank her as I as I said at the beginning of this podcast for for the for keeping my loved ones safe so every day I just try to acknowledge her and every morning I walk past my Altar and and I you know even if I'm in a hurry I try to just like say a hello say a thank you for for just even waking up that day right one last thing I wanted to touch on that I thought was amazing that you put in the back of your book and no one talks about this point unbonding I love that you call it a ritual breakup you know a lot of people will will kind of dabble with deities and quote unquote dedicate themselves to deities and then after a little while just kind of walk away and move on and that's not really how you should handle it so can you kind of talk real quick about maybe not necessarily with Santa Martin in particular but just just the process of when you've formed a relationship with deity and you've chosen to move on unbonding I love this breaking up with deity can you can you kind of talk about that real quick yeah I mean I got into a lot of trouble for that as well as the blood paack people didn't one like the blood pack which was kind of I thought very sort of neocolonial um but people also criticize me for the breaking up ritual because they said well you can never break W up with death you know death will always be part of your life but as you just pointed out sh lots of people will dabble with a deity and then just discard them with like no respect no rence and and that's very dangerous so that's why that is in the book because you know perhaps this isn't for you and you decide that you don't know what to do at that point and and I had heard stories in Mexico as well of people precisely doing this asking her for favors maybe even getting them and then just forgetting about her and then reaping you know negative consequ consquences uh you know I heard a story for example of a man who asked red Sant whated to bring love into his life to bring him a woman and he gave you know his he got a red Santa statue gave her apples booze you know all these gifts and then got this lovely lady in his life walked away from and walked away and then guess what happened a few months into their relationship she had a she had a horrible car accident right and she didn't die or anything that but he realized this was a warning and he was like okay I need to you know address this and so that's why that ritual is there so that people don't find themselves in such situations right because it's it's okay to decide to move in another Direction but if that's the choice you make you need to just like any relationship end it cordially exactly with respect and you know taking the right step so that there are no hard feelings right so that's absolutely why why that's in the book and and thank you for bringing that I loved it I I absolutely when I saw that I'm like this is the greatest thing I've ever seen because nobody really wants to address that you know even though it seems like a very simple ritual it's a very important one if you are choosing to move on yeah and you know and I'm not going to claim that s is for everybody I mean I think that everyone canect connect with her we can all connect with death but you know people have their own path for some people you know they may not want to spend that time and that investment or it may not be possible with their life moving forward you know and I'm not going to judge them for that so I I want people to have options a safe walk away yeah exactly there is no running away from Death you can't break up with death we get that you know we know she's still going to be there and she knows that too but you can choose not to be her devote and still know still understand that death is part of life a friendly until we meet again yeah exactly and I love that one of the things with Santa WTA is is that she helps people appreciate life because we know death is there I understand I mean unfortunately we see it in our lives in so many different ways but respecting that can help you have so much more appreciation for for what you have now and what you're doing here and and I think that's part of what she wants from us is to love the apples and the flowers and the whiskies and the candies and the joints and all of it because because it's all part of life and you you have to appreciate that because we do all come to death it's it's all part of a greater cycle you know and I love that about Santa Mora because she's not just the Death part of the cycle she's she's all of it yeah she's all of it and that's what I love about her you know like I keep on saying she allows us to reclaim death but she's also very life affirming yes and you know allows us to celebrate life where we you know I wrote a publication on this which is coming out soon and in it I said an academic publication I said you know although she allows us to accept death when it comes and where it comes she also allows us to celebr at our life enjoy our life in every waking and even sleeping moment that we that we have while we're still here and and I think that's one of the very beautiful aspects of her and and unique aspects of her I think that is a beautiful place to stop our conversation thank you so much Dr cresa Stone for
