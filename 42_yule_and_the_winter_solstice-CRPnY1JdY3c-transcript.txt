the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to episode 42 of back on the broomstick on this episode we'll be talking about vle the winter solstice some ritual ideas and ways to celebrate the season I'm shell and I'm Leila now I look at them as two different things can I just start off with that I'm just going to jump right into the fire here I look at the winter solstice and Ule is almost like two different things am I crazy am I the only one am I some freakish person no for some people Ule is the celebration that's very much like Christmas it's a celebration of family of togetherness of gift giving of celebrating the crafts that you've made to help you get through the winter and for some people the winter solstice is more of a religious celebration It's the Return of the light it's the shortest day and the longest night it's the time when you go inward a little more spiritually and work to bring about the return of the light so for some Ule is more of a secular celebration a family giftgiving celebration and the winter solstice is more of the religious celebration because I guess I look at it as and if if you listened to our other episode about ulie type stuff you'll hear me say this I feel like Ule and Christmas are more like a together thing and that the winter solstice is like separate and apart from that that's just me I'm just saying the winter solstice is December 21st and it's when the tilt of the Earth's axis makes us have the longest night of the year and the shortest day so it's the celebration of the idea of the sun returning we're in the darkest part of the year and we're in it just getting darker and gloomier and so we need a little bit of a celebration to know that the sun is coming back after that longest night so we celebrate how thankful we are that it has returned you know I am not a fan of these early nights just putting that out there by the way and as much as I I I feel that it almost feels like it just lingers for like two weeks after that it does I feel like the planets stopped moving for two weeks and it's like the longest two weeks of my life honestly I had the hardest time with the concept that the light half of the year begins at UL because it's still freaking dark it's dark till like freaking March exactly but that's the beginning of the light half of the year that's when the days begin to get longer again and the light starts to return but we're still kind of in the thick of it and so a lot of Ule celebrations recognize that they recognize that we're bored we're cooped up we're cold and it's freaking dark and we need something to celebrate and if if if you are one of our southern hemisphere listeners I can say the same thing about the summer solstice here where I'm at anyway in in the Northeast uh in the northern hemisphere Northeast of America you know we have our longest day in June and it hasn't even hardly barely gotten warm by then you know like it's barely warm by the summer solstice so I'm feel like I'm getting gypped here but for our for our friends in the southern hemisphere you know you're kind of experiencing that longest day so you're having pretty much the exact opposite of what we're we're about to experience here yep so with the longest night you will is one of the solar festivals whether you celebrate it on its own or as part of the winter solstice it is a a sun based or a solar based Festival which is so weird because it's like the darkest night right exactly and a lot of especially if you're more Wiccan based in practice you might celebrate konos this time of year in his form as the Holly king and the oak King the story of the two of them fighting for Supremacy during the light half of the year the oak King Reigns and during the dark half of the year the Holly King Reigns The Holly King has died and so now we're kind of like in this in between period where the oak King is about to come back as the sun and to rain over the light half of the Year remember when we did that ritual for the the community we were involved in and we had two guys sword fight and had them play the oak king and the Holly King that was great I'm just saying that was great there's a lot of things that you can do to celebrate again light and sun and anything that represents that is going to be a big part of any rituals or spells that you do this time of year the idea of that light growing and you know another thing that that you can do um I I like lighting a candle a single candle you know I could probably like do like some birthday candle but a single candle just as a representation um of that light coming back and the key thing to me putting it out is because I light it as a representation of the light coming back I make sure that that is a candle that I snuff out and not blow out and we can get into that in another time in another episode but I don't want to blow out the coming light I mean maybe that's that's a weird a metaphor for me but it feels wrong so I snuff out that candle if you listen to our episode last week where we talked about Ule Traditions folk traditions and crafts that you could do one of my family's Traditions to symbolize the time period between Ule and Christmas and to also represent the growing light is to have four candles starting on Ule the 21st and then lighting an additional candle each night until Christmas to again represent the growth of that light it gets more and more every night M mine's way less that I just I sit here a candle I speak some words if you can have a candle on that night to represent the light just turn out all the lights in your house maybe and then light that one candle if you're lucky enough to be able to have a fire in your yard or in a fireplace burning a Ule log that you've put your wishes for the coming year on or things that you're thankful for a lot of people are really gathering around this tradition I mean it's really pretty the idea that you can take a piece of a tree some people use part of the trunk of the previous year's Christmas tree some people just go chop a tree or buy a piece of a tree you can also make it out of cake or cookies but the history of the U log is definitely Pagan in a lot of Scandinavian and Germanic traditions they would burn a tree like a whole enormous tree for the entirety of the Ule celebration which typically was about 12 days or longer and then on the 12th night they would burn it down to the very last bit the stump that they would keep in the house and that would be a spell of protection that would keep the house safe from fires and lightning strikes according to Superstition but the idea is it's similar to a Christmas tree bringing in some Greenery bringing in something from the past that will help to protect your home and also putting candles on it to celebrate the return of the light if you have the ability to have a bonfire that is also good although not all of us have that wonderful ability but if you do that is also a good way and hey if unlike shell if you're interested in staying up to see the dawn a really nice thing to do is to stay up all night for that longest night have a feast with your friends have a night where you tell each other you will ghost stories have a night where you do a big gaming night or something stay up all all night doing ritual doing magic just being with your family and then celebrate that first light of sun as it comes up really be there for those first few moments after that longest night celebrate that first light I love the concept but I I love sleep more I'm just saying absolutely but there there are other things you can do like if there is a light snow because I do I do live in an area where snow on Ule is actually a possibility if there is snow I like to go out for a walk in that peaceful yall know what I'm talking about if you're in a snowy area that peaceful snowfall where it's just kind of you in the snow does that make sense there's nothing like the sound of the forest during a snowfall or the sound of the city during the snowfall if you're able to get outside this is a great time of year to do so even just for a minute and then go back into your warm snug home well what I what I had done um a couple years ago I want to say this might have been I don't know six seven years ago I was in Salem uh for Ule it was before I had actually moved here but I was here for Ule visiting I don't know what time it was but it was after midnight and yes I'm a smoker don't judge me I had run out of cigarettes and the closest store was like three blocks away from where my hotel was and all by myself at like 1:30 in the morning I walked down to this gas station to get cigarettes and it was just like light snow not a soul is out barely and it was just me walking through town and you know people always say when's the best time to come to Salem when's your favorite time of year in Salem it is in the middle of the night in a light snowfall when it's just you in this town in this snow that's beautiful and that's probably my most favorite Ule in at least last 10 years there was no ritual there was no spells it was just me walking alone through Salem at damn one o'clock in the morning with that light snowfall and nothing beats that and that was probably more of a spiritual experience than five rituals combined I think there's really something to be said for the quiet this time of year for those Quiet Moments where it's just the star shine maybe it's something about the lights just a little bit of a twinkling light and and that Stillness and finding that quiet and Stillness in yourself those to me have been the most powerful rituals I have ever done this time of year is when it was dark and quiet and introspective and the very first Ule I ever did with our community in the Southern Tier of New York was a u ritual and it was indoors at the YuYu church and the woman who had the role of the go goddess was about 8 months pregnant and so she was portraying the pregnant goddess and was very much physically pregnant and it was just such a powerful moment in that room in the dark with just a little bit of Candlelight and this heavily pregnant woman dressed all in white and we were just all quietly going up and talking about the gifts that we wanted to give the son that was about to be born right and it was just very still and quiet and beautiful and that's kind of what it feels like when you're outside at midnight going to you know midnight mass on Christmas Eve or walking the streets of Salem to get cigarettes in a snowfall it's that moment of Stillness at the very last moment of the darkest nights well I know that we we talked about this during sa time and a lot of people look at sa is like the time to go within and get introspective I ain't got time for that you know I got fall activities you know we've got Thanksgiving I got some holiday stuff coming with my kids you know I can't be doing that I I look at Ule is where I end up going kind of that going within that introspection because is the season to kind of regroup and not that I'm a Believer in New Year's resolutions because those are just lies you tell to yourself but it's definitely a good time to regroup for the the coming year whether you're steadfast on October 31st being the new year or December 31st starting the new year either way it is this time of year to get your together and kind of plan out you know the next steps and I look at kind of from Ule to imul as a mental regrouping period yeah that's that's exactly how I see it as well it's it's this kind of you've done all the work that you could do in the Lush time of the year and as everything was dying you've hopefully put it all away and prepared for this dark Time of Your Life Of The Year reaped what you've sown yeah and now you have to sit with it for good or for bad and decide what you're going to do differently or the same next year exactly and it can be hard it can be good it can be so many different things but taking that time to go within and to be quiet in the dark is is important I think and and that's exactly what you're doing now and I'm I'm loving the idea of the 12 days of Ule between the solstice and the calendar new year take care of yourself take that time and then start plotting out how you're going to have your together next Go Round the idea of the 12 days of Ule really fits with my whole theory that these last two weeks of the year are like the last two weeks but the idea of 12 days has been around longer than the 12 Days of Christmas according to Martin mcgran to Nordic people the sun was vitally important as you can imagine so as the days got shorter and shorter and the nights got colder and more deadly looking forward to the return of the sun was really important and so leading up to that longest night that's when they would start to stock up the lter they'd Slaughter animals they'd start getting out the casks of meat and beer and all the food and then beginning right around the soltice they would start almost two weeks of rry and excess just enjoying everything no work was done differences were set aside people made marry they gave gifts they feasted they enjoyed time with family and friends and basically they kept that time period pretty much sacred now Nordic peoples weren't the only ones who thought that this time of year was a little off the Kelts also felt that things were a little weird celestially this time of year they felt that on the winter solstice the Earth Stood Still because of the way the Earth Earth's axis is tilted on the solstice when the Sun rises and hits its peak at noon and then sets for about 3 days it doesn't appear to move across the sky so it really does look like the Earth has stopped and so the the Celtic people thought that this was the time when the Fay would come running and end their wild Hunt and so everyone would stay inside in order to stay safe from the Fay and they would feast and make marry so I've kind of taken this whole 12-day celebration and I start the day before the solstice and that's what's called mother's night and that's when you honor your ancestors and do all of that going within work and then each day after that leading up to December 31st represents a different trait or characteristic and also a different month of the year it's kind of like a a minicycle wrapping up the whole year in 12 days literally at the end of the year so it kind of takes care of that weird Lial space feeling because each day has its own representation and then on December 31st it's the end you kind of burn those logs you burn your wishes you get rid of the old year and get ready to start the new and if you're interested in that pretty soon we'll have an article up on the website back onthe broomstick tocom now you've mentioned that you very much see Ule and the winter solstice as different and and I feel I see them pretty much as the same can you say some of the differences that you see between the two I look at the solstice in everything that it is you know the longest night I guess I kind of look at it more as the solar aspect of the holiday and then kind of put the whole I don't know maybe it's just I replace the Jesus thing with oaking and the Holly King I don't know so it's like Ule Christmas and and the solstice is the solstice and then Ule is like Ule Christmas right and I I think part of that is also because my former husband and myself is much as we were both 110% witches and and pagans and and what have you we still had very very very Christian families that were very deep in our children's lives and you tell my father we don't celebrate Christmas okay I dare you so you know part of it really kind of was convenience for the kids in the beginning you know that that's a damn good point we have a lot of listeners who are in the same kind of situation they can't be openly Pagan or they have to also incorporate you know other family members different religious beliefs into this time the good news is is it's not that hard to do right right I mean you know as you well know my ex-in-laws were freaking youth ministers in a Roman Catholic Church for God's sakes like these are my kids other grandparents like okay we're not having Christmas what I guess it was I had to meld the two to make it work for for my family and my children's family and you know even after divorce and the whole kitten Kaboodle my children's grandparents have always been very respectful as I have always been and and my ex-husband has always been very respectful of their beliefs we just found a way to make it work within our kids lives I guess you know well as I was researching this episode and talking to other pagans a story that you mentioned in our last episode about finding a Ule log in your Christian Mother's attic amongst her other Christmas decorations that rang true with everyone that I spoke to it was very very easy for them to incorporate their Pagan beliefs even if they were still in the broom closet with their Christian relatives because the ceremonies and the decorations are so similar honestly you take all the pagan holidays in the wheel of the year and this is like the only one you could totally outwardly celebrate and go under the radar and even when I saw people online talking about it the most common advice that I heard from people when asked how to celebrate Christmas and Ule together was basically do Christmas take Jesus out right right everything else except for the story of Jesus and the Nativity and and the wise men and all that everything else has Pagan Roots the decorations the lights the light come the sun Su n not s o n coming back and being reborn the present giving the wasling the bringing in Greenery the mistletoe all of it is Pagan it's all Pagan from top to bottom so just do that and some people would just kind of incorporate slightly more natural crafts and decorations like the dried oranges and the you know the natural herbs and the Rosemary reads and things like that but yeah it's pretty easy like you said to go under the radar if you're Pagan celebrating Ule I think you nailed it on the head right when you said celebrate Christmas just take Jesus out of it and that's a really good way to keep you know your relatives happy because it it still looks like you're celebrating Christmas and you know in my case it was we had a little bit of uul Miss I guess right right right and I think a lot of people are like and I hope not disrespectful to Christians but you know it is what it is and and and that's a really good way for people to to kind of survive through I just know that that in in my family in my extended family they actually welcomed it as opposed to finding it disrespectful because as the parent of their grandchildren they wanted to find a common ground so that they got what they wanted and yet I still got my way as the parent you know what I mean and both sides totally accommodated each other and as you know we rocked it my kids never were confused and celebrated everything I mean our situation we rocked it same with us and and again it's pretty easy to do this time of year and to have your own ritual I like to do it on the 21st on the soulstice itself because there is something very magical about the celestial event that is the longest night and then the dawn that comes back you know it's just very hopeful for the soul that's that's that whole meaning of this season right is it's like being kind to each other because it's so dark and cold we have to rely on each other and to be hopeful that that sun will come back that the light will come back in the middle of all the darkness there's just something intensely magical about this season just naturally well I I do think that everybody is in the the dark time and in the cold time and it kind of reminds you we're all in this show together man help one another out you know donate to a charity get on your local buy nothing group and donate all the decorations that you don't use any longer try regifting or reusing something being generous goes a long way and it doesn't take a lot to be generous that's true that's another very very good reminder this time of year because again we need each other to get through historically you know people back in the day needed each other to get through these dark times and so give to each other give handmade gifts give things that help people remember that the sun and the warmth are coming back and and help each other through these dark and cold nights you know speaking of give each other handmade gifts are you making more bath bombs this year please tell me you're making more bath bombs please please please please please please please I was actually thinking of making bath bombs just because you've mentioned like so many damn times hinting much maybe I need to to resurrect my bath bomb spell and I'll have to put pictures up when I do it but yes now speaking of handmade gifts for the longest time back when we had our coven shell every year for Ule would make these lovely incenses bath salts bath bombs oils all sorts of lovely Heavenly scrumptious smelling stuff and she would make them individual for each person every year why not why not fabulous gifts and the dark time of the year gives people a lot of time on their hands historically maybe not so much now everyone's working like three different freaking jobs but historically people had a lot of time to do crafts so handmade gifts now this time of year are traditional and are fabulous as Shell's old tradition of giving people handmade incenses or bath bombs of some sort couldn't test you know I'd rather make you something and this is exactly why I made them individualized for each one of you guys I would rather make you something like that that is so awesome and special and magical and well the best thing you ever had just saying as opposed to like I hate spending money on  that people don't want that is my biggest pet peeve I would rather you tell me what you want and get it then waste money so I always thought of of the the gift giving the cupen especially is a way for me to give my magic without it being something stupid and it was always very well-received I mean a handmade gift is so freaking thoughtful I will take that over something commercial or plastic any day of the week and I'm so so thankful that the last few years has really seen a Resurgence in that of people being more thoughtful in their gifts a little less consumerist you know and I and I think that's that's a beautiful way to honor the season okay listeners is my witness people back me up here Leila's called me out on the bath bombs in about I would say the last five episodes I've caved I'm gonna do it and in return somebody is going to make me one of their dried freaking fruit garlands people you better you better be checking with me to make sure I get this and I'm gonna tell you if I don't get it if I get it I'm gonna post pictures but if she's getting bath bombs I want a damn dried fruit Garland okay all right all right it's a deal it's a deal see handmade gifts man they're so much fun and maybe maybe maybe maybe if yall are lucky and we remember
