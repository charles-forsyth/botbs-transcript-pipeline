welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi I'm shell and I'm Leila and tonight is Krampus night happy Krampus knocked I love Krampus I love the story of Krampus but I cannot say what is it CR Krampus Krampus knocked Krampus knocked German knocked yeah Krampus is a new one for me I've only known about Krampus for maybe five six years I think not very long oh see I have a little bit of family background that that goes back to some German Dutch type roots and I've actually heard of Krampus oh we're so all right so before we get too far tonight we are going to be talking about Ule Legends Ule crafts and Ule spells that you can do this time of year the month of the winter solstice and if any of you folks out there have listened to our old podcast which is still near and dear to our hearts the stoned Witches Hour you'll know that I have a soft spot in my heart for a crypted I love a good crypted don't know what my Fascination is with them and we are actually going to talk about what is technically considered a Ule crypted yay now Krampus he's from central European folklore and he's like a almost what some people would consider a devil looking he's got goat legs he's got a tail he's got big curved horns and a long forked tongue and he's kind of like an anthropomorphic goat demon thing you know how I look at him like how I look at Krampus in my mind is he's like the Yang to Santa Claus's Yang that's a great way to look at it actually that's probably the the thing we should start off with is he's kind of like the opposite of Santa the opposite of St Nick St Nicholas the guy in the the red suit Doling out gifts yeah I always saw it as Santa takes care of the nice list somebody's got to be in charge of the naughty list and that would be Krampus yeah so kids leave their boots out in the hopes that if they're good it'll get filled with sweets and treats from St Nicholas but if they're bad Krampus leaves a stick in the boot to beat them with see now I never heard of the boot thing but continue on he whips naughty children so if you've been bad you either get whipped you get put in his bag and taken down to Hell or you just kind of get a Stern talking to I guess it really depends on which part of the legend that you believe so instead of being given coal they thought kids really needed to be scared straight I guess and so Krampus is supposed to put the fear of um going to hell I guess into kids so that they're nice Before Christmas comes well speaking of Hell by the way I I came across some information where it actually says that Krampus is the son of the god hell really actually yeah I'm not saying trust everything you read on the internet I'm just saying but I just want to point out it wasn't necessarily just in Germany it was like Central Europe right yeah the the eight Alpine countries um France Switzerland Italy parts of England Austria Slovenia so this was like a widespread view the other thing is that people tried to make the story of Krampus go away because they kind of felt it was a little mean but Krampus kind of made a big comeback in like the early 1900s and some of that had to do with early pop culture not that there was I don't know do you call the Roaring 20s pop culture I guess respects and after World War II as well he kind of made his his comeback I look at Krampus as a way to keep my kids good man am I horrible parent am I a horrible parent I mean I'm not talking about I'm not telling them the part about the switches of birch rods here anything but you know just the Santa rewards the good like you said somebody's got to tend to the B there's got to be balance sure I kind of like the story of Krampus and he's gotten very popular I think because we all know that everything's not all sugary sweet all the time and just like you said there has to be balance and so I think Krampus kind of fulfills that need and I I see like we posted a picture on Instagram of Krampus having tea with the marude and the Ule cat so you know like most things we like to see the softer side of our Krampus but he does balance out Santa Claus well like I said it kind of goes with my whole thought process of he's kind of the Ying to Santa's Yang you know exactly where there's light there's dark where there's good there's bad where there's happy there's sad everything everything has an opposite and he's the opposite of Santa and they're pretty sure that his Origins weren't exactly with Santa Claus they think he was possibly a pre-christian some type of demon or that kind of trickster spirit that lives in the dark and and I I just want to preface when I say Santa Claus I know that's kind of a North American thing but I I am also referring to jalo St Nick uh St Nicholas The Gift Giver on that cold December night whether you want to call him St Nicholas St Nick Santa Claus I am referring to all the same person now St Nick actually my family has a tradition that goes through my mother's side of the family far far far back and turns out it's actually a tradition from the St Nicholas story that involves oranges well we'll get into that a little bit later in the episode but before we go too much further I do want to say thank you so much to our listeners we have been loving all your comments and the emails the messages that you send us please keep them coming make sure to like And subscribe give us some

it literally is truly sometimes the highlight of my day so keep them coming so back to our our Cryptids another crypted that you introduced me to on the stoned Witches Hour last year was one that I can't even pronounce this name at all so I'm not going to try but it's also known as the Ule cat from Iceland okay can I can I I want to give it a go here got you gotta let me give this a go now you're known for being horrific at pronouncing words I was going to say for any of our longtime listeners you you know what's about to happen and it isn't pretty okay I am going to start with jolure oh that sounds so fancy it's probably so wrong so wrong the U you know and I'm so surprised at you when I found out whatever it was last year that you had never heard of the uat I was like are you serious you and your husband by the way are like Bonafide cat ladies like Bonafide that's definitely my husband he's the cat lady yeah yeah yeah but this is a quote unquote crypted which we all know I love and it comes from Icelandic lore so these folks in Iceland I need to go to Iceland and see what kind of cats they got roaming up there first of all this is a a cat that comes out at Ule now this cat is supposedly bigger than a house so you just got a picture that like 40 foot tall cat roaming around the countryside in Iceland now they describe him as a huge vicious cat as much as I pick on you Ila I am just as much of a damn cat lady don't let me kid you guys all I can picture when when they call this a huge vicious cat I just get a flashback of when I took my pretty little kitty which you know my little Jacks I took him to the vet one time and I leave the vet and they're like get him out of here we had to muzzle him he's violent get him out of here I'm like my baby what do you mean my baby's a lover I I'd probably be the one that would go hug the Yap and die um but they're so supposedly said to lurk the countryside during the Christmas season now in Icelandic folklore if you are good and you've done all your chores and have been a good child good person you get new clothes to wear before Christmas Eve if you were not good you did not receive any new clothing to wear before Christmas so The Story Goes that the Ule cat comes and eats people that don't have new clothes so now you know why your grandma gave you new undies for Christmas so the U cat wouldn't eat you but the other other version because I did there are two versions the other version of the story is that the cat would come and eat your Christmas dinner so you had had no Christmas dinner so either way either you're getting eaten or your Christmas dinner's getting eaten either way you're screwed if you're bad and you have no new clothes and you know that's so funny because I don't know about you but when I was a kid speaking of Grandma's did you always have to wear like a nice good outfit to like your family Christmas my grandmother did literally always give us socks and underwear is it because of the U cat I don't know possibly I I I need to have like a a seance or or do some medium work with with my grandma's because now I want to know if it had to do with the uat I think if it did they would have told us I would have hoped they would have told us but as I had mentioned um in our our previous podcast where I we did a whole episode on this there's some controversy on the start of the uat so this guy wrote a wrote a story in the mid 1800s and that's kind of where it came from they're not sure if he met a literal cat or if it was a figure of speech to quote unquote dress the cat because I love Cryptids I'm going with this shit's real there's a cat that's going to come eat you if you don't have clean clothes on for Christmas that is an excuse for me to get a kickass outfit before Ule that's all I'm saying but listen to this I think the Ule cat is just a different freaking version of Krampus just like there's the Yeti and Bigfoot same freaking thing one's just in the cold and one is in Canada yeah but Krampus is going to take you to hell or beat you with a switch if you've been bad the cat's going to eat you or eat all your food but you can fool the cat by wearing new clothes you can be bad all year long dress up before Christmas and you're golden with the U cat I think that's too big of a loophole there I just want to point out that Lila the first thing she comes up with is a damn Loop pole okay a damn pole just saying hey I I never said that Krampus and I weren't uh well acquainted but my theory is is that I think they could technically be I don't want to say the same thing but the uat could be Iceland's version of Krampus if you're bad you're if you're good Santa's coming man so now we've talked about two of the bad here's two of the little bit more fun and one of them I am absolutely in freaking love with and not just because it's kind of a horse in Welsh tradition apparently they have this creepy horse skull adorned with flowers and ribbons that goes around with singers asking for drinks and and challenges the homeowner like when they get to your house they'll challenge you to a song battle basically they sing a song and you have to keep singing the song Until somebody loses this just sounds like a rap battle with them um and you add a skull into it and and I love I love this tradition but I just get so creeped out at skulls oh my God oh my God why does it they look pretty freaky so this is called the Mari lude or I've also heard it pronounced ivari lude it's a tradition involving a literal horse skull or a puppet of a horse skull and someone dressed basically like a ghost and like a white sheet with his horse skull on top and they go around with basically naughty carolers essentially and have you do that there's like a traditional song it's like a back and forth song but at some point you have to start making up your own verses and it becomes like shell said a rap battle can somebody bring this tradition to Massachusetts seriously I really want to do this for real oh it gets better it's not just a rap battle at your door with the with a horse skull and some naughty carollers okay once the Mari lude wins she then comes into your house chases everybody around and then everyone gets drunk and has food if that's the case why would you even want to try to beat her just let her in and start drinking I think the tradition is she always wins and she comes in everyone has a drink and after she leaves the house is blessed with good luck for the new year okay okay I like this I like this no one's getting eaten no one's getting hit with a switch I love it I know you don't like bones and skulls and I know I do so I love this one but yeah they're not really sure where this tradition came from either it's thought that possibly it had something to do with you know bringing good health and cheer or maybe people were just really freaking bored in the middle of winter well you know the Welsh folks do have a history of BS and a lot of singing oral Traditions so kind of makes sense yeah and it could also be some type of Resurrection type thing as well because there is some evidence that they would take that horse skull and bury it in the ground and part of the ceremony may have been kind of like quote unquote bringing it to life every year bringing it up out of the ground do you know what type of songs I don't know what the traditional song is no there is a traditional song with some back and forth verses but then the rest of it gets made up but I don't know what it's called if somebody does know I would love to hear it I want to go participate in this for real I know right it sounds like fun okay what's your second one well I have well I have two more actually I lied I have lauana who's more of a Christian tradition but she seemed kind of cool she looks kind of like a witch so I think a lot of people bring her up she's like pictured like a like a crone like you're not green but think of like a traditional stereotypical witch figure the punched over older lady with the big crook nose with a wart on it uhuh and the idea is is that the three wise men when they were following the star to go find baby Jesus they stopped at this lady's house and she fed them and then they were leaving and they're like hey why don't you come with us and she said no no can't I have too much cleaning to do so the wise men leave and she feels bad she decides she's missing out she's got a lot of fomo so she takes her broom and a bag of candies and she leaves and starts following this star like the wise men but she's not really sure which kid is going to be Jesus so she just leaves little gifts and candies on the doorsteps of all the houses that have children in them and that tradition continues now kind of like a like a female Santa Claus oh that's cute cute never heard of that before yeah and I think she's brought up in Pagan circles because she does kind of look traditionally like a witch and she's often pictured carrying a broom interesting all I'm picturing is like the witch from Snow White yeah no think like an Italian Nana she's like an Italian folklore okay and then there's also have you seen the little straw goats that some people have that hang on their trees like as a decoration this time of year Goats No I mean I've seen the the straw decoration but not shaped in a goat so the last one I'm going to talk about is the Ule goat oh my God I love decorations holy crap is this a new one I can get do tell it is oh yeah so this one think okay did you watch the Marvel movie Thor love and thunder well yeah do you remember the screaming goats that he was given yeah Thor in Tradition actually does have a pair of goats and I can't remember their names that pull his Chariot and the Ule goats are thought to come from Thor's goats and so in Scandinavia and Northern Europe one of the Traditions is to have this straw goat and it's believed that the goat Spirit would appear before Christmas and make sure everything was proper and was done properly and good and would give you gifts I am literally writing this down that I need a straw goat ornament you need a straw goat there's a town called yav yav in Sweden and they make a giant Ule goat out of St draw and they keep trying to burn it down on Ule but the people burn it down beforehand and like in the last 35 years like on purpose it gets burnt down before it's supposed to be burnt down people are a little overly excited I Goa but yeah so it's burnt as a sacrifice kind of like a Ule log tradition interesting kind of neat right I need a damn straw goat to go with my pickle on my tree let's talk about trees okay I'm gonna defer to Shell because bringing Greenery into the house in the form of a Christmas tree or a Ule tree is her specialty now we're gonna talk real quick about some of our own personal traditions and I would just like to point out to everyone that plants come to me to die it's a sad reality I I try not to make it happen but here we are but a Christmas tree on the other hand and I'll talk in a minute about the fact that I called it at a Christmas tree by the way Lea is my witness and I probably should have gone to to some sort of group meeting for this but I have been known to have 11 decorated full-size trees in my house he's not exaggerating like I'm not talking about a two or three foot tree I'm talking about full like six seven foot trees and I don't want to say that I'm addicted to Christmas ornaments but but each kid has their own tree filled with their own ornaments don't judge me man because my kids my kids have an ornament for every year that they've been alive like their Christmas tree is the story of their life and now that I have a my poor grandson he's 18 months old and I love that little doll and for only this being his second Christmas I feel like I've already got a tubby of ornaments um these are memories people don't judge me but you know is much as I I joke about it it is like how I bring nature into my space in that cold dark period because also Ila is my witness I've also been known to leave those damn trees up until February part of it's because I'm lazy and love looking at him but I can't keep plants I can't even keep a spider plant I've given it a go the only thing I can keep alive here people is cats and kids and Christmas trees are the one time I can bring that type of thing into my space and with the ornaments I just love pretty things and shiny things and I just I can't even explain that addiction but to me it represents how I get in touch with my U people do the U log I have had apartments and in houses where I wasn't able to do the inside uog thing and I'm all for all or nothing I if if I have the uog dam I want to light it not just look at it so I've replaced kind of that ulog tradition with the whole damn tree and bringing in a living green tree is a fabulous symbol in the middle of winter in the dark before the sun comes back and so to have that Greenery in your home in any form is fantastic granted shell puts it in every single room of her home but you don't have to go that far you can just bring in some branches bring in a whole tree no go that far people truly my family likes to get a tree we've gotten live trees in the past and planted them we've also cut down our own or gone to a family farm and gotten the cut trees but we like to have a live tree but our tradition with it is after fule after Christmas we take the tree when we had property we would take it out on the property to a place where it would compost for the rest of the year and after we left it there we would make ornaments out of um edible ornaments essentially out of bird seed and sew peanut butter and pine cones that type of thing and tie them with cotton yarn and then put those ornaments on the tree where it's sitting for the year and then the next year we would go out and take the branches off of it for the fire and then take part of that trunk to be youu log wow I did not have that type of ambition back then when I had Mom I'm not gonna lie that is great but I just want the people out there who who just who just can't don't don't feel bad I'm jealous don't have to there's a lot of crafts that you can do this time of year but a u log can be a couple different things now you mentioned you don't have one we have had one a few times we didn't do it every year but a few times we've had a ulog basically just a piece of of the trunk of an old Christmas tree or you can use any log and then you put candles on it and decorate it however you'd like and it's basically the idea of bringing something in from outside and also with the U log it's the idea of a lot lot of people put wishes into it I've seen a few traditions where people would take that U log and then have it you know in their house someplace Central in December and then uh some people even have little slips of paper for guests to write a wish or a memory for the year stick it in the U log and burn it so I have a funny like childhood ulog story you're you're familiar with my family and and and such and Pagan they were not okay no but you know we all have those parents that they still have every damn decoration for Christmas that they've had since 1984 and yeah they may have added to it but they don't get rid of any of the old stuff oh no so every year you know we'd go up to my mother's attic and we would be dragging out all these these containers of Christmas stuff and she had a uog now I don't recall if it was real wood or if it was fake but you know the white birch and it had three red candles in it and I'd always remember because me and my brother used to play sword fight with the candles and then my mother would scream at us any and as I got older you know I just thought okay that's one of our Christmas decorations you know I was a kid what the hell do I know as I got older and found this path and whatnot and you know knew what Ule was and all of that you know I had moved out by then show up at my Mom's one year for Christmas damn thing sitting on a like a coffee table in living room and you know me I was kind of a smart ass back then and I'm like so everybody wants to talk about me being a witch why is there a uog here did you do that for me did you know when I was a kid because you know we all knew that that had been like a a lifelong household forever and well that has nothing to do with any of that yes it does so then of course you know me I start giving the whole oral history of the uog to my family they didn't take it pretty well and I think that the funniest part is there's a lot of these Traditions that overlap and not everybody realizes that they do and I think that's where kind of my thing with like Christmas and Ule people think oh you say Merry Christmas you have a Christmas tree you're doing Christmas this and that but you're a witch and and you're Pagan and how can that be Christmas for me is about everything that you will is about except maybe I'm the who just conveniently does it on Christmas Day because it's easier for my lifestyle and family situation I don't know what to tell you people but as far as the Jesus aspect that is that is not something that my family focuses on with Christmas it's about being together and making those memories and and doing the whole thing to me they're they're kind of one and the same and maybe that's a me thing that's a lot of pagans a lot of pagans share that same thing for exactly what you said sh that because the the holidays are so similar this time of year there's a lot of a lot of I mean there's Hanukkah there's K Quanza there's Ule there's Christmas there's so many stories about the light returning you know because in the northern hemisphere it is so dark and cold it's all really the it's all the same thing Ule and Christmas you know there's food there's giftgiving I love the fat man in the red soup I don't know what to tell you it's all stories of continuation of giving gifts to each other to help survive this really dark and cold and terrible time everybody hates it when the days get so short we're looking forward to that return of the light that Rebirth of the Sun and so a lot of different cultures and a lot of different religions have similar stories right now so it's very very easy to put Christmas and Ule right together and there's nothing wrong with that I just want to nothing wrong with that you know my my significant other and I happen to have our anniversary on Ule so yeah honestly celebrating Ule on December 25th is a little more convenient because I'm celebrate my anniversary on the 21st I'm sorry but that's my reality and it's okay it is and one of the things that I did to kind of help bridge the gap between Ule and Christmas because when you have kids it's very difficult I mean I sympathize for any family that doesn't celebrate Christmas how difficult it is to get away from you can't Lord and explaining that to my children when they were little that we don't really celebrate Christmas wasn't very easy we still did the tree we did the lights we did the cookies we did the presents we just did it a little differently and so to help them with that I created a ritual that my kids now that they're grow a little closer to sort of grown up still love and it's my favorite as well so it's pretty easy way easier than the Ule tree one what is it we have four candles the colors of this time of year are red green gold silver right Ule is usually the 21st the winter solstice so I got four candles one to represent the sun one to represent the moon one to represent the God and one to represent the goddess so on the night of Ule we turn off all the lights in the house and then we'll say a little bit of something that we're thankful for or something funny you know it's usually different every year and then one of the kids lights the candle for the Sun and then every night between Ule and Christmas we light an additional candle so the next night we light the sun candle and the moon candle then the next night after that the Sun the moon the god candle and then the last night Christmas Eve we light the Sun the moon the God and the goddess candles and each night represents something different and I would usually talk to to them about something witchy or Pagan or you know tell them some type of Ule story and that really helped to give them something to look forward to and we celebrated both Ule as a religious holiday and Christmas as a like you said like a family food giftgiving holiday and the candle ceremony was a way to tie it together and my kids still will not let me forget that even if we don't do any other decorating wherever we happen to be we have to do the candle ritual because it it means so much to them and I love that we used to you know when the when the kids were little the tree thing was very much a ritual but the more trees I put up and the more ornaments I had the more my kids were like yeah know now we kind of joke the last year to the space I've been in I have been not able to accommodate that many trees and lo and behold who messes it the kids you know whatever your tradition is make it important because it is important and whatever works for you freaking do it who cares what a book says or or what the calendar says if I'm gonna do my  on December 25th that's when I'm doing it as long as I'm doing it and honestly the whole month it's very special there's a feeling in the air around Ule and Christmas and I love that everyone's kind of trying to capture that especially now I I'm seeing way more cinnamon stick and dry orange sliced garlands I'm seeing pine cone garlands and burlap and and I'm seeing sticks that are tied in the form of stars and you know the oranges with the with the cloves stuck in them all these handmade crafts decorating people's houses for Ule is gorgeous and there's so much fun things to do with your friends with your kids with your family you know that's very natural that's very Pagan and Christmas oriented this time of year you know my favorite meme on the internet going around right now is what's that you know know how some of these memes go viral and they're like freaking everywhere my favorite one out right now is decorating Christmas trees is a form of Witchcraft and I'm like preach it I love it you know I kind of laugh at it and and make a joke out of it but it's not wrong bringing a tree in is so Pagan the candles Pagan candles this time of year just really represent that return of the sun to me it's that soft glow it's that beautiful light and when I was a kid I went to a Methodist Church my step family was Methodist and very big in the Methodist Church that's so funny because I did too I actually still think of the Christmas Eve midnight ceremony that they used to do my family would bundle up we'd walk down the street to the church and everyone would get a candle as they walked in and then if I was lucky I'd get a seat up in the balcony and I loved it up there because at one point during the ceremony all the lights would get very very dim and people would come down the center aisles with lit candles and they would light the candle of the end person on the aisle and then each person would light the candle of the person next to them so if you were looking from above it was just this gorgeous sea of Candlelight flowing out to everybody in the room and then they would sing like Silent Night and beautiful hymns like that and there were different times you're supposed to raise and lower your candle as you were singing H it's given me chills just thinking about it it was the most gorgeous Pagan witchy thing I have ever seen in my life in a Christian Church  you just plagiarized my childhood Christmas Eve right how cool was that but but my only twist was you know I I I actually my my family was weird I did go to a Methodist Church for a while but my same story was going to the Catholic church when my mom decided to turn Catholic different episode and the only differ was and maybe maybe you just forgot this detail when you would when you would walk down the street because I only lived like two blocks from the church we'd walk they would put white paper bags on the sidewalk and have candles lit so you had this like luminaries yeah yeah like almost like the path to church kind of thing a like at Brushwood in the fairywood right and I lived close enough to the church where they started that path like right in front of my house so one of my fondest Christmas Eve memories is midnight mass and walking down the street and it's just starting to snow very lightly and it's like these paper bags lit with candles all down the sidewalk gorgeous that is something that we have in common everybody has so much in common this time of it took me to but the only problem is it led me to the whole sit stand Neo  now the last one I'm going to talk about is a family tradition that came through my mother's side of the family and I didn't know what it meant for the longest time until I was an older teenager but when I was a kid every year for Christmas in our stockings we would get an orange and a sorted nuts you know that's so weird because I got the nuts too what's with the damn nuts what's with the oranges I just thought I thought it was my grandma trying to like sneak in a point there when I asked my mother about it all she knew was that her mother did it her mother's mother did it and as far as she knew it was just a very old family tradition I know you well enough to know you researched this why do people do this yeah I did okay so the story goes back to St Nicholas and apparently back in St Nick days there was a trio of young women who were unmarried with their widowed father who did not have enough money for a doy for them so because they were were not able to afford to get married they were going to be sold to be servants what the hell right so sad terrible these three beautiful maidens destined to just be unmarried servants forever and St Nick heard about this and so one evening on his way past the home he threw some gold down the chimney now these young women being very studious awesome hardworking young women had put up their stockings to dry by the fireplace the night before the stockings were hung by the chimney with care exactly and St Nicholas's gold fell into the stockings very conveniently the next morning the young women awoke and each found a small nugget of gold in the toe of her stocking and was therefore able to pay for a dowy and get married and so you know starts the story of St Nick bringing it in so now oranges very similar to a nugget of gold right no they get ripe like right around this time of year but it's very rare in a Northern climate to have an orange so you had to be very wealthy to have this citrus fruit in the middle of winter I gota it almost like not a status symbol but kind of yeah I got you kind of yeah and also a very healthy treat vitamin C was probably not very common in the midst of winter and the same thing with the nuts they were rare the one thing my mom said was that she thought that they meant health wealth and happiness to have those in your stocking that sounds good yeah very Pagan right it kind of has that origins in you know bringing you wealth for the next year if you have these in your stocking so I do that with my kids now but they get chocolate oranges I always was like man what's the nuts even my stepmother my stepmother still and then my kids are like why do I get nuts I don't faking know I don't know see these Traditions are like lost in time we don't even know where they came from anymore and and you know what I'm that one okay I'm Breaking All the Rules my kids get Peppermint Patties they get it's almost like Halloween in their stocking like I give them candy like I don't know if I gave my kids nuts I think they'd throw them at me at this stage of the game now the one one thing that I really want to adopt this year you know what they call like the last or the the Lost weeks of the year right after Christmas nobody's really counting whether you're good or bad it just kind of flows into the next year work is usually quiet this time of year family is usually around so we're usually pretty mellow and do home comfy cozy things this time of year but I discovered that in some cultures Ule was probably celebrated for 12 days from Ule till New Years uh what the hell the 12 Days of Christmas my true love gave to me yeah but I think that's something different so I don't know but if you know the history of this someone please email us and tell us Beck onth broomstick gmail.com because I want to know I'm loving the idea of the 12 days of Ule I first heard it from a YouTuber called Ivy the occultist who has a a whole challenge for the 12 days of Ule but apparently it's it's a time of self-care of you know going within of basically just being all Co and and snug in your house and I want to do that that sounds like a great idea this year I don't even think I have it in me leading up to Christmas Lord I could do it the 12 Days After Christmas but man well that's what it is it's from Ule to the end of the year you're supposed to take it easy and chill and just be good to you
