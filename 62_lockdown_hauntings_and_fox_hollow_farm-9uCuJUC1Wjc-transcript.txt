it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 62 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast to wickedly High best friends get together to Dish about the latest weed Trends Blaze the sweet sticky icky and tell Chilling Tales of ghostly hauntings paranormal happenings and fish crypted creatures and finally off of her lady and white [ __ ] I'm Leila and I'm shell and I'm already so high that I got the munchies before we even started so I'm eating this strawberry Hostess cake and I'm loving it that's that's that's a lot of food coloring that's very pink that's that's quite pink and it's quite delicious you know I'm still smoking the same weed I had last week because as I said last week I bought in bulk and this sh you are you are laughing you are chatting but you're eating I'm not gonna lie and this damn cupcake is like the best thing I have ever ate right at the moment well I have to say you are definitely known for having the munchies so I am not surprised now last week we were talking about having a Sherie Board of your amazing weed that you got what was the place that you went to called it was called Mission my new shop because it's cheap cheap and kick ass who doesn't love cheap and kick ass and of course I had gotten that big beautiful hot box from hot box which was badass nine different kinds of wheat of course it is long gone very very tasty I love you smoked that whole box oh I had help it wasn't just me gotcha gotcha I I I have totally transitioned to my beautiful new pipe that we talked about last week it is gorgeous in Spring Lake I love it let me tell you you gotta you got to hit it gently because let's all remember back to the new pipe puff you that that first puff and you're like whoa that's clean you know there's cough to get off and then there's wow I just bust a lung so I've been being gentle with it but it's really nice to have brand new again I also love New pieces and I'm smoking right now out of my little tiny bubbler bong and also my Salem Massachusetts glass piece oh I remember when you got that here yes I love it so much it's fabulous you've been big into the silicone lately which I love now what does the actual bowl piece look like because when I'm buying a piece of glass especially nowadays you'll find all sorts of cheap and really pretty glass pieces to the point where my husband doesn't even like to clean glass he'll give it away or whatever and then buy a new $20 $15 glass piece because it to him it's easier than cleaning it I'm trying to be really careful about this because it's still packed I'm trying to take the bowl piece out so I took the bow piece out so the inside is like normal silicone what you would expect the bowl piece is a little metal insert and it the way the silicone is there's like a lip here so when it goes in it like tucks under the lip so it's not like it's going to come out you know you're not like you have to I don't want to say now is that little metal cup that goes into the silicone bowl is that does that have holes in it like a colander all over little holes all over correct I like that you don't need a screen or nothing I mean it's almost like built-in screen type now do those holes clog up easily does that little metal piece clog up probably for the normal smoker no but on occasion you know how I get you know how I roll but that looks pretty easy to run through to run through some hot water or to put a little alcohol and salt in clean pretty easily what I do is I pop out um and I have this cleaner that I actually use it is it's called grunge off superer and then what I do with the silicone pipe is I take some of this grunge off and I dump it in a Ziploc baggie and then I I take the the metal bowl piece out I put the cap in there I take the cap off but put it in there so like this is this what you're seeing I know our listeners can't see this but I'm showing Leila I have a Ziploc baggie full of my other pipe that's pretty gross it is pretty gross but I let it sit in there for like 24 hours rinse it off in hot water it's like brand new nice even the metal piece you can get like shiny brand new like right back to literally brand new status with the grunge off with yeah but I've also used just hot water it just takes longer because it's sticky res you know yeah I I use a two-step method I use super hot water on all of my glass pieces hot water and just regular dish soap and then I'll go to a little bit of salt and rubbing alcohol to clean up that last little sticky bit of residue and then back to the hot water and dish soap and I'm done easy peasy well that big big jug of uh grunge off is only like 14 bucks and I can use it probably like 15 or so times so and it sounds like that's a very simple method you just pour it into a container cover it over with that Grunge off and let it sit and you're done where my method yeah whereas my method is like washing dishes right right but you know as you can see I did this last night and this water is like black car yeah looks like you have motor oil in that bag now when I buy a glass bowl the biggest thing I look for is it has to be comfortable to hold and secondly the bowl piece itself there's two things I look for in a glass bowl piece no matter how much I'm spending on it whether it's that $15 car piece or if it's a $200 house piece the bowl part has to have the intake hole at the very bottom a lot of people will get screens or I've lately started using um stems I'll cross stems at the bottom of a two big hole to make like my own personal little screen how come I never thought of that that's a genius idea right well I started having this big pile of stems and I have this big huge hole at the bottom of this beautiful bowl and you're were high one night and you were looking at the hole and looking at the stems and looking at the hole and looking at the stems exactly so I just kind of laid them in there like a little cross hatch and then I put my butt on top of it was it works fabulously but I you I usually don't buy bowls that have that big of an intake hole at the bottom for that very reason because you yeah but sometimes down it but if they're so pretty you can't help yourself exactly just like this my little Pentacle piece here it was too pretty my husband bought it for me as a gift so I just layer the stem pieces in the bottom the other thing to look for is you don't want the bowl itself to be too big and you don't want it to have that chalice shape you know what I mean like bigger at the bottom and then narrower at the top right right because then it never Burns right you want it to have a nice Bell shape and you don't want it to be too deep a big bowl for a party is one thing and it definitely should be bell-shaped and not Challis shaped narrower at the top is bad I guess is what my stoned brain is trying to say you don't want the big hole at the bottom you don't want the narrow top and uh other than that you're good to go but if you do get the big hole layer your stems easy peasy screen and you don't have to worry about inhaling metals or anything but all of that aside I am smoking a a mut of my own creation I guess so let me guess it's got Jack hair in it you're close go again guess again gelato yes it has it's a white witow gelato cross ooh super tasty super tasty now here's the problem so what's it taste like you say super tasty like like give me give me an idea like is it fruity is it is it gassy because it's a mut we have several different phenotypes and kind of like your old grandpa cookies you know Grandpa cookies 1 2 3 four five 10 million right right so we've narrowed this down to four different phenotypes and the one that I'm smoking right now is very crystally very purple has a very purple so it's like the purple of the gelato but the white coated crystals of the white widow oh it tastes very grapy now does it really taste grapey yes it tastes fruity it has that sweet kind of grape taste to it and I love it it's that kind of grain grapy taste that fruity taste I really me want to hop in the car and drive all the way 100 million miles to you to smoke this right this is some of my favorite gelato and as you can tell by my face I am super stoned in the stratosphere so I'm very very excited but because it's a first generation who the [ __ ] knows if we're going to be able to replicate this but we're going to try and um so I'm already calling it Lea's lady in white weed oh my God I'm working we're workshopping that name Lea's W lady in white weed that's too long but we'll get there I'm a I'm I'm still smoking the banana pudding tan lovely it's just lovely that's all I've got to say about it now what does that taste like does it just taste like weed is it just it just tastes like weed yeah like there's no fruity banana taste I I you know they made that [ __ ] up totally but the name is cute you know who doesn't like a little banana pudding Tain and that's getting you high as [ __ ] from what I remember last time yeah it is getting getting me high as [ __ ] and I like to the point where I've transitioned from strawberry Hostess CupCakes to dark chocolate filled Oreos so oh wow oh wow that sounds like a really great combination dark chocolate Oreos and strawberry Hostess CupCakes yeah that is not a high [ __ ] combination I don't know what is shell and that's what you get that's what you get from banana puding T wow I don't even remember the the jars across the room and I'm too stoned to get up and get it but if I recall it was like uh over 30 % we do love the over 30s we don't want to pay for them yeah my typical range yeah we want a high THC for a low low price which you can find at Mission I don't know 250 is that's about what you paid right 250 for that ounce 215 215 you paid 215 for that ounce yeah that's that's still a little expensive for my blood for for a 30% THC that's a great price but I'm a poor [ __ ] I still want to pay 120 150 tops yeah but here in Massachusetts that's like as good as it's getting at the moment so you know you don't kick a gift horse in the mouth right I am very much looking forward to I have found even more craft weed grower fairs really craft pot fairs in the area and other than the Lilac craft fair I'm not sure if I'm still going to be here when the next lilac craft fair is in April but there are some other ones in the area and I'm very excited to go check them out I'm super stoked to meet more local farmers do you think that um because things have kind of picked up um with the legalization and and and the more normality of of smoking weed do you think with spring and summer uh headed our way here in the northern hemisphere that you're going to find a significant amount more of these festivals or craft fairs if you will I hope so do you think they're going to be a lot more common um I want to say yes but I'm afraid I'm afraid it's no so I think things are so much in flux right now because the the market on the East Coast particularly in places like New York is so volatile they're not rolling out legal weed quickly enough and so these gray Market stores and sellers are proliferating they really need to make sure to take care of their farmers and their Growers and I'm worried that New York state is going to kind of get fed up with the lawlessness of it all and start to crack down and so I don't know I don't know what the future of of these farmers markets will be but I love them I want it to continue I want to go to a weed farmers market and listen to some music and buy some good food that's infused with fabulous locally grown pot I want that I want that a lot and so I hope New York state does the right thing and keeps these around because the way the weed Market is right now without regulation is actually pretty fantastic and I think as soon as we start getting regulations involved it's going to hurt things and make it worse you really need to come to Massachusetts and spearhead a festival we we it could be like a music weed festival get all the different stores to come and put up little vendor slots where they have yeah like okay I'm down we should we can headline that just like the witch Festival that you went to not too long ago that we feature on our other podcast back on the broomstick we could have a weed festival that we headline right that would be so much fun and just all the different stores and all the different farms around Massachusetts involved we could have some weed fluenc come we could have some local farmers come and local shop owners how great would that be I don't know if you remember this from last year but I do know we talked about it on the podcast last year they do a Massachusetts Cannabis Cup here oh yeah a lot of places do stuff like that you know hey why not build a festival around it [Laughter] right it should happen it should happen but anyway so this weed is really good I'm loving it I'm scared that I'm never going to have it again now are you are you in you're are you like in full-blown growing season now I am yes well I'm in full blown indoor growing season um I have my auto flowers are just about completed I'm in the harvesting phase of my last Autoflower garden and I love them because they're very short growing period I don't usually love the yield they tend to be lower THC like 27% 24 27% is pushing the upper limits of a of an Autoflower which again is great for your average user but if you you know if you want something super super heavy these aren't it they're going to be great for during the day but and the yield is also lower but they're fast and I like them because they're fast and easy and and if my living situation is in flux these are easy but I'm also getting prepared to grow outdoors and I'm helping family in the area who all have medical cards um I will be starting some photo period plants that I'm super stoked about we should put them up on the Instagram the seed packets I sent you what does photo period mean oh yeah I'm talking about two different kinds of plants I talked about autof flowers that are the fast ones aof flowers don't need the light cycle to change you can keep them on 24 hours of daylight and they'll go from a young plant to a plant that's producing flowers all on their own automatically hence autoflow and they tend to have a very short growing time isn't that what plants are supposed to do well photo period plants what they really do is as the sun um you know it's springtime now right the days are getting longer and then towards fall they're going to start to get shorter again right and that change in light triggers the plants to flower so you know you have a certain amount of daylight and then you have darkness and so the dark period is what triggers a photo period plant to flower and that's what most plants are is photo period plants and traditionally cannabis is a photo period plant but they take a lot longer um particularly [ __ ] sativas um but they can take a very long time but those she's not bitter folks not bitter at all they're so delicious and beautiful and wonderful and they're so picky and take so long so basically the the autof flow you're just going against nature and forcing the light cycle that you want whereas photo you're just following the natural light cycle of the Season yeah they're both natural the autoflowers are part what's called ruderalis like you have Cannabis sativa well these are cannabis ruderalis so they they it you know what we don't need to go there you're way too scientific for me yeah yeah it's not important the important thing is is yes I'm starting to grow some photo period plants so that I can take clones of them because we're going to be growing Outdoors this is going to be my first year growing a big Garden outdoors and also um supplying clones to um several friends and family that have like I said have medical cards that will all be also growing Outdoors so I'm very excited to get that started but we're going to start those seeds so that they're ready to go out on the East Coast the first week of June so if you need a tester you just give me a ring and I will let you know the quality of your grow how about that you got it shelle once we are ready to harvest I'll have you and your curved scissors out here in a Flash so I came up with this like interesting this interesting article um that that spawned some stories for me this week and you find sh I wanted I I wanted to get your take on this because you you know I I do got some some real life stories uh to talk about but there's a theme here that I think we all might be a little familiar with oh okay I started reading about a couple of different stories and and the more I looked the more I found that during this recent three-year period of craziness that we've had people have realized that they're quarantining with they've been quarantining with a ghost oh I'm not I guess that makes a lot of sense people were spending a lot of time at home you know maybe you'd notice more Paranormal Activity given more time to pay attention I guess that that's exactly what it is you know you're you're kind of locked down and all of a sudden you're realizing you have a lot more spectral roommates than you thought you did some people come to find out found that the pandemic was a lot less isolating than they bargained for really you know I would personally welcome it well yeah I mean I imagine that would break up some of the monotony of lockdown if you have a poltergeist you know moving chairs around and rearranging your kitchen one of the first U stories I came across was this this gentleman named Adrien Gomez and again this is during the pandemic so we're talking within the last three years these aren't like 100y old stories okay so current ghost stories I love current ghost stories so so this gentleman Adrien Gomez um living in Los Angeles first few days of Sheltering in place um when the when the pandemic started everything was kind of fun and you know we all were there you know you kind of baked and took walks and did stuff nobody knew if we were gonna work or not for a few weeks so they were just kind of living their lives um in their apartment and everything seemed to be going fine um enjoying the first few days of being sequestered um yeah before we knew what kind of [ __ ] we were all in right I remember the first week I was like this ain't so bad you know and then after month seven I'm like what the hell I just want to go to Target so after after a little bit of of you know nothing going on everything fine all of a sudden at nighttime their door knobs began to Rattle vigorously so loud they could hear him across the apartment and obviously no one's there oh this went on for a few days and then one night Mr Gomez about mid April so you figure that's what like when when did this all start like mid-march about a month in so he's about a month in now to being quarantined he's in bed in the nearby window shade began shaking against the window frame so intensely that despite the fact that the window was closed the cat jumped off the bed scared of it so the window's closed it's not wind okay just the shade just starts shaking against the window you know when an animal when a pet like a dog or a cat gets nervous that's when I start paying attention and that's that's what I was first thinking I was like you know you get a cat scared you better be looking around right being in LA the guy first thought that it was an earthquake you've been out that way [ __ ] just shaken that's right it happens it's pretty normal You' be sitting on the toilet and suddenly the door starts rattling yeah it happens so then it turned into him and his Husband were laying in bed one night and started to hear distinct footsteps above their head no one lives above them they just kind of thought H you know maybe somebody broke in you know maybe it's a homeless person they just kind of hunkered down and ignored it then their lights start blinking on and off I would that sounds like something's trying to get their attention it does and they just kind of lived with it and and this is where wait wait wait they just they were just like H that's just a Tuesday yeah they just they just went with it they didn't try to look into it or get freaked out or anything what the [ __ ] I would be freaking out I would be looking up the history of my house right then and there like who died here what kind of Supernatural fault line is this house built on did they just remove the headstones I mean come on you wouldn't look into that I would no like that like like to the point where they just were like yeah you know we just we spent the next however long you know two and a half years hanging out just living with it yeah okay like literally that's that's where their story ends they're just like all right this is it we're living with it there are some people who are so determined to ignore this stuff that they will just kind of live with it live with it and pretend like it's not happening make excuses for it I think well honestly this gentleman Mr Gomez he's 26 and he works in it support you know the type oh yeah usually very skeptical yeah very skeptical and very rational right and he's probably just like you know what I got to work in the morning I got [ __ ] to do I gotta smoke my pipe I gotta fix this server and I gotta go to bed and do it all over again and pick up the damn phone for stupid people who knocked the cable out of their computer I ain't got time ghosty no time for ghosts that's right but I did I did find humor in the fact that their story just kind of ended with we lived with it that's hilarious that's what my husband would do he would just ignore it and just go on about his business so then I came across another story about a a family a a husband wife and their daughter who decided they were actually in New York City and decided to go spend six weeks in Western Massachusetts at Airbnb and you know I I have to drive through western Mass to get back to New York and western Mass reminds you of New York it's very wooded kind of spread out and just screams creepy ghosties in it really does so there was a man named Patrick Hines he was the husband he wakes up in the middle of the night so they're at this Airbnb in western Mass wakes up in the middle of the night around 3:00 am thirsty for water first of while you wake up at 3:00 a. should tell you right there you're in for a little yeah you're in for an experience already so he says he walked into the kitchen and saw a white man in his 50s wearing a well-worn World War II Era military uniform just sitting at the table so is this one of those I thought this was my Airbnb reenactor kind of people well Mr hindes just happens to be the host of a podcast called True Crime obsessed no no no how lucky do you wait a minute wait so this is like you and me having a ghost show up in our kitchen yeah oh okay tell me more what happened so of course the guy's interested he said in the split in that Split Second when he looked at the guy it seemed normal that's exactly how you and I would react we're like hey World War II dude what's up then like wait what wait as soon as my stone brain catches up with what I just saw so for him it seemed kind of normal for that Split Second and then he had that wait what and then when and he quick like glanced back and the guy was gone no [ __ ] no [ __ ] he said that it didn't feel like a menacing Spirit at all and he said it didn't even occur to him to like wake up the family and tell them he just kind of went back to bed and was like me going back to bed saw a ghost wait a minute wait a minute how do you how sleepy do you have to be to just like completely gloss over the fact that you saw a full-blown Apparition sitting in your kitchen and just go back to sleep just like well I guess that's what happens when you're the host of a [Music] podcast hey no no no I'm the host of a podcast and I would not [ __ ] just go back to sleep I'd be calling you I'd be whipping out the tarot cards I'd be getting what's going on it's got a message I know it's got a message what's the message right I would not be so nonchalant about it I just think it's hysterical because like that's kind of the end of that guy's story too so that's like two people are just like man saw a ghost I'm good got [ __ ] to do moving on you know I love how nowadays people are just like yep house is haunted they're a great roommate things are fine and they leave it at that there was this one man Mr Tenny who described his house during the pandemic when the Sun goes down the house starts to warm up oh damn what a way to Des that's scary what a way to describe it uh this this gentleman in his house he would hear bricks pop and wood expand even though it was not getting like extreme temperatures and normally in other times the house wouldn't make a sound just weird stuff one lady described um during the pandemic she said that there was an old woman woman who would sit in a rocking chair and hum all day oh no nope nope nope nope nope the rocking chair ghosts freak me the [ __ ] out I you like rocking Ghosts no no for some reason the the ones that make the rocking chairs move I don't know maybe it's one too many Amityville horror movies when I was a kid but a rocking chair that moves because of a ghost that just no that's too scary for me I hate those you don't think those are like super [ __ ] scary I mean come on you wake up you're in your Airbnb it's all cozy you know you're falling asleep and you hear creek creek and you open your eyes and in the corner of the room that old [ __ ] rocking chair is back and forth back and forth all by itself you're not telling me you wouldn't [ __ ] start screaming get the [ __ ] out and demand your money back for that Airbnb and go stay in a goddamn Hotel because no because rocking chairs make me think of Grandma's so I think there's somebody's grandma just sitting there and how how threatening is a grandma yeah but it's somebody's like creepy grandma who wants to scare you and eat your soul how you it's never a nice Grandma how do you know did you ask if they wanted to eat your soul maybe they just are like feeling like they missed their grandkid and are trying to like how many movies have you seen where the rocking chair ghost was good how many shell tell me well I can't think of any exactly that's my point they are never good they never have good intentions so I'm sorry from the person who loves Lady and whites I do I do love them and orbs those are my favorites rocking chair ghost not so much so anyway sorry keep going but but I I the thing is is that this woman uh jany I'm probably saying the name wrong you know how I am with names jany Cowen she came across the ghost that she started calling Matthew you want to know why she started calling it Matthew why' she start calling it Matthew because it was a good Biblical name and she chose it and hopes it would keep him on his best behavior she's like well you can come here but I'm giving you a good Christian name so that you'll behave yourself pretty much did that work so Matthew as he's known um likes to run up and down the staircase at night in her house and she has said that this is not like house settling or cats walking around it is clearly a ghost running up and down the staircase and she describes it as he's just out to get attention oh wow well you and I have both heard the difference between a creaking staircase and the distinct sound of someone walking up and down a staircase right two different things right right um but Matthew um doesn't seem to have you know any I'm gonna eat your soul intentions maybe because he has a good Biblical name he's behaving himself but what Matthew does do is sometimes that um when people are in the guest bathroom all of a sudden like okay so you you you're you got to pee you go in the bathroom all of a sudden the shower will just blast water out for like four or five seconds and then stop really what is it with ghosts and showers how many ghosts have we heard of that turn on like the showers in a hotel room or something like that why do they do that is it the water thing and what has happened is there's been a couple of times where guests who've used that bathroom when they were in the shower were blasted with cold water and when they've brought plumbers in they've found that the hot water line had been turned off wow that that's pretty freaky yeah that sounds vely demonic yeah right there was another woman um named Madison Hill she was actually originally from the United States but right before the p mic she went to Florence Italy and a few weeks into quarantine in Italy she would wake up in the in the morning and find things on her nightstand that weren't there the night before one time she found a camera lens that she had brought over from the United States but had lost it as soon as she got to Italy and hadn't seen it since woke up in the middle of the night with it on her on her bedst stand so it's like a crow ghost like bringing her presence of things that she's lost yes because other small objects including sets of keys um have shown up or been moved around there's been reapp reappearances of um you know how sometimes you like lose a lighter or you know you might lose like a wristband or something oh yeah hey the house I'm staying in in New York has is known for doing that so things will just randomly disappear and then months and months later reappear on her bed stand and it seems to always appear on her bed stand so it's almost like something's going out and finding her stuff and bringing it back to her that's [ __ ] wild I love that that's like this meme I see on Facebook all the time if you're gonna do all that [ __ ] can you mop the floor while you're here like serious why don't ghosts ever clean up man if you have ever had a ghost in your house that did chores please email us at the stoned Witches Hour gmail.com and let us what their hourly rates are right the Poltergeist or Fay activity or ghost activity or I don't know what activity um has continued in this house including my daughter's credit card got stolen right off the desk this is still happening it's still happening she looked for it for days and could not find it and it finally appeared in a box that's under her bed in the middle of the floor under her bed the credit card appeared in that box under some clothes that's like the 10th time that's happened to you guys that house and I I don't know what's up with this house but it loves to take things and then will'll eventually allow you to find them but it takes a while and it always comes out in some weird spot then you are having the same exact experience as this young lady is having in Italy yeah and apparently we're just ignoring it too but you know it's all fun in games why kick them out why exercise the demon let them take your [ __ ] and play with it no harm why not they're not harming anything it's just Matthew you know I'm just a [ __ ] around and find out kind of girl so see you should come over before we leave this particular spot come on over and we'll do the Ouija board thing oh my God yes yes yes yes so those are my kind of pandemic quarantine people are people are coming across things more and you know I think of what it is is less outwardly communication kind of more in tune with your surroundings your home more how many people have spent more time at home in the last three years than ever in life exactly they're going to see things that they never saw before and and you know as we have found before if you do some type of renovation or if you make some type of change to your routine or change to the home that very often will stir up some type of energy or things to happen where it might not have before and how many people did home renovation projects they were home or just the fact of now they're home during the day whereas before they were gone all the time right be enough to disrupt the energy in some of these more sensitive places or even to the extreme of people who were working overnight shifts are now home at night right exactly and now they're there to see it right right but I think that that people are a little more in tune they're a little more present and can kind of hear and see more than they've ever heard or saw I don't think that there's an uprise in in ghosty activity I think there's an uprise in people noticing I think you're right I think you're exactly right because as we have proved in over the last 62 episodes there is no shortage of haunted locations whether it be buildings physical land people who have Spirits attached to them so I just think it's not that it's happening more I just think we're more aware and noticing it more that's really my story I love it I love those stories those are so fun but I just thought I just thought it was interesting that that so many people were having like these pandemic experiences with ghosts no this ain't new you just started noticing fools exactly okay so have I got a story for you shell this is a little true crimey we are going to Carmel Indiana I feel like I've heard that maybe I know there's a Carmel California maybe I just like caramel because I'm stoned oh yeah and you are kind of hungry that's true I am okay so we're going to Carmel Indiana which is actually kind of outside of Indianapolis to a place called Fox Hollow Farm and unfortunately Fox Hollow Farm is famous because of a terrible terrible serial killer that lived there oh [ __ ] oh yes I'm not sure when Fox Hollow Farm was built or any of that but it is a very large 18 acre estate with a big beautiful house on it five bedrooms has an indoor Olympic siiz swimming pool you know horse stables the whole nine I'll take it right gorgeous forests on the land and everything absolutely stunning property well it was purchased in the early 80s by a gentleman named herb bow Meister and herb and his wife Julia were kind of like nvo re they had recently made their fortunes because herb had borrowed some money from his mother and purchased a store like a thrift store I believe and that became very popular he soon had several of these stores I believe they were in the Indianapolis area wait you mean 1980s right right the 19 okay okay this is in the 1980s he made quite a bit of money and purchased this big huge estate his wife and three children interestingly the news articles and the documentaries that I've seen all kind of try to paint herb as this kind of quiet shy nerdy guy that nobody would ever suspect was a serial killer that's how they always are yeah but if you dig a little bit deeper and actually talk to people that knew him they're all like yeah he was creepy as [ __ ] the guy couldn't keep a job he'd been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and was supposed to receive treatment but never did his Dad tried to hospitalize him for schizophrenia shortly after his marriage and he wouldn't stay he did things like he had a job at one point and he was discovered peeing on people's mail that would go out if I worked at the DMV I'd probably pee on people's mail too let's be real and I guess people even said that when he was a kid he was obsessed with urine and he would even say things to his classmates like he wondered what pee would taste like and would chase the boys around asking for a drink that's creep well like you got issues there pal yeah he pissed on a teacher's desk once and put a dead bird on another teacher's desk and he is quoted as saying that when he was younger he liked to play with animals and dead animals in particular and he like to squeeze them they always say that that is a sign of oh that that that that's usually like a sign of serial killer traits or something right that's some some of the warning that someone could develop into that um I I think there's been some question about that lately but regardless it's [ __ ] disturbing so he definitely had issues his wife Julia said that they had sex maybe five or six times in their entire marriage and had three children as a result of that but they had a very cold marriage from what everybody said and the facts say that she spent even after they moved into this big beautiful house she would often spend Summers and long stretches of time at her family's house or at their lake house at a different location away from him basically away from him correct so even though he's portrayed in some news articles as being a devoted husband just quiet and nerdy it sounds like the reality was he was really really weird and had a terrible relationship with his wife while they're living here you know the wife gets home with the children after spending several weeks away um Springtime and one of her children comes into the kitchen holding a human skull what and says he had found it just out back of the house in the woods oh my God herb immediately says that the skull was from a um you know those like bones that doctors sometimes will have in their offices those skeletons yeah like the Halloween decorations yeah like the Halloween decorations of like a skeleton but they'll have like real ones yeah turb told his wife he quickly took the skull away from his kid and told his wife that his father had been a doctor and that it was one of his skeletons from his office and that he had decided to bury it out back I don't know I've been married a couple times and I I I'm pretty sure I found out long before then that what what what my father-in-law has did for a living that's kind of sketch Julia thought it was a little sketch as well particularly because not too long before this had happened the police had come to her house and asked to search the property and she had denied them after this now she's wishing she hadn't herb leaves to go on one of his many road trips for business and she decides to call the police and allow them to come search the property lo and behold they find thousands of Bones oh my God they immediately find nine corpses dismembered in various ways across the woods in the back of the property they found several different pieces in the stream and quite a few of them buried under a compost pile and some smaller bones burned in a burn pile closer to the house so he had killed a lot of people then he' killed a lot of people he then disappeared turned up in Canada and committed suicide in Canada now were who were these were these people were they homeless people were they prostitutes like missing like who are these people so in mid 990s in about 1993 in Indianapolis uh reports started coming out of young men in the gay community there disappearing oh quite a few of them disappeared and that's when um one young man said he had been assaulted by a man named Brian Smart who had taken him to his employer's house that had a big old pool in it the man Brian Smart had assaulted this young gay man and he'd only come to afterwards um he doesn't know how he just remembers waking up and feeling very sketched out by the whole situation and managed to extricate himself from Brian smart and get away he says at the pool he had seen what looked like mannequins sitting in the chairs around the pool and he reported this to the police but they couldn't find any Brian smart they couldn't find the property they they pretty much dismissed it it it was young gay men in the 9s the police didn't give a ful were the mannequins really dead bodies yes oh my God so this continued until about 1995 and that's when bow meister's son found the skull in the woods and then his wife started to put things together and finally allowed the police to search the property it sounds like he was probably actually a closet homosexual who could couldn't come to terms with his own sexuality and therefore turned into a murderer well I think he was a murderer that just happened to also be gay and he he definitely was closeted for sure and I'm sure that contributed to it in some way what he did was he would go to these bars and he would pick up young men and he would take them back to the pool of his house he liked autoerotic asfixiation and the the young man that managed to escape going by the name Brian SM he had told this man that he really like to see men's faces as he strangled them right up to the point of death so he'd Cruise the nightclubs he'd pick up these guys he'd bring them back to the pool and he would he would kill them there and then he would bury them in the backyard at first he buried them pretty far back in the woods but as time went on and he didn't get caught it's the rized that he started burying them closer and closer to the house also on his business his many business trips that he would go on gay men started showing up Dead in Ditches from strangulation all along I70 which is the route that he would take on his so-called business trips and so it's it's estimated that he killed um they found 11 bodies that they could identify on the farm and they found nine bodies along I70 that were attributed to him holy [ __ ] they had found thousands of Bones and fragments of Bones scattered across the property and they have not been able to identify all of the victims as of yet oh my God on the property above the garage is an apartment a one-bedroom apartment that's kind of connected to the house and like on top of the garage and some of the stories say that if he brought the young man to that apartment they lived but if he brought them to the pool those are the ones that he killed he had different places around the property that he would bring people after his wife kind of allowed the the police to go search the property and they started finding all these remains he took off and went to Canada and he wrote like a really really long suicide note I guess before he left his wife has never released it and she just says that he was very she didn't know he was that angry at her and that's all she'll say about it the only other thing I know about the note is that he said he was going to eat a peanut butter sandwich and then go to bed but instead what he did was he drove to a beach at a state park in Canada and when he was found his car was found parked there and his body was found laying perfectly in front of it on a mound of sand with his arms outstretched and he was dressed immaculately perfectly and the gentleman who found him said that he saw no sign of blood but there was a ring of dead birds around his body and his head was thrown back his eyes were wide open and his mouth was wide open because he' put a gun in his mouth and committed suicide but he had arranged his own body in a very elaborate way what's with the birds though not sure but he has a history like I said of at one point he put a dead bird on one of his teachers desks when he was younger so I don't know there are theories because of course there's a paranormal component to this the current residence of the home it didn't sell for a long time it I guess it was an almost $3 million home and it sat empty for a very long time because nobody wanted to go there I mean they found 11 bodies on the property and there's still bones there right so a couple Robert and Vicky Graves bought the house in the late 90s I believe and they bought it for about a third of its value again it was estimated at that time to be about 2.8 million dollar and they bought it for about 900,000 so they got a great deal really loved the house things seemed fine until they weren't until they weren't so they rented the apartment to a co-worker a gentleman named Joe LeBlanc he rented the one-bedroom apartment above the garage now the very first night he moved in he says he moved all of his stuff into the apartment and he was exhausted immediately and he says he fell into bed and fell immediately into a deep sleep like this wave of exhaustion had come over him and he didn't think it was too weird at the time he just moved in but he immediately started to have an extremely Vivid dream he says he doesn't normally have dreams that play out this vividly that he can remember he saw himself running through the woods and he felt like he was being chased and he was extremely scared he's running and running and running and he's terrified he said he he woke up feeling still feeling terrified to the point where he stood up and started running because he this sense of fear and dread and that something was after him was so strong that he physically got up and started running before he realized where he was and he ran smack into a wall and almost knocked himself out oh wow because the fear was just so strong shortly before he had moved in Vicki had been cleaning the pool area she said she was out there one night and noticed that her boys had tracked in some stones and dirt and debris around the pool so she got like her shop back out and started vacuuming and she's vacuuming along and and it stopped you know how you get too far and you pull the cord out from the wall yeah it looked it looked like maybe that had happened she didn't think she had been far enough away but whatever so she plugs it back in goes back to vacuuming and it happens again only this time she knew there was slack in the line but the plug was a good foot away from the wall even though she knew she had not pulled on it and there was enough slack in the line that it could not have pulled like that now she's starting to think it's a little weird so she goes back and plugs it in and this time as she walks back to the where the vacuum is she's watching the plug and she sees it fly out of the wall on its own and then fall on the ground that is a ghost trying to tell you you are using electricity too close to water maybe that's right maybe that's what it was it was trying to help her out so that's kind of about the same time that um Joe had moved into the garage apartment shortly after he moved in he says another night he's sitting upstairs in in this apartment when he I thought the garage apartment was where people who lived went that's what they think they're not 100% sure but that is what some people the police believe everyone that was killed on the property was killed by the water and the people that lived that went there went to the apartment so just a theory but doesn't mean that they weren't there and so Joe is in the apartment and he heard knocking at the door and he just assumed it was either Rob or Vicky and he's drying his hands as he's doing the dishes he's like I'll be right there but the knocking gets louder and he's like hold on just a second I'll be right there and the knocking turns into banging and his dog at this point sits up and starts looking at the door and the hackles come up on the back of the dog's neck and he starts growling so now Rob is really freaked out so he you know runs across the apartment to open the door and just as he gets to it the banging stops he opens the door and there's no one there but his dog is going nuts growling and barking and snapping and he had to hold his dog back from going out the door oh [ __ ] another time Vicki was coming home pulled into the driveway her husband's in the yard and they're talking and her husband notices her attention is wandered and she's looking at the edge of the Woods at the back of the property he's like what do you see and she's like there's someone over there in a red shirt and he just disappeared she's like it's very strange but I just saw a young man in a red t-shirt walk across the front of the woods and then disappear but he doesn't have any legs now Vicki says she's a pathologist so she's like very scientific does not believe in ghosts but this sighting really freaked her out so her husband's like maybe it was a real person and they go to look but of course they see nothing but this red shirted young man shows up multiple times a lot of people will see him walking in the woods and they think it might be one of herbs victims looking for his legs maybe maybe but they've had quite a few psychics several different uh shows have been out there you know like the Paranormal investigations have been out there the place is active very very active there are EVPs that happen they still own it they still own it and they do allow people in the beginning they kind of tried to shoe people away but as more and more things started happening they've kind of started inviting they wrote a book about it they've started inviting investigators to come on the property to look into it and it's it's pretty active there's a lot of freaky stuff that happens there and they catch EVPs of these young men talking all the time I mean it's heartbreaking what happened you know it almost sounds like all I can think of is that movie where everybody gets killed by the pool but it it it sounds like this guy really kind of was so warped and crazy that he created a space that will forever be drenched in sorrow and heartache and ghost activity absolutely absolutely and the the sensitives that have been there they have all pinpointed the locations you can't see them now but they can feel the dread they even a couple of them said they felt sick to their St when they walked over the spot where herb had buried the bodies under his compost pile right the feelings of dread and terrible things that happen there are so concentrated in these spots in the backyard sensitives pinpoint them easily every single time even people who don't know the history of the house feel a sense of unease and nausea and extreme fear in some of these places have they removed all of the remains un fortunately they're still to this day finding bits and pieces it's an 18 Acre Site and from what they can tell some of he would leave these bodies out there to decompose and in the summer the spring and summer which was kind of his hunting time bodies can decompose very quickly and he would then um try to reberry them or put them somewhere else so he he left them in multiple places and animals would get to them so unfortunately these remains are all over over the place so the the paranormal ghost things are happening a lot but one thing I do want to comment on that was a very mundane thing was the young man that actually helped catch him was this gentleman named Tony Harris his friend Roger goodlet disappeared and unfortunately Roger was one of Herb's victims Tony was one of the few people that never gave up on Roger and he even he put posters with R's face all over the place all over these bars where Roger's killer actually would peek people out of that's right and he saw herb who was going by Brian Smart at a bar staring at a poster of Roger and Herb gave um Tony such a weird feeling that's why he kind of approached him and allowed him to kind of take him home or well where Brian herb said was his boss's house back to the pool it was Tony that wouldn't let it go and he's the one that told the police about it told the police about Brian Smart told them about the pool and you know his concerns that this was the man that had taken Roger and if it wasn't for that they never would have found her bom Meer so wow wow house is still right now crazy haunted uh Robert and Vicki have psychics come there quite a bit you should look it up some of the EVPs are absolutely freaky unfortunately these young men you can hear them crying out for help or they'll say herb did it help find me things like that it's it's very sad but they do seem to be doing some investigations trying to find who these people are they're trying to do DNA testing and try to lay some of these young men to rest and kind of find their relatives and give them their names back for how recent this was I'm surprised I don't recall this from like mass media I don't either I don't either and you have to wonder why is it you know who the victims were but this guy they connected him to nine deaths on I70 and 11 bodies at his own property and I don't remember hearing about it in the 90s absolutely not never heard a word and they they still haven't identified all of these poor young men and the the people that own the property I mean my heart goes out to them I I would be having investigations all the time too because they're constantly finding piles of bleach bottles in the woods you know they're finding all these different sashes and even to this day still finding remains of these poor victims in the woods and I I really hope that maybe the homeowners doing some of these shows will help bring attention to it maybe more people who have relatives that went missing during that time period might give some of their DNA to kind of you know lay it to rest maybe that'll help lay these spirits to rest well honestly if if I were in the situation if I had a loved one that around that time around that area had gone missing the first damn thing I'd be doing is knocking on these people's doors with my own psychic medium saying hey can we team up to find my loved one because they're probably here Y and a DNA cheek swap yeah you know if I if I had a a a friend or a family member that disappeared around that time and kind of fit the criteria of the victims you bet your ass I'd be at that house yeah yeah I I don't know again as much as you and I are [ __ ] around and find out kind of people I don't not everybody is yeah I don't know if I could live in a house like that though like knowing what kind of torment and torture happened there I don't I don't think I yeah you would and you know why you would because you would take it from the approach of you were gonna try to help these Restless Souls find the peace that they're so desperately looking for a okay you're right I would I would try to do that you're right that's exactly what you would do because you'd hear these ghost saying help me and your ass would then be like all right well I got to help them I'd be so sad I would have to help them there's no way I couldn't so so yeah I think you absolutely could live in a house like this and on property like this because you'd be the one that would be like you you'd be you'd be finding Vengeance for all these folks you'd be you'd be trying to close the door you know you'd be trying to I find all their names finish their story absolutely and I hope they do I know even as recently as this year and recently last year they have been looking to match up some of these remains with their relatives and I hope they do I hope they do well my guess is is if they're having all these investigations and having psychic mediums and people in there right now pieces will start to come together as time goes on it's almost like the more people that are talking the more communication happens exactly so hopefully by us talking about it we can help bring a little bit of awareness to these people and uh give them their names back and gez Indiana is like all of the sudden like the hot spot of activity I know Illinois Indiana all these places whatever so thank you so much for joining us for the stoned
