questions so happy solce happy Ule happy New Year coming up and let's get down to some questions Leila I've got questions I have a lot of questions I may or may not be behind in emails equal to or slightly greater than your tarot collection yeah but you know what this girl caught up on Instagram messages well I'm caught up on Facebook messages just not emails thank you I appreciate the emails keep them coming I will catch up eventually it's very awesome we are only two people folks we are literally only two people we're getting there we're getting there we're getting there we are also getting ready for the solstice I'm very excited to start our candle tradition I've got them out and ready to go I'm just trying to get ready and get settled and there's the circle of Lights there's Ule there's the solstice there's this new candle tradition that you have put on to me that I simply just love there's a lot going on this month magically that's true and tonight Friday if you're listening to this on the day that it comes out Friday the 20th December 20th is mon mother's night in the Ule tradition this is the first night of the 12 nights of Ule and it's called modron's knock or mother's night I'm glad you say those words and not me because I am such a pronunciation murderer I try I I try and look up and see native speakers how they say it but I I still get it wrong so if I mispronounce things please forgive me I do try to get it right so it's Mother's night so that's kind of cool and on this Mother's night we're going to be the aunties to all of you lovely witchlings and answer a whole bunch of questions you know I love that I love that folks think that we're like their little witch ants that just warms my heart I love it I love it yeah I'm pretty sure that we're very close to coming into our full power as the great aunts from Practical Magic and even though you would think that we would fight over who gets to be sigy Weaver because let's face it she's amazing in this particular case I know that I am the Diane West character just call me Aunt jet that's me yeah I own that one if this was if this was Practical Magic I am going to be fighting with you over who's making the Margaritas we don't have to fight we can both make them who gets to do the first curse no wait did I say that a we'll be making margaritas together we'll be hexing together we're going to be those old aunties in our amazing shoes and cool stockings presenting at festivals so we can't oh my God you know what would be totally fitting right now we've got some listeners who go back and listen to the stoned witches our um our previous podcast right now is when we need my cackle remember my cackle lab from Stone wi I do we still have that on our Solarium episodes if you hear the introduction to our Solarium episodes that's the same introduction we use for the stoned Witches Hour I don't know what to tell you it it was a busy time I had two podcasts going and you know so I I recycled the introduction I had already created so yeah it's a good one though so totally worth it yeah but bringing up our first podcast the stoned Witches Hour actually brings me to our first question from a listener this is from Becky from North Carolina and Becky says I just wanted to say I just started listening to your podcast I have binged the whole thing I'm coming close to the current end and I'm almost sad I not walking around with the two of you in my ear all day I just wanted to let you know that I absolutely love you guys and want to be your bestie too you guys are awesome I have a million and four questions that I want to ask so I just want to come hang out with y'all for a few days that's all for now Becky we love that and we get that a lot actually we've been hearing that quite a bit on our podcast Discussion Group online and from some other people uh they have binged both podcasts are starting over and we wish we could do more episodes too we're getting there people I you know I actually responded to someone in the in the discussion group I think it was a couple days back that we actually don't take breaks a lot of podcasts do seasons the hell is a season of Leela and shower like what is that not sure well we're into our like cozy Hig season right now I think but there is no off season yeah we don't take breaks I mean maybe we might take a week or two off and record a couple episodes to put out for those week or twos but like we don't take breaks no that just means we worked double the weeks before yeah we're just kind of you know it it really comes back to it's our way of hanging out with each other yall are just along for the ride and we love having you all along for the ride and it seems like this is a a common thing and we wish we could be available more we've had a couple people ask for some personal instruction from the aunties and I got an email from a witch who's kind of stepping back into her Pagan self and is wondering if we'd take on a student and shell has also gotten a message asking for some mentoring so I'm going to mention mine first and again I'm not going to read the whole message either but so I got a message on the gram one of our lovely friends Courtney I hope I'm saying your name right honestly um said that she's messaging because she's listened to all of the episodes and wanted to message us she's new to Witchcraft and she's looking for a mentor she had asked if if there was any way we could Mentor her but she knows that we're busy folk but she was hoping that maybe we could Point her in the right direction of where to find a mentor because she is just ready to eat this up she says she wants to learn she can and I think that some folks I just want to put this in there that I think that not everybody is great with groups of people not everybody is looking to go out and be with a bunch of total strangers and and create those bonds quite yet they want to ease into it tiptoe into it we get it and you know mentorship is actually a great way to fulfill that yearning to learn but without having to be with a group of people that you may not be comfortable with yet and that's something that was expressed by another listener Natalie who emailed us and Natalie I loved your whole email and I totally get trying different rots I also did the same thing until I found what worked for me and Natalie said have you ever considered adopting a baby witch that you two feed direction to and then say monthly or short segments weekly have that baby witch on to discuss their progress concerns and questions she's suggesting that we take on on a mentee and teach them and then at the end maybe have them on to discuss what they learned you know and that sounds kind of interesting hey Lea this gives me an idea what's your idea shell what if we may be agreed to that so what if we said to Natalie and Courtney maybe yes we will take you on as mentees for a month and see how it goes I think we should well sh I think you may possibly have made two people's day but I think that's something we could very much consider and I think maybe we could make this something that we do going forward uh we could choose one or two people to answer all their deepest burning questions and have oneon-one with we could be their aunties for the month we could we could be their witch aunties for the month I love it I love it we're going to get in touch with Courtney and Natalie and let them know the details once shell and I iron them out and uh we will let you all know how that goes we're hoping at some point to have this as something that we offer regularly maybe to our benefactors if you would like to have more things like that available to you the best way to do that is by becoming one of our benefactors and donating every month we do have a link in the description of every show it just says support the show if you click on it goes right to our donation page we also have a support the show link on our website back onth broomstick dcom and occasionally we do post them on social media so you can find them there as well I got something more fun than all of that next question next question all right what you got Emily you know I like Emily she sends us messages a lot and her and I sometimes go back and forth hi Emily hi Emily Emily I'm gonna kind of put this in a little bit more broad of a question hers was a little more specific to a specific deity But ultimately the vein of her question is how do you start working with a deity I know we've kind of touched on this a little bit in some episodes but she was actually referencing hkat specifically so you know let's say hypothetically you're new to all of this and you're like hey you know I have found Witchcraft and now I want to to find a God or a goddess or both or many to do my thing with now what so maybe you have felt that calling maybe it seems like Emily has has felt the calling of picate good luck my friend but maybe you've got that calling or maybe you're drawn to the the mythology behind it or whatever reason maybe you're were walking downtown saw a store with a statue in it and it was stunning and now all of a sudden you know I don't know however you came across it how do you go from that to deity I don't maybe deity worship isn't the right phrase but to commune with that deity to connect with that deity to start working with that deity ultimately her question is in a nutshell how do you get get from I've decided to work with this deity to being able to work with that deity I'm glad you said decided because one of the common questions that we get a lot is how do you know a deity is calling out to you how do you know you're supposed to work with a deity and a lot of people are under the assumption that you have to be called or de needs to appear before you in darksome light or whatever before you're allowed to before you're allowed to worship with them or or to work with them and that's not true does that happen sure but it more happens in the form of hey I have this sudden interest in the Morgan suddenly I'm seeing Keys everywhere maybe I should look into hkat maybe you start seeing foxes all over the place or cats or maybe you'll just feel drawn to a certain area of the world you want to start studying Ireland more maybe you just realized that Stevie nicks's song about Ranon wasn't just some hippie weird thing right it's an actual goddess exactly so yeah so whatever that calling looks like for you the first step is learning about that deity and that's really worship and in for some deities some goddesses in particular knowledge is how you worship them that's what they're all about but that is the first step with any deity is to look into them read what you can about them find the books with authors that know what they're talking about kind of inform yourself educate yourself on all the ins and outs I know that that there's a lot more books more more recently out about hiate specifically but if you are having trouble finding books about the deity you're pulled to this is a weird thing that we're not used to but go to the library there are some some treasure troves there that you know maybe they're a little bit older but it is the information you're looking for and you'll never know when the appendices of of that book lead you to something else how a rabbit hole of books exactly find someone on YouTube or a podcast that you trust listen to what they have to say on that DD but then your next step is going to be for me you know exactly what I'm gonna say meditate in journal boom there I guessed it there's my psychic ability of the day wow I don't know how you guessed that I bet no one else out there listening guessed either of those I bet nobody did they're all in shock and awe right now shock and awe surprise surprise I'm gonna ask you to meditate about it and I'm gonna ask you to journal about it write about it write the things that jump out at you maybe a specific animal or a color but write it all down because this literally that is what they mean when they say de is reaching out to you it's not always going to look like a burning bush or somebody literally putting words in your head I'm gonna eat my words right now but damn it you're right you're right and I hate to say it but I don't call it meditating I call it quiet communing with the god I love the excuses you come up with for yourself that's fantastic they work for me they work for me and that's what you got to do whatever works for you I love that and build a regular practice is my last piece of advice is build something regular particularly when you first start starting out to work with a deity is find you know two three five things to do every single day that show your devotion I like the alter idea you know even if it's just a colored candle that colors is associated with that god or goddess whatever you know maybe you're in the broom closet and it has to be a symbol written on a card that's under a glass I don't know do do what you got to do but have some sort of I like the altar idea because it gives you a visual yeah and tending that alar can be one of the things you do for the day and your what did you call it your quiet contemplative communion with the deity you can have you know so if you do your journaling your quiet communion and tending that altar there's three things every day if you just do those three things at the same time every day you have now built a practice towards this deity and if you have a busy lifestyle or have motivational issues I ain't judging I swear you can do one of those things every other day and have those be your three things a week or or whatever works for you maybe you pick every Friday or maybe you have Wednesday afternoons available but try to pick something regular now you said something that you know we usually try to go back and forth and I I I do a question you do a question and we have a way of doing this but you kind of sparked on something that leads into a question I've got let's do it sh takes a left turn n so weird okay how do I tell what are witchy signs and what are what is things just happening everything can't all be signs and that was by Amy Lee I agree every damn thing in the world is not a sign okay they are not all signs but but am's question is how do you differentiate what is a sign and what is just happening that's part of the practice of being a witch and that's part of learning to trust your intuition and that's another journaling thing if you find something say a butterfly crosses your path and you have never seen a butterfly that yellow in your entire life and you're like this must be a sign I don't know what it's a sign of but it must be a sign I mean like how I've told you how I'm being stocked currently for the last couple months by this owl that different that is a sign but like you know if if if you drive down the road and go to work and you're running late and your boss is pissed at you and it get you get a flat tire on the way that flat tire is a sign not necessarily and that's why I'm saying if you think it's a sign you should Journal it what do you feel about it what did it make you feel what was happening when you saw it what made you think that it was a sign you know is it because you've never seen a butterfly that yellow is it part of a pattern yeah exactly is it part of some type of pattern all these things are things that you should write down so that you can tell if it is a sign or not because your senses are probably if you have to ask your senses are not yet at a level where you know uh shell mentioned the owl that she was stalked by not too long ago you have a there's a feeling there's a sense there's a skin prickling the hair is on the back of your neck a weird feeling in your belly everybody has a feeling when you're in the presence of power or when you're in the presence of divination or something of that nature you feel it when you first when you saw that owl for the first time I don't remember if you called me or texted me right away but you felt it you knew immediately that that meant something I sent you the picture of it you did and then there started to be a pattern afterwards so that was confirmation and so that's what you're looking for and that's why you really need to write it down write down the date CU you will not remember I promise you no matter what you tell yourself write down the date write down how you felt why you thought it was a sign and everything about it that you can remember that way you can go back and look and see if it actually was or wasn't start the pattern find the pattern and find out how it feels to you when you are in the presence of magic or when you're in the presence of something that's more than just synchronicity okay now it's your turn for a question I guess this one is from an anonymous listener in Grand Junction Colorado and they say hello new witch and new listener here I've been binging and even got my husband hooked on you as well he listened to four of your episodes yesterday during a long work drive and loves you guys so hi hubby I love when the husbands get sucked in and they say I've been really feeling pulled toward candle and Herb magic and my child has been really struggling with grief and I was wondering one is it safe or ethical to do a spell on behalf of a child and two what is the best way to do that wait wait wait hold on a second back up was it did they say they were the parent yes oh okay keep going and two uh logistically how do you do a spell or charm on behalf of someone else to ease their pain Etc if they don't really know you are doing it all right sh is not a good person to ask this question to because I'm gonna start off with I would go to prison with a smile for my children so you do you and my children are now adults and I would still do magic on their behalf because they're my kids and if they don't like it tough because I am their mother okay I say you do you Mama Bear 110 I think she's more looking towards uh grief or or sadness magic for the child Magic on the child is that okay if they're too to consent again agree you you know do you consent that your kid goes and watches the pg17 movie you you know what I mean like like that's kind of your I don't want to say your position as a parent but you are in a position until they are of legal age to make decisions that you feel are in their best interest until that time and if they are not at that point yet whether it's magic or something mundane you still are in that position as their parent to decide what is or is not appropriate and right for that child and if that is doing any sort of of of spell to their benefit yeah depending on your magical system and your personal belief system doing magic on or for another person can be can be tricky some believe that it's no big deal if someone is drowning of course you go save them you don't ask their permission first and so if someone needs help of course you would help them and a couple ways that I find to do that especially with children is one to involve them in it and by involving them in it their higher mind will give consent or not if they're part of a spell that's you playing with them they will either consent or not I can see though a point of view where maybe the child's mindset might not be in a place to be able to do that because the grief is so heavy on them yeah that's why sometimes if you don't involve the child you can just appeal to their higher mind when you do the spell on their behalf you can put that energy out there to that person whether it's your child or or another person and then that energy is there for their High yourself who won't be clouded by emotions to either you I'm so bad I would just do it I would just do it I'm so bad I would just do it that's just my personality I would just do it and again I also have the thought patterns of if someone is in pain or in danger I just help them I don't ask permission first especially when it's your kid especially when it is my child I do believe in people's personal autonomy so I have lines I will not cross but I don't remember where I read it it was in a book I'm so sorry hopefully future Lila will remember and I'll pop in here with it I think this was in South American folk magic but they said that if someone is drowning you don't ask them permission before you save them you just save them so in their culture they don't ask your permission first if they think that they need to do magic to help you they just do it and your soul your being your magical self will either accept it or you won't but they don't have any Hang-Ups about doing magic for or on someone else so I guess it really just depends on your personal belief system right right their culture views things like that differently and it resonated with me because I feel the same way you just do it you just help them exactly so in this particular case uh you're doing it for their good if you're worried about it just make sure you include in your spell or your ritual that you are sending out this energy for their higher self to use for their best interest and then send it out there and basically it's like you putting food on their porch if they want it they'll take it if they don't they won't see I'm just I'm the opposite kind of mom man I just impose my on them okay so I'm going to make like uh oatmeal raisin cookies which are the best in the world by the way and offer them to my starving child you're going to hold them down and force Fe to shring of food down their throat hell yeah do that's what mom's do that's right and hey if that's what you got to do that's what you got to do I'm with you so there's that question you got another one sh okay this one kind of gave me like Goosey bumps oh okay probably not going to make our listener feel any better just saying oh no okay so Alyssa this one's for you so Alyssa is having an issue so she had this mirror and the mirror broke oh no and she didn't get into the det out she didn't get into the details of the how or the why but just did it happen and there was a corner of the mirror which by the way I'm going to have to send this to you because she sent us a picture of it too the corner of like a little broken piece she has thrown out this broken piece over five times and she keeps finding it oh no and it has her initials on it too and she she wants to know if it's lucky or cursed and like I don't feel like this is lucky I'm just going to start there I'm sorry Ela I'm sorry historically items that you intentionally throw away that keep coming back to you particularly if it's started out as unlucky like a broken mirror I'm gonna say that maybe the next time you throw it out you should possibly wrap it up with some black salt grab onto your broomstick witches back after these messages hey there welcome to the living Limitless podcast where we explore all sides of the fence and dive deep into the conversations that peque your curiosity from Breaking Free of the 9 to-5 grind to exploring Big Ideas like the Mandela effect shifting your perspective and building healthy habits we're here to inspire you to think differently this is a space for open-minded conversations about mindset business wellness and what it truly means to Live Without Limits whether you're chasing a dream questioning the status quo or just looking to grow the this podcast is for you join us on the journey to living Limitless actually what I was thinking um I had a good idea the first time I the first time I read this I was like oh boy I need duct tape I would actually take duct tape and I would duct tape over uh the reflective part of it um and then after I duct taped over it and made it no longer a reflective surface then I would do like you were starting to say the black salt I do that first sprinkle your black salt right there maybe some Rosemary to break any hexes and then like shelle said just wrap the hell out of it with some good old duct tape fixes everything and just as you're wrapping it say I bind you some sealing and protecting of me in my space yeah and then once you throw it away in the garbage with intent and purpose like throw it throw it like throw it like how I say to throw your cinnamon sticks out the door throw it like a baseball yeah right into the garden Gage with intent and force even tell it goodbye or you know literally shut the door on it if it comes back after that move yeah then take it out of the house so take it out of your garbage put it in your outside garbage and then cleanse your whole house and seal it Al better safe than sorry right good luck good luck my friend good luck yeah but if you're getting the same broken mirror piece coming back that's that's bad luck I don't think that's good I don't think in any movie or book I've ever read yeah know never a good thing know all right so let's keep with our horror theme and I've got a good question for you sh you're going to love this one throw it at me this question comes from Kelly Kelly says someone told me I should not use a pendulum board because it was the same as using a Ouija board what are your thoughts on that use it my f yeah my first thoughts is yes yes they are the same yeah that is not a bad thing they're both a way to talk with spirit with your higher self they're a way to connect to the spirits around you to the energies around you and have them be able to spell out with letters either using the planet or using your pendulum a message that's all it is it's a way to speak to Spirit boards have been given a bad rap you know Spirit boards talking boards Ouija boards they have been given a bad rap unless we forget the elite of the elitist were using them as parlor games you know barely 100 years ago so they they've gotten a bad rap lately and use them I love them they're fun use all the same precautions that you would with any other thing but I have a hard time me personally connecting with a pendulum and we've discussed this in the past so I'm saying do it but it's just not pendulums aren't for me but it's just more the mechanics of it than what it's actually doing I actually very much like the pendulum it's one of those energies that has absolutely amazed me from the first time I was introduced to crossed wire pendulums by someone who used them to find buried wires and buried water pipes underground that's amazing to me this is that's magic that is scientifically accepted and I absolutely love it but the feeling that you get when you use a pendulum is amazing I've never tried using one with a Ouija board or with a pendulum board but it's got me really wanting to dig out my old pendulum and see if it'll work really well but just like shell said use it with intention make sure you you know you ground you Center you cleanse your tools but just use it like you would any other divination tool and it's another thing for you to have in your arigi board a Tarot deck you know the charms in my mind they're all kind of the same thing it's just kind of pick your tool yep so whoever someone is if they're trying to scare you that's silly yes they're the same but neither one of them are bad it's just another way to do divination and if one of them calls to you by all means go for it absolutely so what do you got next sh okay this one I have this is from an anonymous person we have gotten a listener that just started listening to the podcast but they weren't following us on on the o IG because they are in the broom closet hence the reason it's Anonymous they said that we keep talking about Gathering energy and storing it behind your belly button um this person can't seem to do that they can only seem to feel it and store it in their chest and can only feel it in their hands they want to know if this is an issue and what does it mean and they just love us and said thank you a we love you too honestly I want to start off with I think we all we all kind of have that little store in different places kind of thing you know we've talked before about how I have back issues so sometimes energy-wise I would stay away from putting energy near that area of my body because well that area of my body is just toxic energy wise so I think we all just kind of have different ways and places but I don't think it necessarily means anything bad or that it's an issue I just think that just because in a meditation if they say something like you know you're going to gather this energy in your belly button area if you gather in your butt cheek who cares you know you're you're still you're still on that same wave just because you're not necessarily have the same experience as someone else doesn't make it wrong or or that it is an issue or that you're not getting the same effect out of it yeah I was thinking when we were talking about like you know the the chakra thing where you're building up the energy down your down your chakra points and that's what made me think of you know people just because of energy blocks or or physical health issues you know sometimes you just have to avoid where Energies traveling through your body you know Anonymous in the broom closet the good thing that you said was that you feel energy and that means you're way ahead of a lot of people right and shell said chakras and I know that we have a western idea of this Eastern concept this this High magic concept of chakras and but there are energy meridians in our body and lots of different cultures and belief systems acknowledge this the chakra system starts at your B face at your lower spine and it moves up your body to the crown of your head each one of those centers is an energy center and there's seven of them going up your body in any of those you can feel that energy pool and that just might mean something if you're feeling it in your chest maybe you're feeling some maybe there's an you know your heart chakra or your solar plexus chakra maybe that's the strongest one that you have maybe that's where your energy center is we had a coven member who used to say that his hands turned on and I can feel my hands doing it right now just talking about it it's a it's shell you're the raiki master it's a raiki thing right when you use and it's something that a lot of people will do instinctually when you start to move magic it's almost like you get that um Iron Man you know the the circles of power on the centers of your hands yeah that's a common place for people to feel it it like I said it's in raiki but wherever you feel it in your body it's not wrong it's just very common to feel in the center and if you can pull it there it's a it's a good easy place to pull it so it seems to be common for people but it's it's not bad if you have a different place where you like to if you gather it pull it elsewhere yeah exactly yep I'm just stoked you can feel the energy you are way ahead of the game there way to go keep practicing all right I got another question for you what you got so this is from Jeff hi Jeff hey Jeff and Jeff says good afternoon ladies love me a gentleman and he says I am very interested in head dding I have been working on this for a year now and believe I was able to get there once it was very intense and uncontrollable and I had a lot of anxiety trying to get back and I haven't been able to get back there again and was wondering if you have had any experience so w all right let's explain what hedge riding is for people in case you don't know hedge riding is it's a folk practice typically hedge Hedges are when you think of a hedge it's like a fence right it's like a row of bushes I always thought of it as like astral travel astral travel is is similar to this but a hedge is basically a line between two places it's a Lial place and hedge Riders are energy workers witches Shaman people who travel from this world across the Hedge across that line into a metaphysical Place into I seriously I seriously always visualized it as an actual hedge like with a witch flying on a broom along the and if that helps you you can there's a lot of different metaphors for it some people see a wall some people see a ravine some people will see different things but you know if you see a literal hedge that works same thing it's a fence it's a it's a linal space that you cross to get from the mundane world into the spirit realm into the realm where our ancestors and deity and the universe is it's almost like if you walked through the door or if you cross the street you know you're going from this side to the other side ex exactly exactly I feel like riding the Hedge is like if you're trying to ride in between that space yes hedge Riders are people who keep literally one foot in this world and one foot in the other so that they can Ferry people across help spirits to pass or to to bring messages across sometimes people will head ride in order to do that this is not a technique none of what we're about to talk about here is for beginners at all if you don't know what a hedge is please do not attempt hedge riding so it's this linal space and it's it's different than meditation because when you're in a meditation you know where you're going you've written it out you you're basically just traveling within your own subconscious this is like really kind of traveling I don't want to say to another plane to another dimension but you are mentally going to a different place you are leaving your body behind and you are spiritually mentally your soul then travels the Hedge to the other side now one one way that I think there's more common that people might equate this to is sometimes if people have like a near-death experience and they say that they feel like they left their body and that they kind of saw their physical body below them but they were like outside of their their body watching these things happen that's kind of that space right right and entheogens people who talk about entheogen plants and drugs these are the ones that help connect you to the spirit realm they have a specific way of helping your your spirit self separate from your body again not a beginner or even intermediate practice this is this definitely like like you need to be a well season you need to to have a background to do this yeah and now there are some people who are drawn to hedge writing or pulled across the Hedge against their will they also need to practice really hard so that they can control it but you can't always control what happens once you leave but the control comes in being able to cross the Hedge when you wish to both ways forward and back that's where the control comes and so that's what you have to learn through meditation through dream workor through pathor I would even I would even suggest not doing such things um alone particularly in the beginning sure you want to say use the buddy system but use the Budd system you know when you're hedge riding make sure that your buddy is in within Arms Reach at all times I mean I'm never really one to be like you know hey maybe you should not do that until you're a little more experienced but this is one of those things where I am like you know hey um a buddy to start out with wouldn't be a bad idea until you are fully in control and can go back and forth without issue yeah and and practicing going into very deep meditative States very very deep Alpha States going into those States retrieving messages and then bringing yourself back out of them at will is just beginning yeah practice doing that first once you get good at that level of meditation then you can start on the next steps it's not a necessary thing if it's something that you would like to do um it's very good for you it's something that brings you to a lot of challenges it brings a lot of learning uh there's a lot of letting go there's a lot of learning about yourself that happens there it's definitely something that will Aid any witch in advancing their magical path but can't just buy a ticket and go right right this isn't like going to Six Flags and hopping on the Superman ride right exactly exactly might feel that way at the end but you might want it pass out but you know know right and even as much as shamanistic and ritualistic and magical as hedge writing is there's still a pattern to it you know you want to set up your safe place you want to have your buddy right there right right you're going to want to do an anchor uh whether your buddy's your anchor or whether you set up an object a smell a certain song to come on or an alarm some type of Trigger or anchor to bring you back is always a good idea it's almost like working with fairies yeah it's a lot like because you never know who or what you're going to encounter on the other side you cannot control that you can ask for certain beings energies entities to be there there's no guarantee yeah and who knows what else or who else will be there so you want to set a time limit you want to have a something specific like an alarm that goes off a candle that burns down after a certain amount of time you're going to want your anchor make sure when you come back whether it's in a deep Alpha meditation or hedge riding that you ground yourself eat some food drink your water hydrate people all the things do all the things and if you don't know how to ground don't go hedge riding right baby steps folks baby step baby steps so yeah these are things that that you can do and if you slip into hedge riding just try to think of Home think of your body try to remember where you are think of your room reconstruct what your favorite place looks like in your mind do these things to pull yourself back as much as you can and then do your grounding reconnect touch all the things smell the wonderful smells eat some yummy food get back into your body and reconnect with your body if you do happen to slip against your will so I hope that answered your question Jeff because hedge riding is a big thing we will absolutely touch on it in full in a later episode good luck Jeff good luck so I have one more question and this is actually a pretty darn good question so this question comes from Sarah Sarah totally got into making spell jars which I'm totally down with I love a good spell jar but her question is when do you undo it or don't you and can you cleanse and reuse components of it like say Stones oh okay it was a little longer than that I'm kind of condensing her message um but one of the example she used if what if she used some of her favorite stones or favorite tools is part of a spell jar is there a point where she can deconstruct that cleanse those things and then repurpose them for other magical uses down the road I have a weird confusing answer to that which is yes or no yes that's mine too I have a question yes why did you put the spell in the jar in the first place good point if you know why you put the spell in the jar to begin with that's going to tell you whether it's okay to take it apart and reuse the components or not maybe it's a timed spell um you know maybe it's a you do a spell jar to gain employment and then you gain employment and you're done your Spell's over it's worked its magic so your your answer is you shouldn't undo it there you answered your own question that's not my answer that's not what I said it all what I'm saying is that if you know why you put the spell in the jar in the first place other than you just like jar spells that will tell you whether you can take it apart or not some you can some you can't I do have a question no because I think spell jars are more popular than they need to be the only spells that need to go in a jar are spells that need to be carried someplace spells that need to be locked up forever or as long as possible or spells that need to be prominently displayed but not Disturbed those are the only reasons and not Disturbed means you shouldn't undo it right what I mean by not Disturbed here is just that while the spell is active you don't want the components to become separated that's all but once it's done go ahead and take it apart say you made a spell to gain employment and you put that on a prominent place right by your computer so that every time you went online to fill out resumés you saw that jar it was right there that is the perfect use for a spell jar it's undisturbed the spell is Right There by seeing it you re-trigger the spell you get employment you're like okay I don't need this jar anymore I say take it apart and reuse the parts most of them anyway okay what do you say I I agree I agree and how I equated it was not necessarily for a spell jar I'm trying to think in my head because a lot of my spell jars I I seal whack seal I don't I don't open mine back up but I was thinking of like a money bowl for example so you make a money Bowl it's done it's due you're you're you're done can you take the components out of that money Bowl cleanse them and reuse them well yeah I'm not rich here people yeah I agree I'm going to say yes and no most of them yes I think it does depend on what the intent of the original thing was whether a you should undo it and B if you think you should are you going to cleanse it and are you going to kind of get it into that point spiritually where it can be repurposed are they cleansable right that again another thing are they cleansable the herbs I would probably burn as an offering or put outside as an offering or just be done with if it's Stones really nice Stones it depends on the spell that I did maybe I want those ston to stay charged with that spell even after I take them out of the jar right were those stones used in a working that was so powerful that I don't think they're ever going to be able to let go of that energy you that would be another reason to not reuse them yeah I I feel like it's going to be almost like a case by casee specific thing yeah and I say if I say for the most part yes in my money Bowl right now that I'm looking at that I have lit I have money I do too yeah I'll be using that money thr it away ain't happening it is a symbolic offering of energy right now in the bowl so that can absolutely be reused again I have some green stones in here I'm probably going to reuse them when I redo my money bowl at the beginning of the year so I like to reuse things as like for like spells these are money Bowl Stones GNA go in another money Bowl spell easy peasy I like that like for like yeah if I was doing a love spell and I put like say maybe I put a Carnelian in there you're not going to turn around and new that Carnelian for something ass opposite no unless you do some cleansing and sometimes even if you do that stone might really want to just do the love spells and might not want to do the hex spells anymore you know what I'm saying I do and I hope Sarah gets what we're saying so so yeah but my bigger question is why did you put the spell in a jar did it need to be in a jar in the first place right I think we put too many spells in jars so I think that's let the Spells roam free people I I I think that wraps up our question and answers for today and you know first off I want to say Obviously we've got a ton of more questions sent to us we will do another Q&A maybe after the holiday we'll see how it goes
