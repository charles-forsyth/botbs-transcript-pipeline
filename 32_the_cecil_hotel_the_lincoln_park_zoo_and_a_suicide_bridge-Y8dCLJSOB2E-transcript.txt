the munchies but I'm shell with the munchies on the East Coast eating pasta salad oh pasta salad is delicious what is your particular flavor of pasta salad I've discovered in my travels that seems like every state or every region has their own version of what is supposed to go in a pasta salad what shell is yours first of all the noodles have to be seashell noodles the spiral veggie pasta seems to also be popular yeah the ones that are different colors yeah but you like a you like a sea shell noodle I do okay it's a weird thing hey it holds good sauce it does and cut up little tiny tomatoes it doesn't matter if they're cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes orever Tomatoes okay cut up black cheese is a must you can't without cheese got to have the cheese a lot the more more cheese the better if you're wondering if you have too much cheese the answer is keep putting more in yeah more cheese pepperoni love pepperoni and then this is something that not everybody's fancy to but I like black olives so good and then what we did this time which actually was like awesome we put in red peppers and then chopped up fresh um sweet basil oh that you just kicked it up a notch with a sweet basil that's delicious shell turns into like a Top Chef contestant you know she's been smoking something good cuz she has Wicked Munchies so so what type of wheat do you have what are you smoking shell what has given you such amazing Munchies for the day I have this stuff called it's brand new I've never even heard of it before and sometimes you know I just buy [ __ ] based on the funny name I'm with you on that this is called bubblegum yum oh okay that is a fun name and it does have a little bit of a sweet taste like I can't even put my finger on it but it's a little sweet I just can't tell you like what kind of sweet but it gives you the munchies like nobody's freaking business like you're high you're high as [ __ ] but you are ready to eat is it pink at all I have seen some pink cultivars lately no it's just green looks like the same old same pretty greenish little bit of Whitey Crystal color smooth smoke tastes delicious there you go hey sounds pretty good what's the THC on that one oh this is 31 per set come on don't oh wow nice nice now I've been uh let's see what did you call it was bubblegum yum yeah bub and it's making those pasta salad yum bubble gum yum see okay now see here's what I don't understand I'm trying to find THC percentages because you know I'm interested and what I'm smoking tonight is just some homegrown you know I'm smoking Gorilla Glue GG number four that's good stuff it is and I guess you can't call it Gorilla Glue anymore why I still don't get oh well you know it's a it's a name it's a brand name and they don't they don't want their brand associated with weed so so what I do usually is go on Leafly because I don't test my own [ __ ] so I go on Leafly and try to check take a look and see what it says and it says here on Leafly that the Gorilla Glue is 20% now they get their input from lots of different places and I tend to kind of trust them I think they're they're on the up and up they try but if I look at Gorilla Glue number four from the breeder or from a dispensary that's selling that particular cultivar they say 25 to 30% THC who's right and this bubblegum yum what's the percentage that the dispensary said 31 okay on Leafly and on Cana connection they say 15 to 17% well how that's like half exactly that's what I'm saying who's literally half how are we supposed to trust anybody when the THC content is so isn't even who's testing it like I I guess I need to start asking for testing certificates like where was this tested who tested it and can I see the certificate because I don't believe anybody anymore and then you get these people who are like well it's different batch to batch and grow to grow well if that's the case then why you saying it's one or the other then test it batch to batch test it grow to grow you know tell me what this batch tested at because you and I both know that the gorilla glue that I'm growing right now if it's from a seed from the same breeder going to be the same thing but you could pick up some Gorilla Glue clones from some dispensary down the street and you and I might be growing extremely totally different yeah different plants and and it will come up with different tastes different tpping profiles it's the wild west out here we don't know what the genetics are I feel like we're being lied to absolutely especially when some people shell always reach for that high THC I wonder if we're completely being lied to and they're just adding an extra 10% on there to make people so they can charge higher prices yeah because what's the top shelf there 60 and e 60 and E yep yeah I see top shelf around here go 60 and E and then we hear wildly varying prices like some places in New York and in upstate California it's 30 for an eighth for top shelf you know it really depends on where you're at we go yep that's sad it is sad so don't buy it don't believe the THC content ask your bud tender and if they're good they'll tell you who tested it when and was it this batch or was it like some bch right exactly exactly and maybe I should I really need to look into getting um a test kit of my own and I'll actually test my own weed so I'll know for sure yeah so I don't know I'm smoking some Gorilla Glue and depending on who you believe it's either a 20% THC or up to like a 35% THC I don't know it's pretty Stony though I'll give you that that's good but I'm just so confused about I mean half that's like so varying yeah and and keep in mind that these online places they take their input from multiple sources and they kind of aggregate it you know people submit their information and and like we said varying batches will have varying THC concentrations you just don't know how accurate it really is right exactly unless you know that batch has been tested and they have a certificate for it and some places will so don't don't always reach for the top shelf just because it says 33% THC make them prove it and you know get something yummy anyway ah you get me every time on that just because it says it don't believe it you felt the effects though yeah you trust because you smoke that and you as a as a an experienced smoker feel it you know what a 30% THC feels compared to a 20 but the the the thing is unfortunately is you don't have the opportunity to check it until after you've paid your $60 right which is another good reason to make sure you know your place know your bud tenders know your know your plug trust your plug [Music] we actually just got back from Spirit Halloween really why'd you get it Spirit Halloween this was just a fact finding mission trip smart smart I like that you go in you see what's there you sus out the prices right do a little comparison shopping little thinking you can't go in there hungry for a costume you know you'll be buying everything ooh I love this headdress oh that broom looks amazing look at this cloak it's stranger things oh my God and before you know you spent $300 and you still don't really have a full costume no you have no full costume what cool [ __ ] but no full costume full costume yeah so it's a good I like that I like that you went in on a fact finding Mission wow I told you we're going to Boris Bo bash right that's so cool I don't know if you did or not but oh my God you're going to Boris Bo bash we are [ __ ] so I hate you both we're trying to figure out we're like you know oh because of course there's a costume contest of course of course and we're like What would be unique that no one else would do that's a tough one that's tough everybody's witches everybody's murderers every TV show currently on everybody's doing that of course of course everybody's a vampire yes always a popular pirate pirate oh oh Pirates are fun so you know what we've decided what did do decide we are going to go as Mr and Mrs Santa Clause what what that's not scary shell hold on hold on why is it's not supposed to be scary it's supposed to be different and something no one El it's it's not a costume that's going to be duplicated that's true true true wants to do an SNM Santa and Mrs Claus that's more fun I like an SNM Mr and Mrs Claus that's hot talk about some handcuffs and gag in gags you could do a zombie Mr and Mrs Claus I mean how else have they survived for so long because they've gone through Jack Skellington's tree of holidays in Nightmare Before Christmas oh okay yeah yeah there's that idea and I'm sure there will be a lot of Jacks and Sally's we've done that always a good couple choice and when we were in a bar we were like one of four right right exactly exactly and you just don't want that what about like a a murderous Santa and Mrs Claus what's Mrs Claus's first name anyway do we know I don't even know she doesn't even have a first name I don't think so what kind of patriarchal [ __ ] is that Mrs Claus doesn't have a that's that can't be right that can't be right Mrs Claus has got to have a first name Google that [ __ ] what is Mrs Claus's first name Mary this makes no sense why does that oh yeah okay other names are Mary Gertrude and Carol gerud sometimes Holly is he married to multiple people if you go by the the Christmas special the SE 1970s Christmas special Santa Claus is Coming to Town her name is Jessica she was that pretty redheaded girl in town so so what I'm still I'm more confused than I was before I was thinking Mary because I'm Merry Christmas or Mary the mother of that whatever his name is Jesus oh that's cute I like Mary like Merry Christmas I like that I think I like Holly I think I think I've decided Holly Claus Holly Claus oh wow oh look at this oh in the Mrs Claus Heroes wiki fandom Mrs Claus or mother Christmas let's see generally acts as a primary caretaker blah blah blah Mrs Claus's first name is largely a mystery although listen to this Jessica Mary L and Martha are the most referenced names how is Lila christmy I have no idea I don't know why Mrs Claus would be in a hero's Wiki so you know take that for what it's worth but uh yeah Lila Leila Claus Lila Claus I don't know that that do you remember the Santa Claus is coming to town that Christmas special the stop motion Jessica I'll go with Jessica they're they probably got it right yeah probably cute she was adorable Chris cringle and Jessica yeah H's a good one though Holly is a good one so is Mary I like m e r r y Merry Christmas that's cute Mary Claus that's adorable I don't know maybe our listeners have an idea it's not even close to Christmas yes why the [ __ ] are we talking about Christmas oh because you're going as as Mr and Mrs Claus it's your fault we got on this tangent it is it is and the weed I'm smoking well there's that so what are you talking about today sh I am actually going to talk about the Lincoln Park Zoo a zoo a zoo wait a minute a haunted zoo are you kidding me it's actually let me let me step back a second I'm actually talk about two things in Lincoln Park there is a park in Chicago called Lincoln Park don't be confused with the band Lincoln Park okay and in Lincoln Park there is the Lincoln Park Zoo haunted and then there's also what was called Suicide Bridge oh and it's in the same area yeah it's all within the same Park Lincoln Park oh another haunted bridge I bet that's haunted as [ __ ] yeah because you know if you're gonna call it suicide bridge I'm sure you can imagine it's got a history the backstory here yeah interestingly I am also talking about a multi-part story that's also a place I'm going to be talking about something called the most haunted hotel in Los Angeles oo that according to Esquire magazine was popularly called America's Hotel death oh the Cecil Hotel yikes yeah so yeah pretty it's a very very haunted place and it has been home to hundreds of deaths two serial killers damn multiple suicides unexplained deaths homicides and became famous in 2013 when a young woman named Alisa lamb uh checked in and unfortunately met her end there didn't check out that's right Yik yeah sounds like we have some pretty interesting places to talk about this evening we do and you know I wanted to kind of Veer away from Cryptids and I also wanted to kind of Veer away from my Coastal Roots so I I I ended up with the coolest story out of Chicago I love it you're branching out but you you left behind your Cryptids I know how much mean to you we will be circling back at cryp don't you worry we will cing back you always get me with those they're like the creepiest funniest coolest stories I love them so we'll be circling back to crypted don't yes we will that's true but yeah haunted locations today I'm pretty stoked uh you've been going first a lot maybe I'll go first this time why don't you lay it on me oh okay I'm so excited this hotel H is so creepy I don't know if you remember but one of the many coincidences creepy things around this haunted hotel is we actually talked about it in a previous episode briefly it was uh episode two uh where we talked I talked about the Black Dalia that was a long time ago it was a long time ago Elizabeth Short also known as the Black Dalia one of the places she was supposedly last seen was in the bar of the Cecil Hotel Hotel so this hotel is super creepy and very very haunted it became kind of famous in 2013 because in January of that year 21-year-old Canadian student Alisa lamb checked in and part of the Cecil hotel at that time had hostile accommodations like like hostile style where people could come in and stay in like dormatory style rooms very inexpensively and so she was traveling around the US and she stayed there and had other roommates but the hotel started getting complaints from her roommates that Alisa was acting odd and that they they were getting kind of threatening letters from her so they moved her out of that uh group room and into a room by herself and on that same day January 31st when she got moved into her own room she was declared missing yeah she wasn't found until 3 weeks later on February 19th guests started to complained that there there was low water pressure and the water was coming out all brown and fowl smelling some of them said it tasted bad oh tasted bad tasted bad you they're brushing their teeth with it and showering in it and and drinking it everyone was reporting that it was it was bad one couple even got moved to another room because the the water was so foul and they said the the water problems continued in the other room and they complained again that's when the hotel said a maintenance worker up to the roof to check the water tanks he opened up one of the water tanks and in it he found Alisa Lamb's body oh god oh she was floating naked in the tank her clothes were floating beside her and her phone was nowhere near her was her phone was actually never found how do you get in those tanks that's part of the mystery there's an alarm to get on the SE on the roof and apparently there's also alarm that trips if the um the sistern lid is open if the if the hatch is opened none of those went off the hatch was closed the maintenance worker had to open it and the water level was too low for her to have reached back up and closed the hatch behind her so nobody knows how it got closed how she got in there why was she naked and where was her phone well obviously she didn't crawl in there on her own well that's not what the police said but to make things even more mysterious before they found her body they released footage of her in the in the elevator of the hotel and she was acting very oddly she was pushing multiple buttons at once and she she was alone she was alone and she was gesticulating wildly like her arms were waving like she was arguing with someone and she would frequently stick her head out of the doors like she was looking for someone or she was hiding from someone and she appeared to be arguing with someone that you couldn't see she had also made reference on her blog to creepers and being worried about people attacking her and again there were those weird letters that she had written to her roommates uh and her odd behavior then so at the time people were speculating that you know no one knew at that time where she was they they couldn't find her there was no footage of her leaving the hotel so they knew that she had to be somewhere there but they just couldn't find her they had even checked the roof but because the alarms had not gone off they didn't suspect that she was there some people the internet went nuts with this video and people analyzed everything they found her Pinterest her Instagram they found everything about her online and started to try and figure out what had happened and some people looked into the history of the Cecil Hotel because it has a very very dark past and they thought maybe it was ghosts or something like that that had haunted her some people even speculated that she was playing the elevator game what's that it's a game where supposedly you can get sucked into another dimension which kind of yeah there's even instructions online yeah how come we haven't done this before it's very creepy and very scary it sounds like a an elevator version of Bloody Mary basically what this game is is you have to go in alone some say you can do it with friends but most say you have to be alone you're supposed to go into any building that has more than 10 floors and go directly to the elevator once in the elevator you have to enter on the first floor and you cannot do it if anyone else is with you and first you have to press the button for the fourth floor when it gets there don't get out press the button for the second floor when it gets to the second floor stay in the elevator press the button for the sixth floor when you get to the sixth floor go back to the second floor then when you get to the second floor press the button for the 10th floor from the 10th go to the fifth and once you're at the fifth a young woman's supposed to enter the elevator but you're not supposed to look at her or talk to her even though she might talk to you and she might look familiar okay she is not what she seems now according to the ghost in my machine they say at this point stay in the elevator and press the button for the first floor if you remember we're on the fifth hope you haven't gotten lost press the button for the first floor at this point there's two things that could happen you could either go to the first floor floor which means it's failed in which case you're supposed to get out without looking back and immediately leave the building and you can try some other day or if it worked instead of going to the first floor that you pushed it'll go up to the 10th floor and if you wanted stop you have to push any other button before it reaches the 10th floor and get out before it reaches the 10th floor if you chicken out if you don't chicken out at this point don't talk to the woman she'll again try to talk to you when it gets to the 10th floor and the door's open leave without talking to the woman and don't look back and you'll know that you've entered a whole separate realm because there's no one else there but you how do you get back you have to go back to the same elevator and then repeat a whole bunch of button pushings and and more crazy stuff so some people speculated that she was playing this game she was playing this game and that it actually worked and she got transported to another dimension but she did get found in the sistern even if it's kind of unexplained how she got there so there's people who actually go into buildings and do this elevator thing I think so I'm pretty sure just like anything else you can find it on YouTube wow but the police got a tip from her sister who said that she had bipolar disorder and sometimes she would act erratically if she hadn't been taking her medication and among her belongings they did find that her medication that was basically untouched she hadn't really been taking it and the autopsy report also showed that she didn't have any drugs drug in her system no alcohol and she had very little of the medications that she had been prescribed in her system so more than likely she was having a bipolar episode again there's still unexplained things that happened how did she end up there um how did she get it there without triggering the emergency alarm that type of thing and so people started looking into the history of the Cecil Hotel because it has a very sorted dark history okay so let's start back at the beginning it was built in 19 19 24 by three dudes William Banks Hanner Charles dicks and Robert shops and they built it to be a premier destination for upper class businessmen you know social Elite type people uh International destination it was built with full-on marble in the lobby it's gorgeous if you see it everything it's Marble from floor to ceiling it has stained glass windows and alabaster statues there's palm trees and and like big huge opulent staircases and railings it's it's it looks like it was built in the 20s to be for upper class people and for a little while it was it they had 700 rooms and 19 floors of course it was labeled 20 because there's no 13th floor right they all did that five years after it was opened oh and it cost 2.5 million to build I guess oh wow back in the 1920s oh wow right right within 5 years of its opening it was the Great Depression and so they kind of lost everything the hotel kind of sank into disrepair and there were over 10,000 people at one time living nearby it kind of became part of skid row and the hotel started to rent out rooms really cheaply like for short-term stays or for long-term stays kind of a hostile style um with some long-term tenants and cheap housing and and some prostitutes plying their trade people going in for Affairs drugs you know that kind of thing nice yeah oh yeah real nice so this gorgeous hotel has turned super cedi it was built in 1924 and the first documented suicide happened just 3 years later January 22nd 1927 a gentleman named Percy orand cook just 52 shot himself in the head in one of the rooms because yeah he and his wife had been having trouble and he was trying to reconcile with her and so that he could be back and have a nice little family with her and his son and she apparently said no and he decided that was enough and and killed himself wow yeah and then shortly after that just a few years later um [ __ ] in the 1930s alone there were six reported suicides some people ingested poison caplets there were people that shot themselves in 1934 Army Sergeant Lewis D bordon slashed his own throat with a shaving razor is there any consistency as to why not really this gentleman had left a lot of notes and he was partly just concerned about his health I guess and didn't think he had long to live so that's why he said he committed suicide there are a lot of jumpers one resident Kevin Kenneth given uh he used to live there at the Cecil he said anything higher than the sixth floor was Danger ous and that back in the ' 80s that it was basically there were no laws and the higher floors were where people would get killed and obviously the higher floors were the ones where a lot of people would jump so maybe that's the one consistent thing I'm not sure but huh yeah yeah so there was even in 1937 Roy Thompson who had been in the Marine Corps he jumped from the Cecil and was found on the Skylight of another building there were several women that jumped or were possibly pushed uh March of 1938 Grace magro she fell they're not sure if she jumped or if she pushed and then let's see oh there's a couple of them where people weren't sure what happened um and so they have the they're cited by as fell from building so they're not ruled a suicide or a murder they're not really sure um let's see there's Grace Margo Robert Smith Helen gurnie Julia Francis Moore Allison LEL and two ident unidentified men in 1992 and 2015 in 1962 a woman committing suicide actually took out another man a 65-year-old George Giani who was just walking by the Cecil just having a good old afternoon stroll when Pauline auton 27 had jumped from her ninth floor room and landed on aen she' been having an argument with her husband and when he left the room she jumped out the window and killed the guy she landed on she did police had originally thought that uh she and George had jumped out of the window together but then they said that he was still wearing his shoes and his hands were in his pockets and if he had jumped from the building his shoes would have fly flown off of his feet in the fall he would have had his hands in his pockets and he wouldn't have had his so they knew that he' just been walking by so she committed suicide and un fortunately killed someone when she did it now there's some shitty luck just another disturbing thing that happened at the Cecil Hotel was in 1944 and this was in September and now first of all tell me when you spot the sick twisted part 19 19-year-old Dorothy Jean purcel woke up in the middle of the night she wasn't feeling well she had checked in that day to the ceso hotel with her boyfriend Ben LaVine 38 what what mhm yeah so but she wakes up in the middle of the night she's not feeling good and she decides to go to the bathroom maybe she just has to take a dump she ate something bad or whatever so she's on the toilet pushing when she realizes she just had a baby what how do how do you know I've always you always hear these stories you always hear these stories and I have had two children and let me tell you I don't get it well she's 19 with a 38-year-old dude so let's just say that she's not thinking clearly and he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] right so she has a baby to her complete shock she thinks that the baby is dead and throws it out the window because she doesn't want to piss off the boyfriend oh [ __ ] yeah climbs back into bed like nothing is wrong and then of course the next morning he realizes something is up and she gets checked out and they find the baby on the roof and unfortunately he is deceased oh my God so she was found not guilty by reason of insanity and so she's being taken care of but that's just one of many disturbing stories in the ceso hotel that's crazy right I mean side out the window yeah yeah there's just I don't know it's a bad mojo House bad mojo house very much so so yeah every single room every single floor has something now amidst all of these suicides and people dying there were two and this is someone I'll talk about later but there were two serial killers that lived at the Cecil oh in the 1980s Richard Ramirez he's also called the nightstalker oh I might have heard of him yeah oh yeah he was a serial killer in Los Angeles and he stayed at the Cecil in the midst of his uh Killing Spree of 13 people so is there something about this house that brings out the [ __ ] in people I'm not sure I don't know it seems to be some people say that it's cursed some people say that Ramirez um tapped into like the dark side of the Cecil and he's a known Satanist and there are theories that he kind of harnessed the dark energy that was just floating around the ciso hotel and actually summoned a demon has there ever been any of like these um professional paranormal groups there what do they think they think it's haunted as [ __ ] and they do many of them do think that Ramirez either contributed to or harnessed some dark energy that was already there and made it even darker I mean there's there's people like us just you know fan type Ghost Hunters that go you can find all sorts of um you know the YouTube people that go to haunted places or podcasters like us they're all over the place people it's it's so haunted and so creepy and it literally it's been well known for a while to be a very haunted place but after 2013 because of poor Lisa lamb and all the conspiracy theories that were surrounding her and the hotel at the time people really dug into and got interested in this place and it's been featured on um like Ghost Hunters Ghost Hunters and um the Travel Channel one and all them they all all the famous people have been there to do it let's see well they've done a bunch of documentaries crime scene The Vanishing at the ciso hotel I just can't believe how many killers and crazies and psychos have actually stayed there right let's see Ghost Adventures has been there um haunted history has been there anyway and there have been a couple documentaries done on it as well particularly focusing on Alisa lamb but you can also see it featured in Richard Ramirez the nightstalker and the other serial killer who was Jack unter weager from Australia he stayed there in the 90s partly because he um really liked the nightstalker he had a thing for Richard Ramirez so he kind of wanted to stay in the same place Ramirez had stayed and so he was there in the '90s and he actually killed three sex workers while he was staying there he was from Austria and he came there to write a magazine piece about sex workers and just killed people and apparently he had killed people before and gotten let out for good behavior and then went on to kill like 11 more people and he stayed at the Cecil so a lot of people have been to these different rooms Alisa's two rooms room 506 and room 412 and Richard Ramirez's room 1419 which is actually on the 13th floor of the hotel that they call the 14th floor and people have definitely felt different entities and demons in those areas actual demons I some psychics say yes uh some psychics say just dark energy they all agree that there are a lot of spirits there people are just trapped and one of the previous um managers she says that there were 911 calls every day there were deaths in every room really yeah Amy price was the manager there for a long time and she said in her tenure as the manager there were over 80 deaths by Suicide murder overdose accident uh 16 of which she says they're not sure how it happened or what happened whether it was suicide accidental or murder did it ever Dawn on anybody to like stop spending the night there you'd think but guess what they're making it into now shell a haunted bed and breakfast Apartments woohoo you know it sounds like every asylum in the country right very much so and it just seems to just bad luck and bad news seems to cling to the place nobody could pinpoint any particular beginning as to why but I mean it was constructed they spent a ton of money on it and then immediately the depression happened and immediately it started to have could it be the land it could be it could be it's possible I I haven't seen anything to show what there could have been or what it I mean not to say that nobody we just might not know but for some reason that area seems to attract a lot of negative things a lot of negative people good yeah now they're turning it into 600 affordable residential Apartments can you imagine being in an apartment literally like a maintenance worker was showing someone around and just pointing someone died here someone died there someone died in this room someone died in that room someone died in that hallway like everywhere you turn pretty much every single room has had a serial killer stay in it or someone stay in it who has died by Suicide People you can go see videos of people traveling in the elevator that poor Alisa lamb stayed in and it's it's creepy it's sad it's just I mean there are some Mysteries and some questions around her death but that one was probably just an unfortunate accident it's very tragic but the place that it happened in just makes all those little coincidences even more mysterious all the mar coincidental exactly and when you have someone like Richard Ramirez staying there shell one of the things I heard that you would not believe is that this place was so Lawless so wild everyone there was so Brazen and so [ __ ] up out of their minds that Ramirez would kill someone be covered head to toe in blood would go to the alleyway and strip off his clothes and then walk upstairs to his room in just his bloody underwear and no one batted an eyelash wow he even apparently the room the room 1419 that people have done investigations in is the same room where he brought back the eyeballs of one of his victims holy [ __ ] it's just I yeah so there's some bad mojo going on there man there's a lot of bad mojo there and people that go there feel it there are ghosts and um some psychics that have been there have felt different uh drug addicts and people so many nameless people have just died there for all sorts of different reasons in addition to the ones that we actually know who they are so the places there's ghosts everywhere and if you stay there you're going to see one or feel one or they're going to talk to you and then of course all the serial killers who brought all their bad vibes with them exactly including one of them who may have done some Satanic rituals and pulled in a demon crazy yeah wild do you want to go shall we go visit bring a Ouija board Maybe I am probably dumb enough that I would say let's go check out this elevator game there you want to do the elevator game there I just want to know if it's real I don't know I'm not the I'm the person who can't say like that one name three times or I don't like looking in the mirror doing Bloody Mar Bloody Mary Bloody Mar bloody mirror don't do it don't do that this is like close enough to a mirror what are you doing I'm that person I am that person no I was just going to say I'm the one who can't do that and you just did it right in front of my face oh my goodness I'm so creeped out right now shell like I would totally go do the elevator thing yeah would you hold my hand I would I would I don't know I wouldn't want to stay on a high level floor just in case I on like the first or second floor just in case oh right right no we wouldn't stay on any floors over six because what if like the demon Whispers to you walk out the window it's okay there's a bridge you know some Demon's going to lie to your ass and you're going to end up nine floors up like the Road Runner with nothing underneath your feet I just want the demon to have the only option to say go down to the bar it's happy hour weed is legal smoke in your room right right so yeah I I would definitely go and see if I find some portal to a different realm that would be interesting and maybe we could solve some Mysteries while we're there so that's my spooky story the seil hotel we could be like the the Scooby-Doo crew we could we'll we'll head on down to LA and we'll go check out the Cil hotel and we'll Scooby-Do it up we'll all have our little Spirit boxes I've been looking up online sh how to make a Spirit Box because I want to do this with you when I come out in October oh my God this it's so easy did you find the directions I did I did I'm so excited so we're going to do some ghost hunting while we're there right at some of these haunted places you know what they're going to just Flack to us yay I'm so excited I cannot wait so not only are we going to talk about and visit these super spooky historical amazing places but maybe we could even do some little seanes or Ouija boards or Spirit boxes orb photos I got an orb photo taking a picture of the Sun the other day in my freaking yard shell you gotta share that [ __ ] so like this is so weird you know so I saw you know these things happen all the time around here speaking of like different entities Spirit boxes like all the time in your peripheral vision especially like later in the day it's like all you see is these like black blobs all around the yard and down the street and in your neighbor's yard this is my not shocked face do you see my not shocked face you live in such an amazing amazing wonderful magical like that place is a load Stone people have said it before it draws energy energ there I'm so not surprised but you really just feel like you see stuff in your peripherals all the time whether you're home or walking down the street downtown I it's just it's just constant I'm a little jealous I mean I walk down the street and I see you know Brad Pit I see the rock I see and I get to see shadow figures and you get to see the rock right yeah yeah is that like normal yeah all the time my kid sees people she's Gotten Good at now she rolls her eyes she sees a famous person and all the people go to like take their picture and want an autograph and she's gotten really good at at that like tourists now I've Gotten Good at that here in Salem I'm like ah more people who like Hocus Pocus I'm one of those people I can't wait to be a Hocus Pocus tourist in the city where Hocus Pocus was not filmed well I'll have to send you a picture that I uh took the other day while I was out walking during my lunch break cuz it was of the ropes mansion from Hocus Pocus which is like a block away from my work how fun how fun so other than orb photos I'm really looking forward to doing the tourist thing shadow people seeing shadow people taking orb photos taking pictures of all the cool buildings shell this is going to be amazing it's fun it's fun and you know speaking of hauntings and ghostly feet figures I got this weird story today oh you know the craziest places are haunted we always talk about you know hospitals and houses and cemeteries this is a zoo it's a zoo what is up with a haunted zoo is it haunted by an animal partially really there are animal sightings there specifically Lions animal ghost sightings now I happened to find out that the Lincoln Park Zoo is like the seventh oldest zoo in America well that makes sense you might say to yourself why does anybody care I care because where I'm from in good old Binghamton New York we have the fifth oldest zoo in America I did not know they had the fifth oldest know that I didn't I knew it was an older one but I didn't know it was the fifth oldest in America 1865 how fun so that was 1865 so there's L maybe that one's haunted too if it's even older right we'll have to send my children there to check it out for that's right they go up to one of the wardens to be like hi is this Zoo haunted because one that's a little bit younger is and I need to know so where where I'm from Bingham to New York our zoo is 1865 this Lincoln Park Zoo 1868 so it's only literally three years younger this zoo was like meant to be like the thing that boosted Chicago into stardom back then which then they you know the whole world Chicago had the World's Fair and all right late 1800s I imagine a zoo would be a Marvel right so they decided to get this Zoo if I'm not mistaken I think it's like 56 Acres the problem is that that 56 Acres started out as a cemetery it was the original Chicago Cemetery the zoo started out as a cemetery did they just remove the headstones is this one of those situations where they only remove the headstones partially no no so check this no no there's actually a good reason kind of so back in 1868 is around they hadn't seen Poltergeist yet okay hadn't seen Poltergeist yet it once held the remains of 35,000 th people damn the cemetery was then closed when they decided to make the zoo thanks guys I'm sorry I got to go see my grandparents they're over in the monkey section that's terrible so what they did is okay so 35,000 Graves you follow me I am so they decide they're going to move the graves there's that you know you're just moving these bodies year did they have to get permission from like 35,000 families to do that I don't know if back in the 1800s if they were really seeking out the permission right right there probably weren't very many like Cemetery rules then yeah yeah so unfortunately where a lot of the turmoil comes into play is I'm sure you remember the Great Chicago Fire yeah so on the night of the fire they decide to abandon moving the bodies to go help with the fire and the fire lasted however long Fire's over they go back and they can't find the freaking 12,000 bodies can't find them they're like oh [ __ ] forgot where they were what they're like well we forgot can't find them just start building the zoo no so hold on so so the Chicago Fire was 1871 right and it was like two days it burned for like 2 three days so in that time they forgot where 12,000 bodies were did they probably probably get burned up in the fire no they were buried underground oh oh body oh so they just forgot in the area that got burned they're like I don't know where in this 2,000 burned Acres no it didn't even get burned what happened was they were moving the bodies and all the people had to abandon the work to go help with the fire so they forgot where they were working they forgot where they were working so they'd move they'd already moved all the headstones they started with 35,000 and they were down to 12,000 left forgot where they had had them forgot where they were and decided to just leave it [ __ ] it let's just start building the zoo we can't find so somewhere in the acreage of the zoo you said it was like 56 Acres or something 12,000 bodies there's 12,000 bodies still buried under the zoo they just moved the headstones so that's what started it that's some bad mojo right there that is some that's bad stuff you don't do that well and then you figure you got prohibition going on you're in Chicago Al Capone's Town um there were some murders in the zoo in the park and there you you are supposedly able to hear Fox gunshots and screams you imagine being in a gangster Showdown with Al Capone and hey you get out from behind the cage I don't know and then they have a shootout over by the zebras or something like why were they I don't understand was it one of those places with like like a where they ran alcohol through there or something oh actually yep yep they actually were yeah there were places where they were hiding alcohol in the zoo of course of course even the zoo is not immune to the so but here's the other so here's the other [ __ ] up thing throughout the years as they were doing random different construction projects all of the sudden they'd start exing bodies and some of them they would just find a different hole in the ground and shove in there you're joking that's awful why would they do that so the bodies were basically put back and buildings built over top of them so these ancestors are dug up and Disturbed in the worst way not even nicely then shoved back in and shoved back oh man I mean I'm not a Christian burial kind of girl but that's not good that's bad energy right there you don't [ __ ] with dead people so you know obviously as you can imagine the typical flickering lights door slamming there's been various EVPs caught there the voice of an old Zoo director one of the old Zoo directors was eatting by something I would have a lion maybe never left still comes to work every day oh those tape ghosts those are scary I don't I really would not want to go to work every day for eternity there's also what people describe as a floating pocket of negative energy that makes people physically sick and it moves throughout the park that kind of makes sense I mean with all the the ancestors there and all that all the grave robbing moving energy you know that that would make sense if that negative energy kind of like swirls around swirls around the park full body apparitions seen in Victorian period clothing good [ __ ] so also kind of the the additive to this is right next to the zoo it's built up against a lagoon okay and they had built a bridge that crossed this Lagoon the bridge was originally I don't even remember what it was called it had its own name and it was dubbed The Suicide Bridge like if that just doesn't tell you how horrible it was it sounds horrible but it was a pedestrian bridge it wasn't like for cars it was just like a walking bridge and they built that in like 1894 it was just a popular place for people to just take the plunge they they only let it stay up for 25 years before they tore it down but in that 25 years they believe a hundred people had jumped oh no yeah oh that's awful I wonder if the negative energy that was swirling around near the zoo kind of extended to that area and it was a 75 foot tall bridge so basically what it did was it it connected the zoo to like across the lake front people just would just jump off so between the land and then the people like intentionally ending their lives on this bridge like they even in 1907 talk about two sisters age 10 and 12 um that they're not sure if they fell off the bridge or jumped off the bridge oh those poor babies no I bet they fell those poor things probably at 10 and 12 they probably did fall and at 75 ft that's like four stories oh no oh that's awful um they found the body of a man who was known to walk the Lincoln Park every day um in the lagoon they thought that he had actually tried to go in and save the girls like just bad stuff okay side tangent because I'm high on my own stash here but back in the day my family used to go camping a lot and there was this one campground near a lake I don't even remember where it was and they had this bridge that we as kids used to like [ __ ] run across and all it was was these two huge round metal pipes right that ran from one side of the gorge to the other that's it there was no platform there were no and you called it a bridge there were no railings there was no nothing and at its deepest point it was probably a good 50 60 ft deep and it was probably 30 40t across and we would literally run across this and we would pretend to push each other off we would like play on the top of it I don't know what the [ __ ] we were thinking but one wrong move and somebody could fall and and die oh wow I'm sorry that's all I could think of was 10 and 12 yearold kids was me and my brothers running on this stupid bridge that I have no idea why 80s parents let any of us do any of the [ __ ] that we did but it's a miracle we're alive anyway sorry tangent over basically supposedly Zoo employees have heard sounds of young girls crying late at night near the side of the bridge oh those poor babies they probably just want to go home to the where one woman was said to have quit her job at the zoo because of it that would break me I would not be able to handle that I mean to hear that crying every single night she just couldn't anymore and just quit literally quit no I I would too that that I have two girls you have a girl I I I couldn't do it yeah and I mean there are people that would kind of perpetuate the anxiety of the bridge you know it attracted weirdos oh of course of course that type of energy always does one elderly woman was known to go there daily to get as drunk as humanly possible another man would often go and whistle at the moon in a strange Eerie tone that scared the heck out of the cops oh wow creepy well you know and you got to remember this was the early 1900s um so you know everybody was kind of superstitious about it and and dubbed it Suicide Bridge wow I mean I don't I don't know I don't know if I you know know would you walk over it if that's what people are calling it I don't know not alone probably probably not alone because it sounds like it's one of those places kind of like the Cecil and we've talked about other places where negative energy swirls there so much you have to wonder sometimes if people aren't like a lot of these deaths they don't know if it was suicide or murder or an accident and I imagine it's the same thing on the bridge what if it's this negative energy like doing something like whispering things to people or actually pushing people but back at the zoo there's one woman female Apparition that they always spot near the lion house walking around sometimes people think it's a real person other those are my favorite ghost sightings someone will go up to be like oh hey I saw this person doing whatever and they're like oh no that's a ghost everyone sees them I love those but they also find her in the lady's restroom near that lion exhibit like Moaning Myrtle yeah Moaning Myrtle people have seen her um her her reflection in the bathroom mirror in there oh I hate that no and again flickering lights do slamming the restroom so they feel that maybe she had some sort of that maybe her demise had something to do with that lion area so it sounds like at least one person is known to have been eaten so and you gotta you got to remember when you're talking about like zoos in the late 1800s early 1900s the level of safety like they didn't have OSHA right right they're not gonna have like the guidelines so you know a lot of people back then and even in even you know we were talking about the zoo in Bingington Ross Park there was even stories about folks getting eaten by lions there like no share yeah actually getting eaten by a lion at a zoo in that time period was sadly more common than you'd think well I would like you said they were Mobsters this is Chicago and 20s and I imagine they fed people to the alliance on more than one occasion I would put it passed them right you know in my personal opinion the biggest issue with this is that you built a zoo over 12,000 bodies you dumb asses that is their first [ __ ] problem right there why didn't someone decide that that was a bad idea okay they still hadn't seen Poltergeist yet but still they should have known all about money it was all about money back then yeah yeah late 1800s and Chago they were trying to make name for themselves they had enough of those like mediums and like ghostly Seance things going on at the time they should have known somebody should have told them but I guess not I would really love to go to a haunted zoo me too I want to go uh to a haunted zoo and like see if we can hear ghostly lions or or ghostly Lions people have said that they've heard animals that aren't there but really the most of the ghosties are people interesting there are people that said that some of the animal noises that they've heard were just people kind of making it up it it it's not verified by the people because it's how you gonna see a ghosty lion but there are people who claim they're there I you know interestingly of animal sightings I tend to hear of cats more often than any other animal being a ghost so I wouldn't be surprised if lions were seen or heard as a ghost I don't know only because I've heard of cat ghost more than any others but what I don't understand is like they were one of the first zoos to get like elephants and stuff but like all of the activity seems to go like more around the Lion's cages I wonder if that's where the bodies are that could be maybe that's where the bodies are buried that could be I just didn't know if it was because cats were more psychically sensitive maybe that's true too oh gosh I didn't think of that maybe but yeah it just seems that lot of the weirdness is is in the surrounding area of where the cats are lion the tigers lions I want to go I want to bring some ghost hunting supplies oh they do ghost tours here yay probably in October you can actually I believe it it's all year round really how fun so yeah you can actually go and you can do a tour um of the Lincoln Park zoo and they give you you know the the tour guides give you their version and and of what's been going on there and and different things that they may have experienced doing their tours and that they've heard through the the pass down of info so yeah that would actually be a cool thing to get into one of those tours that would be super cool it's on the list of um top 10 haunted Loc in the Chicago area CU looking into this I actually found out there's a [ __ ] ton of haunted locations in Chicago I'm not surprise Chicago has a history we should talk about I bet they've got some cool ones too they do and some of them are gangster related so so fun I love that time period we might have to delve into some of those in future episodes but but yeah so this zoo was on the list of top 10 Haunted Chicago locals oh very cool so that's a lot of stuff shell I like your couple different haunted locations we've got your zoo and Bridge and my Cecil Hotel in La which is scary enough as it is it's just so interesting that there's just you know it's like you look up one story and it takes you down a rabbit hole of all these different experiences and hauntings and sightings and EVPs and and photos like the rabbit hole is just sometimes the best part of this it really is and I love love learning about all these different places and the history and you know just so many cool things similarities the similarities to some of these places yeah the stories that are the same like the lady in white they're so intriguing even the Cryptids some of the Cryptids have similar traits similar similar uh I don't want to call them personalities I word but like they have a lot of similarities and it's just very interesting to see how every town every city every state thinks they're the only one yeah there's the gates To Hell everywhere there's the most yeah there's the most haunted everywhere and these stories are so similar and yet so different and and it's neat to see the cultural influences and the the time period influences and how things change and it's just I don't know I'm loving it I'm still having a ton of fun how about you sh I just I can't run out of stories that's me either I cannot wait stories next week I already have a haunting lined up for you I am so stoked for this one because I wanted to stay in kind of The Haunting Zone and I have found getting to haunty season right it's just so exciting and I found a
