it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 52 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends get together to smoke massive amounts of marijuana while telling each other the spookiest Tales from across the United States of America representing all things ghosty and the uh brain Toasties and the marijuana brain Toasties I'm Lea and I'm shell who's apparently coming up with good anecdotes for being stoned today I guess so that's the first time I've ever heard of that particular one I just made it up it wasn't really a thing until today well then you're probably not as high as I am at the moment and that's probably a good thing one of us needs to be at least a little bit less High I got I got to tell you this this is so hysterical and I don't mean to jump right to the weed stuff but oh jump to the weed by all means I'm very happy to do so I'll jump right along with you you know how I get when there's a deal you love your deals 8 deal8 for 888 288 288 88 for 288 if it was 88s for 888 I'd hang myself talking about your prices are supposed to be be coming down not going up that's the WR that's right that's that's not a deal Lea bad math so I live a good deal and and and you know I'm occasionally good with math so I go to my favorite store and usually when you walk in there's like a like a what do they call eight and a half by 11 sheet of paper in a stand and on that sheet is whatever the deal of the day or the deal of the week is oh sure they have like a little a breakdown of their their special is like a special of the Day menu right and because they're not allowed to like advertise it on their website or whatever because of the federal brewhaha like that is such [ __ ] legalize it at a federal level already the whole ATM crap and I can't use my credit card I'm so over it let them use the banks for [ __ ] sake anyway they do I mean they think that if they charge us the extra fee that we're gonna stop no we keep buying so anyway so I'm I'm looking at this8 and 1 half by 11 sheet of paper in the St and I'm looking at the deals and I'm like wait a minute does that say five 1 G pre-rolls of gg4 for $30 and I'm like wait wait wait wait so that's five grams for holy [ __ ] wait a minute I'm trying to do the math in in my weed saturated brain and that still sounds like a pretty damn good idea five grams for $30 so fantastic so in my mind I'm like okay so like an eighth an eth 3.5 right this is the one time that that Americans can do like math as far as like grams I have advice for for all of these governments out there if you ever want to find out who is who's got the Gan just start talking in ounces and grams and if they understand it they smoke you know you know you know so I'm like wow so usually I'm getting like 3.5 for anywhere between 45 and 60 so if I'm getting five grams for $30 but you know I don't like pre-rolls really and no and in my experience a lot of times pre-rolls unless they're the premium pre-rolls they'll have a lot of Shake in them is this good bud pre-rolls so you got to remember so I'm standing in line high as [ __ ] proc trying to do math okay and and I'm like okay so I grinded up anyway so not that I like to to smoke pre-rolls but I could rip them [ __ ] open and empty them in a baggie and it'll already be ground for me yeah half your work is done right so I'm like okay five grams $30 preg ground five grams $30 pre-ground so I ended up getting 15 pre-rolls for $90 so I actually I ended up up with 15 grams for $90 of gg4 so that's $6 a gram preach it yeah wow and now how much is it how much is an eighth normally 60 bucks so that's like $17 a gram so you got $6 a gram and normally it's $17 a gram yeah so that's that's a good deal hey I even I know that 17 is bigger and more expensive than six that's fantastic I've been breaking up these pre-rolls oh look at that poor sad pre-roll on the side you've murdered that joint just smoke that [ __ ] it's good so then what I do is because I don't want it to dry out I've only been breaking open three at a time oh my goodness just smoke The Joint shell they're good see yeah but see because it's freezing right now in the Northeast and I have to smoke outside I I I don't have the I'm too cold to stand outside long enough to smoke a whole one gr pre-roll so I feel like I would waste it so yeah know I'm breaking that [ __ ] open dumping it in a Ziploc and packing my silicone pipe with it you know I suppose if I wanted to do a tea break if I was going to take a tea break that telling me I had to smoke outside would probably be a good way to do it if I was in the northeast or anywhere where it's cold right now I'm not smoking outside there's no way not doing it can't do the cold so yeah if I had to smoke outside I would probably smoke a lot less yeah it's the life I live right now so so so yeah it's actually more cost effective for me to break it open because I would just waste it if I was like taking a few Puffs off a pre-roll putting it out lighting it back up taking a few Puffs putting it out you know yeah but yeah so that was that's the deal of the day man so I'm laying in bed and I'm talking to my sweet darling love and I'm like you know I've paid more money in my lifetime for dirt weed than I paid for this yeah that's very very cheap that's very cheap and I usually don't go for the joints only because in my experience they roll the joints with like whatever's left in the bag and that can either be very good or it can be very bad and so you get kind of Hit or Miss but it sounds like from your experience because this is not the first time you've done this uh you usually get really good weed so your place is a good place to do that with definitely yeah yeah and you know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a little more simpler than some but for me this for me this just this was like the best idea I ever came up with for this price now what I like to do is uh you turned me on to this and then I found some uh some at a couple places in Riverside California was the smalls the bags of the smalls because I don't give a [ __ ] what they look like and and you keep calling them popcorn buds people keep saying they're popcorn Buds and as a grower I always learned popcorn buds as something very different to me the popcorn buds are when you're trimming you have this big huge plant right and you always see the big beautiful colas and everything right right what they don't show you is further down the branch and further down the Plant the buds get smaller and smaller and smaller sometimes even to the wispy side as a hom grower if I'm not very good about um lollipopping or completely stripping everything off the underside of my plantss I'll end up with these teeny tiny super Airy buds that Growers call popcorn buds um because they're very little they're very airy you know puffed up like popcorn by air and they're not usually worth a lot so to me popcorn buds mean something very different but I guess that's what they're calling these Smalls bags as popcorn Buds and that's I think it goes back to you're you're over complicating it and being way I am it's true my God scientific from a point of from a stoner's point of view they are thinking popcorn chicken from KFC and little popcorn chickens are little smaller than the regular KFC chickens so popcorn chicken popcorn nugs you follow the train of thought here I am I am but you you are so right I absolutely have to overthink everything you and your scientific [ __ ] I know I don't know this is where my brain is stuck but I love love love love love the bag of Smalls that we get that's popcorn Buds and I love them they're delicious and who gives a [ __ ] that they're small all I can think about is KFC popcorn chicken with potatoes and gravy they do have my favorite potatoes and gravy I have to say you had to go all on popcorn buds popcorn chicken potatoes and gravy now I got the munchie something fierce I am smoking not only my homegrown but if you'll notice I showed you some pictures of this the other day when my husband surprised me with it but my new cutie bowl look at that it's got a pentacle on the end of it and I do love that that is very very very pretty and it says Salem Massachusetts on the side it's got the pretty it's all black smoke color glass and it's got the pentacle on the bowl nice big deep bowl and then it's got this blue um light blue to dark blue I don't know what kind of ivy leaf wrapping around it and it says saem Massachusetts the company that made it that is out of Salem Massachusetts they blow all the glass there um it is a awesome place that you I I can't believe I didn't take you there when you did I take you to a a place like that when you were here you did you we went to a glass shop we didn't go to witch doctor I don't believe we did go to just a regular glass shop I believe I know where I took you yeah I know where I took you witch doctor is the place that makes all those pipes um and you can actually go in there and watch them blow well I don't know if you can now preco you could go in and watch them blow um and then they stopped it due to the Rona and I don't know if you can go back and watch him do it again now since we have been on the downer side of that well when I come visit not only am I bringing my new beautiful wonderful Bowl but we're going to stop there we're going to go get you another one absolutely and get your one too to match because these are great I love the feel of it sits nice in my hand they're not paying me for a promo but I'm going to put a link to their website any social media because I love this P it's gorgeous it feels good I'm so in love with it so I am packing it with more gelato some purple Milky Way and some gelato mints o what is purple lky way talk to me I have no [ __ ] idea but I absolutely love it it's purple I am stuck on the gelato and the purple strains lately you know what I had I had a little bit of this um since our last taping it was called Michigan mouth have you ever heard that no I've never heard anything about that that sounds pretty that's interesting where did they come from I'd only gotten an eighth of it was like tide over weed until I got to my regular store so I got this at a different store only got an eighth of it and it was called Michigan mouth and if that wasn't the sleepiest weed I had in my life I don't know what was you know by name you'd think that Michigan mouth that you get all chatty you know you'd be all like you'd think yeah mouth of course no you just wanted to like grab your cat and your like fleece blanket and you know cozy in for a long winter's nap nice very nice but I'm just these new names are coming about what what made me think of that these new names are coming out so what is Michigan mouth what is what' you say chocolate Milky Way purple Milky Way and I got this out of Upstate New York out of a dispensary in Upstate New York it's it's called Purple Milky Way and I've never heard heard of it before where are these new names coming from are these high people who are just making [ __ ] up like I've always wanted to do that's what I'm wondering if this is something out of maybe a local Farm or a local grower I did look up and find a Milky Way cultivar but nothing about a purple Milky Way online so my guess is this is a regional cultivar or or a very local just to that farm cultivar where they either bred something that they put out as purple Milky Way but I wouldn't guarantee being able to find this anywhere out outside of Upstate New York cuz who knows how well it's bred or or if it's just like somebody's backyard M cultivar you know I know all I know is we're gonna have to really start changing the topic because now I want to eat a Milky Way candy bar and I feel like no matter which way we're taking this conversation it's leading back to munchie food all right well let's switch out of food I'm G to pack another round of weed in my beautiful bowl and let's talk about what our stories are going to be today now that that we've talked about how freaking High we are I am going to take us down into the South into a story that I heard about I think like on taps or ghost hunters or haunted history or something a billion years ago and so I'm going to take us down to St Francisville Louisiana to a place called The Myrtles Plantation I feel like I've heard of that before Oh you probably have it's extremely haunted and it has been on a lot of ghost shows and they build themselves as the most Haun haed Bed and Breakfast in America aren't they all they all are well this one's in America not just in Louisiana but in America itself all of America that's I I it is I'm sure it is well I'm gonna tell you a bunch of stories and I will let our listeners decide is it the most haunted or is it much like Amityville house a bunch of bunk now I think that's so funny that you're doing a house that could be a bunch of bunk or a bunch of realness like the idville house cuz so am I no doubt right very cool so we have the dueling is it or isn't it house pretty much but you know I think I'm totally gonna win this one I'm just goingon to spoil alert right now um Shell's taking this one for the win oh we're back to our competition days of of shell vers Leila but no this house is really freaking creepy shell and I don't know I think I'm going to win this spooky story I have the most haunted house in America oh wait no okay what is it I have seven websites and four movies to back me up here oh I don't okay all right you you definitely beat me on the movies I'm fairly certain despite being on numerous television shows been no movies I got movies all right d you've got my curiosity rised I know it's not Amityville because you've already done that one what is it now where are we going I'm gonna tell you I I want to just give you a little bit of my angle before I tell you because everybody's gonna be like oh we're going to hear a story about that house again I'm starting to have some ideas I was flipping through on Prime I am not a cable person I love my my streaming movies um so I'm going through on Prime and I see this thing called Sleepless unrest was the name talk to me Miss [Laughter] Cleo is that on Prime is that on Netflix I don't know I also love a good documentary um so I'm in the documentary section and I find Sleepless unrest it is a 2021 documentary about the real Conjuring home oh okay so then you know back in back when the conjuring movies came out scary scary movies very scary Classics very scary the time I didn't realize I don't know why I you know I was raising kids I had [ __ ] going on in my life and I guess it didn't re I didn't realized that they were based on true stories yeah so I come across this I'm surprised sh because this is all Northeast and you know that was pretty close to where you grew up where we grew up I didn't even I didn't even know where it was I mean you got to figure back when this happened you know I had two kids in high school you know kids in sports kidss in music and theater I was a busy mofo that's true that's true and you were not devoting your life to a phenomenal amazing world-renowned podcast devoting itself to Spooky Stories absolutely abolutely absolutely so you know I guess it just didn't dawn on me the location or the fact that it was real so I'm flipping through Prime and I find uh I find this freaking this movie this Sleepless unrest and I'm like wait a minute are those Conjuring movies real no [ __ ] oh so this is like just now like up until now wait a minute sh sh yes so so I'm like no freaking way and I start watching this and I'm like oh my God I get on Google Maps and I pull up the location and I'm like uh this is like an hour and a half from where I'm living currently so I'm gonna I'm going to talk about The Conjuring house but I'm not going to take it from the angle of the movie I'd really like to more focus on some of the experiences in the documentary as well as talk about the warns a little bit and some of the the legitimate um experiences that have been documented not just the Hollywood theatrics oh I love that because you know the movies are pretty well known and people are very familiar with that side of the story right right and there's I mean you know Hollywood is Hollywood and and I I've done the Exorcist I've done the Amityville oh my God doesn't it seem like I did that a year ago oh wait I did oh you did so The Exorcist we knew was Loosely based Amityville it seems like was just a bunch of hooy and I'm telling you I think this is the real deal like like I want to drive to Rhode Island today I think this is the real deal you said it's only like an hour and a half away I'm surprised you didn't do it already with your sweet love and then come back and tell us about it and take pictures dude I just found this out like within the last four days that a it was real a that it was real and B that it was close oh so you just haven't had time to plan the trip yet is what you're saying I know you I'm sure it's coming put it this way after I watched this documentary and then started doing some investigating um about this house I looked up they have a website The Conjuring house has its own website and they offer tours and you can do like I think one of the options is like with a medium and a Ouija board for 13 to 14 hours overnight and I'm like hold on I don't know if I want to [ __ ] around and find out on that one how do you get the job to be the medium that's on call for hire at The Conjuring house I mean not I would love that job don't get me wrong with like how do you get that job like do they put an advertisement in the local it's called networking it's a friend of a friend you got to know you got to know people Le okay okay okay you just don't know the right people I I have to say I admire I I'm quite surprised that other haunted places don't do this I mean on the Queen Mary they have the ghost hunting kits that come with your haunted room and this place has gone one step further and provided an actual medium to go with you I admire that kind of customer service and you know entrepreneurial Spirit they do tell you those specifically on their website that they do not provide ghost hunting equipment oh just the medium you get the medium it's one of the other you eat it too man no no we will give you the uh the EMF the the flashlights the the Spirit Box you know the Ouija board you but no medium or you get Miss Cleo the medium to come with you but no paraphernalia one of the other you know I would like to just point out something before I get a little too deep into this story and before I get a little too far into this poll but you know going back to so I'm pulling this up on Google Maps and I'm like what the [ __ ] this is down the road when I pull it up on the map there is a a striking closeness to the Lizzy bordon house really really they're like not too far from each other you could go stay at the Lizzy board and bed and breakfast and visit The Conjuring house pretty much like let's do it that sounds like an awesome weekend let's go for Valentine's Day well it'll be a galentine's trip we'll go stay at the Lizzy bardon's house for her galentine's trip I'm sharing my screen with you because this is hysterical I'm sorry I'm cracking myself up over thoughts of our trip from Valentine's Day yeah but look at this look at this triangle on your screen okay so where my Mo where my mouse is s massachus it's very very beautiful Seaport Town beautiful the The Conjuring house is right on the border like literally when I zoom in it's a mile across the border from Massachusetts to Rhode Island like just just south of Worcester basically pretty much and then watch my mouse go down here Fall River down that's the Lizzy Bardon house see wow that's a that is a triangle interesting and there is something I can't remember what it's called because I'm high but there is something called the something triangle in Massachusetts that's like some phenomenal paranormal thing the I want to say the Bermuda Triangle but that's not it because I'm high but there's something some triangle of paranormal activity in Massachusetts that I know is near Fall River and I'm wondering if it did Encompass where the conjur housewi it's called the Bridgewater Triangle that's it that's it that's it it goes it encompasses mostly Tonton is there a [ __ ] Tonton which is to the east of Providence I think they pronounce it I think they pronounce it Tonton okay hold on hold on shell hold on yes yes what the Bridgewater Triangle is inside almost exactly if I'm right it looks like this triangle is almost exactly inside the triangle you just showed me are you telling me that I just had some really super stoned Revelation you did it looks like you really did so it is it is it's right along the longest arm of that triangle that you discovered see Salem is at such an angle where that Fall River angled Taunton is right on that line and then The Conjuring house is the other line you see what I'm saying I do it's almost like the longest line of the Bridgewater Triangle matches up up with the longest arm of the triangle you just discovered between Salem Massachusetts The Conjuring house and and Fall River and Fall River the house of Lizzie bordon holy [ __ ] shell like I just think Massachusetts this one big [ __ ] show of paranormal ghosty activity I'm just saying absolutely and in that area it looks like there is one big triangle of yeah Paranormal Activity and also PR interesting and you know I just said Massachusetts but that abs absolutely includes Connecticut and Rhode Island as well because they're all in that parts of that triangle yeah and they're all haunted as [ __ ] they really really are so so yeah so The Conjuring house The Conjuring house okay now that we've had our little stoned geek out about Shell's Tri-State triangle of terror that's what we should name this episode Shell's Tri-State triangle of terror so like this house is you know what I have found out is I I I'm even more confused frightened curious [ __ ] around find out like I don't know the more I find out because I don't know now after everything i' I've watched and read and listened to if the house is haunted by former residents or if it is an evil portal to hell oh another portal to hell I didn't read anywhere that it was a portal to hell but like it has all the signs that okay that the land it's it's it's an evil place right and that it's the land that has attracted all of these horrific evil I see so I can't I can't tell if it's a if it's a if it's a land haunting or just ghosties in the house well let's start at the beginning because a lot of our listeners may not have even heard of the house let alone seen any of these movies or you know any of the shows or documentaries so let's start at the beginning what is The Conjuring house and why is it famous don't go there even I'm scared if sh's scared you know you should run it is a scary very very scary story you know I I actually I'm not gonna necessarily give you the yeah I'm gonna give you give you some of the backstory um from the from the beginning so this house this house was actually built in the 1700s I can't think of the date off the top of my head I'll get there 1700 something this house was built okay okay so as you can imagine uh that's relatively early into us having those lands we had been here about a hundred years probably at that point so this house is built in initially it's a 200 Acre Farm so that's quite a bit of land and it remained a 200 Acre Farm actually until like the 1980s okay oh wow that long it stayed like intact for pretty long time as a working farm wait for it so there the people who had this house built um actually I think it was nine generations of their family uh kept the property nine or 10 and they like passed it on person to person in their family origin it was called the Arnold estate I'm sure it wasn't called The Conjuring house right from the GetGo that's that's probably not what they named it I'm pretty sure so good to know good it was the Arnold estate not The Conjuring house but you know to kind of jump into the middle I just want to let you know that a lot of the issues start in the in the mid 1800s in this house and and it's because of what we and know and have become grossly familiar with here in in this part of the country she was an accused witch oh of course she was of course she was what for did she look weird did she cure someone of a terrible illness did she pick plants on occasion I mean did she do the ultimate crime of getting old I mean what happened here she did all of those things but then she also there is she she also had a habit of stabbing people in the skull with a knitting needle but knitting needle but we'll get there we'll get there oh oh that's all just a nitty needle in the skull I'm sure they deserved it so where you know obviously the movie uh was not filmed at this actual location so where is this real Farmhouse located the real Conjuring Farmhouse that um it it's often referred to by locals and the folks that live there like I said as the old estate and it's located in Harrisville Rhode Island there's a house and a barn and they are both original from like I said around the mid 1700s you know there wasn't a lot going on in the 1700s with it um people had come and gone there were people who referred to it as other names some people called it the Old Brook Farm some people called it the Dexter Richardson house um the the family that built it was the family of tter Richardson so that would have been like I guess the OG name of the house but nowadays most people refer to it from basically like the 1970s till now as the old uh Arnold estate so there was this lady back in let's see what year was it around 1844 and you know how I am with pronunciations I I'm probably not saying this especially in that area it's not you shelle it's the area they're all hard to say so her name was Betha Beba Sherman I'm probably saying that so wrong but it's spelled B- a t h s he EB a bth Sheba yeah so kind of love that name actually she she was actually born in 1812 but she got married to a fellow Road Islander uh named Judson Sherman in March of 1844 and they basically bought this Farmstead um like I said it was a it was a house in a barn and then 200 Acres of property not too shabby yeah yeah they had a son she actually was an older mom and this is I think where maybe her story starts to go arai she had her first son at the age of 37 now you and I have had kids you know know how it goes the older you get the higher risk you are and 37 is a little bit old especially for that time quite surprising right so they had a son named Herbert Sherman and they say that she had three other children of um three other children as well all of whom did not survive past the age of seven oh that sucks but they can't find any Census records to confirm nor deny well depending on when they were born you know they might have lived and died before the next census anyway yeah right right so basically there was no evidence to really support that she was ever a witch only local surprise right only local Legend and folklore but what happened was suspicion would grow because you got to remember this is this isn't a part of the country where they were only about 100 150 years removed from the The Witch Trials right suspicion grew when an infant mysteriously died in her care when the baby was examined it was determined that there was a mortal wound caused by a large sewing needle that had been that had been impaled at the base of the child's skull oh damn so the towns people believed that BBA sacrificed the infant as an offering to the devil but yeah what but due to insufficient evidence the court found so she was actually tried for the murder the court found that she was innocent of any wrongdoing but despite her name being cleared legally the public already had convicted her pretty much I am actually super curious to see or or I wonder what evidence was used to clear her name I mean a child being found in your care with a sewing needle severing its spine at the base of its neck that's usually a sign that someone did something wrong unless it was some sort of horrible accident so I'm wondering what came out in the trial I'm very curious I it didn't get that deep I am sure that's too bad because I need to know I I'm sure we we we could maybe yeah my guess is it they must have found it somehow it was some type of accident or she or someone else would have been tried if it went so far as a trial and she was found innocent my guess is is it had to have been deemed to be just a terrible accident well also um just to point out and I'll get into this a little deeper in a few one of the folks who lived in the house and had some horrific experiences ended up writing a book in the late 90s early 2000s and um they talk about some stuff that they chatted with a local historian about this person so there may be more about B sheba's story in that book or through the local historian in Rhode Island very cool okay so this lady Beth Sheba she she dies as an old woman in 1885 right after her husband died she did live to see her son get married but there are people who believe that she sacrificed all of her children even though their Census records showing that her son Herbert lived and married and had children of his own I gotta so the rumor went around despite obvious evidence to the contrary right because basically this baby dies in her care so now they think that her three children that died before age seven were sacrificed to whoever right so the rumor mill as usual goes crazy and despite her name being cleared now she's a witch now she's a witch I gotta okay so now here's the thing this is where [ __ ] gets creepy though now various articles online kind of lead you to the impression that when she died not sure shortly after but like kind of the moments following her taking her last breath that she literally turned to stone no [ __ ] or the other thing that is found is that she died from a bizarre form of paralysis that puzzled and frightened doctors oh so one of those things where like your muscles stiffen up and you can't move and so the rumark became that she turned to stone it's kind of like um that disease that you've heard recently that Dion is suffering from God bless Selen Dion love her Titanic soundtrack was moving and and basically that's kind of what happens your body that's how they describe it your body turns to Stone so you got to think in 1881 they literally are thinking it turned to stone but it could be it could be that disease that currently Seline de is um suffering from I'm sure there actually is a medical explanation for it but they might not have known that in 1881 no no they wouldn't have had that information good point so you know between them thinking that she died and turned a stone and then all the Legends in in folklore saying that she had these children who died in her in you know her children um that the one in her care the the rumors are swirling flying Fast and Furious the gravestone of BBA Sherman is located in a historic Cemetery right down the road in Harrison Rhode Island so you can actually go find her grave and you can see pictures of it online it's kind of like a broken Stone um but her name is very clearly able to be read on it so yeah I mean and she is basically still there so now you've got this this history of a supposed witch who supposedly dies and turns to Stone who supposedly sacrifice small children there staying there that's her house that's where she's staying she's haunting the lands but how did they realize or quote unquote think that she was there so you got a fast forward to 1970 and this is kind of Where The Conjuring movies come into play was in the 70s interesting that these places that seemingly had horrific histories and laid dormant suddenly are active now in the 70s the late 60s and the early 70s have you noticed that because TR it does seem to be a trend like the Exorcist was in the 70 like what is with the 70s and all this [ __ ] going down I don't know Dawning at the age of Aquarius I maybe it was all the drugs people were doing suddenly the ghosts were coming out of the woodwork I don't know so she dies 1881 all is well that ends well fast forward 1970 and the plot of The Conjuring movies begins okay o now we get to the really scary part so now you have new owners of this house they have finally taken the house out of the original family remember I told you like eight or ten Generations oh maybe that's what happened that could be oh [ __ ] didn't even think of that yeah Disturbed everything that had been settled for so long something new probably they painted walls and did renovations right so basically there's this family called the parin family and the parents Roger and his wife Carolyn by this house in 1970 now still to that day 200 Acre Farm so from 1700 whatever to 1970s we're still the whole property and buildings are intacted 200 Acres the barn in the house these folks they like to get busy they got five kids wow that's a lot man I have all I can do handling two and my kids are adults right imagine having five they live in this house and they only live there for 10 years like literally move in in 1970 move out in 1980 they started having some some dealings with have you ever heard of um oh what the Lorraine and Ed Warren oh yes I I know actually I'm hoping to do a podcast just on Lorraine and Ed Warren so they actually gotten in gotten involved uh in this house as well well let's tell everyone who Lorraine and Ed Warren are you know what I'm going to I'm going to munch on some M&M's for a second can you tell them who they are while I just take a quick munchie absolutely Lorraine and Ed Warren are well-known paranormal investigators of psychic and her husband who researched and were involved in so many different cases back in the early 70s 60s they were like the most famous like they right they are the ones that were part of the Amityville Horror house they're the ones that that investigated that I believe that Lorraine was um a clairvoyant and that her husband Ed was the um demonologist he was a demonologist and they founded a school they wrote books they went all over the country looking for Paranormal Activity looking for ghosts and looking for demons and portals to Hell very often if you ever hear of anything around the USA that has any history of being a portal to Hell prior to the 1980s I bet you Ed and Lorraine Warren's fingerprints are all over it why do you think I thought that this could be a portal to hell and not a go exactly so there is a lot to the Ed and line Warren story and we're going to talk about it but we'll get into that at a later date in another episode that's a different podcast but for as it relates to this particular story they were a big part of kind of bringing some of this stuff out now I just want to backtrack for a second and just kind of go over real quick some people who died there so keep in mind eight or so generations of one extended family lived and died in this house yeah a lot of times they were born and died in the very same rooms or very same bed in some cases and you know I don't know maybe maybe you're on to something not necessarily with this specifically but bigger picture-wise maybe maybe there's something about you know eight Generations 10 generations of one family in this house and then all of a sudden they sell it out of the family and that's when the hauntings start so often in these paranormal tales and these spooky stories that we we find there might have been small occurrences or none at all in the past and then when the house changes hands or goes through some type of renovation things get stirred up I guess I'm not sure but changes seem to kind of precipitate these paranormal Poltergeist de demic activities you know it just really seems to be a Common Thread in a lot of these Tales so check out um some of the people who have um who who died in this property okay over the course of those eight or so Generations there had been two suicides by hanging one suicide by poison damn the rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl by one of the hired Farm hands on the property oh my [ __ ] god two drownings the passing of four men who froze to death oh man as well as someone who died during childbirth yeah sad but common someone who choked to death and other tragic losses of life in the house wow that's quite the list SH now also remember when you're talking about like mid 1700s until like probably even up until the early 1900s when you have a generational family land of 200 Acres you bet your ass most of those people are probably buried on that property too that's true they very often did have a family plot right especially when they had that that much property at that time you know I mean back then 200 Acres Jesus you own the whole freaking land so a lot of these people were born there died there under tragic circumstances and then were buried there as you can imagine there's some [ __ ] going on on this property yeah it sounds like it so remember I told you the parin family who bought the house in the 70s one of their five children Andrea parin she wrote a book in the title of that actually she wrote a Trilogy of books called House of House of Light House of Darkness oh quite the catchy title if that doesn't just freaking Intrigue you yeah so basically she writes this book and she also was able to get with local historians to kind of delve into some the history of the house before her family lived there very cool and she was able to find that most members of the Arnold Family died on the farm there most of the recorded deaths literally were in the family well again that makes sense they didn't have you know a respit homes or you know end of life homes or hospice care you know they didn't have old folks homes kind of things back then you went home to die you stayed with your family until you died even Beth Sheba was a part of the Arnold Family the only person um that they have on record that died on the property that wasn't a part of the family was that 11year old girl basically there's been a lot of [ __ ] going on so even they've even asked questions when this this she's not a child now but one of the children of the family uh the paren family who bought it in the 70s um she writes in her book that this is just a dark place just in general like the energy is just dark how could it not be with all of that like that's not one or two or three tragic deaths right that's a lot and those are just the tragic ones that's not dying of old age dying of sickness so when she calls her book House of Darkness House of light she means it yeah there's a dark history there and you know someone asked her at one point why she named her book that and she said everyone who has lived in the house that we know of has experienced this wow wow basically I found out that you know how I told you that you can do tours up to 13 to 14 hours overnight yeah there's no checkout policy you want to know why why is there no checkout policy sh most people don't make it through the night so they leave running and screaming and take off so because that happens so much they ditched having a checkout policy oh my goodness really that's pretty good I that's that's funny they say some have left screaming and running for their lives they said one guy came to help with restoration on the house and he left screaming without his car without his tools no [ __ ] I want to stay there you without your car how scared are you that you leave without your car you and me are just the [ __ ] around and find out types that should go stay there would we go running out in the middle of the night or would we stay and just get more and more scared you know honestly when I was discussing this with with my sweet love I I kind of equated it to your father's house that place I don't know if even I could stay there overnight I said I actually I made it through a night at Lea's dad's house so I think I could make it through a night here right right so [ __ ] spooky so the question becomes how did the paren family figure out that the spirit haunting them was this Shea Sherman that's a good question this is where the Warren come in okay it was their suggestion and then you know I can't wait till we do that episode about them because you know sometimes you're torn between these people are legit and these people are full of [ __ ] oh sure I'm excited to delve into it myself but it was it was edin Lorraine Warren that brought up the idea that it was be Sheba Sherman haunting the property I don't H I almost feel like they let him they led him down a path if that's well sure they were the experts you know they they were called in to kind of explain what's going on here so yeah they would have had ultimate control over where the narrative went right so the mother Carolyn parin she had told Eden Lorraine about an incident that had happened where she had been lying on the sofa and felt a piercing pain in her calf and that her leg muscle began to spasm so she got a leg cramp no she like basically she noticed a puddle of blood and a point of impact holy [ __ ] she had a puncture wound and there was nothing there oh [ __ ] like an out of nowhere puncture wound [ __ ] out of nowhere puncture wound Perfect Circle pool of blood and Lorraine and Ed Warren said it was as if a large sewing needle had impaled her skin I see I see are you following the tie I'm following I see here so when they hear this story they all of a sudden start telling her about you know the story of B Sheba Sherman how she was suspected of killing the infant with the knitting needle oh the Warren are saying she was guilty right okay Lorraine suggested um that be Shea Sherman could have taken the needle with her to the afterlife and used it to stab Carolyn in the calf oh wow [ __ ] and then from that point on Lorraine Warren referred to the quote unquote demonic presence in the parent house as Beth Sheba well as we know Ed is a demonologist so all of these have to have a demon component as well right I mean I don't even really know I didn't even dig deep enough because I was so enthralled by the movies and the documentary I didn't even dig deep enough um at the moment to get the connection with Ed and Lorraine Warren but that [ __ ] LED them is it me or did she lead them or did she Discover it you know she come in as the sensitive and is told by this entity whatever it happens to be that its name is Beth Sheba and and did she get that energy from where did the information come from did it come from The Entity or did it come from Her Imagination or did it come from the research that they did prior to going to the home right and my other question is is are you just going on that or was there contact did Lorraine have contact with basba who was like yeah [ __ ] it's me you know what I mean right right too many unanswered questions so actually the the interesting part about this is when The Conjuring they were The Conjuring movies were in the making for pushing 20 years which I also didn't know so at the time when the the base idea in the script you know the screenplay and stuff was being written a lot of these players were still alive edin Lorraine Warren were still alive and a lot of the parin family were still alive and the family and the Warren backed everything that was done in those Conjuring movies they're saying it was all true yeah they say that every single they stand behind every single thing yes yes it does seem that the house was dormant uh for a little while after the par and family moved out no one has been able to stay in the house since now was there any um was anything mentioned about Ed and Warren like exercising the spirits or cleansing the house for the paren family no no and it wasn't there wasn't anything that I found as far as it relates to the book either okay I'm about they just left right they just moved out it seems though that Eden Lorraine Warren kind of they agreed with everything that happened but they were kind of mad that they didn't have like a role a bigger role in these movies and that kind of turned me up a little bit oh yeah they were very much about getting their name out there for sure yeah yeah and it's like you know as as someone who has done stuff like that you know the tarot stuff the the the psychic stuff if you're getting mad that you're not getting all this attention that's a red flag for me right but any any who honestly with my my introvertedness and with my own personality I don't want the attention like I have a hard enough time doing a Tarot party because there's going to be too much attention on me Seekers right right I don't I don't want to be the focus of that attention you know I just I just feel that there is definitely stuff going on so anyway anyway let me let me go back the parent family s they they move out in the in 1980 nobody's been able to stick with that house ever since people going in and out going from hand to hand selling buying selling buying that's a common theme amongst some of these haunted houses whether or not you believe in Eden lra whether or not you believe even the Amityville Horror right these houses change hands oddly frequently yeah an inordinate amount of times an amount of times that is disproportionate to the amount of times other houses in that area change hands or houses in general change hands like you mentioned my dad's house earlier that house has changed hands I think my family lived in it for the longest stretch of anyone that lived there and that was mostly because once the adults moved out adult children would move in at different time so it was still different families but within the same family and none of them could stay there for very long and even now after my family moved out of it I've noticed that it has changed hands multiple times just go look at Zillow you can see all the different it just changes hands every few years which again is very unusual for the area so you can keep a house in the same family for eight to 10 generations and then boom the longest anyone can do after that is 10 years well again if they were living with these ghosts and if the family if a lot of the ghosts are related to the family or if they're if they are the family maybe they knew how to live with them or maybe or maybe the ghosts didn't get kind of riled up until after that family left maybe they were quiet because that family lived there for so long it's a little bit different when the when the ghost is your Aunt Susie who used to bake your cheese bread right right maybe they just didn't talk about it because it was Aunt Susie who used to bake your cheese bread and they didn't care they just knew they were familiar when it's not your family ghost all of a sudden it's creepy and scary that's right it's like you walk into your house and everything is fine you walk into your friend's house and it smells like cheese right they don't notice they walk into your house and it smells like n Champa and you're like no it never smells like n Champa in here yes it does you just don't smell your own house I guess you don't notice your family ghosts but other people do yeah because they're your people so yeah so no one's been able to to to keep ownership for extended periods of time D up till now so these folks have bought this house I'll get you their names in a moment I'm guessing is they've kept it for such a long time because they don't live there oh absolutely not they ran it out that's right that's right that's how you get around that is you don't live weirdos like us right you don't live there then you can keep it right right yeah no they rented out to to folks like us weirdos like us every day Ghost Hunters people who just want to scare um and I actually do want to point out this is so hysterical what the fact that we definitely have to go and stay there and see if the ghosties are all worn out or if they'll talk to us through a Ouija board do you want to know how commercial they have made this house and it is a ghosty house and I ain't saying it ain't a ghosty house oh no is it super [ __ ] commercial they have one package you can call you can you can get investigate and prepare contact $1,00 a night $1,500 a night on the weekend that's so you can create content for your followers this one is called the content creator investigation they'll hook you up to investigate and I'm like are you really GNA charge people $1,500 a night just so they can bring but these are their packages they have this is the one I had to tell you about the medium thing they will get you three hours in The Conjuring house and you can receive Spirit messages from gifted mediums for $175 okay okay this is what I was thinking I was like oh my God I need to find six friends who can split $960 for $960 six people 13 to 14 hours they give you a tour of the house and then you're on your own till morning but you can't record it correct if you want to record everything you have 1,200 correct you are I believe allowed to take pictures I don't know I'd have to dig deeper but anyway wow this place is haunted and I agree after what I've done this is no Amityville this is the real deal but they're making a damn Buck on this [ __ ] they are making a buck but for like I'm sure they are booked the [ __ ] out with Ghost Hunters amateur Ghost Hunters like you and me wanting to experience something that's been in the movies for bucks you can do like an hour and a half guided but yeah so as you and I both know visiting historically haunted sites can be disappointing sometimes it can be enlightening but very often it can be disappointing I I am curious I would have to see some other Ghost Hunters that I some amateurs and some that I respect their experiences there to see if it's worth it because for $1,500 I don't know it better be worth it this movie that's where this movie comes into play you need to go Prime Sleepless unrest so we we're fast forward into this movie now you I've given you we all know the conjuring story now we got the history now we've got the background we've got the background tell us what's up with the documentary what's going on now OMG so this group of folks went there there was like four people they were I believe two of them were documentary folks uh documentary filmmakers and two of them were paranormal investigators it's a good combination we need some documentary filmmakers to follow us around I know right hey anybody your doy we're world famous wiy podcasters come follow us around I'd watch that you've got four people here and you know maybe two of those people want to see something but the other two you can at least say are relatively objective these people had the [ __ ] scared out of them no [ __ ] scared out of them oh my gosh I want to see this investigation now no check this out in one scene they're talking to like this roaring radio sound like as if someone was answering them like talking through the radio because they had all this equipment you know the ghost Hunty equipment yeah the stuff that we need to acquire and put on our ghost Hunty schoolie for when we do this it was like one of those electronic uh Spirit Box type things oh yeah so they're talking to this like Spirit boxy thing and like you can actually it sounds like someone's answering them and then you're hearing like a bam of a loud noise no way and then no [ __ ] way you start to see like they're recording say they're recording a corner of a room and like you can see a blurriness in the video is like an orb is it an orb no it's in the shape of a [ __ ] body no no [ __ ] way no way and this was done recently like this docent was filmed like really recently it was put out in 21 yeah yeah sh we got to go oh my God this isn't people that are like adding some Hollywood [ __ ] like you kind of get that Blair Witch seasick from watching the movie feel like like this is a legit documentary and like you see it and you hear it and you're like oh my God like I was getting Goosebumps for some of it wow wow the thing is is that you know these people were they were interviewed by other entities like you know you do a documentary and you got to go on your like promotion circuit so they're being interviewed for their like promotion circuit type stuff and people are like you know because Blair Witch was kind of fake I wish it was real because that would have been great right A lot of people were like you know you say this is a documentary but it seems too good to be true is this really real some of those four people I'm not going to name names because that's just me and if you want to know look it up on the internet your damn self they had to actually go uh and and seek mental health therapy no [ __ ] house damn they had to go see their own mental health Prov health care provider um after what they experienced in that house oh wow no way if you have to go to a freaking doctor after a ghosty experience sign my ass up I want to go if it scares someone so badly they need to seek professional help would like to experience it as well thank you me I'll go for backup sh I'll be your backup but like that kind of just takes it to a different level for me so you know uh Lorraine and Ed Warren could be full of [ __ ] but these people need to go to freaking counseling after a night there wow damn so then I go back to you know maybe edin Lorraine Warren were a tad Miss Cleo but maybe they were a little bit legit maybe they were 5050 legit scam they might be again we're we'll have to find out I'm not I don't know I've heard things both ways you and I have heard about them we grew up hearing about that and only Rec involved they're involved in like every based on a true story movie we grew up with exactly and they they they started so many different groups and schools and all these different things and and they were considered the end all in Beall and only just now have we started to hear the other side so again I'm curious really to dig into and to get more into our research on this but they were very good at marketing maybe maybe or maybe they did have these connections or maybe like a lot of things getting into my story when we get into my story there's some truth and some fiction but there's a lot of kernels of truth to it who knows there might be maybe it's one of those things that got to be overblown maybe there were true things that happened and then it got embellished or maybe it's all [ __ ] [ __ ] I don't know I don't know but the the the folks that were in the house they walked away with scratches oh wow yeah the physical ones those freak me out when people have those unexplained bruises and scratches and they're like oh hey something touched me and then they pull up their sleeve and there's a scratch there yeah this this wasn't just Thing That Go Bump in the Night This was um the these people had blood drawn oh wow [ __ ] blood drawn and well that would make me want to go see a professional for sure and you know that that was definitely apparently a [ __ ] around and find out moment for some of these folks I don't know if it was the Paranormal folks or the documentary filmmakers but they their asses were freaked out and they didn't realize what they were getting themselves into oh that sounds so creepy so it's worth the $11,200 during the week is what you're saying yeah and I read a story about someone who went there a more lower level amateur paranormal group went there to do a amateure investigation and it got to the point within a few months after that visit the mental health issues were too hard to overcome um and that person succumb to Suicide oh [ __ ] no really they had left documents written documents saying that they felt that ever since they had been at that house that there was a cloud of evil following them around oh wow that there was something that attached itself to them at that house that left that house with them kind of thing like they they basically felt like they were driven they felt like they were Driven Crazy so some some real badass [ __ ] has come from this house yeah I guess so that's really [ __ ] shitty whether you believe it you don't believe it people's lives have either been extremely affected or unfortunately have ended due to their experiences at this house so you know say what you will about Ed and Lorraine Warren but the shit's the real deal man and I want to go right right who knows and we'll find out about Ed line Warren but uh it sounds like this house is really [ __ ] spooky but if you're looking for a little and you've got Amazon Prime check it out it is actually it's worth the hour and whatever that the movie is um it's called Sleepless unrest the real Conjuring home and again it's a a 20121 documentary well I'm gonna be watching it right after we're done recording because that sounds fascinating but like I just wish you know I just wish that I had full faith in edin Lorraine Warren because between the documentary and then some of the other experiences like like the person who ended up committing suicide that's some [ __ ] that's some yeah that's a wild story that's pretty [ __ ] wild that's some [ __ ] so that's my Conjuring story I if we're going to compare this against Amityville and The Exorcist this one 110% legit for real and like I said I based on what I've I I've found out I don't know if it's like ancestral land haunting if it is some ghost stuck in the house or if this really is some Demon portal to hell wow it sounds like it could be all sorts of that because the history of the house and where it's located and and who knows weird triangle I discovered I discovered a triangle right shell Stone triangle what did we call it terrible triang Stone triangle shell Stone triangle the terrible triangle of terror yeah the terrible triangle of terror something like that yeah absolutely we'll figure it out but yeah we'll Workshop it so this one's a real one this is this is definitely it makes me want to go back and watch all the conjuring movies again now that I know they're real I'm definitely going to be watching that documentary because that sounds very very interesting but from my story I am also taking us to a historically haunted house be that beat this one okay beat that go I think I can I'm pretty sure I can but this house has also been featured in quite a few different places um let's see unself Mysteries Ghost Adventures most terrifying places in America Ghost Hunters Taps love a whole bunch of them yeah I don't remember which show it was that I originally watched it but I do remember the ghosts trapped in the mirror and the handprints that appeared on the mirror oh God yeah right so we're gonna start begin Bloody Mary Bloody Mary Bloody stop it sh stop it what are you doing oh my gosh don't do that I don't think it work on a zoom screen are you sure that almost counts like a miror oh you're freaking me out don't do that sh oh my gosh I'm too high for that don't do that all right take us to your house okay what year is this oh we are also in the late 1700s and the early 1800s for most of this story okay all right so we are going down to St Francisville Louisiana which is not too far far away from Baton Rouge Louisiana okay and we're going to a place that's currently called the Myrtles Plantation and it is a gorgeous Anabell which I'm still not really sure what that means I think it refers to an Era but it's an Anabell Mansion it's a 20 room mansion that you can currently stay at as a bed and breakfast and they do have some houses on the grounds as well I always love the places that you can actually stay at right now the Myrtle Plantation was built in 1796 by a gentleman named David Bradford who is actually a general in the Army okay now General Bradford built this house originally as an eight room home on 600 acres of land and he named it Laurel Grove and it was actually his prison for a short period of time General Bradford was part of what was called the Whiskey Rebellion I love whiskey right me too so back in the day apparently President George Washington and Alexander Hamilton decided that they needed to raise some money and one of the ways they were going to do that was by taxing whiskey and the people who made whiskey [ __ ] right for real it was not a popular thing and so there was an uprising in Pennsylvania which is where Bradford was from and so he was part of this Rebellion we're not going to get into that but they lost obviously and some of the people were held accountable for their actions by President Washington and Bradford was put under house arrest and so he went and he stayed at this eight room really nice house down in Louisiana on house arrest for his part in the Whiskey Rebellion rich people jail yeah so rich people jail oh they were like oh yeah you need to go to jail for your part in this Whiskey Rebellion go stay at your nice house in Louisiana right so pretty much that's what he did now he had built this house this is going to go back to one of your favorite things shell the land itself had originally belonged to the tuna people that lived uh they were an indigenous people that lived along the Mississippi River and according to rumor this area had originally been part of a sacred burial ground and when and when David Bradford built his house he actually dug up quite a few Graves what is wrong with this guy and they decided to just dispose of everything all the artifacts and Graves that they found they cleared they they desecrated and burned and then built his house right there all right you don't even have to finish your story because we just know that this is going to end in [ __ ] [ __ ] show destruction now there's nothing specifically saying in historical record that that's exactly what happened just local Legend but the area did indeed belong to the tuna people at the time so it could possibly be true not sure probably right now so he lived there for alone for quite a few years under you know house arrest until he was pardoned by President John Adams in 1799 so about five years the Whiskey Rebellion from was from about 1791 to 1794 so he stayed there for about five years under house arrest so basically what they did was they said if we're going to make you on House rest and you don't have to stay in your cold house in Pennsylvania we'll send you to Louisiana where it's warm and you'll be comfortable he left his family in Pennsylvania in order to keep them safe because he was the only one that was in trouble and he had wanted to live along the Mississippi River anyways and he had purchased this land and and built a small house there and so he went there to kind of keep his family safe and then he was already so he was already living there in Exile when he was tried and found guilty and told to stay there as house arrest his family stayed in Pennsylvania and he was in Louisiana so he moved his wife Elizabeth and their five children from Pennsylvania to the plantation once he was pardoned he died there in 1808 and his widow Elizabeth ran the plantation until 1817 when her daughter Sarah Matilda married a gentleman named Clark Woodruff who was 26 and Matilda was 19 at the time now here's where legend and history kind of differ they always do the legend of the Myrtle Plantation being haunted begins with Clark Woodruff and Elizabeth Woodruff is the people haunting it or the people that see that there's some hauntings going on well the people that kind of caused the most famous Haunting of the house okay now during this time this is before the Civil War so slavery is unfortunately still a thing and as many plantations did they had enslaved people on the grounds we don't we don't condone that but unfortunately it was what happened at that period of time yeah we yeah that that was the history it was [ __ ] up but that was the history so Clark Woodruff did an even more [ __ ] up thing and he took one of the young slave girls and decided to make her his concubine and and raped her repeatedly she's called in some stories his lover but obviously she was a young girl she was an enslaved person she had zero agency to be his girlfriend so her name was Chloe and she worked in the house because he wanted to keep her close so that he could rape her whenever he wanted to rumor has it that he then picked another younger girl to start having um you know to start paying attention to and Khloe was sent back out to the fields and to do more and more menial labor now to try and prevent this she took to spying there's a lot of different reasons given for why she started listening in to his office but one of the many is that she was trying to protect herself from being sent back out to the fields where she would be treated much more harshly so she was caught listening into his office one day with her left ear pressed against the wood and as punishment Clark Woodruff had her left ear cut off and so after that she took to wearing a green turban on her head uh but unfortunately this didn't stop her from being sent to more and more menial labor and she was working in the kitchen and out in the Fields shortly after this happened one of the children had a birthday and she was part of the crew that was cooking in the kitchen and she was specifically tasked with baking a cake a birthday cake for the family now whether it was revenge or whether she was trying to do something so that she could later look like a hero she took the oleander plant the juice from the oleander plant which is a poison very similar to arsenic from what I understand and she put that into the cake batter and baked the cake and served it to the family and to the children people are divided onto whether she was doing this as revenge or if she was trying to make them sick so that she could then cure them and get a position of Honor back in the household ah but whatever her intentions were Legend has it that Elizabeth and her two daughters were killed by the birthday cake and that Clark uh was sickened but didn't die probably because he was a bigger person and it would take a higher dose to kill them correct it said that the their deaths were recorded as yellow fever because no one knew what caused their deaths and so it was it was determined that it was an illness that caused their deaths yellow fever was an easy go-to back then yeah and exactly yellow fever was a very easy go-to so historically their deaths are recorded as yellow fever but what lore tells us is that they died due to this cake and that when chloee went back to her family in the Shacks with all the other enslaved people they found out about it and rather than being punished themselves they decided to punish Khloe and hung her from a tree and then threw her in a river oh [ __ ] the other story is that when Clark Woodruff caught wind that it wasn't illness that killed his family but Khloe baking poison into the cake he hung her and the most likely story is that he's the one who hung her and threw her into the river now it's said that Chloe ha the house and you uh there's actual photographic evidence of her that was um determined I guess they they've shown it to different people who study film and they have determined that it it can't be explained by Shadows or anything like that and it is the right height to be a woman and you can clearly see what looks to be the height of a young woman with a um in a dress with a turban around her head and that was what her physical description was that's correct people will also see the children playing in the household two young blonde girls they're also known to be seen very clearly when it's raining specifically out in the front yard when it's raining you can see the young girls playing in the yard as if it's a bright clear sunny day that's weird yeah there's also pictures of young girls both what looks to be young black girls that could be enslaved children and also young children that might be the two girls that died there in the background of people's photos in the in Windows but they're very often seen and the story that's very specifically told on some of these ghost hunting shows and that I specifically remember is about a large ornate mirror that's in the front hallway the entryway of the household and at the time some people had a Superstition where if there was a funeral going on or a death in the house they would often cover up all the mirrors and cover up any reflective surface I know of that Superstition so that that that's definitely a widespread thing and Rumor Has It that this particular mirror for whatever reason was not covered after Elizabeth and her two daughters died and so their Spirits are trapped in the mirror and you can see handprints will often appear in the top of the mirror where nobody could reach to put them so small child-sized handprints will appear on the mirror and people report seeing a woman and two children two young girls Reflections in the mirror when they're not in the hallway oh I just got visions of people like inside the mirror clawing to get out let me out let me out that's [ __ ] spooky and I hope that's not what's happening but people say that they do see them and it's it's well known to be very haunted mirror that mirror still up that mirror is still up and and they will tell you the story of the mirror in some of the videos that I've seen you can clearly see handprints on it and in other videos there's nothing on it at all so they do sometimes appear and sometimes not now the house is rumored to be the location of more than 10 10 murders not just Elizabeth and her two children possibly whether those were murders or accidents are to be debated but so after Elizabeth died after Clark's wife Elizabeth and his children died he moved and and left a caretaker to manage the home and he left it it was left to a gentleman named ruffen gry Sterling now the Sterling family also had run-ins with problems here including leis Sterling was the oldest son of ruffing gry Sterling And he supposedly had all sorts of you know you ever heard of the House of the Rising Sun in uh New Orleans now Lewis was a known frequenter of many gambling establishments and had all sorts of debts and loved a good poker game supposedly I don't know if it was during a game or if it was if it was uh someone just surprised him at his home but leis Sterling was in the uh dining room of the plantation and he was stabbed to death over a gambling debt and it's rumored that he tried to crawl across the floor and died just inside the doorway of the dining room oh people in the dining room whether they know the story or not will often trip just before they get to the threshold of the door trip over what over nothing there's nothing there there's no rug there's no indentation there's nothing that there that would cause people to trip but it's as if they're tripping over the dead man's body oh wow and it's a well-known phenomenon in that spot whether you know of him dying there or not oh wow it's weird that's weird that's weird because people tripping over nothing without even knowing so you know that you know that it's not like oh I'm just going to pretend yep back during the Civil War according to Legend three Union Soldiers broke into the house and it is known to have been looted quite extensively during the war so Legend said say that the first three Union soldiers that broke into the house were trying to loot it they were in the gentleman's parlor when three Confederate soldiers came in after them and killed all three of them in the gentleman's parlor it's said that when they tried to clean the blood from where those three men fell no matter how many times they cleaned it the spot kept coming back it looks to be you can see very clearly the shape of three men laying closely together in this spot and it said that for over a month they tried to clean that spot and it would return oh wow rumor has it that it's not there all the time but every once in a while that spot will come back and it will remain despite attempts to clean it until it just disappears on its own that's cre another family that lived there was the winter family in 1868 Kate winter who was their three-year-old daughter of the family that lived there was dying of yellow fever or typhoid fever again one of the major diseases that was going around at the time and nothing was working to heal their daughter so in desperation her parents brought in a local voodoo priestess to try and see if she could cure their dying child despite her best attempts she was unable to cure a little Kate and she died oh the family unfortunately blamed the voodoo priestess because of course it was her fault she was the last ditch attempt and because it didn't work it's all her fault that Kate died and they killed her on the spot Kate is very often seen in the bedroom where she died a mischievous child including one account that a caretaker retold about a gentleman who stayed in the room where Kate died he was awakened in the middle of the night and when he opened his eyes to see what was going on he saw a young girl standing over him who very excitedly exclaimed hello and then promptly disappeared and he was so freaked out he had to get up and go talk to some about it right then and so told the caretaker at the time what had happened was explained that it was probably the ghost of young Kate the Priestess is also seen sometimes walking up and down the hallway outside the bedroom so Kate's Father William also passed away in the house a few years after Kate died in 1871 he was living in the house heard a noise outside went out and was shot by a man on Horseback oh [ __ ] went back into the house and climbed the stairs as his wife came running down the stairs to him and he died in her arms on the 17th step oh and people say that on that step if you're standing on that step you can feel the immense sadness and people will also hear him running into the house and up the steps only to stop at the 17th step how many steps are there I don't know but that sounds like a lot I mean most traditional houses have about 10 to 12 steps before there's at least a landing well we're talking about these old um slave plantations which are one of the weirdest things to me because they're absolutely gorgeous buildings and grounds with the shittiest slimiest most disgusting history ever it's the weirdest thing but a lot of these places had those sweeping staircases so I wouldn't be surprised if this front entryway staircase had you know like 150 [ __ ] steps for people to climb up cuz you know after you have your enslaved people do your hair and your makeup and your big fat [ __ ] gown you got to like Walt your ass down these big steps and look impressive right right so [ __ ] anyway so he died on the 17th Step In the Arms of his beloved wife and people still hear his dying Footsteps in 1927 another murder occurred there there was a caretaker staying at the house and it it's disputed whether he died at one of the out buildings of the house or whether he died in the main house itself but he definitely died on the grounds of the plantation and he was killed during a robbery so there's a lot of people that were murdered at this one location and their ghosts all seem to roam the house and people keep getting photographic evidence of them and of course there's always your you know there's always your Tales of doors opening closing items being um moved from one place to another those are nothing super super common and the caretaker will tell you that a lot of people don't stay the night I mean they haven't gone so far as to eliminate checkout as far as I know but people but people staying in some of these very haunted rooms don't stay the whole night because of the activity that happens is so very prevalent I do have to tell you there is no record of an enslaved woman named Chloe being part of the household yeah but that doesn't mean anything though that doesn't mean yeah they didn't necessarily keep great records A and B even great records of their we'll call them staff how about that yeah and if they did kill someone that they were keeping like that it's possible that they would have wiped out any record of her anyway I say they're not going to document that [ __ ] hey I murdered this girl April 23rd 1842 jot that down in the history book yeah exactly and if she had been born on his Plantation odds are even her birth might not have been recorded right so this poor woman could have been wiped out from history but there is no historical record of her also Elizabeth and her two children a son and a daughter not two daughters were the ones that died of yellow fever but they were marked as dying of yellow fever that doesn't necessarily mean that's what they died of they did all die within a very short time of each other so the house has a lot of a sad history to it and it still continues to have hauntings to this day I I was looking through some of the trip advisor and you know some of the other different what's the deal is it is it a privately owned can you go tour this [ __ ] what's going on here both of those are true it is privately owned you can go tour it it is a bed and breakfast you can stay in the house or in one of the um one of the small Cottages that's placed around the house so you can go check it out and and see that they've current they are currently uh definitely catering to the haunted side they are fully embracing the haunted of this place and they're more than happy to tell you all about it and and uh host you if you're going to go do some ghost hunting that seems to be the same with the conjuring house it seems that that you know and that's that's kind of a a theme going on at the moment all these places sorry I'm trying to pack my pipe oh I'm gonna pack a pipe too let's pack together all these places um they see that this is this is the current Trend this is kind of the oh yeah it's super popular you and I want to stay at all the these places I imagine our listeners want to stay at all these places I mean let's be realistic we're not the only paranormal spooky G podcast out no no we're the only ones sh true so you know these a lot of these people they see a way to make money it's kind of like how I look at Salem you know as long as there's uh interest in witches there's money to be made in the witch City same thing with these houses as long as there's interest in paranormal there's money need to be made at these houses rock on with your bad self and honestly places like The Conjuring house can charge as much as they do because as this do it's really H these things are happening enough stuff is happening there whereas like the places that we went to in Salem it was seven bucks or 20 bucks it was a nice tour it was a great tour but I wouldn't say that they were very Paran I wasn't running I wasn't running screaming and crying seeking therapy right we weren't running into ghost everywhere just a few tingles here and there really and that was about it you know you got to kind of look at it as as you look at tarot readers you know are you going to get a tarot reading for $20 or are you going to get a tarot reading for $80 you know you get what you pay for and it's kind of some of these ghosty paranormal experiences are the same you get what you pay for are you going are you going on a guided tour that's 1750 for three hours or are you going to go and pay freaking $1,500 to go to The Conjuring house so you're going to get what you pay for right and obviously do your research because there might be you know these $1,500 places might be complete [ __ ] too you know definitely if people are consistently paying it and consistently seeing things then checkie check out RWS you know and and just like anything if you question it look elsewhere yeah and if there if there's too much like when we ran into the Amityville or there was a there was an asylum I looked into at one point where you if it's just coming up as [ __ ] too much times don't try to force something that's not there if it's just [ __ ] move on remember I was so excited that you finally were going to do a episode on an asylum and come to find out it was a [ __ ] story I was heartbroken I was super excited too but I think that kind of falls into what you're talking about now is that this is very popular and so people want to capitalize on it and I had read this blur basically a very short teaser paragraph about this super haunted Asylum but then when I looked into it that blurb was the only thing that existed that was the only information and even when I checked in with people that was all they could tell me was regurgitate basically the same three sentences and so if it's just not there it's just not there and maybe they're trying to Hype things up to kind of capitalize you know maybe there's a small inkling of Truth and they're just trying to blow it up to capitalize on something that's popular at the moment as long as there internet there will be scammers scammer that's right so do your due diligence and I think both places that we've talked about obviously the the Myrtle Plantation does not charge that much they don't charge as much at all but you know they have so many different stories from everybody that goes there and read reviews that's how you know you know read the reviews and if everybody says that you know wow there's something to this then go pay pay whatever they ask because there might be something to it and you're not going to know if you don't go but like if someone's regurgitating the same three sentences [ __ ] that go to a place that you're going to have some sort of legit experience exactly so that Asylum was part of kind of like the growing Trend but these two places the mles isn't very expensive to stay to it is kind of expensive but they have different accommodations for people and they do have the tours and there is a tour that comes complimentary with your stay but it's one of those places that has so much history to it and I thought it was really interesting speaking of I almost forgot to say one of the families that recently owned it was the Myers family and they owned it like in the 70s and 80s what's it with it the 70s and 80s exactly this is kind of where the Chloe story may have originated because the Meyers family had a family legend that they didn't really talk about about a woman the ghost of a woman that was often seen walking around the plantation and the home in an oldtime dress wearing a green turban and they didn't like to talk about her this isn't something that was known until about 1987 when Francis Meyers took a picture and talked about it and she said she was asleep in a bedroom downstairs and was awakened by a black woman wearing oldtime dress and a green turban and she says this woman was holding a Candlestick in her hand and the whole image was so real to Francis she said that she could see the glow of the candle around this woman oh wow and she was absolutely terrified she started screaming and like reached out to touch this Apparition the woman never moved but just as her hand reached her reached this Apparition it vanished and the woman was gone there are a lot of tales in the Meyers family of seeing this woman and they didn't know who she was and so it wasn't until kind of looked into it that they came up with the story or found the story of Chloe the legend of this mistress or this young woman that the the man of the house used to rape now don't tell me don't tell me that that Edler and Warren were there were they as far as I know they did not go there I don't know but I do know that they again I listed off a bunch of them in the beginning they have been the subject of so many professional ghost teams and they have had very freaky experiences there so the place is definitely haunted whether it's by a woman named Chloe or not we don't know there's also some Legends of an indigenous woman a young Native American Girl that in a lot of recounts is naked for some reason I guess there's a large pond on the property that has a small island with a gazebo well it now has a gazebo on it but this woman has been seen throughout history on that island and I don't know what her story is but uh she is known to protect children and I believe has even saved a young boy from drowning by warning his mother that she needed to check on her child before disappearing uh saying your children will come to no harm here and then disappearing into nothing and the woman was able to get to her young son and save him before he drowned I want to have a pond that has a little island in the middle of it on my property damn it that has a ghost that saves people from drowning very Princess Diana like right so I don't know what her story is I wasn't able to find much information on her but she could be I've done some tours in haunted places and I do know that sometimes the the tour guides might take a little bit of liberal license of creative license with some of their stories and that's why I think we get so many different variations and sometimes these variations are ones that you only hear when you go to the property and they're slightly different from another story that you've heard so the truth is out there somewhere where but I don't know what it is yet reminds me of X Files yeah I kind of did that on purpose it's such a good catchphrase I mean come on the truth is out there somewhere just gota look but you know I I I think that a lot of these houses have something similar in common and I think it's just a lot of grief a lot of death a lot of a lot of unhappiness and that sticks with a place oh that scks the place and some of these people that don't pass on and are kind of stuck in that in between they're stuck where they know and where they know is home and home might be what's now your current home yes and Earth and the land is such a powerful magnet such a powerful attractant of spirit it's that Hearth and Home that we're all so nostalgic for that we all are drawn to it's it's no surprise that people are stuck there and in both of our stories you know mine has the indigenous people that could possibly have been buried there um and desecration of that obviously would cause problems disturbance in the energy of the land yours has all the people that died there that are buried there so much history of unusual death in both places I me how many pieces of land are going to have 10 murders now obviously as a plantation more than likely it had hundreds more murders of enslaved people that they're not talking about yeah yeah yeah so the place is just run red with blood it's just got a history that's shitty so it's it's bound to have these spirits that are restless and are stuck there and unfortunately kind of the history with our country in general a lot of that is prevalent yeah yeah a lot of these older East Coast you know pre 1800 houses you know that's why the East Coast seems to have so many of these hauntings in my opinion so much [ __ ] so much shitty [ __ ] happened there right and you know we kind of brought it on ourselves yeah that's a good point you know we are haunted by the Deeds of our past by the misdeeds of our past and and in a lot of ways we deserve it I guess in some ways we're capitalizing off of it because that's also what we do I don't know the sad thing is is you're absolutely right you're absolutely right and but I think the big thing to remember is we brought this [ __ ] on ourselves yeah so true so true I I I don't know how else to say it but you know you can't go to a new land murder and enslave its original inhabitants desecrate their burial sites their ritual grounds their sites of Warship and expect that [ __ ] to end well you can't enslave people and murder and rape and pillage and expect this [ __ ] to end well right if you do want to go say at the Myrtles Plantation you definitely can they do have places where you can stay at the myrtles but there is also something called the Whitney Plantation that I want to mention and this is one of the if you're going to take a tour of a a Southern plantation that used to have enslaved people at it the the Whitney Plantation is a good one to go to because they actually they're not just going to talk to about mint julips on the porch and beautiful dresses and and the The Veranda and look at this architecture and isn't it just Grand you know they're not going to do that [ __ ] with you they're gonna give you the actual real tour you know the they're going to talk about the enslaved people and how the these houses could not have been built if it wasn't for that and that you know that this very pretty facad housed a very dark and brutal underbelly sinister that's right very Sinister is a very good way to put it Sinister underbelly and so if you do want to go to a plantation and kind of actually get some of the real history I I have heard of the Whitney Plantation and I know they I've heard they do a very good job of that yeah so they're not going to give you the romanticized you know Gone With the Wind version they're going to give you the real version I think that that we both really kind of we we both had a really good go today we both had some good places we had some we had some good Deets and I like that both of them have kind of a history of is it true is it not true and damn it seems to be [ __ ] true yeah and even though you immediately start get pulling getting pulled one way or the other something pops up that whips you back in the other direction right exactly I think we both home runed it today I think we're both winners I think age shell I think we need to go visit both places and then we can decide which one is the scary we'll have to do a ghost tour in both of them we know which one will be cheaper we just need to know which one's most haunted we need to start putting this out to our listeners you know we're gonna we're going to have to get it together here a little bit and start offering uh to to do some uh options for you folks to buy some tarot readings from us because we're going to have to start actually like starting to fund some of these trips so we're going to come up with ways so that you can assist us in roaming all around the country and that's right so many places to explore so many things to do so many ghosts to find I just want to chat with some of these ghosts and be like what the [ __ ] are you terrorizing people for what need what can we do for you what do you need Michelle is going to soothe the Savage ghost got a poltergeist call Shell she'll Cal him the [ __ ] down chill him the F out pretty much there you go all right well so tune in next week on the stoned witches our for episode 53 where maybe shell is getting ghost high and telling them to sit the [ __ ] down and don't be so scary damn it I'll probably have plenty to share because I'll still have some of that 15 grams for 90 bucks left nice but tune in next week at Wednesday at 4:20
