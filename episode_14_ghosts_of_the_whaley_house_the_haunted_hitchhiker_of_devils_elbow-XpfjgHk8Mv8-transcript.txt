I didn't get a lot of sleep my nose is running my head is stuffed I just don't give a [ __ ] you're wearing your squishy bathrobe I am I you don't [ __ ] with a woman who's wearing her squishy bathrobe in the afternoon you just don't it's a bad idea it's witchcraft [Laughter] [Music] hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to the stoned Witches Hour where we smoke lots of weed and try to Spook each other out with scary tales from across the country I'm Leila over here in sunny California and I'm shell over here in drizzly s Massachusetts we are two best friends on literal opposite coast of the country this is episode 14 welcome to episode 14 how are you doing today shell um I'm I'm a little high I'm I'm doing good how are you I'm not as high as I could be but I'm getting there I got something um new today that I actually really really like um not to just kind of like jump into things but I got runs have you ever heard of runs yes yes I did I have I like runs and pink runs oh I didn't know there was a pink runs but very good very good it's very delicious it's a very smooth smoke I like it I like it so that's my that's my treat of the day I'm smoking some runs again store bought is this another high THC for you sh yeah yeah um I will tell you it is let's see this particular batch is 35.77 per. Dam D you know I'm a fan of high numbers you like the big ones that's true can't say I blame you and this one is a hybrid uh so you're kind of getting the Best of Both Worlds with it but you know again you know how I I go on about names when you call it runs and put a little picture of a pineapple and a watermelon and an orange on there I'm expecting a fruity flavor kind of like runs candy but it does not have a fruity flavor much to my dis but I still love it nice very nice they always lie to me with their names they lie to me they do I'm expecting it to taste like runs candy you know if you want that I I would definitely recommend getting some type of you know go going a little more the wax or the butter they very often will put flavored extracts like Tarpin in there so that you do get that actual flavor yeah so I'm smoking some abusive OG flour today because I do like that high THC did you grow this or is this store bought the the abusive is store bought so I'm getting a little tired of my homegrown I I grew a little bit too much of a poor you particular cultivar and so now I like I don't want to keep smoking the Bruce Banner oh like oh are we smoking that Jack hair blueberry again today no what do they call what what do the kids call that nowadays first world problems there you go it's a first first world Stoner problem for sure oha's getting tired of all that weed she's got piled up in the back of her closet I try I try to usually grow smaller batches of multiple cultivars and this time I just got I got a bunch of freebies and so I just grew the hell out of that and and now I have too much and we're in the process of doing all this other stuff so my Garden's in flux right now and yeah anyway it's all is breaking for you overabundance of weed well thank you I appreciate that I I you know I I appreciate a little sympathy during this difficult time tell of our listeners out there if if you think Ila is an [ __ ] for having an overabundance of weed please email us at the stone wi isour at gmail.com and tell her how much of an [ __ ] she is for her overabundance of weed yeah I guess when you have a dozen mason jars full of just two cultivars and you're crying about it that's that's probably not a problem not really a problem first world Stoner problems man exactly but St problems smoking this butter it's a new butter are you mixing that with the flour sometimes uh my husband is actually a cannabis artist and he likes to make bowls and he'll do different types of especially if they've got different colors you know who do the shatter and the butter and the resin you ever see those joints like on Instagram where they got this gorgeous joint it's rolled in ke and it's got the wax wrapped around it and stuff he does that in bowls and he'll do the KE and he'll do the little pieces of shatter or butter and they look really pretty so sometimes yes you can buy those here at the store I'm quite the fan but you know you know what the [ __ ] because here they do it in pre-rolls once you get maybe a little less than halfway down the butter clogs the paper and you basically what I end up doing is I have to clip off clip off some of it and actually smoke the rest it in my bowl but the butter clogs it and pre-rolls and that's kind of a a a little bit of a drawback to putting butter on the flour in a pre-roll I found the same they tend to look better than they smoke but they are nice they are very nice oh you'll get [ __ ] up totally you get smashed but at the bottom end you end up having to snip it off and put it in a pipe because it gets clogged yeah yeah a little too much butter back to First World Stoner problems right so for those of you who maybe don't want quite that much THC you can unwrap those Butters or resins off of that pre-roll before you smoke it and smoke it in something else if that's going to cause a problem for you so little tips and tricks from Shell and Lea it takes to smoke it and get high people just smoke it this is a a new company sticky AF oh it looks like bubble gum it looks like a bubblegum wrapper it tastes like bubble gum it's tastes like watermelon bubblegum so you were saying that if if you want a flavor sometimes these are good to get and I really like their I hate packaging but I guess if you're going to make packaging make it recyclable and fun like this it says um oh [ __ ] yeah oh that's exactly what it says and then check this out so the whole thing has different different words oh that's so cool and what what is that what is that called This is their watermelon butter tastes like watermelon and it does taste like um the last hit I got of it I literally said to to my husband that it tasted like watermelon bubble gum oh my God that's what I'm looking for that is what I'm looking for if you're gonna if it's just gonna taste like weed just call it weed but if you're gonna freaking call it runt make it taste like runs or don't be calling it runs yeah that's all I ask you you know I had to laugh this week I had been in contact with a couple of our listeners and one thing that's kind of a common theme is they're like you know oh you know you and Ila are funny you know you talk about cool [ __ ] and they're like but you know you guys smoke a lot like you're only getting an hour snapshot of our day you think I smoke a lot in that hour I'm talking I can't smoke while I'm talking if you think we're smoking a lot during these recordings spend a Saturday with us we'll your [Music] [Laughter] mind but I'm laughing because because those couple of people both like specifically said they're like you guys smoke a lot I'm like dude you don't you don't even know go camping with us for even know until you've been to an outdoor wedding with us sitting in a circle with 150 of your closest friends and the tent is so Smokey you can barely see the people that you're sitting next to people you're passing I have a I have a bubbler on the ground in front of me a pipe in one hand and a joint in the other and I'm trying to figure out which one goes where it's like what was that game people used to play like we had to pass a spoon or something I don't know but you can't play Hot Potato with weed with us no so many smoking utensils going around at this wedding that you could barely see your neighbor but you know what you know what the best part is is I can distinctly think of at least two weddings that was like that for us right that's not just one it wasn't just one time like that's right remember when remember when we would smoke all night in my apartment and you could it was the same thing like my apartment was just like this big puff Cloud swim through the the the smoke to get to the bathroom that's right people talk about hot boxing a car I'm like amateur Hot Box an apartment yeah yeah or a wedding tent then talk so but yeah so that's what I'm smoking today it's pretty good stuff I'm I had actually tried I went on a road trip the other day and part of the road trip was to go to a haunted house and the other part was to get some famous weed I wanted to try some top Bud flow and why is it famous Seth Rogan okay that's what okay so last episode I had been smoking on Pineapple Express and I mentioned part of the reason I bought it was because it's the flower from Pineapple Express with Seth Rogan which is hilarious check it out folks good movie check it out so I love Seth Rogan I think he's great and I even like his uh do you know he does um Pottery I did not know that yeah he sells he loves vintage ashtrays I guess and he started doing pottery with his wife but anyways he sells those and he also sells his own brand of weed and so I wanted it's called house plant he sells it in three different blends an indicia blend a sativa blend and a hybrid blend and I think there's also vinyl you can get a record with u music to go with each blend now what what makes his so fan freaking T why why do I give a [ __ ] about Seth Rogan's weed as opposed to Johnny down the Block's weed well we were talking before about wanting to smoke Snoop dogs weed which I do I would also like Snoop Dog man right that's Snoop Dog weed I think Seth Rogan is well known for being a big connoisseur of weed so for that reason I'd like to try it and just to see if it is any better because I'm guessing it's probably not um I didn't realize I guess I didn't realize he was like a big weed guy oh huge weed guy huge huge huge he's well known for being stoned he he's right up there with uh I would say he's the modern version of chich Chin chong nice nice yeah so it's a lot it's pretty fun they did have cheich and cheich weed and Chong weed which I didn't because I was specifically going for Seth Rogan weed so maybe next time I'll get some chichin chong weed but the dispensary that that I had gone to was near the wh house in San Diego California which is known as one of well they call themselves the most haunted house in America oh a lot of people say that though a lot lot of people do say that that's very true and this one has some history to go with it it's it's in Oldtown San Diego which is gorgeous when I went there it was in the evening beautiful sunset on the way and this place has lights like Christmas lights Sparkle lights everywhere there was music coming multiple restaurants and cafes and little shops as I found a parking spot which was you know fun in and of itself picture me smoking a joint going around and around and around in a little parking lot waiting for someone to pull out get my little parking spot walk the half block to the whe house and I see uh there are fireworks going on and everything beautiful spot to go to even if you're not going to the wh house but this is a I'm G to share my screen with you sh so you can see some stuff and I'll take you on a little tour oh I love tours right where's Shar screen oh right there in front of my face okay so this is the wh house oh wow here in Oldtown San Diego so it's like in a like a highly populated area this isn't like just off out in the middle of nowhere no at the time it was built uh in 18 I think it was built in 1850 1849 do you see it there yep okay thank you it was built in 1849 and it was built on in the Public Square it was actually built on the site where they did hangings oh Jesus why do they do that why do you build a house on a spot where you hung people and expect that to turn out well I have no idea he had even witnessed several of the hangings that had happened there including the hanging of Yankee Jim Robinson James Robinson sometimes called Yankee Jim was one of the hangings that Thomas Wy witnessed at that square and Yankee Jim Robinson well let me show you the pictures before I get into that so here's the wh house this house has a still a little bit of yard next to it you can see that here it's a brick house it was the first two-story Brick House built in the area oh wow it was meant to be imposing he wanted it to be impressive it was also the site of unlike a regular house it had a courthouse in it it started out as a Grainery but it got rats it was supposed to be a rat proof Grainery and it had too many rats so it it transitioned to a couple different things over the years and and it was a courthouse for a long time so you see that when you first enter the house as the courthouse but like people actually in it though right people actually lived in it while it was a courthouse and it was also a general store at the same time oh so one of the rooms downstairs was a general store and you could get all your your goods there and such they have it all done up with different antiques some from the house originally uh some that are just period antiques that they brought in this is a picture of the dining room and the dining room has an interesting history because there's a little girl ghost that supposedly haunts the dining room and I've heard two separate stories for her in both of the stories a tragic accident occurs and a little four-year-old girl is brought into the dining room where she breathes her last on the dining room table and it's her adorable mischievous spirit that runs around I'll tell you the two different stories here in a minute this is a picture of violet Eloise wh and there's different portraits of the family throughout the house and violet is one of the more tragic stories and her ghost is also said to haunt the house so is it pretty pretty much kind of decorated the way it would have been then yes the whole thing is very much I'm pretty sure the whes are the only family to live there the last wh died there in the in the early 1900s and then after that it very quickly after that became a museum because if that's like their couch like the couch that the whes SAT their asses on I could see how that place would be permeated with their with their according to the guide some of the objects are original to the house but most of them are not I believe this couch is not however this is the couch Violet wh when I tell you her story uh she committed suicide the second floor had a theater in it oh wow and it's a very small room there were 25 of us roughly in the tour and I mean it wasn't full by any means but if you doubled it I would say it was pretty tightly spaced and when it opened it had 150 people in the audience and women were advised not to wear hoop skirts or pett coats because it was so packed in they must have been packed tightly so you're figure in 2550 people tops and they used to actually pack in 150 people correct and it was the first theater in the area back in the day hope they all wore deodorant no none of them do so this is me in the theater in the theater this is one of the bedrooms this is the master bedroom for such a big house I feel like that's a small bedroom there it's actually not that big of a house by today's standards but by standards back then it was considered huge and there were several rooms that we couldn't go into there was like an additional bedroom upstairs and and such like private they they won't let people in right and the theater had been bedrooms back when they had six children living in the house but you know once their children were a little bit older you know they had separate purposes but this is the master bedroom and some people do see apparitions in here and this is the children's bedroom this is the backyard looking to the house and these trees were supposedly the one in the front yard right here was supposedly planted by Violet wayy but the other ones are a little too young so it's only a museum like they don't do like overnight ghost tours or I believe they do sometimes I've seen you know occasionally they'll allow once we get famous I'm sure they'll let us in there to do an overnight because I have seen that some people are allowed to do that but the general public you can go in the daytime it was closed for about two years about a year and a half two years mostly due to covid and they did some Renovations and updates and spruing up at that time and it it just opened in the last couple months so I was really excited to be able to go down there you can do a self-guided tour during the daytime and I do recommend that if you want to take pictures I don't know if you noticed my pictures were kind of orangey the lights are all orange and very low and flickery they they very much give it the atmosphere that you're back in the late 1800 it's it's really great so the daytime tour is nice if you want to take pictures and if you want to take your time in the rooms you can't go in all of the rooms some of them have uh barricades in the doorway but you can certainly see them very well and take lots of pictures the tour at night is nice because you get a a tour guide ours was gouie Julie and she was fabulous knew all the history of the house it was fun going there knowing what I know but you know hearing the stories from someone else and slight differences that I hadn't been able to find in my research was fun to hear um so it was fun having a tour guide the atmosphere was really neat you know you really thought you could see a ghost and I'll tell you my experiences here when we get to the story did I see a ghost or didn't I that's what I want to know so the nighttime is nice because of the tour guide it's a lot of fun to do that the ATM atmosphere is great you certainly do feel like you're going to feel something or see something around any Corner however it's crowded and you don't really get to spend a lot of time I tried to kind of lag back behind the group so that I can get some pictures of the rooms by themselves without people kind difficult to do that very difficult to do that plus you kind of feel like you're holding things up you know a couple times I was like running up to the tour guide being like yep I'm the last one out you know and uh so I felt a little rushed and and I felt a little crowded so maybe do them both it's so $15 during the day I think or 12 or 15 and like $18 at night so it's not very expensive oh that's cheap and don't forget to tip your tour guide they're fabulous gouie Julie I love that name shout out to gly Julie at the at the wh house she did an excellent job so let me get into the story a little bit for you and tell you why this house is called the most haunted house in America what's up with the wh house like why are we supposed to be scared before the Whey house was there it was a Town San Diego was a town and this was a Public Square and it's often where they would hang criminals the most famous of the criminals that was hung there in that square was called Yankee Jim James Robinson he was from Australia and he moved to America and discovered that horse thieving was a great way to make money he did that for a little while until the gold rush in 1849 and then he came out to California and he did find some gold and he couldn't keep it a secret and he told one too many people and a whole bunch of people rushed in and they formed a little town in the area the town itself self burned down about 3 years later in a fire that was set in multiple places and people suspected that Yankee Jim was the arsonist because he was upset that people had come to this secret claim that he thought was his own but they were not able to pin arson on him they were able to discover that he was a thief and they ran him out of town he ended up in San Diego in 1852 and continued his shitty ways was a drunk you know we've heard the story before about some people on this podcast he was kind of a dick he was a drunk and he made no friends and San Diego so he became notorious for being a loud drunk that nobody could trust and he was never caught but he was suspected of quite a bit of petty thievery one night he and some drinking buddies decided to go steal a boat and of course everything went wrong in the middle of this botched boat thievery the authorities catch wind of it track Jim and his buddies down and during the scuffle of trying to capture these guys Jim gets knocked upside the head with a with a quote Rusty sword interesting but sounds it almost sounds like the reports were trying to nicely say that they hated him and so he got roughed up a little more than he might have been otherwise by the authorities this went to trial he was suffering a shitty head injury and to the point where he was feverish Delirious not doing very well his two buddies got a year in jail each and somehow Yankee Jim get the death penalty maybe using himself as a lawyer was one in the long list of bad decisions yeah right so Yankee Jim was set to be hung in the Public Square and the way they did it back then is I'm not sure if it was a tree or a scaffolding I've heard it two different ways and that underneath this scaffolding they would bring a wagon and they would stand the accused on the wagon and loop a rope over the scaffolding and put the Noose around their neck then they would you know smack the horses on the ass and the the wagon would go away and the person would drop break their neck in best case scenarios well this scaffolding was built for the average height of people at the time which I guess the average height of a man in the late 1800s was 5 foot five inches Yankee Jim was 6 foot five and extremely skinny when the wagon pulled away and he dropped his feet touched the ground just a little bit uhuh so his neck didn't break because his feet kind of hit the ground and he was so light that it took him a long time 18 minutes some accounts to die from strangulation that's a long time holy [ __ ] crazy right and this was witnessed by Thomas wayy who lived there at the time I don't know why people would go watch that I don't think I would you know people were pretty pretty brutal back in the day they they that was their entertainment well they didn't have WWE on cable so I guess they had to get that somewhere public hangings public hangings hey so the rumor again was that Thomas wayy was in the crowd and it's possible because he he had been living in San Diego he had moved to San Diego from San Francisco in about 1853 and that's Jim had stolen the boat in late 1852 so it's entirely possible that after the trial and such wh was there and it's rumored that he was oh so they say that the the land is cursed you know again multiple people died there from hanging and they say that it's uh you know the horrific nature of Yankee gimms hanging amongst the others has caused the land to obviously have bad energy issues issues so Thomas whey is a gentleman from New York and he married Anna Eloise Delaney in 1849 and they moved to San Francisco before moving to San Diego in 1853 they made their money selling mining tools I believe to miners up you know the minor 49ers up in the great Gold Rush right right yeah so they had a son in 1854 Francis and in 1856 Thomas built a grand house the wh house on the site of the public hanging Square again the first two-story brick building in the area it was huge mansion by by old standards and he wanted it to be imposing he wanted it to be impressive this is a man who had named his sons after business partners because he just thought that was the done thing and in this house he had built part of it to be a residence and part of it to be Town fixture there was a a general store and what was originally a Grainery eventually became a courthouse interesting yeah so the family lived there for several years and it's rumored that even that family had encounters with the ghost of Yankee Jim Mrs wh is reported to have seen him in the house and Tomas way now did they did they know Yankee Jim prior to his death they didn't know him but they knew of him because again he was kind of a notorious Thief town drunk and the town wasn't very big back then and the the trial was kind of a sensation like the OJ trial not that big of a sensation but yeah kind of so he uh Thomas way has also said to have told people that he heard footsteps upstairs when no one was there and attributed them to the ghost of Yankee Jim Robinson so in about 1858 they moved the store the General Store from the house to another building in the center of town and and around that time tragedy struck the family the store in town burned down to the ground and their son little Thomas Jr 18 months old died of scarlet fever a that's shitty that is shitty his ghost is also reported to be in the house the nursery is the room one of the bedrooms that we could not go in oh bummer but in that room his you can hear a woman weeping and you can hear a child giggling and Little Footsteps like a little kid running through the house like if he's still kind of playing in his room basically he's still playing in his room or sometimes you can hear his mother crying in his doorway little Thomas passed away in 1858 and the family couldn't handle the grief and they packed up and went back to San Francisco for about 10 years an earthquake struck San Francisco in 1868 I mean tragedy just keeps following this family and after that earthquake they decide to come back to the Wy house in San Diego and this time they come back with three more children George Violet and Ken they fix up the house and they lease one of the upstairs bedrooms to of all things an acting troop the Tanner troop and they turned the room into an actual theater and it was the first public theater in the area now I've been in this room and it it's roughly the size of a large master bedroom maybe with one end of it being a literal stage and theater I was there with a tour group of about 25 people and we were sitting on I think there was like five or six benches there and the room was relatively full it you could feel the temperature change once everyone was in there it was a little stuffy and as the tour guide was speaking it it was very stuffy and you could feel it almost felt like it was more oppressive than it needed to be for the amount of people there but at the time of the first play opening night they fit 150 people in the audience holy [ __ ] holy sh [ __ ] now the tour guide said that some people do report being in that room and feeling shortness of breath and I did feel that again one of the things that I felt was that considering it was a cool night and there were 25 only 25 people in this room it it had felt stuffier and more constrictive than it needed to be so maybe I felt a little bit of that there um but they at the time they reportedly told ladies to not wear their hoop skirts or their pet coats when they went to they would fit in there because it was standing room only they literally packed them in so interestingly even that troop was not Without Tragedy 18 days after opening night in the Wailing house The Troop leader Thomas D Tanner died from what mysteriously less than six months later the end of January 1869 the Tanner troop disbanded oh wow when I showed you pictures of the dining room I mentioned that the dining room is haunted by the child a small a small child a small girl and I've heard two separate stories one I found through research that was mult mentioned multiple times and a different one same girl different manner of death from the tour guide in the Whey house and they have a picture of this child and a little box on the wall and I'll tell you what's in the box in just a moment so there was supposedly a Playmate of the whe children Annabella wasburn little four-year-old girl and my research says that she was supposedly playing on the grounds of the house running around with the children playing on the grounds of the house and she ran into a low clothes line that caught her right across the throat oh that's horrible The Story Goes that she this little girl was brought into the house and she died um of strangulation from a crushed throat now supposedly this story is from a former employee so this could have been a story that was told by other tour guides and I did find it mentioned multiple times but no proof of Annabella wasburn now the tour guide last night or the tour guide that I saw in the wh house did mention this child and showed the picture in the dining room but she told a story of a little four-year-old girl that was playing on the grounds and had found a small glass bottle a pretty little glass bottle and it was open and in this glass bottle was a sticky substance just a little bit of it and the little girl stuck her finger into this Sweet Sticky Sticky substance and ate it and unfortunately it was rat poison and the little girl very quickly got sick and again taken into the dining room where she passed away so every time they think somebody's going to die they take him to the dining room well it's the same it's the same story just different manner of death one child gotcha one little girl I'm just not sure if this is entirely made up just to be a fun story which part yeah which part is real or if it's real but regardless there's supposed to be a little girl in that room and multiple people do report uh feeling like a low pant tub or a child trying to hold their hand particularly women will feel that in my group there was there was a group of four teenage girls and maybe they were just jumpy teenage girls but before they even said that one of the girls had kept like wiping her hand at her leg almost like she felt like a you know when you get a fly or something on your leg and you try to you go to wipe it off yeah or if a a dog or a small animal or a small child is coming up to you and you're occupied and you might kind of sh them away a little bit yeah it was almost as if she kept trying to shoe something away there and when the when the tour guide mentioned a small child kind of tugging at your clothing or reaching for your hand she flinched and she and her friends started talking and giggling so I don't know if maybe she was feeling a little tug at her leg before she even knew about the story or not but it certainly looked like it now what about you we're getting there okay so other than the other than the feeling my breathing being a little constricted in the room um hadn't seen or felt anything I was taking tons of pictures and little videos the entire time when we went up the stairwell I did take a a small video and tried to take lots of pictures going up the stairs because in my research I had found that people thought that the the exact location of Yankee Jim's death and The Gallows was in the stairwell and a lot of people report feeling constriction around their throat or short breath or even panicking going up or down the stairs I did not feel any of that and I was sad I wanted to feel something but when we came back downstairs we then went into the Parlor the downstairs parlor and that's uh where they talked about the story of violet wh now Violet and Karin are the two daughters of Thomas and Anna and when Violet was 19 she and her her sister both got married in the wh house on January 5th 1882 Violet married George balachi but two weeks after their Blissful nuptuals he left her leaving a letter and in the letter he said he'd been a big fat [ __ ] liar and he had a horrible past of drinking and gambling and womanizing that he had kept from her and her family and that he didn't deserve her that he was terribly in debt and that he was going to leave for two or three or four years to become a better man and that he'd come back for her big Scandal during the day of course her parents were Furious all sorts of upset everyone in town was whispering talking about how horrible this was and of course it's got to be all her fault Violet who had already been kind of um Melancholy she was known as a Melancholy young woman anyway was devastated by this Scandal and by the love of her life running away on her you blame her no not at all she wanted to wait but her parents said no dude's a scoundrel and a cad and no way what is a cad anyways that's a bad word right an old that's an old timey bad word for bad guy a cad so he's a scoundrel and a cad divorce him so she divorces him and is devastated and of course the whole town all the little gossips in town Can't Let It Go not that she did anything what' she do make the mistake of marrying the wrong guy we've all done it right we've all done it but in back in that day it was all her fault and of course she couldn't shake the Scandal and her depression got even worse so she became kind of a recluse she wanted to leave town her parents wouldn't let her they kind of her stay there I mean why would you do that she she can't get away from the rumors everybody's talking [ __ ] about her nobody's going to marry her now they should have just let her go it's all about saving face I guess so so she basically spent most of her days in the master bedroom and according to the tour guide gouie Julie gouie Julie she' attempted to drown herself in the sistern outside where they pumped water and her father found her and was able to save her but shortly there after on August 18th 1885 Violet found her father's pistol and went out to the ouse locked the door and shot herself in the heart oh Jesus her father again found her dragged her into the house and laid her on the the sofa in The Parlor under the window and unfortunately that's where she died he stayed with her the entire time she did leave a suicide no again what I found in my research was different than what I heard from the tour guide but supposedly this her suicide note was a passage from a poem by Thomas Hood called Bridge of size and it says mad from life's history Swift to death's mystery glad to be hurled anywhere anywhere out of this world oh wow very sad her younger sister Karin Lillian was engaged at the time Violet committed suicide um but because of the scandal of that Karin's fiance broke off the engagement damn yeah after all of these tragedies the family left the house and it stayed empty for decades um Thomas wh died in 1890 in a different house in town Accord apparently uh he died in a fury he was Furious because his children weren't following in his footsteps his wife Anna died in 1905 in 1909 the eldest son Francis decided to fix up the family home and he became an Entertainer with the house as a tourist attraction um and he played guitar and would entertain guests the remaining whes all passed away and most of them passed away in the house peacefully of old age and the youngest child Karen Lillian passed away in the house in 1953 and after that is when it became a museum so they're literally pretty much the only family who lived there correct and they all had would discuss experience of of seeing Yankee Jim of hearing the children they all reported um seeing the the little boy that died there the little girl that died accidentally Violet a lot of people will report feeling um extreme sadness particularly in the master bedroom by the window and some people have taken pictures of her standing you can see from outside some people have taken pictures of the window and you can see a female form standing window and people you you can't go in that room but I guess back when you could people would report feeling um extreme sadness wash over them in that room now also in the Parlor it's separated into like a front formal parlor which is kind of bigger and then there's like an archway and it's the same long room but it's kind of separated into one long part and then a shorter part by an archway and it's the shorter family parlor where Violet is supposed to have died and the archway according to the tour guide Julie ghouly is where the she says that's where the Gallows was and that's and a lot of people will report feeling constriction in their throat uh or feeling Terror standing underneath there there were four people standing underneath that and again I didn't notice anybody say anything the one little boy said that he was really hoping to hear something but nobody saw anything there however standing by that couch and that window is the one place um where I think I might have felt something when I was there I thought someone put their hand on my shoulder and there was one woman who was there she and I were both on our own doing the tour and we would often be the last people in the room taking pictures and a couple times like she had accidentally stepped in my way or I had accidentally stepped in her way so you know we were kind of on a joking friendly terms with each other and um at one point in that room people had kind of started to shuffle out and I felt someone touch my shoulder and I thought it was her and so I turned to be like Oh I'm sorry I'll get out of your way and there was no one there and so that's the only time I thought I was so sure it was her I felt the weight of her hand on my shoulder I turned say I'm sorry and you know oh so sorry I'll get out of your way haha because we had you know again kind of been the last two people and getting in each other's way a little bit and there was no one there I was alone in the room so that was a little weird but other than that oh wow no orbs no Ghosts no sounds but it was a lot of fun again they had the atmosphere going the the lights are all flickery like old timey lanterns the tour guide was excellent amazingly well done really good storytelling so a lot of fun I highly recommend it you're probably not GNA see a ghost but you don't necessarily feel like you saw a ghost I think most people are a little sensitive to energies and to feelings in rooms and I I like to think I'm a little bit sensitive and there were times in the theater again I I did feel a little constricted and I did know that 150 people had been in there and I do have a problem with tight spaces so it's possible that that was psychosomatic but I did feel that kind kind of more constricted than it needed to be feeling right you know so there was a couple little times where I would catch small feelings of eeriness or sadness um in the Parlor it I could distinctly feel and again it I'm a parent so maybe I'm feeling my own emotions of a parent sadness but I could feel that wash of sadness could I have felt some inklings I really wanted to spend more time so maybe a Day Tour would be nice because even though you don't get the atmosphere you can take your time and and with a tour group you have limited time and you're definitely not alone I could only catch a few seconds at a time alone in each room at the end so you don't really get that time to stand and sit and really feel in the space so maybe a daytime tour if you want to do that a nighttime tour for the for the tour guide stories and the atmosphere interesting so it it it definitely worth a visit definitely worth a visit I do think that enough people have experiences while they're on E of the tours that your chances are very high to what extent though yeah right to what extent you might just have a spooky good time it is a very well-preserved house it's a very cool house to go look at to see what life was like at that time and the history of it is very interesting it's tragic it it has all the ups and downs that you expect out of a haunted house so for that storytelling aspect history aspect alone it's definitely worth it worth 18 bucks worth 18 bucks so was a lot of fun to go there we'll have to go visit some more yeah very cool I actually I have I have a couple things I want to point out to you today oh before I get into my story I have a a funny weed story to tell you real quick okay so you know we're always kind of looking around what's in the news what what what's up and coming in the world of marijuana I love Daily Mail I don't know why I don't I I can't explain it but I love Daily Mail I I look at it every single day oh what you find on Daily Mail the article is called here comes the bud here comes the bud now this is the kind of family I need in my life okay bride's brother laces wedding cake with marijuana is video of stoned guests dancing at the reception after eating the magical treat goes viral please tell me please tell me they all knew I believe most of them did um this was most of them I don't know if aun Edna was aware but when her back St that's terrible that's actually not funny that's bad don't dose your relatives unless they ask please so this happened this happened in Santiago Chile and so the bride asked her brother to make her wedding cake whatever that's your first mistake never ask your sibling to do anything for a wedding because you know they're going to do something to get at you or is that just my siblings no this is what she wanted so she wanted a seven layer wedding cake and asked him to make one of the layers a magical brownie tear so here's his instruction my kind of wedding cake dear brother I want a seven layer cake I want one of those layers laced with weed the rest of the layers I want fine so brother translates that to lace the whole thing oh I see what happened so they knew they were getting some THC they just thought it was going to be in one layer and he did it in the whole thing but good boy good boy like any good brother would do he did make a smaller second cake specifically for children well at least he was responsible there right it did say that the guests were made aware before the cake was cut um and that the laced cake was kept away from children that's fantastic they have over a hundred guest and and and the the family says that the greatest reaction was from the aunt who complained of ailing back pain before the treat kicked in and after it kicked in she was ready to hit the Dance Floor hell yeah auntie I guess this a video from the reception has made it to tick tock and like this thing's gone viral on Tik Tok I have got to look this up and it said it left all the guests high as a kite he said he spent 20 hours making and decorating the cake it was worth it I bet that's fantastic fan [ __ ] tastic oh my gosh talk about just imagine just imagine how hysterical how h irle if your whole wedding reception was high as [ __ ] high as [ __ ] kit oh wow guess what he did baked I guess he used butter butter with teas so he you know he made Edibles before so he knew what he was doing and he also uh made like a chocolate ganache with yeah that sounds Del butter but they did point out in the article that none the guests were drugged against their will and everyone was told about the Cake's special ingredient so it's not like this this was telling anybody right yeah that's the only thing I was worried about yeah this was not against anybody's will or anything it was all in good fun that's awesome that's awesome that's the type of brother we all need on wedding day just want to point that out do you remember did you ever watch that show bong yeah I did yeah a great show where they cooked with it was a show where a guy would a couple people would have people over from a food perspective and they would add cannabis to it in different ways it was a great show it was on Vice I think I really liked that show maybe that dude should appear on an episode of bong Appetit or I think the new one is cooking on high right on Netflix cooking on high I haven't seen that one I haven't seen that one yet either but I really did love bong epti so I'm gonna try cooking on high once the Food Network comes up with they're thinking about chopped 420 or something that would be funny yeah right then you know it's gone mainstream but maybe they will once cannabis is legal because I I know we were just talking about this the other day sh when the feds came out and said that they're going to actually make cannabis legal the House of Representative is going to vote to federally legalize marijuana just for the second time in history and hopefully this time it'll pass next week it'll probably already have half by the time this comes out so fingers crossed people you know unfortunately and this is may be in Debbie Downer American here the only reason they're considering making it Federal at this point is because we're in an economic crisis and they see dollar dollas quite possibly that is quite possible you know it's always been about dollar we weed will save the world like we've always said it really will I think it really will help a lot it does help economies um you know if they do it right and this particular ular Bill if it does pass it's not going to make weed legal right away right you're not going to be able to mail it to me yet no no doesn't make it automatically legal what it will do though is states can then make their own rules any state that has laws on the books where it's legal it's now federally legal and so Banks can now take payments you can you'll be able to use your credit card it it doesn't have to be used it doesn't have to be used like an ATM transaction where you get dinged in ATM fee it can now be used as a retail transaction yes and the retail stores won't have to transport huge amounts of cash because they'll be able to bank like regular businesses so cannabis right now is currently a schedule one drug like heroin and opium which basically so [ __ ] stupid so stupid honestly the only reason it was put there literally is racism but entirely different podcast once they take it off that schedule one um no scientific basis for that but once take it off no scientific basis for putting it on schedule one and once they take it off of that then banks will be able to do stuff shops can take credit card payments they're going to expunge prior convictions which is fantastic you know they really need to fix some of the shitty things that prohibition has caused um it'll also make it easier for people to get loans we'll finally be able to get that loan for that big farm store we want to open sh right that'd be awesome right I think that'll be pretty cool so sending lots of energy out to the universe that uh that this passes and they're able to take it off schedule one I'd really like to see that in my lifetime oh the more act it's the more act you know two two quick things I wanted to Circle back to before I get into my little spook Spooktacular story you had talked about um you had talked about Joe Rogan and his celebrity Seth Rogan Jo Joe Rogan's the podcaster dude very controversial Seth Rogan is the funny guy makes great movies smokes awesome weed oh makes Pottery too which is pretty cool that's where my confusion has lied okay now I realize they're two separate people you've been getting Seth Rogan and Joe Rogan confused yeah oh sh oh sh because I'm like wow you've been smoking two high thc's I think

gosh we we fan girl you should just see me like I literally squeal like a kid and I I get all excited and it just makes my whole week so yes please send us fan mail we like that we do I want to start out my little ghosty story with a shout out to Leslie hey Leslie Leslie had asked a while back for us to talk about a little old place in Upstate New York Devil's elbow in iGo New York I remember this request Devil's elbow now I'm familiar with a Wego we know that area we know a Wego well like we have been so high in a Wego so many times I can't even remember because I was too high but I never knew this story which is so weird I'd never heard of it either what's the devil's elbow shell I'm going to settle in with a bong tell me all about it I actually lived in a Wego for like a year and didn't even know this so the devil's elbow the best way I can explain it to I mean I can explain it to you listeners out there aren't G to have a clue what the [ __ ] I'm talking about but but the devil's elbow is on what you and I know is old rot 17c in aigo okay so like one of those old County routs kind of winds through town it's a major road but it's like a two lane major road out in [ __ ] New York it's like what used to be the main road before they built an even better main road I think the way my mom describes it is um they were like the pre highways yeah those were the main the main ways to get here and there and everywhere before bus all right right right so main drag for for your own personal perspective Leila this is in the vicinity of if you took 17c through a iGo and we're starting to go out to the other side of a weo okay out where it starts to become Farmland mostly right right right I guess this has been going around for literally a hundred years this is crazy what I've heard ultimately and then there's a lot of different versions that kind of gone throughout time and and and different people see different things kind of but the ultimate root of this is there is a woman in white along this stretch of road oh nice another woman in white haunting I love that Legend it's a that's one of those interesting persistent hauntings that seems to occur all over the country every state has one kind of thing episode one Texas check it out um so so this particular this particular you know Devil's elbow you can kind of in your mind imagine it's basically like a sharp curve in the road okay I think I know exactly the turn you're talking about it's it's actually located between iGo and tyoga center and it runs along a steep Cliff overlooking the Susana River kind of near the intersection of Route 17 and Skyline Road to give you personal perspective the listeners are going to be like he they can Google it Google Maps is a thing it is it is so this actually started kind of the Rumblings of this ghost story started in the 1800s Leslie growing up hearing this is like it seems like just kind of town lore because this this story has been going around since the 1800s many people have claimed that a woman dressed in all white was seen hitchhiking along the side of the road people would stop and look for her and she would vanish Without a Trace kind of like the typical lady and white on the white hitchhiker story that's fantastic I did not I didn't know that iGo was home to that urban legend as well how cool and the theory is is that the lady in white would ask drivers to stop at the bottom of the hill for a ride so who is this lady there's there's a couple theories um a couple versions on who the lady in white is some say that the lady was murdered but a lot of Legends try to pin it back to Mur murder even when it wasn't necessarily the case yeah murder or accident seem to be the two biggest themes with the lady in white hitchhiker stories but stories vary on exactly what happened but people have narrowed it down to they believe that one of two possible versions of of how she died so version one is that she was killed by a drunken p uh a drunken patron of the tavern located near Devil's elbow okay yeah don't drink and drive another version was that she and her husband were both killed by the tavern's owner because the owner stole their cow and killed them instead of giving their cow back what that's such a [ __ ] a Wego thing and they confront the bar owner over stealing their cow and he shoots them he kills them instead of giving the cow back he's like I'm keeping the cow lose you like I I'm not banging on anybody who's from aigo we love aigo such a cute town I love a very quain historic town it's really cute I think that jail is haunted I saw a ghost in the jail they turned that jail into like a restaurant and apartments and I saw a ghost there different story yes different story but yeah no the we the iGo jail is definitely haunted absolutely without a doubt um but yeah so the owners stole their cow and killed them instead of giving the cow back Jesus why would that easier how is that easier I don't why would you think getting rid of two bodies is easier than just giving them back their freaking cow oh my goodness you know I think it's a pride thing I think he didn't want to admit that he took the cow he was like embarrassed of his actions I guess so that's some some extreme embarrassment right there so he thought murder was the only way out but either way in 1932 a fractured skull was found nearby and it was strongly believed that that skull belonged to the lady in white no hey and to go back to our people getting killed by axes Axe Murder episode check it out if uh what was that episode two or three or four I don't know I'll add it in later velisa Axe Murder episode five I think if that's not it Leila future Lila add it in here but so they believed that she could have potentially been killed by an axe or a board to the head which kind of follows along the whole Tavern owner killing him right so they think it was either an axe or a board to the Head was it a man's skull or a woman's skull see they just say that the one that that the skull they found was strongly believed to be the lady and wh so I'm guessing a lady skull yeah you they can tell I think they can tell if it's a you know probably a female skull or a male skull that's why but you know what what but you know what oh there's more ever since they found that skull appearances of the lady in white have slowed down not gone away but weren but but slowed down like almost like that ghost who wants to be found like they want people to figure it out and now that they've found her bones she's feeling more at peace oh my good not gone away but just slowed down you know they always say so is the lady in white real well only the Shadows know for sure but in the late in the later 1900s teenagers were known to try and pull pranks in the area including this is such an Upstate New York thing including hanging white dresses at the base of the hill in the trees that would be so freaky can you imagine you're tooling along in your big old old old mobile or whatever in like the 1970s and you see like the ghostly white thing in the trees and you know the legend oh my God so scary for all you folks out there who are not aware of this fun fact toid um Rod sirling we all know who Rod sirling is Twilight Zone Twilight Zone he was born and raised in the greater bingamon New York area which by the way for those of you who don't know where a Wego is where this this Devil's elbow is it's kind of right outside of Bingington New York so Rod Sterling Rod Sterling was from Binghamton and he actually wrote about the lady in white in an episode of The Twilight Zone really what episode it didn't tell me oh [ __ ] I will I I I definitely will Google dude yeah let see I was going to say I would definitely find that out because that's interesting but yeah um an episode of Twilight Zone was based on the the lady in white in Upstate New York in Binghamton New York there's a public access channel on TV everybody has Public Access those used to be so fun in the we hours in the morning just to get stoned and watch whatever crazy [ __ ] people had decided to record and put up there that was the best can I just tell you though that's for Teletubbies started was on public access so I don't know about that like I said whatever crazy [ __ ] people had decided to put up there people have have done news stories recently about devil Zelo one story and and you know how I said they weren't quite sure they they couldn't necessarily like pin down how she died exactly right here a Blow To The Head from a an angry thieving bar owner now those two stories were kind of the 1800s version of how she died now there's like 1900's versions of how she died oh it's been updated lady in white 2.0 yeah pretty much some people say that it was a newlywed couple driving through the fog ridden stretch um of Devil's elbow Hill Road it is a sharp like I said yeah which like I said is now 17c and back then the slope of Road climbed sharply upward and then steeply down again and part one of the one of the versions say that the new Leeds didn't see headlights from an oncoming truck um and were hit bride bride died instantly crushed in the wreckage and the groom was thrown from the car uh and died like in the brush a little bit of ways they also say that his body was never found so maybe the Restless Spirit was she wanted her fiance's body to be found and when they found that skull you know what I mean so I don't know if it was hers or his bones they found but I could see it by was Restless because either one yeah right interesting again how in episode one when we talked about the lady in white haunting it in um Crystal Lake in Texas there were multiple different versions of how the legend could have started there was a lot of different ways all of which could have been true or all of which could have been fake but so many different ways that this lady in white story could have started and it's interesting to see here whether version 1.0 or 2.0 of the devil's elbow Lady Lady in White that there are again multiple different things um all of which could have happened there I mean they they call her interesting they lot of stories in one place they say she could be a new bride other stories say it was a girl on the way to prom other stories say it was like an ill- fated hitchhiker I think the reason people do that is they update the story based on the time period right yeah the 2.0 story now has things like prom and and cars and hitchhiking in it a a prom dress and a wedding dress very similar B Victorian era Garb that's how they dressed back then you could call it a prom dress today and it was like what you were on a Tuesday back then oh good point it's kind of like the alien sightings people see something they can't explain like a woman in white and your mind fills in the details and it's going to fill it in based on what you know if it's the 1800s it's a woman in a wedding in Victorian arar if it's if it's the the 1970s it could be a girl going to prom or a woman on her wedding day you're going to fill in the blanks with what you know interesting so I think it's more that than people telling all different kinds of stories I just think seeing a lady in white and they're making a a legend to to kind of try and explain why we're seeing a lady white the only thing we really know is that a skull with a fracture in it was found near that spot right so so you know there's there's a lot of that's wild you know what's crazy and fantastic God so people like that's obviously I mean you know that road it's it's a pretty well-traveled road yeah people have seen her and stopped and offered her a ride you said that people stop to try and help her or try to find her and they can't find her they're still doing that they're still doing that and so of these people some of these people that did you stop and try to pick up the lady in white and not find her email us Leslie let us know she isn't gonna after she hears this story um so you know the type in that area a lot of farmers about a lot of big Burly country guys yeah like this man who was in his 50s um they said he was a construction worker which we know the iGo construction worker type oh felt bad saw the woman um kind of going dark so you know evening not quite nighttime yet but not really daytime anymore like that that being shiv wants to make sure she's gonna be safe right right so you know he feels bad and he pulls over and you know hey you want to ride and she's like oh yeah please I only need to go a couple of miles she gets in and he figures you know I can take her a couple miles down the road no biggie she gets in shuts the door and then he starts to drive again about 45 seconds to a minute passes and the man looks over to the passenger seat to say something to her and there's nobody there oh yes yes the legend has come full circle I love it but like he actually like he had a conversation she got in the car and just said she only had to go a couple of miles and then we over gun there and this is one of those salt of the earth No Nonsense you know I believe in guns God and America kind of people yes yes and he's not believing in a ghost for nothing wow oh wow these are people that don't believe this [ __ ] that are having these experiences that's fun oh wow how fun that's amazing and then now now there's some there's some variations to the story because apparently a lot of people over the last few decades have experienced similar things picking up a hitchhiker and then when they look over there's nobody there but some stories go that she leaves behind a white flower or a different white object is proof of her spectral visit oh interesting that's a new twist yeah yeah so the other ones just leave like a puddle I guess she can potentially leave something white now the only physical clue hinting as to how the devil's elbow Ghost came came to be happened in 1932 and what happened was uh what you call it railroad choo choo train I was couldn't think of it for a second the railroad came through the railroad came through and there was a steam engine guy a conductor actually the railroad conductor um for some reason and you know I hate how like Society has done this to people he had more clout than a lot of people just because he was like a railroad conductor I don't know why that matters I don't know I mean dudes like the railroad conductor come on all little kids show them a railroad conductor on a choo choo train and they go nuts anyway it's like primordial so a steam shovel operator helping uh to eliminate the Eerie Railroad Crossing near that area you know the the Eerie lines uh for the railroad system go through that area the Southern Tier of New York they uh separate and apart from the you know I told you they found a skull in 1932 yeah separate and apart from that another skull was discovered in that area of a young woman believed to be in her 20s it was found at the West End of what's now present day Glenn Mary Drive which would have actually back in that back in the back when the story was happening it would have been uh considered the bottom of Devil's elbow Hill interesting just today present day it's Glenn Mary Drive um the County coroner examined the woman's skull and they said it was about 100 years old and the prevailing theory was that she could have been murdered with an axe or a long flat board they were never able to identify the remains other than knowing that they were about a hundred years old and historical records in tyoga County New York have pointed towards the woman her killing actually taking place near a uh Tavern called the Broadhead Tavern no no way and it operated in in that vicinity in the early 1800s so basically they they like almost like the science behind kind of corroborated one of the Legends it did corroborate one of the legends that basically the tavern owner [ __ ] her [ __ ] up but in 1925 That Old Tavern was torn down and a rust stop was constructed in that area so if you're on 17 yeah between iGo and tooga Center that rest stop is where the tavern was wow oh my goodness and where that poor girl was murdered yeah yeah wow you know it it basically no matter which way you kind of look at it the story kind of is linked to a woman suffering from violence against or involving a female yeah oh my goodness but you know this is definitely not you know Legends of ladies in white or whatever you know Legends over the country I love it not only all over the country but you can find those Legends as far back to the 15th and 17th century in Europe so aigo is just another place that has a similar story you know what I mean interesting that they've got that that urban legend is just so prevalent everywhere but they basically think that sh that that her spirit her her spiritual self has clung to the location of her death and people have been seeing her for decades centuries over a hundred years over a hundred years I mean now because it's I mean we're looking at 2022 so we're probably pushing 150 to 200 years now I mean because they're talking early 1800s while we're in the early 2000s wow U actually if you go on YouTube uh wskg which is the local public access Channel um they actually did a stories and have YouTube videos about Devil's elbow and iGo so definitely interesting uh definitely worth checking it out PBS you can go to PBS.org and PBS has a couple videos about the devil's elbow and ego and I can find the Twilight Zone episode if I can figure out which one it is I'll link it in the show notes absolutely because how cool would that be to find I didn't even realize that until I was looking obviously into the story I didn't realize that rod Sterling had done you know they always say that a lot of The Twilight Zone was based on stuff that happened in or near Binghamton New York well if you've ever been there or lived there you know it is like the unho it is the Unholy Vortex I can see why he used his experiences there to write a super creepy show yeah no offense Bingington you like The Twilight Zone move to Bingington that's your day that's your life every day all day there you go so so yeah I was kind of surprised that that episode was done so if you do find that definitely tag it in the notes so that not only myself but other folks can check it out yeah no matter what version of the story you want to follow it all comes back to there is a woman on that road who isn't going away she might not be her story is so sad yeah she might not be seen every day like back in the the mid to late 1800s because you know they did like I said they did say that the activity slowed after the were found but she's still there and she's still looking for a ride and she's still looking to get away from Devil's elbow oh she's just trying to get away as much as she tries to get a ride that's where she is yeah people try to help her and they just can't she just disappears leaving a white token behind so Leslie Leslie thank you for having me look into that story it makes me actually want to go to a Wego and check out 17c on a dark foggy night you go we'll have to do it thank you so much for the suggestion anybody who have a local legend or ghost story that you want us to check out or explore send it on over we'll take a look let us know for sure wow definitely spooky stories this evening I don't know who's was creepy or the wh house was pretty creepy and fun yours is super spooky and and such a such a Common Thread such a common theme I think that's really interesting is it is it one of those Arch types that we just can't get away from does this type of thing just happen in so many places well I think what makes mine I feel a little more spooky there's a sense of when you know the place and location it creates this more sense of spooky reality so like we know where Devil's elbow is so that makes it more intriguing yeah but I went to the wh house whereas I haven't been to the wh house you've been to the wh house that's true I have pictures yeah well I haven't so for me I feel that the devil's elbow is spookier because it's something I've personally familiar with right that's a place we both know and have actually been to and can picture whereas the wh house since you know I'm so lucky I lucky enough to be able to go there as part of my research it was pretty cool so yeah I guess I don't know both of them have such a a large amount of people that see something there so I think we're pretty close this week and not not even just at one time over the span of decades or even a hundred or more years it's not whether it be the wh house or Devil's elbow these aren't experiences that one person or one family is having this is Generation after generation after generation are having these experiences yeah even people that didn't know the legend formerly are still having that similar type of experience there which is what makes some of these so fascinating to me with my story the details just get updated with the current century you know is it a prom dress is it a wedding dress is it a Victorian everyday dress you know I love that and and just interesting to see that that kind of repeated itself so much so shout out to aigo New York good story a Wego we'll be back soon to check out Devil's elbow in person oh and shout out to Alex thanks for your well wishes and comments about the show we really
