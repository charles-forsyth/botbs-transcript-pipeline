guide to runes an essential reference for run lore meanings divination and Magic so welcome Wayne and thank you for being here hey thank you for having me yes so tell us a little bit about yourself Wayne and how you got into runes oh okay uh well uh again Wayne Brey is the name and uh yeah nobody can it's hard but it's interesting because the last name kind of came into play when I started like late after I started runes in a weird way but um yeah I started reading runes about six years ago maybe maybe more I've been into runes and Norse mythology and everything since high school so since like 83 82 883 taking classes in my high school about Norse mythology which I thought was very strange they had medieval history they had Greek history and they had North mythology and took them off that's cool though those sound like great inspiring yeah it was very inspiring and I really enjoyed it and so I kept that throughout my life of course I got into Dungeons and Dragons in high school back then and uh really took to like I was an artist so I like to draw so I really took to things like the door the tolken runes and I was fascinated with the Elven language and I really liked all that so through high school doing all that you know and I was raised uh actually at 15 I became a Buddhist so I was Buddhist still I mean it's a philosophy so I incorporate that into my spiritual work but yeah I had that going on and so I was very accustomed to different cultures and I really uh I was digging into it um then I went to the military As A Firefighter in Alaska for five years and up there I still maintained uh my interest in everything really all through that I did didn't really practice Rune reading or anything just until about like I said about six years ago go and it was uh because of everything that i' had been in uh not only that in fantasy gaming and all but I was still really very interested in the Norse mythology and I had realized that um my great-grandfather came to America from Norway and that there's a town called Brey by the sonum F and I know I was like wait what okay this is strange so a lot of things started leading up to this journey into runes and I went into the next millennium bookstore this this bookstore we have right up the street and I I've been in there before several times and for some reason this time was the right time I ended up getting a room book I saw runes I thought that looks like token runes what are these and it was the the runes by Lisa pel or yeah pesel I opened that up and I started reading this book and going through it and for some reason I was felt like I was struck by lightning I I I I I kind of got an really good already idea of what they were about I was fascinated by it and had this weird calling for the first time really because you know kind of a jack of all trades and I was like I don't know what I'm doing with my life but I had this weird calling to kind of help people and and I went up and they had Rune sets and I bought a rune set and now I had a book and I had a rune set and that was it I I just got so into it that I was I was just all I was all in so much so that after a few months I had another person that was owns another metaphysical bookstore in rock rocks and crystals and she is also a psychic medium and she kept pushing me she's like you should teach classes I'm like I I'm not going to teach classes I I haven't done this long enough and I she like no you're ready you should do teach classes on this it's going to help you read for other people and I was like wait reading for other people was also not really on my playbook and then it all just kind of worked out and from then on I was actually hooked up with the next millennium bookstore I always wanted to be on the other side of the table every time I went there to get readings because they have readers every day and then I found myself on the other side of the table so that was really gratifying and starting to read rooms for people and it just really worked the classes were great and I started reading and I was just blown away with how accurate the things were and with the lessons I was personally learning from reading for other people and then I yeah then I started working there just because I wanted to start helping people in the store so I didn't know how much I got paid or when I got paid I I just showed up you're just like I love it here I have a quick question Wayne you said that bought your first Rune set I am I am more familiar with tarot as a divinator yeah and there's this you know Superstition I guess is the best word to call it that says you should not buy your first Tarot deck it should be gifted to you is there any weird Superstition before I go to for that's complete bunk by the way you don't have to be it's just it's just one of those B it's not true it's not true at all but is there any sort of like weird Superstition true or false and as far as obtaining your first Rune set well that that is out there and that is something that I try and teach people through my podcast and consultation uh about what Rune weaving is and it is weaving other everything into your spiritual practice with runes being the Forefront um no I don't I I make runes and I sell them so I hope people want to buy them and the thing is is that um purchased runes I think are are just fine to have as a first Rune set to me if you want to stick with that tradition then you should be the one going out and gifting tarot decks and Rune sets to people if that's the way you feel I I totally behind that but I also feel like if you I was called to this set and there was nobody stopping me from picking it up I wasn't going to go I didn't know anybody in fact to this day I didn't know anybody that did runes I I know now maybe two other two three other people I've been in it more over the years but I don't know many other Rune readers nobody else in town that does it as often as I do and I don't know anybody that's had had a rune reading 90% of my 9 well 90% of my clientele have never had a run reading before and they they still get one from me and so I'm like when it comes down to those kinds of things people say that you're supposed to make your own you're supposed to uh carve them and you're supposed to do them out of a certain type of wood and then you're supposed to you know some people say you should bloody them otherwise if you purchase them they're worth nothing and I don't want to live in their world I live in my own real my own reality which dictates I buy what I want and I in tune those things and that's why I say in my book runes are just tools runes are tools you're the magic runes are only pieces of wood plastic whatever you you make them out of and what makes them magical is the intention that you as a rune reader puts into them each and every time you pull them out of the bag because they're that versatile I write runes on my hands I carry runes with me I'm make bind runes so to me that kind of weird sacred thing tradition or or or belief that people say they're not of any use is just showing that you're not that good with them then if that's the case you're speaking directly to my nerdy witchy heart here because I too found runes very very similarly back in the 80s playing Dungeons and Dragons reading tolken and I didn't know about witchcraft it was not as prevalent then as it is today I knew about Norse mythology Greek mythology Celtic mythology and and those types of things called to me similar to the way runes kind of felt good to you then as you know as I got older and discovered Witchcraft and went into runes I originally used it as a a written language to me it was more something to write spells in to keep it kind of secret or to to use it intentionally because as you talked about bind runes and sigils the act of writing or creating one the whole process of paying attention to creating that is part of the magic and setting the intention and so that's really where I got wrapped up into runes rather than divination like you said runes are a language but they're also a divination tool so can you you speak to that a little bit like what the history of it is and how people can use it as a divination tool yes runes initially were were they were an alphabet they still are uh younger fuar the Elder fuar and by fuark I mean the it's like an anagram of the first letters of the alphabet of either the younger or the Elder and then there there's multiple sets of runes and they have been around for just thousands of years people tend to consider runes as a Norse or Nordic or Scandinavian German Danish kind of thing but in fact they had traveled all around the world for Millennia before they even settled there and were used so they were used in many different connotations I'm sure they were changed and then what happens is you you can take that alphabet and what people have done is that each letter you might say or each sigil has an association so the association is what brings in all that intention and to me the association is what brings in uh ties together the gods the mythology and whatnot and the reason why you can use them as a divination tool is that when they being able to read them it's not just what that symbol is and the meaning the general meaning of the symbol it's how they relate to the other runes that are beside them and also taking into mythology if if something is an Odin Rune like like anus Rune of communication of all forms and if that is an is a rune related to Odin and it's about communication well then you have like hugan moonin you have well then you can start to think about well what is it telling me about knowledge wisdom listening books smarts versus Street smarts when do I need to learn more when do I need to pay attention when do I need to help and and listen even more uh so each Rune has a connotation like that it has a relationship to a god to a to a certain thing whether it is a a rune of healing protection because multiple runes are protective but you can tell the story in the each room thoras Thor's hammer The Thorn I mean when that comes up think about what Thor is I mean Thor is very gregarious but he's he'll he'll be the one that that will uh stand up to the Giants and it's not a war god he's not he was never a war God but he was the one that will help plow your fields we drink with you in the tavern and then we'll go and defend your village so it's a it's a rune of defense and when you start looking weaving in the mythologies of that and trying to think you know it opens up what the runes truly mean and a lot of people have their own versions of what each Rune and you should have kind of it'll open up for you as you go and you'll start to put in your own meanings I've had people sit down front of me and I've been doing runes for a while and all of a sudden something comes up and I and I was like wait that just changes the meaning of this room in a mind-blowing way so and then I keep it so it also evolves as you go you can write things with it that's why you like you said use it to write spells with which I do as well uh you and it's just that versatile so when you take that down you put intention into saying all right I mean that's why people can read bones right yes each object or artifact has a you you put an association with it so you can cast runes and and put associations with them and as you pull them down and you read them a story you get your divination if you ask for the connection and my divination I usually say I don't consider myself a psychic medium because I don't want to see your grandma behind you like I would I just like for you to let your people come in and my people talk to your people and that's when we get our consultation I love that and there's definitely like you said the runes themselves may not necessarily be it's just a tool the intuition the energy really comes from you I I like how you said that when you you know when you do a divination with the runes it might have something new for you like it might lay a certain way or or in correspondence with a different Rune or just the energy that you're reading that time could be different each time and you have to be kind of open to that and able to be a little bit flexible I think sometimes with that especially when explaining it I think the correlation between runes and Tarot that I think that's where it's making sense to me because I only ever used runes more as like sigil work but I can see such similar ities with tarot that I I definitely am getting it and don't you think that if you allow yourself to be open to the person's energy and to the person's people that are there that uh sometimes depending on their situation and what they're talking to you about that those tarot cards it'll expand it's not they're just not static this means a this means B no matter what uh that's the beauty of of any divination method I I believe too but you know for example I I did a uh I was one Rune that changed I remember what happened it was at a Mystic Fest that we had in and gefu it's it's just an X it looks like an X the gift Rune and I always thought well that's a good Rune you bring that up wow you got it's no you can't reverse this Rune so it's like it must be very good R you're going to get something or or maybe you've been gifted something or maybe you are are are you know it's about giving and receiving so learning how to accept and receive and then my wife said something to me that kind of opened it she says you know having issues with possibly um you know with self-esteem and like she's like sometimes some people just like even give me a compliment like for a second I just go you know you kind of blow them off and think they're lying you know and you just kind of blow it off and that hurt my feelings for one I was like oh no that's sad and but a lot of people have that I felt the same way I was like wait a minute I do that too it's uncomfortable sometimes when somebody gives you a compliment so if that's uncomfortable what about what's happening with everybody everything else in your life that has to do about you receiving sometimes we give give give but it's that receiving you can't even take a compliment without you just brushing it off yourself you did it you brushed it right off because you didn't feel you were worthy enough and so after that I started telling people more about that when gefu comes up maybe look into this are you allowing yourself to just accept other people's generosity and other people's love and other people's compliments no matter what you think they mean I I love that there's never an end to how they kind of tell a story and how that opens up whether it be for different people you're reading or for you it's just kind of the more you use it the more you can you're still delving yep beautiful thing is too is you like you know when we talk about the versatility of runes there's so many different ways to use them if you're not busy reading for people so I did love in your book how after each one of the runes you did have different correspondences for them and kind of of like shell said it very much opened my mind to them to look at them in a different way and I I tend to use them as a just as a language or as sigils you know they like you said they they mean certain things oala is one of my favorites it's the the ancestors The Hearth and Home you know that that whole feeling of belonging and being there I like that Rune so that's something that I'll use as like you mentioned as a Sigil um now you mentioned the word bind runes is that different than a Sigil or is that the same as well I think you can incorporate bind ringes into sigils so a Sigil can also be decorative and a Sigil can be can incorporate other symbology as well to me it could it could have protective symbols and a bind Rune it could also have elemental symbols it could have other personal symbols that you put with it to me that's more of a maybe yeah yeah I think it's a it just incorporates them and people have different views about that bind runes are actually just a combination of runes you can take up to you know three four runes you can write your name out in but I usually like to tr to take about start with a good three runes what am I doing and somebody they asked me to to do these for people as well they'll ask me and I'll say okay well what are you doing and they're like well I'm going on a trip we never have a good time on a trip I really want this to be better can you make something for everybody in the in going on this trip so I'd make a bind run I bless them and consecrate them and there's you know way to do that but it would be a thing with you start with the raid hole the travel Rune and then maybe you want to add in some happiness oh so perro you know so I would I would make sure per is in there which really is a nice easy way to put that in there with that with r ho because it's already in there in that Rune and now you start to see other runes that come out of those that run those intentions you say well also I want them to have a safe journey so I will putala in there so and now you have a bind r that has it all but you'll be able to see multip runes they'll be Zeus would be in that so communication naturally will come from that which will bring them joy and a happier trip and tier tias is in that naturally too he's the the god of strategy because he's a war God but to me it's all about strategy making a proper plan for victory and so there's so many creative ways that you can create bind runes for yourself and for others oh so what it sounds to me so I can explain it just a little bit for our list it's very similar to some of the ways to create sigils in which case you say you're taking three runes that you have chosen ahead of time that you feel applies to you know whatever it the working is and so you'll start by writing the one Rune and then you'll look at that Rune and see how the next Rune that you have chosen you can draw it with an adjac or on top of that other Rune is that correct and then continue to add the third Rune and as you're doing this just like when you you draw a Sigil through letters or symbols and you're adding them together you're using your intuition and your own magical energy to see the other runes inside of that and where they might fit energetically and aesthetically to make a bind R is that correct y that's it I love that I I'm very much I like sigils I like chaos magic I love symbols and symbology so that's something that speaks to me very very strongly so hopefully that's something that our listeners can use as well and you mentioned chaos magic which I like to point out that um well in the in the Norse tradition and and that a lot of times I from what I've learned is that they didn't really view good and evil they viewed Order and Chaos and if you think about it it makes sense is a is a lion evil for eating an elk killing that elk is a human evil for eating that elk well you know are we you know so so it's all taken into that so I'd like to usually there isn't any kind and people have asked me that too well what if I'm Christian can I still can I still use like almost all Norway is Christian I mean that's the big christianization that happened yeah yes you can again it has nothing to do with any um it's not like you're worshiping anything else so I always tell Christians that I you know I leave out I would leave out certain verbiage if they were kind of like H if they were all about Christian if they were about that I would leave out any connotation of you should do this because Odin says so or you know Thor you know you you don't have to incorporate that you incorporate what the essence of that God represents and they get it and it's all in every religion I mean it's already in every religion the same kind of things uh can be talked about in human problems so it relates it's all different paths to the same pop of the mountain I think yeah and the correlations were you mentioned correlations before I forget I really wanted that in the book and mainly because I don't do tarot and I don't know anything about tarot so I had to research that I had to research what these tarot cards were and then then I you know there's other books that do have some and I was like I want that in my book but I really wanted to get you know the the correlations for that in there because a lot of my people that I that I read use terot and they they do have similar correspondences crystals and herbs I do a lot of herbal work I do a lot of Crystal work I I taught people all they needed to know about all the rocks that was probably my main job at that place and learning all about the crystals and I found that even crystals I mean you're taking a blue appetite and that's all about communication and I kept thinking holy moly this is this is an Zeus this is like you could an Zeus is is blue appetite so it was fun to make those correlations actually now speaking of stones you know you said that that you you use runes um wooden runes do you think that there's a preferred stone or grouping of stones because a lot you know a lot of the metaphysical shops um I'm here in Salem Massachusetts so they're on every street corner um a lot of the runes I see are on Stones crystals is there one that's better than the other or hodg podging it together and have one Rune of this Crystal one Rune of this Crystal any insight on that I get that question a lot actually and since a lot of the runes that we sold there at that store were those Stone runes you know uh I had to answer that and I I brought others in because I don't prefer those Stone runes they're too round uh they don't cast well they do not um you can't do a layout with them for divination because you need to have a uniform shape so you don't know what the Rune is if it's forward or reversed on the back similar to tarot and I I found that they it was just and sometimes they're just poorly made a lot of times the runes are just you know they're making hundreds of these and that's why I can understand why people don't necessarily want to buy runes that were just made by I don't know children in China I don't know but I'm like that's so what I prefer is to find a you know it depends on what you want to do with it uh you can I have several different sets of all different makes metal ones clay ones Stone ones wood ones um but you can you can choose them based off of what you want to do with them so some runes will be easier to use if they are flat so even if they're Stone if they're flat you'll be able to cast those pretty well they'll they'll playay one way or the other you'll be able to definitely tell other runes will have a more uniform shape especially the wood ones so that you can do layouts with them so you can these are ones I made I I made some Fimo ones but I shaped them all in a rectangular way so that I didn't couldn't tell what the Rune was on the back so that's a thing and say round runes you make them out of a log or a tree branch or something well those if you try and cast Will Roll right off the table and it's i' had that happen um so I look at that what I do tell people is that you can pick Stone runes and what they're great for is carrying them with you taking them with you each of those crystals you just look at the what what are you looking for to you know to do I guess so if you're looking for some healing energies and maybe you'll buy a multi set of runes that um have different things or you get one that's Rus that is a that is a quartz crystal or maybe you're looking to have a little more selflove so you're going to get that um lus freya's Rune and you'll get that in uh rose quartz and so that's how you can use a combination of the Rune meanings with a stone and make it practical got because it's just when you start doing castings yeah and the other thing is too you can always just reach in and pull out your Rune cast you don't have to read reverse runes you just pull them out as long as you're aware of what a you'll know if one should have been reversed or whatever but yeah and it looked like you had a rune set that almost looked like a card oh yeah I knew you were G to ask about that yes it was like the the tarot card of runes yes thank you I'm glad you you recognize that I made these runes uh I made a I have a a wood cutter etcher kind of machine glow Forge and I experimented with making runes with that so I drew them out just used a Sharpie and I drew out runes on a piece of paper and I and I etched them and they were small they were they were the normal size and they were great they were fantastic I I drew one of the runes backwards on accident but you know that happens so I stopped using those and corrected it and made more but over covid I was doing a lot more video room readings so you know and I'm old I'm not techsavvy so I'm using a One camera to zoom in while I've got another one here but it was hard for my clients to see and really you know see the runes to make an impression on them and ah I gotta do something about that plus I realized that nobody I've reading I'm reading has ever had a rune reading before now if they've only had tarot readings before why don't I make something that makes them feel a little bit more comfortable when they sit down in the chair especially if they're doing a divination method that they've never tried before so I made some larger runes and this way I can see them that's mainly the reason why I'm little selfish but we can see them when you're doing video readings exactly so even you know and they're nice and large you don't have to even put them right up to the camera and mess up that they can lay they can stay this far away and you can still clearly read each Rune and when you're at the table you can actually shuffle them almost like cards I feel it brings it makes people a little more comfortable and and it makes them they just kind of get it and then and then you can lay them out you turn them over like a book and you'll get your uh you'll get your familiarity to it right and so far it's been great and I I use these runes pretty much exclusively for reading for others uh for that reason I have a little Lazy Susan actually that I put my run cloth on so that I can turn it so the client can see the layout via their view they I usually have them take a picture of it so that we can go back over that when they come back in for another run reading let's compare I like to experiment with that kind of thing the other runes and the thing is when you make them yourself even if you're gifting them or selling them I'm still it takes a long time to make runes the set that I just pulled out that was the Fimo set now think about I had there's 24 runes so I had to make each Rune pinch each Rune into the shape I had to then draw on each Rune then you have to bake it I mean so this is in 24 Runner 24 then another run 24 then you bake it then you take it out then you have to to paint it that's a task and then you have to paint the Rune itself that's 24 more of that and you might have to do two coats and then three coats of fingernail polish on each Rune wow so these have a lot of energy in them not I don't usually use these for other people I'm just like no I put too much work in and them they feel really good I'm gonna keep them that way so yeah it's there's a lot of of intention you can put into your runes no matter how you're making them I think that's what actually I think does make them more most versatile is you can do a lot with them that you can't necessarily do with tarot right yeah I love that you brought up that the ones uh made out of crystals the ones that might be irregularly shaped that those have a use as something that you carry with you you know maybe in a Talisman bag or just in your pocket to bring that energy you know into your life maybe you're going into a new job and you want to bring some energy in with you you can pick a rune to help you with that like you said with a corresponding Crystal that might also have that same kind of go get them energy but at the same time you have so many other different ways to do runes you have the flat ones so that you can cast them you you have created cards Rune cards so that you can do almost a tarot reading with them and I I think that just makes them very accessible to people they're just a little bit easier to grab and for the runes it seems simpler to start and then it gets it opens up into so much more so it just seems to be a little easier to a little more accessible I think for people to start with a runes so I'm surprised that they're not as familiar uh for people as tarot cards because they do feel more accessible yeah guy but your book has been also very accessible I loved how fun it was to read how accessible you made every single Rune the history what it was how to use it did you have like a simple reading or a simple way that someone can incorporate runes into like their daily life oh sure absolutely yeah the uh yeah thank you on that on that by the way uh it was fun to write I had been writing a I'd already been writing for like a year on a book just not knowing what I was going to do with it so when I got the call to do this book I was like I have this already and it allowed me to really refine it and weed it down and re that was you know it that was so rewarding but yeah if you're not writing a rune book the way that I tell people to get started in fact I'm doing a clinic on this here soon is about getting started in runes I would just do a rune a day a rune pull a day you reach in and what I'm actually going to be publishing I'm trying to get it trying to get it U made now I'm doing a journal a little Rune 30-day Rune journal they're out there I wanted to do one of my own and uh and it will be one of those things and you can just do this without that but that's the easiest way to get into runes is to do a 30-day Rune pull you pull one Rune every day and then you you write down in your notebook or you ask first before you pull it you go what Rune should I learn about today and then you pull it read up on the Rune bullet point what it means then carry it with you every day or carry it with you all day and you're going to start to see it you'll start to see this pattern in the trees you'll start to see it in the painting on the parking lot you'll start to experience it and you'll look for it so to me when you do that that's how you get to learn it and you get to sit down and then you meditate with it you just draw it with your finger and then you you you get to experience it and that's just one room per day and if you pull the same room the next day that means you need to experience it again and you do it and you do it for 30 days that's my easiest way or you know I I tend to let to tell people not to try and do a a reading on themselves all the time uh they're there to guide you but they really aren't going to give you the exact answers you want I mean let's look at north gods man those guys is awful I mean they're all awful yeah no straight answers there no they're just gonna but they're going to give you those answers they're going to give you that guidance and and also maybe not no guidance at all maybe you're just you are experiencing that Rune all day your gefu that give and take that compassion that that acceptance that love that generosity and you get and you focus on that Rune and you're going to do that all day you get hagal which means hail you're like H I don't want to focus on this room today but what you do is use it as a shield bring on all those challenges that were going to come anyways whether I pulled this Rune or not but now you're aware of them and why you're aware of themal means you're going to get you're going to get through those challenges and you're going to learn something very important from them what do you need to learn from them so they don't they're not that big of a challenge anymore because you're using hagal energy to do that and that's the best way to get to know them and and do it on a daily basis or you have a dinner and you want to carve runes into your turkey or carve them into your your bread before you bake it anything like that you can do on a daily basis you're you don't have to do Rune readings for people to incorporate a a spiritual aspect of runes in your daily life for sure and as far as the Heathen stuff goes too I will be out there and tell everybody that I don't I don't really do any of uh I've been asked this to I don't do kindreds I don't do any acet I don't do religion I just don't do religion in general and I don't consider Buddhism and or Norse uh runes to be religion in that way although I'm you know do you definitely do you no and I I love that you pointed that out the runes themselves are definitely not a religion and they're certainly not held by any one particular religion they're kind of more for everybody else like you said and something that can be used um we've touched on sigils before I liked how you said to put them on yourself and one thing that we have told um you know if you wear makeup if you wear perfume or anything like that you can draw it in your concealer or you put your makeup on you can draw it in your as you're putting on your perfume yeah draw that draw that that with oil I never thought about that yes you got your deodorant you're just doing little anzo here little T get that get some massive coverage on little whatever it takes right right I don't know if there's a rune for smells but boy probably should be but that is exactly it you get to you get to utilize runes like that um because they are and to me that is a safe acred way of using them I that's that's every every time you you put some attention into that it's a sacred way of using it you know now to kind of just circle back to the book real quick one thing that I thought was interesting is you can kind of it's not just informative but it can kind of be used as a workbook can you kind of touch on that aspect of the the workbook piece of of of the book and how people can use that to learn how to do runes divination do room PS I I I just I love books that are kind of half info half work bookie I feel like I'm a participating player at that point no I'm with you I'm with you I use them all all the room books I own and I own several but it's I use them as reference books and I tell people in the book I want you to highlight in here I want you to underline paragraphs I want you to do whatever it is write in the margins I want this book to be like a textbook in high school you know utilize it write it up this isn't a sacred tone you have to read cover to cover in fact you shouldn't you should go through and do the things take a good glance at it I put a bunch of um I really wanted to add some things in the back that were spells and you know full disclosure on this that the company that had me write this book originally wanted me to rewrite another room person's book and they were going to discontinue it I think and they just wanted to expand it and I thought oh okay I'll but then this person also follows me on Instagram like I know this I have this book and I was like oh wow completely different author female much younger and the writing just would not match up there I was like I don't want to put my name on this expansion when it was this person's work and they did that I I want to do my own right you know thing so that book had I think had a kind of a spell for each Rune in the back of it and it had or at least a few runes it did and I did one for every Rune in the f dark and not even a spell I guess they are spells yes they they're spells I mean how to make like suo te suo is the son you know and that's what she had in there her book too so I did a riff off of that and then I came up with a bunch of my own based off of my experience I thought this is great you and everybody can do this too you can come up with your own spells for each Rune you know what how do you how what would I do for tias you know T tier tier I'm also a big tick fan and I was read he like smells like justice and I'm like that's it tier tear he said God of Justice and legalities and and so I I did a thing uh I don't even know what I did I'd have to look it back up but but that one was one based off of it was a way to make something uh yeah it's a recipe it's a court case type of powder I believe yeah it is a victory powder so this is something that I did myself as well for some of my family members um and you can use this in a candle ritual so you can you can dress your candle with this and you each of of the ingredients has something to do with protection and successful outcome on legalities so each Rune has a way that you can and you can do multiple things with TS too different types of spells but I just want to inspire people on how to use that and then go and I tell in my book too this should be one of many Rune books in your collection don't just make this your room book or any of them when you read sometimes you want to reference and you do your own Run cast and you want to reference something you just go and like let Spirit kind of guide you which book you need to read and I would do that too pull out this book all right before I had my own book but you know but I still do that you pull it out you go right to the page you relax your eyes and you just look at the page and whatever you happen to be looking at is what they want you to know doesn't matter and I think that I think what I love most is the correspondent section for each Rune and how every chapter has like a takeaway so you like the takeaways I love the takeaway section that is that is my jam is writing this book for me oh good I knew there was a reason I didn't know what to think of that I was like why am I writing takeaways I'm just repeating what I said this is hard this is like a thumb up on the takeaways nope thumbs up on the takeaways okay I will keep that in mind for other books yes my husband also very much likes the takeaways because not a huge reader and that really helped you know make those points make a lot more sense to him and so I I love them as well I suppose you can if you B if you even underlined the takeaway part that you really wanted to know then you would immediately reference that first and you can go back and look at where it's at in the book yeah I can see how that works great well thank you that's great you know actually one of those takeaways like struck me like lightning actually I was reading through and I believe it was it was definitely the Run Urus and in it you had compared it to the tarot card The High Priestess and I immediately just felt shocked because the high priestess's Crown her headdress on most rer weight tarot decks if you look at the horns it's Urus upside down oh I have I I couldn't believe it that was the first thing that I you got the guy looking up a Tarot deck card now I know yeah I know no I was like looking up o I'm like when you were saying that I was like wait a minute I'm picturing that and you're right it's because kind of off-kilter one part of Udo is this way but then there's the angle yeah and very very similar and I I had never really caught that before but you know you kind of opened my eyes to that correlation and I I think that's kind of like what you were saying about grabbing a different book each time when you do a reading or when you want to kind of look at the r meanings because you never know when someone is going to have a different take that you hadn't thought of before or open your eyes to a different way to kind of look at the runes and so I I love like you said having lots of different books and lots of different references I learning is so important and I think kind of gathering from all those sources is very cool well it's also one of those things where if you know as an author I'm like well everybody there's so many room books out there there's so many and and I was like well each person though got downloaded basically the information from Source or Spirit whatever you want to believe but each author then got to put it through their filter of humanity so every single book has relevance you know even even the early ones that they didn't like that what's his name that there's a Ralph Bloom yeah even even there's some relevance in those but yes that was my introduction to runes I apologize no I I have the set I have a hard cover set of it I was like fascinated with getting like oh these are the first ones like back in the day that back in the day that was the only option for runes was that that Ralph Bloom set and I will say that I do use the um the weird Rune and that it's been a source of controversy since Ralph blims books uh some people do not use the blank Rune and I I call it I've been I've been yelled at on on forums and stuff about it I'm like I look at it as the tarot card the kind of the you don't know what you're going to get right there's there's a way to read them to me and people are like it's not traditional and I'm like a there's no tradition on Rune reading at all there's no evidence they ever did right and B well it just offsets the balance Perth supposed to mean that I'm like no you don't understand perthro has way different meanings than a blank void and if that's in the middle of a reading what does that mean it makes it hard because you have to think about it why is there a void here do they not want us to talk about this maybe that's just this topic that usually comes up when it's like a very sensitive topic or something or they're just like or is it like Hey we're not here to give you guidance on that you have to navigate that that's coming up you know you have to navigate it even if it's in the now like yeah there's a lot of unknowns happening to you but here's the guidance you need to know we're not going to tell you what those unknowns are happening but we're going to tell you how to deal with them if I were getting a rune reading I would want the blank Rune to be in the mix yeah I just I find it a little exciting and it's always funny I'm not funny I shouldn't say that I've done that before it comes up and we're having a good time with the client we're having you know just having a good time and it comes I turn it over oh my and like what sorry yes so now I got to think for a sec because because it does give you a challenge as a reader to figure out what they're trying to say but to me the more options I can give my people you know and I look at it this way too you know their people are trying to give that person a message the person they're guiding through life how they going to do that with some guy with a bunch of you know wooden runes and there's only 24 of them mind you and this person's got a lot of baggage and we got to fix this but I somehow we have to do this out of nine runes that they're gonna he's GNA pull for her so how do we you know so it's like you have to look at it from a guide's point of view as well what would you say how would you say it why is this here because this is a good way to say this and the other thing would be um talking with the client like I said I'm not a psychic medium I could read you without runes I could could read it and I'm a good reader of people I could read a people I can read somebody right there and then but kind of like you you mentioned earlier you you were talking about not reading for yourself so much right for me it's easier to read other people than it is to read people I know or or myself partly because I know myself and I know what I want to hear and don't want to hear so it's harder to hear your guides because it's your own wants and needs but when you're reading for someone you don't know you don't have all that bag like you said the filter it's much easier to let the runes speak or to let that energy speak through the runes when you're reading someone that you don't know I found that that is very true but when you read for people you may as well I did a whole podcast on this you may as well be looking in the mirror I did a whole festival where I was reading one person after another for two days straight and I swear I could have been reading to myself a lot of times if you need the work you if you need the self-work you'll give get readings and you'll be doing readings for people the clients need the same work are coming to you yeah that's why they're in front of you because they have some same issues why would they come to somebody or be attracted to somebody that has a completely different outlook on life or completely has no idea or no clue as to what they're going through they just a natural thing that people don't really realize when you that's another responsibility of being a reader they're going to sit down in front of you and you're going to be able to relate to them you're going to read them and you're going to be able to give them proper guidance because it's your higher self also talking to you every guidance you give somebody else I learn from I learn a little bit and I can and it it's just like yeah it's hard for me to read myself or do a casting I usually use the runes again like you do in a different way uh for sigils or and then I do do readings when it for myself but mean like for my wife and I we have our own family set but and friends yeah that's a little bit hard but I always I mean repeat clients become friends so you got to get used to that too and being able to give them the advice and you got to pull yourself out of the friendship relationship a little bit and let your your guides kind of take over your spirit takes over and then tells them what they need to hear but if you can do that with confidence then I think that's a showing growth a lot of growth now one other thing that you have mentioned and I heard you speak on it a little bit here was um when you talked about the runes you almost talked about them a little bit like they their own personalities like they you know they have their own attitudes a little bit and I think you mentioned that a little in the book as well and I 100% believe this because I had a Tarot deck once and it just had a really shitty attitude I got it I I worked with it you know attuned with it I thought did readings with it and it told me I was going to die and then every time I did a reading with it it was really bad news that wasn't true and even when I would read for other people it would be the worst Doom and Gloom none of it true and I couldn't figure out what was going on and I it didn't like you the deck just didn't have we just didn't have a good fit it was The Enchanted tarot I believe I ended up giving it away shell and I used to be part of a group that did um different workshops and and things and spoke about tarot and I ended up giving it away to someone there that it seemed to like but I've never had before since such a a personality reaction from a Tarot deck now is that similar to what you were saying that's why I don't read tarot yeah it's just the one just the one staring at me while I'm sleeping that on my night and cheese no no that's true actually it is I mean you naturally say you have multiple runes multiple Rune sets you know you're going to find ones that just feel good in the hand that you like to pick and so you're going to you're going to give them a personality you really give them the personality kind of but also you recognize you recognize it and that's where people would come in and say well you said they weren't anything but just chips of wood and plastic and blah blah and they're not you know I'm like well yeah but also you know I have toys that have personalities man you know my cats have personalities um and it's all the way you act when you have them how does it make you feel like when you know these this personality that the big ones they just seem like they really they feel good to me and I get really accurate readings and Fa good positivity when I do it for others with these large runes great when I want to do my own casting I use my smaller runes well that one handcrafted S I did that took forever uh because those guys just want to you know yeah you you you do kind of give them a personality at that now I don't know if I've ever had something that didn't read right with runes I always felt like that was my problem just rude by not by pointing out my issues no that was the oldie deck yeah oh I've heard that story though a lot actually yeah that they're like oh yeah especially with Tarot me I don't know why that is I don't know if it's a different kind of energy or just you know that's just how it works but I don't know now is there anything you recommend to people when they're choosing like you mentioned a couple different um things to look for you know runes that are flat something that you might feel comfortable in your hand or that you like is there anything else that someone should look for when choosing a set for themselves for the first time I think I would just suggest not to be afraid to try them out I mean if you're the kind of person that is like I'm going to pick a lucky Rock today and it's going to be the first one I see because that's what I okay that's my lucky Rock if you're looking at a bunch of run sets and you're just drawn to one you're like oh that's for I'm G to pick that one that's fine but the other things you can look for are just how does it feel in your hand try casting them dropping them on a tablecloth or you know a rug on the floor however how do they bounce how do they feel in your hand how do they make you feel um that's the biggest thing because you want to want to use them you want them to feel and maybe you'll feel energy they're Stones a lot of people feel energy from stones and you put those in there and you're just like oh these are going to be powerful and some of them you might get and be like well I like these but I don't want to use these for other people mainly because I I do divination differently for other people than I do for myself you might think that so that that would be it I don't think there's any hard and fast rule or any big suggestions I can give you because everybody is going to I I would just encourage everybody pick the Rune set based off of what feels good to you not what anybody else says not what I say or anybody else says for my own personal information when are you starting production on deck of run sets oh the run set deck yes there are a couple out there in fact uh wow I love I love that you've turned them into cards I just love that that concept oh it you know and it works I mean you can turn them I would for classes I would etch out on on card stock uh I would etch out little room so they're flat and then I can give those in an envelope to people um and they're just little regular size runes but instead of etching and cutting them on wood I did it on card stock and it worked out really you know like this craft paper card stock um if you don't have a set of runes you don't have any money to make runes do that just take a card stock or whatever and draw out the runes this is also going to take some atttention and you can cut them out and you can shuffle them and use them like that um use them similar excuse me to Tarot um doing a three three card layout or do a nine Rune layout I haven't had any production yet on the actual cards I'm working on that because there are a few other sets and then one set I bought actually had the same picture on the back and it was you can tell if it was reversed which I I was like ah boo you can't do it that way I can't cast it I can't do the regular type of reading like it so if you do make your own cards make sure the back is is something different yeah just or or just so you can't see it yeah it's the same either it's blank or has the same a mirrored image so you can't tell if it's forward or reverse and that'll help out a little bit better and you know don't be afraid to read the revers type of Rune either don't be afraid of those but yeah I'm going to try and hopefully get that out in a in the in the in the journal the 30-day Workshop I love your 30-day I'm a journal fiend so anything with a journal on it I love that so that sounds F I have a I did a video on journaling your journey and people would ask me about journaling and I was just like man you should have multiple journals I have I have my journals over there and they're like I got I started them in 2020 I think where is it oh they're over there are you I mean think you're me I don't know yeah maybe got lots of journals over there I got like six different journals I have like you know my magical Journal I have like my schedule Journal I have my moon Journal I have you know feelings Journal that I don't really show people it's all hand drawn and hand dotted and it's going to be my gamore that my grand kids going to freak out about but it's like this thick so it's going to take me a long time to finish I've got my my daily journals and then mat spiritual and magical journals so I do one each year even though one year I might only have filled it up that much but then to me having multiple journals is great especially if you're doing Rune readings and or you're you're you're practicing those have a journal for your 30-day Workshop that you're doing and then have one for your when you read for other people when you're practicing and you write down the way lay it out and you can refer back to it yeah I love journaling it's it's I think it's super important and you know you shouldn't ever get on yourself if you stop journaling for a while I say that as a professional because I do that so there I'm giving myself permission yeah and giving everyone else permission too I love it yes you don't have to Daily Journal and you're not a failure if you don't so so where can people find your podcast and your YouTube channel and where can they get readings from you give us all your details well if they cast some runes maybe they're
