Augustine Lighthouse well it sounds like we have an amazing episode coming up sh is going to be talking about a haunted lighthouse and some of the first hauntings in America I am going to take us to St Louis Missouri and the cursed LMP family Mansion so stay with us like subscribe shoot us an email write us a review say nice things about us smoke some weed get really really high light some incense set the mood sit back relax cuz you know why why we're [ __ ] International Superstars we are international Superstars we still got New Zealand peeps that are pretty regular you know speaking of the New Zealand part of the world some news out of Australia this week very sad gosh yes I know I remember you know there there was a point not too long ago where we had other sad news our favorite Rocky Horror actor meatloaf pass play yeah I remember we had to do a shout out today I feel like we need to do a shout sh out man to Olivia Newton John like what the hell Greece and she was like so pretty even though she was like 78 years old or something the [ __ ] lady was beautiful like I want to look like Olivia Newton John when I'm in my 70s like how do I do that and she seemed so nice and so gracious genuine yes you don't get a lot of that I had to break the news to my husband oh she was his girlfriend yep I can see it you know and had the posters was in love with her and it it was difficult I had to hold his hand he was very very sad very sad you know it and and the thing is is that it's not just gree and I think that I think people forget that yeah Greece wasn't like her only thing she had that music career she was wasn't she on Broadway um I'm not sure about the Broadway I don't know about the Broadway thing maybe Greece was on Broadway but not her necessarily Greece was on yeah definitely it that was um I don't know if she was in it on Broadway but like she put out like an album back in the day like physical remember physical she was in like the headband I remember that please exercising in the in the yeah like that was our childhood like that [ __ ] was on MTV like we rocked that and I'm sad she was a cannab user no [ __ ] no [ __ ] she used it to help with cancer oh no [ __ ] I did not know that yep she was def she was a very outspoken advocate for cannabis and for how much it helped her in her cancer with her cancer symptoms she had um breast cancer right she she had breast cancer back in the day and um you know she used cannabis oil she you know she was uh very vocal for how much marijuana helped her realize that and you know that kind of gives you perspective because I am not the only person on the planet that thought that that woman was the greatest thing since freaking sliced pie truly and I mean Greece was not only the first movie I saw but it was I saw it in the drivein when I was like seven like like drivein first movie like come on now right so fun what a good memory have some have to have someone that beautiful and gracious and humble and not just beautiful physically but like inside beautiful like such a awesome person is was also a cannabis user and an outspoken Advocate because it really did help her she found when she was undergoing chemo like I think she was on morphine for the pain and she she used marijuana to wean herself off of other pain medications and used just cannabis and cannabis oil um she was very very big on it she was huge now do you happen to know not trying to put you on the spot but as me and all of our listeners are aware you are the weed woman the wise weed lady oh my yes that's my Instagram handle wise woman weed and as we all know your Instagram handle is 100% truth of who you are so I'm very wise ask me anything so what are the laws for marijuana in Australia is it legal is it not legal is it medical is it recreational I know you say that she was an advocate I know she lived in Southern California in the end but Australia was was like her place what were what are the laws in Australia do you have any idea I have no idea but I bet Google knows Google says it's largely illegal in Australia but the rules differ from state to state that's kind of sad um I guess they do have a legal medical Mar marijuana program gotcha okay recreational is illegal on the federal level but laws vary from one state there to another it's good that medical is legal there so if she went home she could still continue to take medical marijuana right now was her advocacy do you know in California or Australia or both or don't everywhere she was just she she would talk about it anybody that asked she would talk about it I know she was on some shows talking about it but she was just very outspoken about how much it had helped her in her journey but you know there are folks out there that marijuana is a very taboo thing even still to this day and that's why I think knowing that that people like Olivia Newton John who were outspoken cannabis users is kind of like a point for our side yeah I think the more and and she's she's an older woman she was an older generation and to see someone who's famous and intelligent and and well spoken you know well put together she's she had her [ __ ] together she is an an older lady who a quote unquote normal person exactly and to see that type of person be a competent intelligent advocate for cannabis especially for something medical like this is huge more people need that type of relief and they'll trust it more coming from a normal person right especially because we we need that kind of advocacy you and I grew up with chich and Chong and I love them very much and outside of the funny marijuana movies that they did they even back in the day were advocates for Advocates yeah yeah but I think that some people take them a little less seriously that's the way our society is and I hate that but we need people of all types to come forward and say cannabis helps me relax it helps me medically it helps me you know have a good time I like to unwind after work with a little bit of marijuana the more people of all walks of life of all colors of all religions of everything we we just need it needs to be more accepted everywhere you know funny story I go into the weed store my favorite Happy Valley Gloucester Mass love them that's kind of what you see there you will see the 24 yearold kid who looks like he's been high for six days straight and doesn't need anymore right now and then you'll see the guy that's dressed in a three-piece suit in line behind him followed by what looks to be like my grandma or my great grandma in line behind them right when you are at the weed store and they're they were having a sale so it was rather crowded I love me a sale well oh my God like for real we'll have to get into that but so it was relatively crowded like needed to wait for a parking spot kind of crowded and to see the variety of people from all walks of life is pleasantly surprising I love it because it's not just back in our day what you'd call that typical Stoner hippie Stoner you know it looked like there was a lawyer and your typical your atypical American grandma in line know exactly exactly and I I think that was one of the things now weed is legal in New York for medical and recreational at this time but when I left New York it was not legal in any way shape or form and I went to California and I got my medical card and I could walk into a shop and that's exactly what I saw is I saw every type of person and I and I love that because it's so helpful it helps Grandma's gloma it it helps everybody here's my my final question for the wise weed woman I hear rumors back when I was in New York they had started legalizing medical and I had obtained a medical card due to my chronic issues IID only ended up getting getting weed at the medical store once in New York because I was like you're charging that my friend can get me Triple that for that so I actually only went to the store once in New York with medical card when I moved to Massachusetts it was recreational so I didn't even bother getting a medical card because I was like well why bother going through that and paying my co-pay at the doctor just to get something I can already get but my question is is the medical quote unquote stronger than the recreational because that's the word on the street that's a rumor I don't know if it's a myth a fact is there a benefit to getting the medical is it better is it stronger like tell me the deal here come here sh lean in real close I'm going to tell you a secret it's the same weed that's what I thought that's what I thought that's why I didn't want to pay the co-pay I haven't had an MRI in like four years and they'd make me get an MRI plus the co-pay and it would cost me like a, dollar at the doctor and the price of the medical card on top of that I just want to smoke people yeah we just want to smoke same thing I do want you can grow more plants if you have your medical license there's there are advantages to having a medical card so I tend to have one um I know people in New York that have them right now because I believe the only way you can grow legally in New York is it is medical there is no recreational home grows at this time right so there are some people that have it but it's a plant people if somebody wants to take it for a headache or back pain or because they have fibroids or because they have ADHD and it helps them just let them take it really they're not going to hurt themselves they're not going to hurt anyone else it it can only help and it does it's proven that it does just let them take it don't don't make us jump through hoops you know cuz what I'm thinking to myself I'm like you know some of this high THC content good weed that I get actually does make my back feel better and I'm like are you trying to tell me that if I get a medical card that I'm gonna like my back issues are going away like what are you saying so that's why I wanted to know like is the medical what they call medical grade is it really any different no the answer is no but depending on your state you may need a card for various reasons you might need your medical card in order to grow you might need a medical card you might only be able to buy medically uh you might only be able to grow medically you might need a medical card if you have to take uh like a a piss test for a job like a drug test you might need your medical card although I do believe there are things in I don't know if it's at the state level or the federal level um where they they they don't test I believe it's state by state so check with your state but some people need a medical card for that reason the other thing is I do believe that most States medical weed has less taxes so oh more more bang for your buck right so you might actually eventually save money but depending on your co-pay and if like you you have a very very high co-pay it might never be worth it to you so you know when that's your health care situation and that's a whole another [ __ ] subject why is Healthcare so [ __ ] up here why is it so expensive for you to get an MRI that you really should have I don't understand that and we put things off because I'm putting things off because I can't afford it I can't there's no freaking way I could afford the different things that I need so it's [ __ ] up so [ __ ] up if we have any friends in either Canada or England who are who are looking for some American weirdo was to come live with them so we can milk your government's free healthcare no we're interested we're interested cuz things here are going to hell in a hand basket right a but so you're pu you're you're you're bonging it away oh I am so bonging it away I am bonging left and right over here let's talk about what we're smoking since we're on the Jive I'm smoking some xj13 homegrown cheap [ __ ] over here um yeah so I'm reaching back into the cupboard this time to a marked jar of some old xj13 that I grew uh good stuff it's a jack hair descendant so it has that yummy Jack hair taste a little bit citrusy little earthy I like it nothing spectacular I would say nothing to write home about looks nice looks like weed you know looks kind of pretty a little crystally nothing special little you want to see my XJ just sedy it looks sedy you know and it tastes good T like I said a little citrusy earthy I like it and it's middle of the road I would say middle of the road for THC again my own and I haven't tested it if any of you want to send me a test kit email us at the stone Witches Hour gmail.com but uh the uh leafly.com says that it contains about 20 25% THC so and and it feels about there it's it's a decent high I can feel that I'm high I I usually feel high in my in my eyes first I can definitely feel high makes me happy makes me feel motivated this one's good when I'm having ADHD days where I'm bouncing from one thing to another this one can kind of help me stay

relaxation a little help and so this is nice this is just kind of an easy breezy I feel good hi gotcha I like it and I'm just lit I am lit you are baked sister I love it so here's some here's some interesting ghosty histories we're GNA talk about real quick I am super excited you said that you had some little first ghosty factoids and so I'm going to smoke some of my EXT J 13 and uh L I'm on me there sh all right so you know ultimately ghost stories go back to like literally 100 AD or BC can't remember BC ad one of those long time ago I remember it was I remember when I was reading about the first documented ghost stories ever in the world it was like during the Roman Empire so I think that was the first century ad if I'm not mistaken one of the too so any who so I I'm looking into the St Augustine Lighthouse and it it led me down to a path of America's first documented ghost it talked about like the history of ghost what is a ghost I'm super curious like there's a there's a first documented ghost sighting in America hell yeah hell yeah and I just I just fell upon this information to I wasn't even looking for it and fell now are you are you talking about the first colonizer ghost story or are you talking like a Native American first people here okay colonizer yeah definitely not Native American that okay yeah they've got their own much deeper history that's different okay yeah no this is this is the first colonized and believe it or not it actually didn't happen until 1799 you would think there'd be ghosts before that that were documented you would think you know maybe we just couldn't see the ghosts that were here no I think what it was was before 1799 they just thought you were batshit crazy and burned your ass at the Stak that's probably true too just saying nobody was GNA mention any ghost stories certainly no teenage girls this was like this came out of Maine and you know all of our listeners know that I should not be pronouncing towns anywhere in the world okay okay so we're going to give this a go mashas mashia Port masus Port Maine okay if you're from Maine and I said that wrong I am so sorry so sorry so very first documented ghost story comes out of this town mashia Port M this occurred on August 9th happy anniversary actually today's the 10th so it actually is that's so funny that's so weird why does that happen like this is not the first time that we have researched something and the DAT happened basically on the anniversary right what is with that that's such a weird coincidence to have happened more than like three four times is just weird to me so on August 9th in 1799 Abner blazel started hearing strange noises in his house kind of shook it off and and kind of ignored it then he saw a disembodied female heard a female voice and it had a very clear message that he was able to understand the ghost exclaimed that she was the wife of Captain George Butler and those that have heard her were supposed to send for her father David Hooper and these people they'd get kind of scared and they would go get her father yeah like literally go get him and bring him to the house so upon Mr Hooper's arrival he would hear the voice he confirmed that it was his daughter and her name was Nelly and Nelly began appearing in all these various forms and especially as a recognizable Apparition just how she looked when she passed away and she was often floating above the ground appearing very white as like a glowing light type thing she would make appearances to converse with the blazel family and they would actually Gather in their basement to speak to her like did they have a Ouija board was this a Ouija story interesting to me this has a lot of elements of the lady in white Stories the daughter the that she can't let go she's asking for her father or her family parent comes it sounds a lot like the lady in white Legends so she would eventually be seen by so many Spectators that she became like a ghost celebrity um Everybody in the region talked about her people would try to debunk her and basically this ghost would disprove them and holy [ __ ] that's wild like oh okay you don't think I'm real here I am and it didn't even matter if her family was there or not she would appear and basically scare the [ __ ] out of people to prove she was real like like this ghost was that's amazing this ghost would like prove her own existence yeah they initially thought that that you know the family was like doing something like creating like Illusions and had like voice things in the background basically like creating a ghost that wasn't really there like all those charlatans that used to do like the the table knocking and the curtains that would blow in the breeze they had a a guy from Harvard come and the guy from Harvard he described the girl looking at him like a white cloud he saw her saw her rise from the ground and away from him and then instantly appearing near him would come close and then go far away and in like a split second the he called it a spirit Cloud it could transform into a child-sized figure and back into a fullsize adult-sized figure here rays of light would emanate from her head and wow yeah and and he was also a reverend the guy from Harvard freaked out one more twist was Nelly died after giving uh birth to a child and Captain Butler was her husband and she suggested that he marry Abner blaz Del's daughter Lydia after she was a ghost her Apparition went to her husband and was like hey you should marry this chick just s wow picked her husband's next wife like a fantasmal Matchmaker so actually he ended up marrying the woman and she told her former husband to be kind to his new wife because she knew that the woman was going to die and what holy [ __ ] she did indeed end up dying after giving birth to their first child now did the other child live yeah so now he's father to two motherless children correct so then [ __ ] gets married to somebody else and she basically haunts them gives him a a ghosty tongue lashing and um reeks havoc and then disappears forever because he married someone else and she didn't tell him to kind of like she gave him the blessing to marry Lydia but didn't bless him marrying a third person and she was pissed wow so she only let him marry the one Lydia because she was going to die soon anyway she got all sorts of mad when married someone without her permission apparently I mean it's not like any huge like mystical thing but that is the first documented ghost story in America so a guy had to go and ruin the best ghost ever to exist apparently apparently so rude yeah like typical man stuff just saying just saying and I also found out do you know what the most famous ghost in America is that has seen the most most often the headless horsemen I'll give you one more guess is it a politician it is is it a president it is uh Thomas Jefferson close Abraham Lincoln oh [ __ ] that's who I wanted to say Abraham Lincoln the vampire Hunter guy yeah right apparently Abraham Lincoln is the most famous ghost most seen often even to this day um people say that they see Lincoln all the time at the Lincoln Memorial at night Lincoln is in in multiple locations apparently wow yeah Lincoln is the most seen most prolific Lincoln wow yeah so those are my little side tidbit stories for today I like your side tid bits that's pretty funny yeah actually I thought it was interesting um to see you know what technically what is the first documented in in in United States history because as you can tell they weren't really documenting that before we became a nation so what were we 1776 so by 1799 we were documenting that stuff what we'll have to do sometime future episode note we'll have to document first alien sightings oh yeah that's a actually we did document the first alien sightings I talked a little bit about it I think I'm not sure but we can talk about it more for sure so what led me to those tidbits was I was actually looking into this uh St Augustine Lighthouse oh yeah you saying I think I've heard of that before is it really famous it is actually and there's a couple things about it that I didn't really realize St Augustine is the oldest city in the United States did you know that I did not know that I did not know that either it was founded by Don Pedro D AES of Spain in 1585 so actually um St Augustine was founded I don't know 75 years before Plymouth Massachusetts so yeah actually according to what I found oldest city in the United States so as you can imagine freaking ghosty ghosty ghosty so there there are multiple tales about the lighthouse but the most popular and and and the most prolific is the story of the pity girls and again we all know I'm horrible with pronounce pronunciations their last name is spelled p i tte pity py I don't know pity girls sound right what happened to the pity girls like I said you know Don Pedro founded founded St Augustine 1585 in the 1600s a lighthouse was built and it was built out of wood obviously for the time but as you can imagine there was erosion to the land from the ocean as well as you know destructive storms hurricanes what have you over the years so around 1860 they decided they were going to put up what we now know the traditional cement style lighthouses so they started with a one and then they're going to replace it with a with like a better one right they had gotten stuff going um to get this going and they decided they were going to bring in a professional a lighthouse professional I guess I guess if there is such a thing so I imagine there was a lot of need at the time didn't they probably did a lot of failing so probably Lighthouse professionals were a thing oh absolutely especially off the coast of of well anywhere really even matter what Coast right the construction began um in 1871 and they decided to bring a superintendent of Lighthouse Construction in from Maine um this guy named hezekia pity I hope that's how it's pronounced so he moved from Maine to Florida with his family to oversee the construction of the new Lighthouse and part of the deal is he had to live on site he had a a wife and three children the the two older girls were teenagers then he had like a I don't know I want to say a five-year-old is this one of those lighthouses that is out on like a very tiny island or is it on the tip of of the of the Mainland I believe it's on an island yes okay so very isolated very remote tough place to live for a small child I imagine well they had um like little Rail lines and they had Railway carts that would move the supplies from the ship's dock up to the where they're doing this and what these kids would do is they would ride in those carts for fun normally there was a wooden board at the end um that stopped the rail cart from tipping over in the water what do you mean normally shell what do you mean normally why did you say normally because there comes a point where it might not have been there no mm mm anyway you know as you can imagine they had a lot of workers working and some of these workers um had their children present as well on July 10th 1873 the three pity sisters one was 15 13 and then the other was four along with an unknown African-American girl who was 10 who they suspect her father would have worked on site all the girls all four girls were playing together riding in the carts the wooden board was not in place oh no and the cart flipped into the water and trapped the girls underneath oh [ __ ] there was a Man Poor Kids there was a man named Dan sessions and he was a young African-American worker he saw what happened and race to the water as you can imagine these big huge carts they were not light so it took all that he had and he had to struggle finally was able to lift the cart from off the girls but by this time three of the four girls had drowned oh my goodness those poor kids the only Survivor was the youngest daughter so the two older daughters and the 10-year-old African-American girl whose name they never had Figures were lost in in this tragedy so they shut down the town for a funeral and then the family immediately went back to Maine to bury their daughters in their Hometown no one has a been able to find the resting place of the young African-American girl and unfortunately based on the time period we can only imagine that she's probably there still right so in the 145 years since as you can imagine the girls are there um you can hear them playing you can hear him laughing you can hear him giggling and there's definitely a sense that they're always there day or night they've had apparitions even during the daytime oh wow well to have three small children die suddenly like that they have they have so much Life Energy you know and to die in and at the time that was technically their home so they're just there playing and roaming around and might not know they're gone at least most times it sounds like people hear them playing and laughing rather than you know drowning yeah yeah yeah in the 1950s people thought they heard footsteps and uh there was a headkeeper at the time named James Pippen um he was the last person to live at the Lighthouse and um he had to leave because he said it was so haunted he would not stay another night in there oh wow um yeah grown ass man grown ass man uh the the the light housekeeper was like oh hell no and essentially no one has stayed there since there is a woman um who also occupies the lighthouse still she's probably more famous in the hauntings of the St Augustine Lighthouse than the little girls does she have a backstory she does she was there um as kind of a socialite overseeing some stuff and her man ditched her oh no on the island so she went up to the top and when she realized his boat was off in the distance jumpy jumpy so nowadays um and you can actually find uh pictures of apparitions on the internet of this one really so you know how like at the top of the lighthouse there's like a catwalk around the yeah yeah you can see her walking outside of the catwalk but it in the air like she's jumped but she's walking around the oh how creepy yeah like um actually like I said if you if you Google the St Augustine Lighthouse hauntings like you'll find [ __ ] like it's it's I'm gonna do that right now I was like like whoa all right I'll check shell I'm checking I'm gonna check St Austine ligh housee haunting if you click on images ghost profile you should see an image and it's got her Circle a ghost right outside the lighthouse yeah what the heck yeah so she's still what the heck and basically the story is is that she's basically waiting for him to come back oh that's so sad he left her there and she's still going to she looks so creepy I'm telling you I'm looking at picture and there is clearly a woman in a white dress with long dark hair standing outside of the catwalk on the ledge that is very very creepy there's also been workers that have said that that every single night she jumps off oh oh that's so sad that's so sad I I don't like that story I don't like any of these stories can you imagine just having your children die while they're playing is just just horrific just so terrible like I don't know if it you know I don't think it was anybody's fault but like that board just wasn't there that one time because those girls had played there over and over and over again it had never been a problem and nobody ever came forward and was like oh yeah you know old Joe down here he forgot to put the board back up cop to it this was basically like The Architects kids no no one did that you got to remember probably a lot of these folks were were SL labor making a nickel a day and probably would have been killed if they fussed up to the mistake even if it was a genuine mistake they been killed right good point back in those days oh hell yeah oh hell yeah it was probably just a terrible terrible accident but so sad right so um actually they do tours there now um ghost tours you can go on a ghost tour there um it is in to our Island Tour special I actually found out here's a fun fact about Florida Florida was in in in this area first place to ever do ghost tours really is that weird Florida and the first today good for them you know that's a tragic Lighthouse that's super sad it is and the thing is is that it's it it is a location where people have actually been able to catch The Apparition on film and on on video pictures and videos of that like you saw you saw multiple images online of that like that woman there like that woman is there that's a scary looking picture that's creepy so this is one of those even a skeptic has a hard time debunking this one because it's just so it's it's it's seen so often it's not a shy ghost not at all shy there are pictures of her right there yeah crazy [ __ ] and they're haunting they're absolutely haunting nowhere that I found anyway has anyone seen apparitions of the children just hearing them the auditory right in the the mansion that I'm going to talk about the hauntings are very much auditory a lot of times they're auditory here as well there seem to be a lot of different types of ghosts there's some that you just see some that you just hear H some that you see and hear sometimes you just feel like a poke or a pinch well and you know I think that that kind of there's a lot of factors with that because you know what is a ghost a ghost can be a cloud shape it can be a human shape it can be [ __ ] I I recall in my life I've seen a cat ghost you know like like it doesn't have to necessarily have a form and I think that's what throws people you think you're GNA people just assume you're going to see a see-through body not always the case so where are you taking us this week I forgot because I'm high and I know you told everybody but forgot so where are you taking us you're smoking the good [ __ ] today and you're faded I can tell I love it but today I'm taking us to St Louis Missouri o yeah and I'm actually going to talk a lot about beer of all things we both don't like beer and we both talked about the Deep South today I know so weird but you know Beer's okay I don't I don't I don't hate beer I don't love it but you know Beer's nice on a hot day you can't say that have you ever like I don't know worked outside worked on a good sweat and they had a beer it's kind of good that's what whiskey is for oh gosh whiskey let's not go there whiskey is really good okay but yeah no I'm talking about beer today we're talking about beer and this is a family the LMP family back in in the beginning of America so we're going back in the day in my story as well is the early 1800s a gentleman named Johan Adam LMP came to America from Germany and he settled in St Louis and this gentleman opened up a grocery store and at this grocery store as a lot of people did at the time he made like some of his own foods like his own pickles and his own beer so he was basic was he basically trying to bring his culture like what a lot of immigrants did at that time brought their culture to America like their food culture absolutely and he had an old family beer recipe and so he he brewed his own beer at this store and by 1840 just a couple years after opening his store his beer was so popular with everyone that he closed down the grocery business and focused solely on brewing beer and it's said by a couple people that there's some other person who's credited with bringing hops to America First why where's hops from I I'm really not sure I feel like I I feel like I have an ex-husband Who would know the answer to that probably they could probably let us know I know you're in the middle of starting to tell your story but have you ever been so high that you think you smell Bagels even though you know damn well you don't have Bagels in your house cuz that's Bagels would so good right now this weed I wish I remembered what it was and I threw away the packaging but damn you're so high you're imagining Munchies seriously Phantom ghostly Munchies in your house seriously oh you know what I'm imagining right now I was at the store the other day shell I totally thought of you I saw chocolate covered pretzel crisps oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] they had milk chocolate and dark chocolate versions is this a store that I can find in Massachusetts no oh my God I'm gonna die I don't think so do you guys have Stater Brothers over there never heard of it in my life never heard of it no sorry we're Trader Joe's kind of land up here in the Northeast we have Trader Joe's too but that's for like rich people I I all my discretionary income goes to weed I don't have enough for healthy food I have to make do with what I can get pretzel crisps we love them they're cheap they sell and that's why I did not get the dark chocolate pretzel crisps even though I desperately wanted them they weren't in the budget next week next week listeners please if you find chocolate covered pretzel crisps send Lea and I an email the stoned wi isour gmail.com we'll give you our mailing address please ship them to us love you forever because if shell doesn't try these chocolate covered pretzel crisps I'm going to die I know we're so hungry and we're so broke help a witch out so weed break weed break was the best break so Johan may or may not have brought hops over before this other person did some beer person can correct me on this how ever his logger was famous and everybody loved it and I learned something new I've heard of logger you've heard of logger right beer logger I have logger is derived from a German word it comes from the word logger which I guess means to store I don't know apparently you have to rest this type of beer and Johan had hit the jackpot because on the shores of of the of this Mighty River here he the mighty River the mighty River no so he has found under in in this area he has found some Limestone Caverns underground Caverns o I love caverns and these Caverns maintain a temperature and so he's able to store his beer there to kind of rest and ferment a little bit and and they keep it nice and cold it's perfect there's no Refrigeration at this time so being able to use these caves was a huge boost to his beer and everybody loved his beer funny Stone thought is I happen to know because we have caves in New York and I love caves and I go there a lot I don't know about other places but the caves in New York year round winter spring summer fall 52 degrees all year round and I imagine it was probably the I don't know if it was the same there but I imagine it probably was so he bought a property right near a natural cave and he used that uh he was I believe he was the first Brewer in St Louis to manufacture a logger type beer that's a lighter e effervescent beer and you need these cold storage places to be able to do it so he soon becomes very very rich making beer yeah but that makes him a Target as we all know it really does and there's rumors that these Limestone Caverns upon which he built his ginormous brewing company as well as his home they had tunnels that would connect he could go from his house to his Brewing Company and back and forth and some of these tunnels were so deep that the fish didn't have eyes you know super deep caves now the rumor is that these Caverns had a history that obviously goes far far further back than the settlers more of a native a native type history correct and that the caverns themselves were not amenable to the people that had kind of taken over and that so wait wait wait wait did he build these Caverns or were they naturally built or these are natural Limestone caverns in the area and they have been oh okay so they weren't like blasted out no these are natural naturally formed Limestone caverns and as we've talked before sometimes Limestone and particularly near water there's a lot of activity in places like that it's an attractant to to that energy that paranormally energy I can't remember what it's called because I'm high but it's an attractant and there are rumors that this particular area did not like being used that it that the area itself was kind of malevolent or or had bad feelings in particularly towards the LMP family for some reason Johan Adam LMP or Adam LMP as he was known became like a huge magnate in beer brewing even with the the anous ANH anheiser anhauser ANH Houser Bush family that big company anheiser Bush and Heiser Bush the beer they were all big at the time and there was at one time the LMP beer LMP Family Beer was ranked like in the top 20 and things like uh Budweiser weren't even in the top 25 oh no [ __ ] so this was like an OG beer OG exactly but they no longer exist and partly do to possibly this curse that the family may have been under I love curses do do tell so in 1861 Adam had a son William married a woman named Julia and they built a mansion called the LMP mansion that's what a lot of people did back then especially in the South if you had money you are building a big ass house and that's pretty much what they did and this Mansion was built again right near these Limestone caves so you could go from the big brewing company that Johan Adam had built and now William has built a house and they're connected by these Caverns so William becomes the first Brewer in St Louis to install Refrigeration in 1878 so now he doesn't have to use the logging caves he could use them for other things so now he his business has Refrigeration inside the business and he uses these Limestone caves for uh he converted it to like a theater a bowling alley there's a swimming pool down there they had like a hot tub with with water piped in from the brewery and it said that he had lavish parties in these caves I would totally smoke in those caves don't I'd be getting bombed in those caves right he's the first son new money everything's extravagant prostitutes partying drugs you name it he said to have done it in the caves they were the huge site ofner the Hugh Hefner of the South exactly so as the brewery is growing he incorporates it under the name the Western Brewery in 1892 and continues to grow the fortune see he's a father to nine children damn one of them died as a baby and the rest are Anna the oldest William Jr Louie Charles Frederick Hilda Edwin and Elsa I think they all sound like like princes and princesses oh yes this family was basically beer brewing royalty and they lived like it they lived lavishly the the whole Brewing Company spanned blocks and blocks of the city it was huge and he was training up his sons to follow in his footsteps now the oldest son William Jr and the next oldest Louie were big-time workers in the family business they were great doing everything however the youngest son Frederick was the one that dear old dad loved the most and had decided was going to be the Aira parent to the entire family fortune and the whole LMP Brewing Company Frederick however was very frail he you know was working in the business and and was kind of sickly and decided to go to California for a little while to get better while in California he seems to be recovering and then dies suddenly mysteriously and unexpectedly ooh tell alternately I could find that he died either of heart failure due to having a poor heart he was only 28 when he died oh that's super young yeah he may have had a bad heart but you know not a lot of 28y olds have a bad heart others said that he died under mysterious circumstances so could they have been getting rid of the AA parent I don't know so after Frederick died things continued to go pretty well for the company William Jr called Billy and Louie again helping out in the family and doing a great job billy gets appointed to be vice president William senior is still in charge but after the death of his favorite son he's getting more and more despondent you know he one of his best friends also in the beer industry he dies after a long illness and he just is seen often in his office staring at nothing and kind of just like making nervous gestures and and talking to no one kind of going a little cuckoo a little bit so William senior's getting more and more despondent his son William Jr called Billy he's wildly extravagant he's a Playboy he races horses he's constantly buying new things and he marries a socialite a woman named Lillian who is also known for her flamboyant ways she loves the colored lavender and so she dresses from head to toe in lavender and even has the horses that pull her carriage all their leather was dyed lavender and sometimes it's rumored that even the horses were dyed lavender and so she was called the lavender lady so are you saying they're kind of basically more less just like spoiled brats pretty much big time spoiled brats so when the favorite son dies William senior is just having more and more trouble and just three years later on February 13th 1904 so three years after his favorite son died in 1901 he was found in his bedroom lying in bed he' shot himself in the head self-inflicted yes a year later his widow was diagnosed with cancer and she died 2 years later in the exact same bedroom in the exact same bed where her husband 2 years after he had taken his own life first of all whose idea was it to keep the bed right right so weird after his father died William Jr Billy took control of the brewery but this dude like I said way better at partying than he was at taking care of the business there was a reason why Frederick was the favorite so he's continuing his partying ways and it's even rumored that he fathered a child with a prostitute down in the Limestone caves which back then huge no no huge no no huge no no there's a Nookie going on in the caves then right and the lavender lady is not pleased this is bad for her reputation they have a son William III and she is livid that he has gotten a prostitute pregnant and even worse when the child's born it has rumored to have Down syndrome oh they took this baby boy and locked him in the attic and kept him there theyd never let him out people would see him in the windows and he got a few unsavory nicknames that I'm not going to repeat because it's not that poor kid's fault but people at first thought maybe there was a monster in the Attic because that you know they would see this deformed face in the window and it was just this poor little boy similar to like the hunchback and odre Dame story really very similar type story so the lavender lady's pissed there's this this illegitimate child she decides to div divorce him right and it's it's a huge spectacle well back then divorce was like so bad right right you only really got out of marriage by death exactly exactly oh so you know I forgot to say remember I said that um William LMP Senor was after his son died he he was also sad because one of his best friends had died yeah it was Frederick paps oh my God paps Blue Ribbon beer PBS yeah oh my God yeah that guy you know it's kind of funny it's like this guy is BFFs with the PBR guy yeah what was this like you only could be friends with like other beer brewing people other beer families I'm not sure so back to the lavender girl Lilian Billy Jr right Playboy Billy having children with prostitutes Billy holding huge parties in the caves Billy he's tired of her you know she's pissed off at his partying ways and he just think she's boring so apparently rumor has it that he gave her like a he made her like a Brewster's Millions type proposition do you remember that old movie where he had to spend all that money to inherit like millions and millions more anyway it was kind of like that but he said that she had to spend $1,000 a day and that if she didn't spend it all she wouldn't get any more money from him to basically keep her out of his hair he would give her $1,000 and tell her she had to spended all of it or he wouldn't give her any more money you know so he gives her this ultimatum and the the marriage is doomed and they decide they're getting a divorce and it's this huge huge spectacle I mean think think the Johnny Depp and um Amber herd trial kind of spectacle and back in those days these people were considered like the elite Rich folk very much High Society people wanted to hear and they everyone wanted to hear everything all the salacious Tales you know everything about how they were atheists apparently was a thing that they were cruel to each other they were Conant drunk there was a lot of gossipy females back then because they weren't allowed to work and they didn't have a say so all they could do is Gossip gossip gossip gossip during this proceedings she almost lost custody of her son their only child William limp III and do you want to know why I was going to say just for being a weirdo why there was a photo of her presented at trial where she was smoking a cigarette [ __ ] that's what they were going to use to take her kid away from her good thing my children are adults now because I I smoke cigarettes it's a bad habit I know but damn get your kids taken away for smoking cigarettes right is that the dumbest [ __ ] or what I'm not saying it's a good habit but Jesus wait was there photographs oh yeah there there were photographs back that my bad they were so she did manage to keep custody of her son and it said that although she wore lavender every day of her life she was dressed in black head to toe on the day that the divorce proceedings were finalized isn't that a statement so it was shortly after the divorce that the widowed mother of will died by cancer two years after her husband had passed away and unfortunately the the curse didn't stop there so now after this divorce you know Billy Jr here running the the brewery has lost custody of his son even know his wife smoked a cigarette they probably put her up to it yeah she was even said to have used foul language in public gasp wait I've done both of those things on this podcast I've had a cigarette while we talk and I've used foul language I'm totally screwed yeah apparently you could have lost custody of your children back then now so Billy's bouts of of bad luck or possible cursedness did not end there Pro prohibition goes into effect in 1920 that screws your beer business big time other Brewers um anhauser bush anheiser anhauser bush I still can't say that right anheiser anheiser Bush they kept in business by selling I believe um like non-alcoholic beer and other stuff but the LMP Brewery went under they couldn't they couldn't maintain profit after alcohol sales were no longer allowed you know that's also around the time where soda started becoming popular and I wonder if potentially some of those beer companies started making soda anywh who let's get back to the ghost they probably could have but Billy was a shitty businessman he was just a Playboy because he liked hookers that's right too many hookers too many parties in the basement so now at the same time you know Billy's getting more and more despondent as prohibition is going the business is failing the Mansion is falling into disrepair and one of the other children Elsa she was a kind of like um I I read one website that described her as like the Paris Hilton of her day uh so socialite you know beautiful kind of flitting from thing to thing she married a man and they had a terrible terrible time it was prone to arguments and it she lost a daughter shortly after birth and this couple who constantly fought got divorced and then remarried and in 1920 just 11 days after remarrying this man Elsa LMP shot herself in the heart how what is with everybody shooting themselves it said that after her daughter died she suffered from insomnia and just never never really recovered Billy at the time when he heard that his sister died is reported to have said that that's the LMP family for you something's a eyy at that property with that family so Air 2 years later the LMP Brewery is sold for almost nothing and six months later December of that year Billy Jr sat at his desk at this office that's just inside the left door which I guess today is like a dining room but it used to be his office sat at his desk and shot himself through the heart what is why stop giving people in this family guns right his son when he was told about it said quote you knew I knew it I was afraid this was coming I knew you knew what exactly exactly who is talking to these people what what what what what ghosty is talking to these people now William III also had a nasty socialite messy divorce and he died of a heart attack at the age of 42 they have bad heart issues just saying they have something going on here now another brother another one of these nine children eight I guess since one died in infancy Edwin LMP uh how many are left now so there's Edwin and Charles I think left so Edwin one of the other brothers he left the family and he was reported didn't want want anything to do with them and he I mean he took money but basically stayed far far away from the family now the other brother Charles he had never married and he moved back to the family home after Billy shot himself in the office it's reported that he just kind of got more and more depressed and he just stayed in This Old House and never really left and he just got kind of reclusive and odd and he lived there with his dog and in 1941 he sent a letter to a funeral home and gave them notes on exactly what to do if he died I could see it not too strange yeah I guess so I guess people do kind of leave their last wishes sometimes and then in 1949 Charles walked down to the basement let me guess shot his dog and then shot himself in the heart and then and then you'd think but no walked back up stairs wrote a suicide note and then shot himself in the head hell man is there anybody left from this family I'll get there I don't know why he shot the dog but the sad thing about the dog is I read that even though this poor puppy which was his sole companion and best friend apparently even though this very good boy was shot in the basement his body was found halfway up the stairs oh my God that's horrible right even after being shot he still tried to get to him so sad hor so um he just wrote a note that in case I am found dead blame it on no one but me and it's thought that maybe because so many others in his family had committed suicide and there was questions as to whether it had truly been suicides or not he wanted everyone to know after he passed away the other brother Edwin was still alive oddly when he died at The Ripe old age of 90 in his will it instructed his Butler to burn almost everything every piece of artwork every artifact tons of luxurious items and expensive historical items did he say why maybe because of the curse maybe fear that one of those items carried the the LMP family curse continue it on wow did the butler do it he did it's thought that millions of dollars of items went up in smoke wow artifacts and artwork and things from all over the world gone because that was his last Last Wish that's so hardcore Superstition man now this house as you can guess is hella haunted right A lot of them are auditories um one of the saddest ones that I heard is that the father who shot himself it said that it said that one of the kids for one of the men who shot himself in the house one of the kids heard the shot and ran to the door and was kicking the door trying to get into his dad and you can hear the child kicking the door that's one of the sound oh my god oh that's horrible there are uh the auditory sound of shots are often heard for a little while it was a boarding house but people wouldn't stay you know they kept hearing things they would see people walking around items would go missing from their rooms people got too spooked to want to stay yeah yeah it's a hotel now um you can you can tour the brewery which I believe has a um a haunted house complete with animatronics and you can tour from that down through the Limestone caves and up into the the LMP Mansion itself which now is a bed and breakfast cool that's cool this one paranormal investigative group stayed there and a woman Shannon from the group says that they did an investigation and they found that it's haunted with tons of spirits and they said they had conversations with William Billy Charles and Elsa LMP and Elsa told them that she was murdered by her husband and that it wasn't suicide no [ __ ] and they also said that Charles spoke to his dog and that the dog barked oh wow oh wow so there's definitely a lot of sightings there people will think that they see a man walking through the hallway the family's still there that's the family is still there the bottom line the family is still there in particular a lot of people will get the heavy feelings as they go through the different rooms and sometimes they'll smell the perfume from the lavender lady very often things will be moved when they shouldn't be you know so and again mostly auditory hauntings a lot of people will hear people talking they'll hear conversations in another room and there's no one there um there's very often a man in a suit that people will see either sitting in what's now the dining room that used to be an office and in the the bedroom where multiple people died they'll see a man walking into that room and there's no one there oh yeah so it's definitely still a haunted house but it it sounds like it was very much a cursed house there's just so much that happens to it and down in the in the Limestone Limestone Caverns is particularly where people can feel malevolent spirits and again sometimes referred to as the gates of hell because they're everywhere because they're everywhere that that I could see where there could be a different set of spirits down there because the Limestone and then the house Spirits a separate thing yeah and there and there was so much debauchery that happened in in the Limestone Caverns you you know who knows what they got up to down there and the tour guides for this place are supposedly fond of taking people deep into the dark caverns and then saying underground no one can hear you scream and if we've said it if we've said it once we've said it a thousand times you know stuff sticks to to land stuff sticks to where the trauma happened yeah and stuff sticks to also what it thinks is home yep and the little boy that was born to The Prostitute that was locked in the third floor Attic in the servants quarters he lived there till he was about 30 years old and then he was buried in a grave that only says limp and it's probably still there and he's probably still at that property yep people will see him they'll see him often there's pictures you can see of his face peering out the attic windows and people will hear him running around the floors upstairs so he's often heard the whole family is still there they're still there there was so much that happened and the dog people will hear the dog barking in the basement so it has been you know it was purchased in 1975 and uh turned into an inn and a restaurant and it still is today and the the brewery is a haunted attraction that seems to be more of a like your modern Carnival day haunted house but they will then take you to the the LMP mansion and you can talk to to a medium there uh she says there are nine different spirits in the home damn yeah one time a woman was in the woman's bathroom I guess at the home and she saw a man peer over the stall and she said he kind of looked like he was wearing like a a suit and an old hat and she thought he was kind of a perv and when she got out of the bathroom there were just two people at the bar and she said I hope you got an eye full and both they and the bartender were confused because no one else had gone into the bathroom so who knows like you said they're still there people still see these gentlemen walking all around the house and sometimes they'll report smelling the perfume of the lavender lady or seeing a woman in lavender walking people will always they'll always be there they'll always be there so much happened and who knows what's going on down in those Limestone Caverns but there was definitely a lot of bad juju here for a family that seemed to have it all they lost it quick they lost it very quickly that's a good way to put it so what a great story right interesting stuff who would have know for a stoner I I was kind of interested in the whole beer family Saga right right but yeah so that's it our there's our stories East first West from Florida to Missouri 29 in the books man 29 way to go next one's going to be the big three damn and we're g to have some uh new and interesting
