Story Time with Tom and Mike hi thanks for having me on guys I would just like to point out we're East Coast heavy tonight so you know the West Coast doesn't stand a chance my friend oh all you need is one of me over here on the West Coast because it is definitely the best coast oh we're so excited to have you here by the way I I couldn't wait in fact I didn't sleep well and I had butterflies in my stomach about for about an hour prior to the show and I was like I was looking at my email and I was like when it comes up should I click it right away or should I wait like would that be weird if I just clicked it immediately like I I'll check out this game I downloaded last night this isn't holding my interest at all oh [ __ ] what I'll go out for another cigarette you know it was terrible I admit I smoked several bowls doing the same thing waiting for the email when we went on your show just recently yeah the episode title it's episode 139 the guacamole debacle yes guacamole did come up if I remember correctly several [Music] times are those peeps Easter's coming treats are out I am about to snack on tropical burst peeps so I will be ready to review those momentarily it's a peep lollipop now that's a stoner treat stick right there you just need a chocolate fountain to go with it yeah it's it's a long wooden stick with four different colored peeps on it is impaling a marshmallow peep part of the Easter tradition uhhuh and then you always eat them but first oh all right I am not a peep fan but I'll take your word for it I'm not either but it are do you have them in like royi Biv order um this is just how they were bought oh they're not in royi Biv order okay but I will say I did get something I'm trying something new they tropical burst what the hell is that monstrosity i g to find out but I got to eat the lollipop first and then I'm gonna give a taste to the tropical burst peeps so I have Peeps and then I have my pretzel crisps very nice so you've got your Munchies I do I belong to a Facebook group called um aggressively bad eating or something like that I forget exactly what it's called but it's it's like just like meme posts of different stuff people have eaten that like that's like how dare you even do that to yourself one was the Cheetos milkshake ah can you imagine I can't even imagine well I am now thanks Tom but no I would prefer not to who the [ __ ] would drink a Cheetos milkshake ew that's like crossing a line you could not get me stoned enough no I don't care what it is you could give me Willie Nelson weed and I'd still be like yeah I'll pass I am not eating a Cheeto milkshake I'm with you although that taco from Taco Bell with the chicken shell sounds pretty [ __ ] good right about now you know like that fu yeah hell yeah you have to be pretty stoned but at the certain point yeah you have to hit a certain point you have to be like smoking all day and really good [ __ ] like stuff that like sparkles when you look at it you know what I'm talking about oh yeah that's come by yeah Snoop Dog or Mike Tyson weed yeah do you know he has a brand of uh THC gummies yes and they're shaped like ear po Field's ear with a bite out of it yeah yes I'm alternately amused and disgusted both ways yeah it's about as tasteful as OJ's book I didn't do it but if I did here's how I would I think the only way I'd be okay with it is if it was a Vander hollyfield right yes if evander's okay with it I'm okay with it I I like Tyson I do and I'm happy that he's found peace he's into the weed he's into peace I mean he looks badass with the beard have you seen him lately with the beard no I haven't man's looking man's looking pretty good but I'm I'm happy that he's found some semblance of of he seems to be happy and I anybody that wants to grow weed and find happiness I am down for yeah I agree well apparently he he made up with Holyfield a long time ago and recently came to him and it was like okay do I have your blessing to do this and Holyfield was like yeah all right okay I'm sure there was some monetary transaction involved as well that probably sweetened the pot so to speak well then I'm gonna stick with I'm amused I'm I'm G to goes firmly with amused then yeah I think I think it's it's kind of cute in a way you know it's almost like an apology to the world like yeah I know I was [ __ ] up like I don't know yeah I kind of look at it that way too I mean it was 25 years ago he was in a terrible place you know I like to extend Grace to people um often to the point where they don't deserve it but yeah that might be a fault on my part there's nothing wrong with Second Chances but there is a point where you're being taken advantage [Music] of I want to know what everybody is smoking today ah yeah so so we're gonna we're gonna actually start with with our our guest Tom so Tom what are you smoking today today I am smoking Hawaiian Haze o I like that have you ever guys have you guys ever tried it I have not interestingly The Strain I am smoking today is Pineapple Express and that is a cross of Hawaiian with train wreck oh okay okay so this is a cross of Hawaiian and Hayes obviously um I actually pulled up a wiky leaf.com article about it says many strains have exotic names While others have Exquisite tastes then there are those that possess Those whom possess both such as Hawaiian Haze wow I don't know who wrote that but that was hard to read so how is it for you as an experience uh it's very energetic uh it's pretty creative it makes me pretty chatty of a lot of dry mouth dweed yeah definitely day we not too many munchies although I am haven't eaten yet so I'm a little hungry but uh a spiked level of paranoia I will be honest and that's not because you're hanging out with two awesome witches no no you guys actually comfort me and put me at ease I was a little nervous but yeah I feel very comfortable with you guys no last night you know what it was it was La last night this morning who [ __ ] knows um I decided I wanted to make my bong more presentable so I that can be a challenge sometimes depending on how long you have let that bong marinate I let it go way too long I'm talking probably like a about six months worth of residue oh you sound like me I'm terrible yeah I just let it go I just let it go and it's so bad already and I just cleaned it last night see that's what I want L are like brand new clean all the time well I have all you need is rocks like rock salt and water or I mean alcohol alcohol yeah but it's still it's a chore it's a chore let's let's be honest here it isn't chore but it's worth it and and I think it also depends on the quality of the piece that you have because a lot of these bongs are made out of cheep [ __ ] glass that's [ __ ] glass that's porous it's porous like you really need to the good Boris silicate glass you need you need good glass see now my my version of dirty bong water is like so black you can't even see through it yeah I I I take it Beyond I I I'm one of those you should have taken that away from me four months ago and clean it she tend to throw them away she used to throw them away throw away before I'd clean them I was just like you know what [ __ ] it I'm just gonna go buy a new one because I just can't even get that clean because I would I would use pieces until they were so clogged you couldn't pull a off them anymore yeah I've done that in fact last night or not last night but a couple days before I took the stem and I have like a big huge industrial siiz bag of of pipe cleaners and I'm like in there with the thing and I'm cleaning the stem because I realized that it had extruded over time to take up half the circumference of the inside of the [ __ ] stem pulled out I pulled out a pound of what looked like raw like straight cancer just yeah yeah it was horrible and and then I remembered I remembered the fact that there were there were days in my life when I did when you used to smoke that yeah yes yes me too I've known people that smoke that Lea would never do it I Lila would never do it no I'm not a fan I I have been very privileged in my life to not really ever be short if I didn't want to be short yeah um so I haven't really had to worry too much about it you had mentioned you were smoking um Hawaiian Haze yes and I'm smoking Pineapple Express made famous by the Seth Rogen movie Pineapple Express and it is also a uh a Hawaiian descendant I believe it's a train wreck and Hawaiian cross it's also very uplifting I like it because it helps me to stay energized and focused and helps to lessen some of that social anxiety you know you're very easy to talk to Tom but I'm definitely a a Hermit type person I don't do great in social situations just as shell and so having something that helps me to feel a little more social and and upbeat is is definitely key here so I like it for that it's pretty tasty too now I went out today I went to the store this morning I you know the rush of my day I woke up late had to go to the weeds store had to get my snacks but I came across three things that i' never heard of and you know how I like the combination of high THC content and I've never heard of it before something new that's right what' you find you probably both have probably heard of at least one or more of these so I got this uh biscotti super fire anything was super fire in the name and I so we've talked about how um most places around here provide awesome cust customer service and they will talk to you about weed for days I said to the guy he's like well you know there's this biscotti super fire I go is it super fire and he goes he just looks me dead in the eye he goes Super fire and what in that like Stoner we guy behind the counter way I love it I love dispensary employees they're so laidback and cool no exception yeah where are you guys finding these exceptional I feel really bad for my state here I've had some great weed tenders some bud tenders but for the most part the bud tenders here just they're not that interested next next East Coast is the best coast these people want I mean if they were allowed to smoke in the store they'd be like hey you want to take a couple puffs let's both try it together here you know puff puff pass kind of thing they're that friendly and willing to assist you now the grow stores the garden centers where I get like my soil because I I grow in dirt you know get my soil I get my nutrients they're pretty cool they'll talk to me for days on end about weed all aspects of it but not so much in the dispensaries you guys are very lucky with your bud tenders yeah yeah but there's more there's more so then he was like well we got this stuff called runs and I was like oo like the candy and he goes absolutely like the candy he goes it even has like a light candy flavor I'm like okay you better not lie to me he lied you know how I get [ __ ] about the the name versus the actual taste but this is 35.77 THC so I don't give a [ __ ] if it tastes like dog ass you have got some amazingly high THC out there I don't care if it if it tastes like a dog's ass I'm smoking the whole a and I'm gonna love 35 that's great7 wow and there's more I got one more this one's called Mac one and this one this is a hybrid by the way oh I forgot to tell you so biscotti super fire is an indicia and then runs hybrid and this Mac one is a hybrid but this one 36.2c sh I was this close I think that's such a coincidence I was this close to getting Mac one today really this close yes and then I I wrapped it all up with a pre-roll this is also infused with butter with D's not te's that's right but not butter the good stuff the good stuff and this one is like 51.5 n yummy yummy my God I'm guessing you're a medical patient in PA yes Tom now do are what's available able in Pennsylvania for medical patients retail it depends on the dispensary but a lot of times it's like some store product like it seems to be like products that are that follow certain companies like for example they grow their own kind of thing I think so yeah or they get it from this another National supplier or something and just slap their their logo on it for a fee or whatever you know you know how how that [ __ ] Works basically but it's kind of like when you buy the generic brand of beans or the you know the Boston baked beans and it turns out to be they were canned in the same Factory using the same source so you know it's just a matter of what labels on it right they just put a different name on it that's what you're paying for and a lot of times I think you're right that's what's happening with a lot of the a lot of the Cannabis that goes out you know I don't I don't think that's the case here though in massachus it's because a lot of these places um like that one place I like Happy Valley up in Gloucester they grow on site where their retail establishment is and you park your car and you get out of the car and as you're getting out of the car that smell hits you like a wall because in one area is their grow warehouse and then the other area is the retail place a lot of these a lot of these places here they they grow in production for their own store and then like you go to one store and you can buy some from the other store you know they kind of swap their brand but a lot of the places here each each establishment has their own grow if you want to know what the color green smells like go to a cannabis Warehouse where it's wall toall plants it's a distinct Aroma you'll definitely know what green smells like if you go to some place that grows cannabis for sure now do they have um any type of distillates or concentrate on any of the like the shatters or Butters yeah they have a a fair uh amount of that I I find their lack of stuff kind of frustrating and to be quite honest in Pennsylvania at least the the pricing the price point is so high that I without incriminating myself find that it's it's better not to go to a dispensary understandable can you say what roughly what like a gram is in a dispensary per gram let's see let me the some math here oh do how do they know do they normally sell it in higher amounts like half they'll sell it in three and a half gram s grams and sometimes in in in like 14 grams okay so nothing more higher than that I I'm actually kind of glad we brought this particular thing up because I wanted I have a [ __ ] today and I wanted to mention this [ __ ] and it is about exactly what you're talking about and I have my receipt from this morning I go to two two different stores one's a little bit further away one's closer today I went to the closer one because I wanted to get with you guys you know the both of these stores will advertise an eighth for $60 3.5 grams for 60 bucks which first of all remember the days when you could get 3.5 for 30 bucks where are those days yeah exactly 3.5 for 60 bucks now if I go to the one that's about 20 minutes away my fave plays they say 60 bucks you roll up with 60 bucks you get your eighth you walk out now the place I went to today that happens to be closer you get a eth for 60 and then you get to the register and the tax is on top of it so at the first place the 60 includes the tax at the second place the 60 does not now granted I got more I got a couple of eths today but my total should have been x amount of dollars sales tax for cannabis 1338 marijuana excise tax 2301 local marijuana tax $642 my total taxes for the day just taxes alone were $ 4280 they kind of hide that here in California you just get the price that you pay they don't tell you how much of it is taxes it's it is quite a bit and the eights here $60 that's that's more for higher end stuff do they have lower cost eights or is it just $60 straight across the board well my favorite store when when they say $60 the tax is included and you just pay 60 straight they are also the place that has sales all the time so I can sometimes get an eighth for either 39 or 45 as opposed to the 60 if you catch the sale the way they advertise between the various retail establishments is they make it look like everybody's charging 60 and E and they're not because some of those places already include the tax and some put the tax on top of that why be Shady [ __ ] that is my issue like their weed is not any better than the store 20 miles up the road but yet I have to end up paying like [ __ ] $72 after tax when if I go up the road it's 60 [ __ ] dollars flat even which is still highway robbery ours is graded you can buy you can buy lower-end MIDI and higher end and it will be different prices you know down to as little as like $25 an eight you can obviously it gets cheaper as you buy in larger quantities so if you're buying an ounce you're G to pay much less Kinda Yeah but not really here and also the 36% THC weed is the same is the same price as the 19% THC weed that would be different here it's not there's no G 60 and e period 60 and E what you get is it like that in Pennsylvania too is it all one one price for everything it is yeah it's about it's about volume and brand so whatever the brand sets it as it doesn't matter what the what type of if it's a CBD or if it's a type of strain or whatever it doesn't matter how much THC is in it price is the price a flat price yeah and it I'll be honest with you I was just doing the math here while you guys were talking about what you're paying and it I can get the same amount of weed not at the dispensary for half if not less literally not less than that because I have a friend she's she's not a a dealer she just smokes a lot of weed and so she buys him bulk and she just gets it from somebody and I don't know that person and I'm fine with that you know uh it you know it's a very casual thing that we just hey we'll hang out and yeah cool I find it's every bit as good as the stuff that I've gotten in the dispensary if not better it probably is I that could be my imagination some when you're as fried as I am as often as I am you it's hard to gauge a high like my friend is always like I want you to try this I want you to try this you're GNA love it and I'm like and you're just like me I'm high well I'll just and I'll say like yeah I'm high like like what more do you want from me yes I'm high you know I was thinking about that a little bit sometimes when we talk about weat because I I do have a very high tolerance I I smoke for pain and for other reasons as well so for that reason I I do tend to smoke quite a bit and so a little bit some of those nuances will be lost on me as I'm smoking say like you're mentioning you know weed is pretty much weed but I do feel differences in different types of weed maybe because um I think what we've just been talking about is a huge reason why everyone needs to kind of grow their own and do that because it's vitally important that we don't let this corporate everything take over what is essentially a weed that's very very easy to grow yeah one person can grow for a co-op can grow for a group of people and everyone can get their medicine or their recreational cheaply and easily and it's clean and it doesn't have a [ __ ] ton of packaging and and I just we need to get away from that like the packages that shell was holding up those are great and all and it has a lot of information on it but they are like environmental Killers there's too much there's too much packaging there's too much taxes there's too much government involved there's too much business involved it's a [ __ ] weed and you should be able to grow it in your garden and and it should be very easy and Le way less regulated in my you should be able to walk into the grocery store and just buy a [ __ ] stock of weed and it should be by the pound and you just buy the whole plant NE have a celery you want to go to Gourmet Grocery Store and get your Gourmet stock of weed yeah you know that's called Whole Foods that's right Whole Foods for weed full weed I would totally go to I would totally buy some potted weed plants just to to take them because then I don't have to worry about the initial process which is always the hardest part you know is is is getting started um sort of a jump start to that and then I learn as I go you know harvesting from the next to the next plants come to me to Die the starting isn't the hard part the getting it going getting the seed going getting it to to start that's not the hard part the hard part is okay now that the is like a foot and a half three feet four and a half feet tall now what and then it [ __ ] just dies because I just I don't I I just that green thumb is not a part of me I guess but anybody could grow it and should be able to grow it I know in New York right now it is legal for recreational as well as medical and medical patients can grow but legally they're not allowed to grow in New York yet until the dispensaries get first crack that's some [ __ ] it is some [ __ ] but you know of course they want to give the business time to get established before they allow people to grow their own and I think that's complete and total crap because it's very difficult for people to find it whether they're medical or recreational at this time and I think people should be allowed to grow it and I just think it's ridiculous what they're doing now I would like to point something out that I think is very interesting hard to ignore is that you know pot is easy to grow mushrooms are easy to grow you know sort of sort of got to do that sterilization thing really well right but what I mean is that they're they're they're things that that take on in nature a a very a very easy stance on Survival as opposed to something more complicated like a more like Niche plant you know so these these things like what's another one that the Moss that grows on wheat OT oh yeah that that uh also will give you visions and can kill you in in larger amounts yeah you don't really want to [ __ ] around that no but yeah I mean there you know and then you know other stuff like iasa which is like a brew or a formula but that's a little more complicated in my opinion I'm talking about stuff that you just pick up off the ground and pick up yeah exactly and and it's interesting How the Universe provides us some of its most profound tools for understanding it right there on the ground literally growing in [ __ ] which is a metaphysical joke is such a wonderful joke as a metaphysical on a metaphysical level it's like all right here's here's here's the thing you're going to learn more from [ __ ] than you ever learned from anything from anything else [Music] wow I got this Chillum this morning and it's called fourth 13 Diesel and this one is tapping out at 31.7% THC oh yeah that's my size queen oh wow so I'm gonna take a puffer two off of this and get ready to talk about some ghosty ghosts I think this is Shell's way of saying we've been talking too long and we need to get into the ghosty spooky part we do well yeah we definitely do definitely do do you want to start us off with yours Tom sure so I have quite a bit of notes so I'll try to file this down into the the most interesting stuff so this podcast stays under six hours I grew up in a house in Hershey very old house I would say at this point it's probably well I guess it was probably built in like 1890 1880 something like like that old farmhouse brick uh really nice steepled kind of roof like a like a uh what they call a um there's a term for it a a chapel Roof oh okay or that's not quite the right term for it Cathedral it's a cathedral like it's really steep yes yeah very steep like two and a half stories high or something like well not that high but I'm terrible with that kind of [ __ ] that's okay but big especially for a kid probably yeah it added another story to the house completely and and it was a huge Attic So this house I moved in there when I was in kindergarten and when it first when we first moved in I don't remember anything really particularly awful happening this seemed to happen when my my sister and I got older we started H right around the time she was probably eight and I I guess that would have put me at about 12 maybe younger than that uh we started having shared dreams about some entity that lived in the basement and made this horrible sound like a locust that sounds terrifying yeah and and I remember I remember in my dream which I never told her until she told me hers because it was right around the same time too my dream I was down in the basement and and it was sort of an unfinished basement with a lot of tools and stuff and and I was staring at a a a photograph of a bunch of World War II pilots in uniform standing in front of a plane and as I'm looking at it I hear this voice say those are all the people who in the war who went missing and I and then it gets dark and I look up and there's this faceless glowing white entity standing there and I was terrified and I woke up you know screaming oh yeah um and then and then that same night I had dreams about Locust noises coming from the basement well then my sister like a week later is like I had this crazy dream about the basement and there were like these Locust things living down there and they were like made out of like shifting white light no way and I was like that's so yeah and I was like that's super [ __ ] up that's a lot like the dream that I had but that's that's just surface level [ __ ] did your basement make like in in your waking state did the basement make any type of weird noise is there some sort of like real life basis why you guys might might have both been dreaming about that type of noise no it did not um that's wild yeah and and it was I don't believe it was during a time of year when the locusts were active either um yeah because that's something you guys would have been able to place if if you know right now did she see I I'm curious about the pilots that you saw did she see anything similar to that or was it more the sound that she remembers she remembers the sound and something like a shapeless entity wow um yeah so yeah I I actually called her the other day to get get some more details on some of her stories and she gave me a doozy which I'll tell in a moment but yeah so this house it seems like stuff mostly happened during the winter interesting yeah like I feel like maybe the was thinner there for that place or something there were two entities there was uh Alice we called her Alice um I was I remember I was sitting in my living room watching TV one day and my my mom and my sister this house is sort of divided into four quadrants rooms you know they're all equal size and there was the front room which was in the front left and then to the right was the the the living room and then back from that was the the dining room and then sort of wrapped around on the other side of the staircase was the kitchen so you couldn't see one room from the other so my my my mom and my sister are playing some board game in the in the dining room I'm in the living room watching TV and I happen to look over and I see this little old woman standing at the the base of the stairs and she's smiling at me and she's completely translucent and glowing like a blue color wow holy [ __ ] what did little you do well I was about I was about 14 so I wasn't that that young but I just kind of went wow and then it went away and and then I turned to my sister and I was like did you guys ever see anything weird in the house and they're like like what it's like like an old lady and they're like oh yeah that's Alice oh nonchalant like yeah like they had already been seen that they knew her they're old friends why did they or Alice was Alice just what they decided to call her or was there someone that they were able to trace it back some real person named Alice the woman who lived in the house prior to us was named Alice okay and she died in the house okay I believe she fell down some stairs and broke something but I I mean you know I was very young when I moved in and I really should have called my mom and done some more homework on this because I don't know the answer to that but yeah I I think because we had a nextdoor neighbor named Maryann who who told us about Alice and how nice and kind benevolent a woman she was and it definitely matches up with my perspective of the person or entity that I saw you know was that the only time you saw her yeah although I strongly believe that she kept a watch on the place like like she protected us and she had something to protect us from because there was another entity called the vo I call the void sister I told that to her and she said that's about a good enough name for it you know so she's seen the void as well as Alice oh yes was the void in the shape of a body so to say or just more like a black blob a blob okay yeah uh definitely I if I had to name it I would say some kind of shadow person or iteration of Shadow persons I'm getting chills this oh it's horrifying so this thing just it just radiated darkness and a and anger and en just negative energy like hate it was it was like a personification of fear where would you where would it normally appear did that at the bottom of the stairs as well or in different places in bedrooms in bedrooms yeah oh especially in the Attic bedroom he'd like to show up in bedrooms it showed up in bedrooms I don't know why I'm calling it he um yeah yeah I remember one the the the mildest of the stories was my experience so I'll go from there I I lived in the atct room until I left for the Army in 97 or 96 somewhere in that vicinity and uh I was um up in my room and that I just opened my eyes and there was this Darkness floating over me and it was just so consuming and I was like and I remember looking at it and going I'm not afraid of you [ __ ] you and then I closed my eyes on went back to sleep did did you notice if it went away or did you just not give a [ __ ] at that point I was like [ __ ] it I've lived in this house this long I've seen so much [ __ ] up [ __ ] you know this mine was a later encounter you know and I just decided I was like and this is weird and my one friend uh from from uh Peru often tells me this is true is that I'm protected somehow there's something there's an entity and I'll talk about that in a minute too there's an entity watching over me I don't know why I don't know why maybe I have something important I'm supposed to do I don't know but yeah or someone an ancestor looking out for you or something that they want you to do yeah I have my theories about who it is I have two theories but that's getting ahead of myself so I this thing yeah it's floating over my bed and I'm like I remember say to it [ __ ] you and then just closing my eyes and rolling over and being like and the next morning my eyes were all funky and like gum like gooey you know like honestly the the [ __ ] you is a good enough spell that's a spell right there telling them [ __ ] you and then closing your eyes absolutely you have no power over me yep exactly you have no power over me if you mean it even a little bit that's that's a very powerful Shield right there so I'm not not surprised you were able to but even with the little gunk get there you know to show that there was something there the next day I've learned even better ways magically to deal with things like that since but I another not a complex spell by any means not at all but uh so my sister told me a story just the other day she was up in that room after I moved out to join the Army and she was sitting on her futon and looking at her from across the room and she's on the phone with her husband who was then her boyfriend and um she said she said that this Shadow came off the wall and slipped down into her bed and under her covers holy [ __ ] yeah her Shadow or this a shadow just detached itself from the wall took on form and slipped under the covers and she said she said I'm never sleeping in that room I was gonna say that's when I'm done I wouldn't either I'm out I'm not getting in that bed no no way no way although maybe it would be a cuddler maybe I'd try it during the daytime no I don't want to cut I'm sorry I didn't ask permission first you can't get in my [ __ ] bed no yeah well after you hear the story about my mom then you're definitely not going to want to cuddle with this thing cuz it's nasty oh [ __ ] it's a nasty mother [ __ ] oh no I I was uh I was reading a book called communion uh a True Story by Whitley striber uh it's a story about alien abduction which is like a whole another podcast yeah it sounds Vaguely Familiar I may have touched on it when I was looking up Area 51 and stuff possibly it's got the most freaky decky picture of an alien that I've ever seen like something about it that's so haunting compared to every other picture ever seen of those types of aliens the slano ones and it just it used to enthrall me as a kid but it terrified me so finally as a teenager I decided to read it so I'm in bed and I'm reading it and I'm up in the attic room and I noticed this when you are reading or absorbing material that's highly paranormal it's like you open yourself up to it more [ __ ] happens I agree I think so too yes cuz you get yourself into that kind of state yes yeah yeah more [ __ ] happens so a lot of weird [ __ ] going on that summer and I hear what sounds to me like kids goofing around downstairs on the first floor on the porch like I'm hearing like laughter and stomping feet and I'm like what the [ __ ] so I go downstairs and I fling open the porch door turn on the light nothing out there I'm expecting like a flam flaming bag of dog [ __ ] or something some prankster or something there yeah nothing out there I go back upstairs I lock the door go back upstairs and my pass by my mom's room and I'm hearing like this really pan panicked sort of you know dialogue going on so I open the door and here my my dad is trying to console my mother who is basically in the fetal position and I'm like is she okay he's like I don't know I can't get her to calm down like let talk to her you I always had a way with her so uh always have and um I guide her out to the room the other room and we talked and she told me that this thing was hanging over her in bed and that it was just like worse than the devil she said it was worse than anything she could imagine ever oh wow similar similar to what I described and what my sister saw yeah yeah and and she said it wanted to eat her soul holy [ __ ] yeah wow yeah and and it was just so [ __ ] I mean I'm Miss I I don't even know what to say at this point it's just it's crazy the [ __ ] that I grew up watching and seeing and does your family still own that H that house no it's actually a Hair Cuttery now that's probably better people don't need to be waking up to like evil entities hovering over them or trying to climb into their bed so rude it was such a gorgeous house though I always wanted to turn it into like an an authentic Pub did you ever did did you or anyone in your family ever do any like Research into the house or the property no I should I've also wanted to actually go to the the business that it now is and ask them if they've seen anything you know like oh yeah you know just under the pretense that I'm interested in in in hearing more about their experiences in the house because I grew up here you know sure you know just shoot them an email or whatever but I imagine that Alice's neighbor is probably no longer with us but I wonder if she had ever heard anything I don't know I don't know maybe that maybe that entity is what threw her down the stairs you're not the first person to say that my friend said that to me yesterday and she was still in the house to try to protect and counteract future residents from that blob it does sound like a prote that she was there to protect especially since she was smiling at him and was seem to be very benevolent right but I love that I don't know I get the vibe that maybe that thing threw her down those stairs it's hard not to think that you know I got to kind of wonder where where that entity came from I've been so enthralled I've been forgetting to smoke kind of along the lines of of how Tom's was kind of about a a childhood home I real briefly wanted to tell you mine is a mine is a childhood home thing as well my house uh that I grew up in similar to Tom's was kind of like a late 1800s sometime in the 1890s it was built I don't know exactly if it was 1891 or 1899 but sometime in the 1890s my childhood home was built where I grew up it was kind of one of the first houses quote unquote in my little town this had been used as kind of like a a Moder day bed and breakfast or I don't want to say hotel because I mean Leila you've been to my mother's house I mean I wouldn't call it a hotel no like a boarding house type situation so it had been used as a boarding house the founder of the little town I lived in um had a daughter and he had built bu this for his daughter to run she was a single um never had children um so he buil her this house to run as a boarding house and that would be how she would kind of make her way in the world was by having borders she always had men in and out because there was a military base up the street and some manufacturing um so in the early 1900s this was a boarding house that that was essentially kind of like the main place to get a room in that little area so people in and out but she had her own distinct bedroom and it so basically she had this one particular room in the house and all the other rooms were rented out so you know fast forward to the blessed year of 1975 um this woman has now passed away in the house why do they always have to die inh house house it was much more common in the late 1800s early 1900s people didn't go to the hospital or hospice for the end of life as much as they do now yeah so yeah exactly exactly they just stayed home so she had like I don't know a relative a nephew or a niece um that kind of quote unquote inherited the house and just just kind of left it as the boarding house and just kept the renters in it for another Maybe decade or two and then again 1975 the glorious year they decided to sell it my parents buy it right before my birth like literally like a week before I was born they buy this house so they kind of make it less boarding house more we just had a baby kind of house I would say about the time I was maybe seven is probably my earliest recollection we had it in the back of the house it was is multi-story house so on the floor that my bedroom was on you'd walk up the stairs and there were two bedrooms a bathroom and then a a a room at the end of the end of the house end of the hallway there was like the whole length of the house it was this big huge room I mean actually now present day my mother's turned it into a laundry room but at the time it was not a laundry room and my bedroom was right next to that and then the bathroom was straight across from me okay I always felt like I was being watched and I mean as you know a seven-year-old eight-year-old nine-year-old even a teenager you know are you parents watching you you know I had a brother six years older always snooping on me but I always had this like unnerving sense of being watched in that one particular spot or all over in the house never on the first floor but on the second but on the second and third floor yes but never on the on the main floor never like where the kitchen and living room it was always where the bedrooms and the attic rooms were one night with my bedroom straight across from the bathroom I very distinctly remember getting up in the middle of the night when everyone else in the house was asleep and having to go to the bathroom and being a tired little kid walk out of my bathroom and something instinctually made me look to the left down to the end of the hall oh no where the doorway to this long back room was oh no and I saw a woman standing there and I just remember screaming and screaming in everybody in the house waking up and my mother going hysterically you know what's wrong and I'm like there's someone in the house and you know everybody starts panicking and there's no one in the house kind of thing and I'm like she's there Mom she's there and she's like what did you say I goes she's there and she goes what she look like and it just looked like just like an older lady like I don't want to say that beehive but you know how in like the 40s and 50s and 60s older women had kind of that updo beehive yeah yeah that Big Bun thing on their head yeah but like like that and then like this long I don't want to say like a maid looking dress but it definitely was like a long dress with like a big apron over it and my mother was like did she you know did she look like so and you know some some she named out some things I was like yep yep that's exactly what I saw she goes she lives here go back to bed what so your your mom wait a minute wait a minute and you know my mom I do so this is very unlike her character because she is very much she thinks ghosts and blah blah blah she thinks it's a bunch of [ __ ] did she literally mean this was a person that she couldn't have how I'm very confused as a young kid I took it to mean that and in retrospect being the age I am I still still believe she meant that because you know things would happen and then it got to the point where you know as I'm 8 nine 10 years old if I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom I would start at my bed I'd make sure my bedroom door was open and the bathroom bedroom or the bathroom door was open and I would run as fast as I could would you down the straight across that hallway and i' never look to the left never ever ever look to the left um but did you feel her watching you when you did that yeah and I felt like she knew I was up going to the bathroom Qui I'm sorry quick side note like did you feel did she give off any type of like energy did you feel other than being afraid because there was someone there that shouldn't have been there did you feel like benevolence or fear or anger just just a presence she was just there she was just there and as a kid that just freaked the [ __ ] out of me the Watcher but but as much as my my mother and and my brother and and that part of my family thinks this is a bunch of papoi they believe that this woman never left the house your mom does not believe in ghosts my mother does not she doesn't even believe in the Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs that she has in her house she thinks they're beautiful portraits that The Beautiful People of Pennsylvania created and they have no purpose whatsoever other than Beauty but any she knew that that ghost was there recognized her as a resident of oh wow I you're blowing my mind here sh her name is Clara the ghost um Clara the ghost so because my mom actually went and and found her name and stuff so because we were that curious and everybody who's been at my my mother's house so you know fast forward a few years so wait wait wait wait you just said everyone who's been at the house are you trying to say they all have an experience with her my my brother my sisters my stepfather my mother um all have I have so fast forward um as you know at one point I had owned a house right down the street for my mother MH so my mother had a gas station across from her house as you know my mother currently does the half of the Year down south half of the year uh in New York my children were probably my oldest was probably 16 which would have made my youngest 13 or so at the time and my mother was in Tennessee uh for the winter and the kid and I had to stop at the gas station on the way somewhere and you know we're at the gas station everybody's going to look over and look at Grandma's house for a few minutes while we're sitting there I get in the car after pumping gas getting ready to go and my son who was the younger of the two kids goes mom why is there someone in Grandma's Attic Window oh and I'm like what like my first thought was what are you talking about Grandma's in Tennessee the house is empty then my daughter goes yeah Mom Clara's in the Grandma's window and I'm like what and I look over and I see a female figure in my mother's Attic Window wow wow when you know no one was in the house when we know and at that time I was the only one who had access to the house in the winter did you go check it out to see if there was an intruder no I knew who it was and I wasn't going in there I knew every I knew I I wasn't no fool and that's when it kind of came out that when my kids would stay at my mother's my kids would see her and I was like oh my God why didn't you ever tell me that so my kids would have experiences every time they'd stay at my mother's but like we literally were all across the street at the gas station looking over seeing this translucent figure of an older woman in the Attic Window staring out looking at us pumping gas across the street because that what it was it was like she was looking at us specifically that was the one thing I remembered about that is that it was almost like she was looking at us you know what I mean wow no I I I just wanted to to just kind of end it with present day uh my mother still does the half year in New York half year in Tennessee and my mother has rigged her house now with a camera system and things have flown across the room and she has seen human shapes kind of floating across her security camera W I love orbs let's not get into a discussion I still love them have you guys ever um challenged an entity I have not that one well I'm pretty sure that the void was was some sort of parasitic entity um do you think it attached itself to you yeah I think it attached itself to our to that place and it just sort of dwell there like I think of it as like the an interdimensional leech that feeds on fear it has no real intelligence at all it's just a parasite but in something in its biology or its cosmology who [ __ ] knows when you're dealing with higher Dimensions or lower ones um uh something that exists outside of normal SpaceTime as we understand it um isn't Bound by the same physical IAL laws and can feed off something abstract like fear and I think that something like that our brains are wired to find patterns in the in the chaos so when something is producing in a phenomenon that something must be processed and and it it we translate it into a best fit so something that we can understand better right so for most people it's just an Inky Blackness because that's like the most we're terrified we're we're we're instinctually terrified of Darkness that's true it's a safety mechanism it's the Primal brain trying to to keep us safe from our own curiosity because the world around us is inherently a dangerous place right you could fall you could you know fall off a cliff you could be attacked by a wild animal you know you could you know step on something sharp and cut your foot open which in that time and in and age was a death sentence you know yeah yeah yeah from the little demons that would get inside your blood I I think it's really interesting how much our story is kind of parallel I'm going to tell you my story and uh see if you can find where I talk about a house a staircase some Inky Blackness and family that sees things together how fun okay so I mentioned earlier the house that uh I grew up in for a little bit of my childhood it was also the house that my um my grandparents had purchased back in the early 40s and they raised their family there then my dad had it for a little while and had his young family there and then when my parents divorced he lived there off and on for a long time so this house was in our family for a good 50 plus years is this the house I've been to before yes it is oh my God I love this house this is another Ouija board story so you're going like this shell knows this house because the the hauntings here are very well known my whole family knows everyone's got a ghost story from this house my dad is one of nine children every single one of them and their spouses have a ghost story or Supernatural story about the house I have 40 plus cousins and every single one of them has at least one if not more stories of ghostly happenings I have a ghost story about this house anyone who spends any amount of time in this house will have a paranormal story to tell after they've left you just need a few hours shell spent the night so so this house was built in 1920 it's in senica Falls New York kind of right near the uh women's rights Memorial Park when I was a kid it had been a church and then it was a laundromat ironically enough and I and then the other half of the U Memorial Park is now um open green space and that used to be a movie theater there so I would kind of cut through the laundromat and the alley behind the laundromat to get to the movie theater but that's now the women's rights Memorial Park that kind of gives you a place right near there in senica Falls New York House was built in 1920 and my family moved in my grandparents had a couple young children they were pregnant with their third child and it was in the in the late 40s I believe and they found this house in senica Falls super cheap super cheap and as they were looking at the house the the couple that owned it told them part of the reason why it was so cheap they're they're telling them the story of the family before them that had owned it and The Story Goes that the couple before them had purchased the house in the early 40s and young couple wanted to start a family the husband worked wife stayed home husband comes home from work one day early unexpectedly and he's walking up the staircase now this staircase in this house has been replaced six times that I can think of which is a little unusual for any house so he's walking up the the original staircase and as you walk up the stairs you go again into kind of a great room and there's three bedrooms that come off that great room one of those bedrooms has a door that faces directly the stairs so as you come up the stairs he's he's treated to an ever increasing view of his wife and the neighbor guy having a good time in the guest bed oh no yeah so he doesn't say a thing doesn't say a word goes back downstairs goes to the back room and gets his hunting rifle and brings it upstairs and proceeds to kill his wife and the neighbor then he goes to the garage and gets a length of rope and hangs himself in the stairwell and this couple's telling my grandparents this as they're thinking about buying the house my grandparents are like why did you buy this house then and like well it stood empty for a long time it was very very cheap so we bought it replaced the staircase so staircase number two replaced the staircase redid the bedroom rooms and we had a great deal and and you know things have been a little weird but it's been good they wouldn't go elaborate supposedly my grandparents were like okay fine we'll buy the house so they buy the house and proceed to raise nine children in the house and again every single one of them has stories of things turning off and on that shouldn't Furniture being moved when no one's in the room seeing ghostly figures in particular someone in the stairwell sometimes seen as just a dark mass or a dark figure hanging in the stairwell and a young woman who particularly the younger children would see the young woman and an older woman and those are different stories so when I was when I was in my early 20s it kind of in and out of college and in and out of jobs didn't really have anywhere to go and my dad offered for me to stay at this house he and my grandfather lived there but neither of them were ever there they were both kind of off staying at other places so I figured this is a good deal I'll go stay there so I'm staying in uh not the bedroom that faces the stairs but one of the back bedrooms and one of my friends decides that she's going to stay with me all the time she doesn't exactly live there but she's never really gone either so we're hanging out one night nobody's home it's summertime so this friend's basically living with me right and she knows all the stories and as everyone does as we go there we get out my grandmother's Ouija board and we hop up on the bed and we decide we're going to do the Ouija board and see if we can contact any of the spirits it's in the house why do people think that's a good idea it's never a good idea we thought it was a great idea yeah so didn't we the time you and I hung out at your dad's house also not a good idea oh yeah and that turned out scary too right so I'm a baby witch I think everything's going to be just fine so we're sitting on the bed we got the Ouija board out we're smoking some pot nothing happens nothing moves I'm like all right let's try again you know so we set the mood we light some incense we light some candles we smoke more pot nothing happens it's getting later I'm [ __ ] bored it is hot as hell in that room again summertime New York no air conditioning super hot and stuffy so my idea is let's go out to the back porch and sit on the porch get a nice Cool Breeze we'll get high out there look at the stars and chill friend is like all right let's go do that so we get up off the bed we're getting our weed we're getting our shoes and we hear something fall and look over and the planet has fallen off the bed onto the floor and I'm thinking that's weird I'd swear they were in the middle of the bed but must have moved it when we got up and friend is like oh the spirits want us to talk to it again and I'm like oh haha right so we sit down we decide we're going to ask it questions again so again sit down in the middle of the bed put our fingers on the planchet this time it wants to move and I'm thinking okay she thinks this is funny right so I'm like okay hi what's your name and it shoots over to no all right haha funny funny so I'm like okay you don't want to talk to us don't want to tell us your name that's fine how old are you and it shoots over to no so now I'm getting a little more pissed because it's moving really strongly under my fingertips right I know she's got to be pushing it and I'm I'm just like you know this is dumb if you're GNA push it at least make it funny or scary or something this is just dumb qu [ __ ] with me kind of right so I'm like all right what ever so this is just stupid let's just go outside and I throw the plan grab the planet and I kind of toss it at my friend I'm like haa let's go outside let's just go smoke this is stupid and she's like okay no problem sets the planet down we both get up again we're getting ready to go and this time we hear a door downstairs slam hard enough you know when you slam a door in a small house and the windows kind of rattle it did that there's only three doors downstairs there's the front door door which was locked we're 220 somethings alone we locked all the doors there's back door locked and then there's the bathroom door which is shitty and sticks and barely even [ __ ] closes you can't slam it so I don't even know what door slammed so we're both like that's really creepy and weird and we're like I think we should maybe we should go check and kind of psyching each other up like okay we'll go check so we go out into this great room and it's got one of those pull lights in the middle of the room and we're on the far side and and we've got to kind of go to the pole light in the middle and then the stairwell is on the other side of the room only it's really pitch black over by the stairwell darker than it should be there's a window near us and the moonlight's coming in but it almost seems like it stops halfway and it just literally seems too black on the other side and it almost seems like it's moving and I'm thinking I've smoked way too much [ __ ] pot so I'm kind of inching forward all creeped out and I pull this cord to turn on the light and the cord comes off in my hand and I'm short there's no [ __ ] way I'm reaching up there to get this cord and I'm like I think it's gotten even darker over there I'm pretty sure it's even blacker now at this time my dad has taken out the staircase again and has replaced it with a RW iron spiral staircase it's not safe to walk on even when you can [ __ ] see I'm not going to go down it in the pitch black there's no way plus that's kind of creepy black so I'm thinking you know what I'm too stoned I'm going to have my friend lead obviously I'm seeing things she's probably can see just fine so I turned to look at her to follow her down the stairs and she is staring wide eyy mouth open at the stairwell and she looks at me and she says do you [ __ ] see that why is it so dark over there and I'm like oh [ __ ] no nope nope nope and I push her back into the room shut the door behind us and I lock it I'm like no no there's no way there's no way shut the door lock it turn around friend is now standing in the middle of the room staring at the floor next to the bed and I'm like oh [ __ ] what now and I look over and the Ouija board's on the floor and the plan chat is on no and we had left it in the middle of the bed I knew for a [ __ ] fact we had left it in the middle of the bed at this point I'm losing my [ __ ] I'm like you know what I have never done the [ __ ] room cleansing banishment and sealing in my entire goddamn life we we threw everything we had sat in the corner with our sage and our Sal and our crystals smoking pot all night long we're like I am not leaving this room ever the Sun finally comes up we stretch we're like okay obviously we smoked a little too much we psyched ourselves out that was dumb open the door everything's fine the house is full of sunlight go downstairs we are like half giggling half kind of scared still joking with each other like oh haha that was so stupid we make some coffee and we're like all right let's go on the back porch my dad had a whole garden in the back right lots of tomato plants some other plants there's was fenced in kind of really private in the back the porch I wanted to go to so we get our coffee we go to the back porch we sit down we're kind of joking with each other still and I notice that some of the plants are trampled so I go over and there's a there's a tree on the one side next to the fence on the off side of the garden and right near that tree a bunch of like three four plants are trampled like what the [ __ ] did a raccoon or a dog or something get in here but there's bootprints in the dirt and next to the tree there was some cigarette butts where those cigarette butts when you looked up you could see my bedroom window and you wouldn't be seen I don't know what the [ __ ] was going on that night but I'm glad we didn't leave the bedroom yeah I do know that you know I was not that particular friend thank God because I know that friend didn't want but I know um one time I stayed at that house and I believe I ended up sleeping well we'll call it that on the first floor maybe the first floor in a back bedroom I was in a back bedroom at the back the house yes that's where the rifle was kept in this supposed murder suicide story I joke and I say oh yeah I slept at laya's Dad's house I did not sleep at Lila's dad's house I laid in bed frightened for my life all night until dawn at Lila's dad's house sleep no there's something there that is angry and mean and it wants to take it out on everybody there and I did not like being there I remember being up in that second floor big room great room getting really high with your dad and the higher I got it was almost like the more scared I got to be up on the second floor that is that is the most oppressive house that I have attempted to sleep in because it was whatever's there wouldn't let me sleep I almost felt like laying in bed that there was just something above me just kind of like growly and you know you ain't [ __ ] sleeping you [ __ ] [ __ ] like kind of like that attitude and I just it was fun to hang out with your dad and we had a good time but it it is not a place that you are going to get any sleep at like a spider yeah and and much like your house Tom it has both good and bad I think like I as scary as that situation was for me looking on it I almost feel like it was just trying to keep me from going out back I feel like it was just trying to keep me from leaving the house whereas I felt threatened at your dad's house I was scared people have had both experiences there are both kinds that happen there now I've done digging when I was younger I tried to find you know if there's any history of a murder suicide there and I couldn't find anything then and I figured now I have more tools at my disposal I would try again and so I did look and I did find um that there were murder gun murder shotgun murder and hanging suicide right around the time period in the 40s I found it in the county coroners reports for Sonica Falls but I couldn't find any news articles or anything and I would think that double murder suicide would be big news in that period of time right and so I don't know but everyone in my family knew that story some of the neighbors knew the story I mean it was common urban legend now my father is a well-known teller of tales he does have a book published he does have some poems and short stories published and is known to Spin A Yarn so could he have heard something and embellished it and then other people heard it and picked up on it maybe U but he was a kid when this story started so I don't know I did also find now this is fun I did find a true tale A True News News tale back in 1896 um before that part of santaa was built so 1896 I found a newspaper article titled killed a woman and himself so a man named Thomas Pelton was apparently pissed off because Minnie Manel had scorned him and she had said nope don't want you around he then went and killed her and then killed himself at a place Edward minder's Farm the minders farm and both were in the employ of Mrs minders from that farm and the newspaper article says quote he was infatuated with her but she gave him no encouragement he threatened a few days ago that he would kill her now two fun coincidences the minders farm is where my house was built on minders Street H and this article that I found I was researching just recently and I looked at the date the date was March 16th 1896 guess what day I found it that's right because you texted me and you were like oh my God this was today and I was like whoa no [ __ ] March 16th so something very similar did happen in that area and I can find some hints that maybe what had supposedly happen in the house could be true but no definitive proof but some interesting coincidences now the question is how do you take someone with a really scientific mind frame and explain that to them in a way that will satisfy their rigorous rigorous demands for reality because I have never figured that out you can't you can't I like to think I have a little bit of a scientist mindset I I like I do too and I can't expl that and I think that's why I like these stories why why sh and I like talking about them because I don't know what happened could I have knocked that off yes could my friend have been pushing it yes but I've also had my own experience at a completely different time in that house which makes me believe that not only is what I experienced some crazy [ __ ] but that everything Leila experienced before and after absolutely happened because having my own experience there makes me not doubt any of her experiences there you know what I mean yes yes and that's what I think is interesting about all of our stories is the components that are so similar and happened at different parts of granded all in kind of the East Coast but happened in different cities happened at different times but there's so many similarities and you and your sister had the same experiences people that go to that house in Sena Falls all have very very similar experiences so many your family so many people in that place how do you explain that you know you can't just explain it off that one person's nuts you know we can't say well Tom's nuts Tom's not nuts because Tom has a sister who has similar stories you know what I mean I mean once you start having multiple people have these experiences you can't just negate them as easily anymore oh yeah and it and it wasn't just my sister you know my mom I had friends my sister had friends family members just you know it was an ongoing kind of thing where where people would be like yeah I saw something weird upstairs you know I don't know what the hell it was that was kind of freaked me out I I kind of don't want to hang out here anymore you know like science or not it's just hard to it's hard to kind of blow it off when so many people are having so many experiences you know what I mean there is there is a cult of science that is very very present in the world where um I want to be careful how I say this because I don't want to come off as a complete whack whack job but we can we can lay things at science's feet for testing but not everything is appropriate to be tested under those rigers I get what you're saying absolutely I feel you and and people say well you can't and I say you can that's what magic systems exist for the problem with magic systems is that they deal with the infinite and you can't account for the infinite in math so you're never ever going to crack the code no matter how hard you try no matter how much you want to quantify this you can't and that's going to drive you [ __ ] crazy and it's the reason that we're not exploring the Stars right now honestly it's the reason why we need art why we need Phil ophy why we music because all of those are forms of magic and it's I know they can be Quantified music obviously has a lot of parallels to math but that's why we need Eminem yes we do we need all different kinds it's true we need all of that and and I I do have a very mathematical brain I like things to fit into a pattern I like things to make sense I like to be able to find the Wise and the reasons and I guess that's maybe also why I'm so interested in the things that don't seem to fit you know they're fun I like the anomalies I don't consider myself to be superstitious or like I'm very skeptical but in felt experience can't be denied um just because it can't properly be Quantified does not mean that it doesn't exist you know what's that okay so we all know uh when you first hold your child for the first time there is a release of o o oxytocin that bonds you to that child for life okay so that first few moments after the child is born it is critical for Mom and mom and baby to have touching contact right skin to skin bonding right now now that doesn't describe anything about how it feels and no language that does is quantifiable oh on scale of one to 10 how happy are you totally subjective there is no way to measure it there's no little ruler that you can go oh they're are five1 okay good so you know and can you see that too oh no I can't repeat it you know why because it's totally subjective it it exists in a realm of abstracts and we don't know how to deal with that scientifically and we have built up this Cult of materialism in the west that is very you know very much an alter to Ego actually uh you know it's it it's the it's the you buy it now don't wait order today you might have these side effects that whole sweep of society that we're looking at with all the get it in three days exactly all the culture all the [ __ ] that's that's swarming around us constantly making us forget what we really are probably by Design to some degree yeah that you know they want you to forget about that they want you to forget that that that that shit's going on you so maybe that's why you like McKenna so much wasn't he all about that like letting go of that materialism and basically go out and touch grass personified yeah yeah he was very he was very much your hippie yeah and and and you know you have to when you listen to people like that you know you have to then ask yourself like when is the last time I stood Barefoot in the grass and why does that feel so amazing because you're I think because you're connected to your roots to True Earth very much so you know to soil to to Clay we almost to feed on the grass time right I love spring for that I liked your analogy with the magic of holding your child and being able to describe it in scientific terms that's something that I do with the moon like I love the Moon the Moon is so was just the full moon last night I danced under it you know it's very very magical to me and just because I know that it's the light of the sun I know why eclipses happen I I know the science behind it but that doesn't make it any less magical I it it almost makes it more magical to me understanding it and then standing underneath it and still feeling that Rush of emotion that that Rush of happiness and joy just seeing all that you know Moonlight shimmering on everything it's well yeah it's built into the human consciousness on such a deep level it's so primordial and and the energy that that you're experiencing you know what you're seeing is is like a model of a bigger system so what you're seeing on this level is happening on a su level and on on a higher level in a similar fashion so the exchange of energy the way everything's shining and it's kind of like this little box right that just has thousands and thousands of lenses and mirrors in it and if you move one Everything Changes because the way the lights interact changes the whole show like a big hologram and that's our universe in a nutshell in my opinion it's a show it's a big mirror show love we're all being we're all being shown the same image from different angles perspectives and and and under different lights and and we're all seeing the same thing and the beauty of it is that all of us are kind of like the same person just looking at it through all those different lenses and different time periods all trying to experience the same thing yeah it's one it's one Consciousness trying to cons like see itself subjectively because how can you look in the mirror if you are the mirror there has to be a me and a not me in order to perceive so we have to you know what I mean so that's why we exist in my opinion we we're like we're like education for the godhead and and that being able to actively Take A Part in the creative process involved in that is is so overwhelmingly cool and powerful and enabling and I mean there's so many ways to do it and some of them are very ritualistic based and some of them are as simple as going and taking a walk and nature they're all paths to the on the same Mountain to the same top just a different path to get there yep and and you choose what you get you put into it is what you get out of it so the more intent you put into it and the more I think with intent comes effort yes because at the end of stuff that I've done like rituals I've done I felt [ __ ] exhausted like pouring sweat you know just like I am done yeah yeah oh absolutely oh it's like taking a major test it it's the same type of energy expenditure as taking a big test you're you're you're working it's mental work but it's still work I think there's an emotional element to it as well like an emotional component that you're tapping from everything I guess so the best magic is the most exhausting magic you have to kind of raise that energy and and getting your emotions involved and and getting the getting your you know your endorphins going getting everything in your body moving towards a purpose and trying to direct that energy to something you need to involve emotions you need to involve thought you need to to kind of get and it involves a lot of pushing a lot of energy work and and that's going to manifest itself in being tired and being sweaty if you've run a marathon or Tak a the SATs yeah what was I gonna say no but we are should probably get close to wrapping up and I know we could keep going but yeah so we we've we've talked a lot about science and weed and ghosts and weird family home experiences I loved Today's Show I I think that that Tom you're awesome we loved having you here you better get back here again sometime I will we uh we definitely are are are

give you sort of like the elevator pitch is a show in which two best friends make each other laugh and entertain each other and and you with stupid theories and sketches and news of the week items and just general conversation all those on all those topics occasionally we stray into Political or well dicks yes that comes up quite a bit actually uh urethal sounding is a very common element I I love
