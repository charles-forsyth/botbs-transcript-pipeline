[Music] welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode we'll be talking about the witch capital of the USA Salem Massachusetts Salem has been a draw for witches around the world since 1977 when Governor Michael Dukakis decreed Lori cett Salem's official witch and the crowds have grown every year since how did the city become such a load stone for witches is it just a tourist trap why are witches celebrating a city that is famous for killing people who were not witches I'm Lea and I'm biased because the pilgrimage I made to Salem in 1992 was a turning point in my witchy life and I'm shell and I'm equally biased because I am currently a resident of Salem woohoo which we love because it gives me an excuse to go there all the freaking time right and there's beaches here that's all I'm saying and there's a lot of history there which is another great reason to go to Salem speaking of History I would like to start off by saying we all know Salem as the witch capital of the USA I get it I'm here but lest we not forget Salem Massachusetts is home to the National Guard it is the birthplace of the National Guard it is there is a lot of history there other than witches there's a lot of Maritime history there's a lot of history history it's one of the oldest popularized some of those buildings are freaking old and there's the Hawthorne Museum there's a lot there but what we're going to focus on is the witchy history why is a place that killed non- witches why is it such a loadstone why is it such a draw to witches today yeah why is it Mecca are we glorifying the death of these not witch women and men is it just a disi overly tourist trap now like what is it what do we feel about this I I would like to kind of start with all the answers to that depend on what what do you think you are going to experience here what what is your intention are you coming to connect with some ancient witchcraft ways or are you coming for the best witchy shopping experience of your life so the person I think we have to blame actually for the reason why it's called the witch capital is Lori cabbit it's all Lori Kitt's fault it was not known as a witchy tourist trap or a witchy destination before Lori cabbat moved there back in the early 70s and I heard a I heard a legend about how she became known let's hear it I'll tell you if it jives with the local Legend oh okay very cool so what I heard came from Enchanted Living magazine and they did an interview with Lori cabitt back in the 70s Lori cabit was living there she had a little shop and she was definitely witchy out but she kept kind of a low profile she wasn't very well known but her familiar her cat black cat named Molly Buu climbed up a tree outside her house and refused to come down and Lori wanted some help to get her beautiful little feline familiar out of the tree and no one would help her and so finally she called the local newspaper and said quote I'm a witch that's my familiar I want my cat out of the tree right now so the person who answered the phone was an editor and not only did they dispatch fire trucks to her house to help her get her cat down he also went out and interviewed her and supposedly he never answers the phone and the night that she called he just kind of felt a reason he just kind of felt like he should answer the phone that night and so he did I feel like if Lori Cabot was calling my phone I'd be compelled to answer it that's all I'm saying I have a feeling this call is is important and I never answer the phone so right right for Lori I would answer yeah I would totally be answering that yeah yeah yeah so what's the local Legend say you know funnily enough what I've heard out and about word on the street is almost the same exact story kind of minus the cat just that she called up the news one day and declared herself and that they decided to come into a story um I didn't hear the cat piece but that doesn't mean anything other than I didn't hear that in 1977 uh the then Governor Michael Dukakis called her Salem's official witch and she was even in the National Geographic in 1979 along with her coven and in 1986 she established the witches league for public awareness in order to counter stereotypical images and negative witch imagery in media and one thing that they do talk about locally is that for as long as she has had the shop in Ben in town she has been very outspoken and very forward about her spiritual beliefs and that kind of contributed to her being declared the official witch you know remember back in the day you and I were loud and proud she was just loud and proud when we were in diapers that's all you know back when people weren't so loud and proud she was well you have often said that her book The Power of the witch was your first introduction to Witchcraft absolutely and it was a lot of people's her books were some of the few that you could find that were openly witchy on bookshelves back then yeah yeah I mean she was the gateway drug man Lori gateway drug so starting in the 80s the tourism really did ramp up they were doing the Halloween ball they had the sa celebration that they would do on the Square they actually started what they now call Haunted Happenings which is a monthlong I'd call it a a party Fiesta show dumpster fire grand old good time but Haunted Happenings kind of came about in the mid 80s and has just grown into this like the Marty Gro of October October is crawling with people and every year there are thousands and thousands more which is wonderful for the city because it does bring in a lot of money and it's a lot of fun yeah really try to park for work on a random October Tuesday because it's it's brutal it's brutal that's right it is brutal on the locals I know people have to call in extra people to work people work overtime it is very very hard on the locals even though it does bring in the dollars but let me tell you the things I see the people I see and I've got to say all of what we're talking about aside to sit and look out my work window and just on the daily in October see thousands and thousands and thousands of pagans witches heathens however they identify just kind of they're doing their thing and it's great it's great it really is that is why I completely 100% agree with it being a meeting point it being a place for witches pagans heathens there's the vampire shop yeah any type of paganism you will be accepted Salem proper is a very accepting place now which is very different then it's history right so by going there we are reclaiming the space we fully understand that those people were not witches they were persecuted because they were different because they had something that the powers that be needed or wanted and that's up that's wrong so Salem basically flipped the script and made it the exact opposite the exact opposite I love that so much because honestly those Christian zealots from back then have got to be rolling in their graves Cotton Mather has got to be flipping out that witches are out and proud and walking around and taking pictures of a grave too that's right taking pictures we respect the fact that these people were not witches and that they were persecuted and we relate to that because we too are persecuted especially today I like how you said flip the script because that feels so good to me to be there nowhere else in the United States is there such a concentration of witches who live live there and who work there and who provide services and just be there just doing our due man just doing our DU like we all got a day job currently and here you can just be you and it's okay and not everybody has that freedom right and it's celebrated there and it's it's a way of reclaiming that space it's a way of reclaiming our witchiness I guess and saying that it's not okay to oppress other people using your religion or because they're different that's not good and we won't allow that anymore but you know kind of circling back to the historical factors you know I I love old creepy places and boy does Salem have them you know where else are you going to go in America where you're going to find not only cemeteries but what is it four or five actual buildings from 1626 like where Els where Els and they're just cool to look at and walk through and just kind of take it all in you know you have stepped where people have stepped for hundreds of years you walked up that same stairwell to that bedroom that someone else did 300 years ago there's something awesome about that you can go to the House of the Seven Gables yep yep or the witch house you can go to the Peabody Essex Museum you can go to these places that are so old and have so much history there and it's just amazing it's amazing what they have done and the Witchcraft tourism has helped to build places like Proctor's ledge and to build some of these Memorial sites as well but also you know if you're you're a pop culture fan you know obviously there's there's the Hocus Pocus filming sites there's the Hobie Halloween filming sites and those are cool in their own right and for different reasons so you know there's there's just a lot here history-wise and again I remember when we went to the House of Seven Gables together and I was so fascinated because I remember we saw that brick of tea that was like 300 years old like I wonder if that still tastes good obviously not it's 300 years old but like to see a compacted brick of tea from 300 years ago to me I find that fascinating other people might think I'm a weirdo but I was all about that well you're definitely a weirdo but one of my favorite things was also one of my favorite things was in that same house when we were on the tour and we were up in the attic and the tour guide had us look down at the floor at all the little indentations that were in the floor all over the place and those were actually from tours from like the early 1900s yeah from ladies shoes because all the ladies wore high heeled shoes and it damaged the floors what an interesting I mean that's still historical to me I mean that was over a hundred years ago that they were made and the house was being toured even then you know the place is just filled with these neat little details these beautiful little places and so going there and being your witchy self and being able to go to the sa ritual which for me was the first time I ever met other witches it's just special in so many different ways now as with all good things there there can be a flip side and in my opinion my personal opinion to me the flip side a little bit is some of the commercialization but that is what happens when you are at a tourist location I understand that you know Myrtle Beach s Massachusetts you know touristy but aside from that you will not get a better Pagan or witchcraft or Heathen type shopping experience in all of your bloody life in person cities can you walk from one pagan shop to another let alone 30 oh there's got to be more than 30 on Essex Street and just off of Essex Street there are some amazing amazing shops one of my favorites hi and Forge is just off of it you will find local handmade gorgeous gorgeous stuff there I love that like I can't even explain the gorgeousness it's just amazing and whatever or taste or flavor it's here it's in a store there's a store for it like you were saying you can go to the vampire store and there's a store that's just rocks and gemstones and crystals and there are readers and there are classes and yes you have to pay for them yes and let's face it if it was free these people would be overrun with hundreds if not thousands of people wanting their time and they have to be compensated for that energy somehow so I get it but just be cautious if you are paying for any classes or anything a fee is fine if it feels like extortion it probably is exactly exactly if it feels icky it's probably icky that's right but but a fee is to be expected especially someplace that has that many people but you know there's there's a lot of great things here you know you were talking about you know your favorite store I I got to give a shout out to pentagram I love my people at pentagram and they also have great readers great mediums there but food let me tell you there's some good food in this town oh yeah everybody on our Facebook page that says they're coming to sale and they're like oh shell where should I eat Casa Tequila man I had steak nachos today uh after work like there is all kinds of food all different where did we have that Divine Lobster rolled I don't even remember because you can get them everywhere you can get them everywhere they're so good but they're they're delightful I will say this here is my little caveat to the food thing the food here is fabulous but either eat indoors or if you come in the summer guard your food with your life these seagulls are no joke like like no joke they will come down and take the food out of your hand they have no no fear there no fear be warn to the seagulls but you know I I do want to say that there are great museums here as well that are are worth checking out and you and I have mentioned in the past and I again want to shout these guys out the witchboard museum fabulous place Absolut fabulous have to go every time it's amazing they rotate their displays so you know you go you go a couple different times you're going to see different boards but like there's a Pirate Museum there's a witchcraft Museum I got to interrupt I'm so sorry because I just heard that the witchboard museum had some uh ghost hunters or someone come through and I think they' have they been hearing voices have there been EVPs ghostly voices been heard in there so I heard this and you want to know what I thought of so remember when we went there and he was telling us about that most haunted Ouija board I think it was like a stranger things board my first thought was it was that damn board going nutso yeah John kak is the owner proprietor of the witchboard museum and he's amazing he will talk your ear off and it's fabulous so much information I have never known someone more knowledgeable about which boards Ouija boards Etc than this guy he told us about the one board that was sent in because people will send them haunted boards by the way if you have any haunted Ouija boards you want to send send it to us we'll take care of it PO Box 106 Salem Massachusetts what's the zip code 01970 you know haunted cabinets haunted teacups whatever you got send it our we got you we got you but yeah people send him haunted things and this one was spooky and shell you felt a really bad Vibe coming off of it right I did and you know I actually was like what is this creepy one behind glass yes and he's like well let me tell you it's the worst one here and I think we did catch a couple EVPs electronic voice phenomenon when we recorded our conversation with John but they were very garbled I don't think they said from what I understand they heard get out at the Museum I think it even says it right on the yeah it does I see it on their website um so I'll have to go back and listen to ours and see if any of them sound like get out but I wasn't 100% sure if it was just background noise but it was when were alone in the museum so I'm pretty sure they were EVPs we'll see but when I when I heard that recent story about that all I could think of was that stranger things board I'm like it had to be that man it had to be that creepy board behind the glass and he changes up the displays regularly so he's always putting up creepy stuff so definitely check that out but yeah so many good places to go one of the problems that people have with going one of the criticisms that I have heard is that it's disrespectful to the people that were killed because for some reason there's the idea that all of us witches that go think that the people that were killed as witches in Salem were actual witches and I want to dispel that right now I don't know anyone who thinks that the people that were killed in Salem were actually witches yeah neither do I I think everybody knows the truth yeah so I think that's just a little bit of an odd criticism and from what I've seen for the most part people are extremely respectful of the sem is the the um what's that one Memorial right by the cemetery with the ledges where the people put offerings the witch Memorial yeah the witch Memorial right there by the cemetery is gorgeous and extremely moving and people are always putting offerings there to these people because we understand they died because of persecution because of misunderstanding because of bigotry and hatred and not because of Witchcraft you know a couple things about those two points I want to add in I have never in all my life and and you know I was I was big on exploring genealogy and going through cemeteries all through New York state for years so I've been to a cemetery or two and I've got to say I have never seen people be more respectful than I have here and that's saying a lot considering there's sometimes over 1.5 million people here in just the month of October but I have never seen such respect no garbage no vandalism like that kind of thing thing um no walking off the path where it says Don't Walk Off The Path like people are super respectful and as far as the the witch Memorial that's right next to the Charter Street Cemetery I don't think in the five years that I've lived here that I've ever once been through there where there wasn't fresh flowers on every single memorial for every single person that was accused of Witchcraft I don't know who does it I don't know if it's the city I don't know if it's people I don't know if it's randos but not once in 5 years has there not been fresh flowers every day on those memorials the historical society and the different groups in Salem people aren't that respectful to their fam's graves for God's sakes they are very much respecting the history of this place and the history of the people that were persecuted there and I think that's very important to remember is that that's what witches do is we accept people we draw them in we understand persecution and we get it you know and and to talk about your your good buddy there uh gu's Corey that you love so much I do he was an but I really like his story I I respect that not going to speak in order to damn the man because screw you you can't have my stuff I'm keeping my mouth shut I very much respect that he invented the man right seriously so the one thing that I I kind of I find respectful yet get a kick out of with his story is you know as you are aware there's four or five sites around town where they say that that he was could have happened it could have happened he was pressed to death in case any of our listeners aren't sure Giles Corey was pressed to death he was accused of Witchcraft he refused to enter a plea so that they couldn't try him and in order to get him to talk they laid him on a stone and laid progressively more and more stones on top of him in order to induce him to talk he wouldn't do it all he said was more weight supposedly and then he died so sorry but there's there's several places around town where they claim this happened well you can only Stone a guy in one location for God's sakes they weren't moving them on the daily there happens to be a plaque about this right outside of my work and I laugh because tourists will actually go to all of these sites and pay tribute to them and you know why because at one of those sites is where it really happened and they're going to figure out you know it might not have been this one but in case it was I want to pay my respects to this it's it's more about showing respect and honoring what these people went through because yes they were not witches but they went through a hell of a lot of  for people like us who are and we do people do and and I think that's what the people who are traveling to Salem identify with they understand persecution they understand being different and on the fringes of society and having that used against them so I do actually like the fact that you will see some of these people going around from sight to site because it's almost like well one of them's got to be the right place you know and and I I like that that it's more about paying the respect than picking a spot you know what I mean we don't know this was 300 years ago I don't know where this could have happened four blocks away from where they say it did how do I know you know what I mean that's right and and the the memorial next to the old bearing Point Cemetery is relatively recent and it's beautiful and very very meaningful another recent thing is they have recently discovered within was it 10 10 years ago or so maybe 15 15 years ago nowor ledge Proctor's ledge they've discovered the actual location where the hangings took place and there is a very moving Memorial there but that just happened 15 years ago you know it's possible at some point they will discover where the jail actually was or where Giles Corey was actually pressed to death and these sites have meaning and they are being very respectfully and beautifully honored there now we're talking about sites that have meaning I would be remiss if I didn't tell you about the biggest Bull crappity story to come out of Salem OH what's the biggest Bull crappity story there was no witch dungeon there was no dungeon I understand there's one there today and you can go tour it but that it no was there a jail were they held in a jail well they were held in a jail but not in a dungeon the witch dungeon is a tourist trap friends just saying it's fun it's interesting definitely a tourist absolutely absolutely but it's not historic there you go I had to say it I couldn't help myself I don't blame you one bit now it is almost spring ostara is coming up and this is Shell's and my favorite time to go to Salem go in the late spring go in early Autumn it is beautiful it is less crowded and it is just a stunning amazing historical City to walk around in like I get that people want to come here in October like I get it and you should do it once like yeah and you know it's like Rocky Horror you got to do it once man go or many times if you're us but you know first of all when I say there's over 1.5 million people who descend on this city in a month like that ain't no joke we don't have the parking for that yeah I was going to say I think there's like 66 parking spots downtown so you're not getting one of them you're just not yeah and people need them for work and I need that for work it's cold if you do not think for one hot second that October in New England has any sense of warmth you're crazy I still try to convince myself of that and I freeze every year but like it's not warm here sometimes it snows here in October spring is beautiful you know you got the Bree the ocean you can take the ferry into Boston the Beach come in the spring people come in the summer I feel like you have a better time seeing the sites visiting the memorials going to the museums checking out the restaurants just all of it is just more comfortable when you're not wearing 85 layers and a snowsuit it is a good time to wear your cloak though you know that's the other thing you have not lived until you have walked down Main Street in Salem in your cloak and no one even looks at you weird I know it's so great that doesn't happen in New York in New York they look at you weird but here yeah no it's like it's like a Tuesday I love it there you go it's perfect all right so we've talked about amazing Salem and I do think you should go because when I went the very first time was back in the 90s and I went for sa I ended up sleeping in a van in the parking garage because I was dirt  poor but I met so many witches people that I still know today and they were of the first people I had ever met that actually practiced Witchcraft and hadb and headb covens and it was just a beautiful amazing experience you reminded me of a warning that I must give any potential visitor of Salem and I encountered this issue my first visit to Salem what's that their parking is no joke here like we talk about parking spots I'm talking about like if you are 4 seconds over on your meter expect a $25 ticket these people I feel like they have like night vision on these meters and the minute your meter is up you are getting ticketed you need to be cognizant of where you park how long you're allowed to park there make sure you pay for it because parking they are very strict and they yeah it can be costly this parking notification has been brought to you by shell from back on the broomstick please park your brooms responsibly when visiting Salem in October thank you I should get a kickback from the City of Salem for that damn it the other thing I wanted to talk about was Salem is a Mecca Salem is a load Stone it's a draw for witches and pagans because it's a place where we can be free it's a place where we can say screw you to the man into the people who would persecute us and we can be out and proud and amongst our people that's not possible in a lot of places and it's getting worse it's actually getting I feel I actually read something today and I felt like I honestly felt like I was like time warped back into like 1990 what' you read there is a place I want to say it was South Carolina that I might know which one you're talking about February 21st in um the market on the mill in Pickins South Carolina it is a venue that has you know it's like one of those small shop things you know they have it's open on the weekends or whatever and different people will come in and so you've seen those like like little markets right yes this is one of those well apparently one of the vendors is a Wiccan and was selling Pagan related witchcraft related items and they were targeted by the local Stillwater Christian Fellowship they put up YouTube videos they've harassed the owner but here's another piece that I was reading about today and this kind of pissed me off you know I'm a Gemini so you know I could flip on a dime but this got me going you know how we're all on the old book the old Facebook apparently some of these righteous folk are getting into under false pretenses getting into some of the local Pagan Facebook groups for that area finding out you know how we are you know hey you want to get together at this coffee shop or let's have a ritual here or there they're finding out about local events and then they are going and harassing these people now this is this was where I really kind of went over the edge they are shouting Exodus Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live like are you implying violence what what are your intentions by saying that where where's this going this is concerning like this is concerning because these people are whack jobs you know I don't go around preaching my and shoving it down their throat why are they trying to do that to me seriously we reported back in December M on a a group they wouldn't allow them to be in the parade yeah okay so that was um Donna Donovan so that was the Parkersburg Christmas parade in parkerburg West Virginia they are still fighting with the city over that the city would not allow the Appalachian Pagan Ministry to participate by having a float in the City Christmas Parade the city holiday parade because they didn't want their kind of people there then don't come I don't like church so I don't go this was open to everyone it was open to all faiths and they told the pagans that they could not have their previously approved float because they didn't like their kind of people all faiths but you exactly and we also talked about the Tulsa down in uh Tulsa Oklahoma the Tulsa Tulsa city council they have an opening prayer and it's supposed to be again all faiths but they had a pagan Minister come in and she gave a prayer to Medusa and the governor it's a problem now it's a problem he's calling Satanism saying Satanism is going to have a foothold now they've actually done away with the prayer they won't do a prayer now they just have a moment of silence now also I I'm sure some of you folks uh read the wild Hunt it's like a pagan news thing here's the title of the article West Virginia seeks Constitutional Amendment to codify the Bible is the utmost Authority for human moral Behavior what absolutely like what like what I cannot even I cannot even there are countries where being a witch is punishable by death I know just recently in South Africa in also in February that there's men in Zambia that are being held right now on charges of practicing witchcraft because they think that they were trying to do charms and hexes against the president so I don't know if this again I don't know if this is a Salem Witchcraft and if these men are actually witches or not or if this is some type of persecution but it's still persecution from Christians saying that witches are doing something bad so basically I think what I'm gathering here so far in talking about Salem and talking about current events what I'm gathering correct me if I'm wrong is that after 346 years not a damn things changed pretty much okay I just wanted to make sure I was getting this yeah we are going backwards in so many ways and it's getting worse the zealots are getting worse and they're they're pretty VI like you said with the the claims of Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live which isn't even the correct quote quote your Bible correctly like if I said that to you that'd be considered a physical threat like does that mean that's a physical threat to me I think it is a threat I think that's ridiculous it's based on ignorant it's based on fear and I think that's why we need places like Salem Massachusetts more than ever because this is a Bastion where people can gather where people can talk where they can speak their Truth where they can combat some of these misconceptions some of these falsehoods but here's where I get confused on all of this you know there's been a lot of talk recently you know how they do all these like census things and and polling of people things and they're finding that more and more Americans have left Christianity and spiritual and or non-religious people are rising so if there's more spiritual Pagan non-religious Folk unless Christians what the hell is happening I don't get it sometimes it's a last gasp I don't know they still outnumber us they do and around the world they are still very large in number and in power in positions of power I mean in Scotland again just recently there was an event at the Glasgow Cathedral to Mark the city's 850th anniversary Y and the Scottish Pagan Federation and the humanist Society of Scotland were both denied from participating after the church of Scotland and the Catholic Church complained I don't get it it so I read an article from the humanist Society Scotland and they said that in Scotland the humanist Society conducts more weddings than all other Faith groups combined and paganism is the fourth largest religion in Scotland and yet the Catholics and the Christians denied them from helping to celebrate glasgow's anniversary I'm dumbfounded that's all I can say like I'm dumbfounded it's got to be because it is the fastest growing religion because we are growing so quickly are we just scaring them that much yes because our religion is about thought and you have to put in the work and the effort and it's about working together and it's about accepting people for who they are and theirs is not you mean no double standard how dare you so I think right now it it's difficult it's very difficult people there was a woman in California I just lost the article future Lila maybe will pop in with the information but a woman in California lost her job because they said she was a witch and this was just within the last six months it's happening and it's it's scary and there are people in this country who are worried because they they fall into more than one category it's not just witches that are worried right we're just that's our focus of this conversation but we are definitely not the only ones right right and we need to take care of each other and and so we're going to keep shouting out these news articles and we will keep up on them you know maybe we'll put something up on our website we'll keep track of this and we'll try to reach out to these people but this is another reason why I think that everybody should come here at least once because if for no other reason you can walk around in your cloak and you can walk around in your witchy finest and and and that's okay and it might not be okay where you are but it's okay here you can wear your jewelry you can say you're a witch you can wear your pointy hat of whatever kind you like right and be accepted it is such an accepting place no matter what you are no matter who you are no matter how you are and we need that yeah I was just going to say it sounds like those are becoming fewer and far between yeah especially when things are in turmoil we need each other and we need to stick together so if no other reason I complain about parking I sometimes complain about the commercialis and the tourism but you will not find camaraderie like you find here anywhere else and there's something to be said for that and that right there is worth a trip here 100% And it is full of Tourism and there are no parking spots and it's hard to get around sometimes but it is also very very magical and so beautiful and so much history so much to learn there it's just you should go and steak nachos and pineapple coconut margaritas and really good lobster rolls everywhere watch for seos I have to say you know we're talking about that but I I need to mention I have recently found a new store okay tell us about this new store before we wrap up I love new places to shop now I happen to sometimes on occasion work in our neighboring city which is Lynn Lynn Massachusetts beautiful beach there I came across the store and you know who knew you thought all the witchy stores around here were insane Salem not the case so I'm over in Lynn the other day and I come across this store called Ravenstone shout out to these people holy mackerel the stones the gems and then of course you know me the tarot tags yeah but like I think that that sometimes some of these places and then you know there's shops in Beverly pentagram like I said in Salem my favorite store they have a sister shop in Beverly um called the zodiac tea room they do Tea Leaf readings and such there I think sometimes when people come to Salem they forget that there is some witchy experiences to have in some of the surrounding towns and cities so definitely come to Salem enjoy it for what it is but don't forget that there's hidden gems all around that are outside of the Salem City Limits such as Ravenstone in the Zodiac t- room you know I have not been to Ravenstone yet but after you got that gorgeous ring which I love and the Tarot deck because you saw the one card I had and fell in love with that deck so you got that deck you knew I was getting a Tarot deck there regardless okay oh yeah absolutely you you can't pass one of these stores without getting a deck but I looked at them online and I cannot wait to go there now they're not a sponsor or anything we just love them their jewelry blew me away I cannot wait to go pick out a piece it looks so cool I actually got this ring all their rings have a name I know how cute is it I want the Nona ring so bad I got the ring that was called Joy it is round amethyst and I am so in love with this thing I could just you know I went for the Tarot deck you know how it's like going to the grocery store you go for one thing you come out with a bunch so I went for the Tarot deck and I saw this ring and I was like oh yeah I I'm not leaving without that and you know the one thing I loved was that the gentleman there his name is Eric he basically told me everything I could possibly want to know about this particular stone and a couple of stones I asked about um he had just returned from the Tucson gem show and was like showing me all like they're very knowledgeable I guess is my point they don't just sell items they don't
