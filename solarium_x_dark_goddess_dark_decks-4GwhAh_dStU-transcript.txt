it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi and welcome to the solarium shell and Lila's herbf filled sundrenched Sanctuary where they put away their pointy hats put their Bas HS aside and lay their cursing fingers on the table what even what that means and use their cursing fingers for better uses like rolling magical joints or stirring delicious tea and today in the solarium we have a very large stack of books and oracle cards all a little on the dark side I'm Lea and welcome to the solarium and I'm shell and I have the biggest surprise for you folks ever tonight for you longtime listeners you know I'm not a fan of Oracle decks I don't know why we've talked about it before I'm sure that you can go back and listen and and find out my my distaste for them but have I got a shocker for you tonight one of the things we're going to talk about is an oracle deck that actually caught my fancy can it be so well this spooky season is full of surprises and before we get any further we would like to thank red wheel wiser for supplying us with the books and the Decks that we'll be going over tonight so thank you very much for those by the way shout out to Aaron at Red wheel we love you seriously seriously it is definitely almost s almost Halloween and it is freaking cold out and I don't know if I love it you don't even know the Northeast is one chilly place come this time of year it's like it's 80 one day and then like 59 the next G shell why you sick I don't know yeah I've kind of felt bad for you because I know you don't deal well with the cold and The Damp and it's been pretty damn cold and damp there in Salem and uh it's been pretty right oh sweet Jesus is it peopley you know you and I believe it or not folks Lea and I are kind of hermy people and US never half the planet is in Salem Massachusetts right now and the other half of the planet will be here in the next however many days before sin but I will say as much as it makes me not feel good and and has kind of given me an earache like I'm four we have gotten more rain in 24 hours we have gotten all summer and that is much needed so we thank the goddess for that but could it have happened when it was warmer gez yeah well you know everybody likes to go to Salem around sound because it is really fun to be with that many other people who are witchy minded even if they're not witches they at least are there you know they're interested in the history they're interested in seeing witches wandering around I am obligated to give a little PSA for this right right now folks come to Salem enjoy Salem see our sits eat our food but For the Love of All Things holy please remember some of us live here some of us work here and some of us need to park here for work I don't want to go to work downtown but I need to and for that to happen I need to park my car so remember have fun here do your du be a witch as much as you can here but remember that there are people who do have to live and work here all right I'm going to say this and when I say it just please keep in mind that I have the memory of a turtle but I saw something that said that there's like 800 parking spots in Downtown Salem and 10,000 people come every hour or some that is an absolute fact an absolute fact an absolute fact see I I probably remember those numbers exactly right but yeah it's it's some astronomical difference of the number parking spots and the number of people that are trying to get there so they have all sorts of public transportation use it take the train and remember be polite we live and work there all right shell we need to come up with some amazing costumes and then next year you know what I tell my sweet love I'm just dressing up as a witch this year hey I dressed up like that last year but like I haven't even seen cloaks yet what not a damn cloak okay you all are slacking I I need you all to dress up if you're going to Salem park somewhere else and please for the love of all that's holy dress up wear a cloak or a cooler witch hat I mean I love those little wool ones as much as anyone else but there's cooler ones I do I do like I said I love them as much as everyone else does I mean I have like2 different hat where's that big black pointy hat that's right wear something extravagant go all out but yeah no you can't like they're even closing Street like you can't move in this town right now but not a damn Soul has a costume on I can't even take it for shame for shame your witchy ancestors would be disappointed I work outfits are more of a dress up than these people okay oh my goodness all right well back to the loop let's start with The Wanderer tarot I love Tarot I think we should definitely give this a minute but I cut you off so tell the people who's this deck by this is The Wanderer tarot and it is by Casey Zab and we did go over their Oracle deck not too long ago the first thing you'll notice is this deck is entirely in black and white and it almost looks like it has been etched in you know like those scratch off boards so it's very simplistic much like casy's Oracle deck very simplistic line drawings but very oddly deep but it does have one thing that you dislike yeah it's got that silver gilding on the edges I mean it looks sharp it's a it's a good sized black and white simplistic deck and the black is very solid and shiny and the color goes to the edges and then you've got this silver gilding so you know it's flashy I just don't think the gilding is very practical I love it and you want to know why and I I'm generally not a gilding lover first of all love the cards I love the black and white and and when you are looking that edging makes it look like they have glitter on them and you know I love glitter you do love glitter and they do look very glittery yeah the cars are very very striking the Imes are etched in white on black and there's a very simple straight line white border very very thin line so you've got the black edge to edge but that that thin border is only on the minor Arcana it is not on the major Arcana yeah the major Arcana is just picture and black and they're very pretty and and as simple as they are much like Casey zala's oracle cards these come across as very simplistic on first look but there's a lot of meaning and depth especially in the major Arcana there's this one card that really strikes me um if you could Shuffle two look at the Ace of moons Leila holy no you did not just say that rewind the feed I did Ace of moons I opened my deck I literally just cut my deck and cut to this card you me I am not it's the Ace of moons like I didn't even count or do anything I just you said open your deck to Ace of moons and so I did literally to the Ace of moons that's wild anyway well I was going to tell you how striking and poignant I thought it was but I didn't know that was gonna happen that's pretty wild I'm actually going to because you know I like to look up what authors say about cards even though I have my own meanings I am going to see what what what she says that what they say what they say the Ace of moons is but isn't that card striking aside from that just was the aces are very very pretty now the the suit cards the PIP cards are relatively simplistic except for the aces the aces have a lot more character to them but like there's the six of feathers and it's six feathers hanging like on a clothesline over a witch hat how cute is that I love that so they do have different suits you know what's different about this it comes with like a booklet per se but you don't get card meanings it tells to the suit meanings and the things like that the court cards and numerology but you're not getting a card for card meaning from this deck book right what you get instead is an actual fold out poster yeah that has the different suits on it and it has to know air which is they have like knives or swords and then to will which is fire which is the feathers which seems so backwards to me to DARE is water which is like moons and to be silent which is Earth which they have as crystals I need to tell you something I just in the moment realized I don't like about this deck what's that have you been touching it and picking it up and moving it around in your hands look at your hands look at your hands am I glittery you are the glitter is already my hands are covered with glitter from touching so that's gonna get into everything the one thing I don't like about this deck is um it can be a little bit hard to see what number of the PIP cards you're looking at yeah I know noted that yeah so it can be a little bit hard to tell what card you're looking at but you know that's okay that's part of the fun of exploring a new Tarot deck is checking out what the new meanings are what the new images are and and how that resonates you but I would not recommend this for a beginner tarot reader I would not either and part of it is because of how the the numbers and and some of the this symbolism I find simple yet very deep if that makes I do as well yes same it's not fluffy it is not fluffy it's it's very pretty very simplistic but I also find it oddly deep maybe partly because it's so simplistic I can riff off of it and and go a little deeper with it maybe I'm not sure but the images are very interesting and uh I like the art I like the art style it's a very pretty deck probably not one I would use because I am very picky on that so you know definitely not nothing to take personal but I will say as much as I love glitter I don't like it rubbing off the very you know I I haven't touched these cards more than a handful of times and just tonight I'm like covered in it I like this box it's more like a cigar box or some type of Jewel box it just has a little opening that and it just fits the cards and the pamphlet thing that it comes with I probably would not use this deck on a regular basis but it is very striking and very pretty I would definitely use it sometimes for daily card PS it has a purpose it has it does and I might pull it out you know if I have a group of friends together just because it's interesting and different I'd call this a special occasion deck definitely a special occasion deck very pretty all right so the next deck we have is actually an oracle deck and since this is the only Oracle deck we have for this episode I'm guessing this is the one you like you know who to thk it because the only or other Oracle deck I've ever really gotten into was the goddess Oracle and that the version from like the late 80s early 90s I just I don't know maybe I'm just such a Tarot person I just can't I can't Vibe with the style I don't know what it is so I kind of went into this with a bad attitude you know I opened my box from Red real Weiser and I was like oh an oracle I like to surprise shell with what she's gonna get she doesn't always tell me I don't always get a say and you know so I'm like all right I know how this is going to go I'm going to open it I'll look at it you know play with it for a minute and then tell everybody how I don't like it because it's an oracle deck well well well to my surprise people if you are gonna ever get an oracle deck I think you should get this let me tell you why I feel this way and this is called the Untamed spirit animal Oracle and this is by Francesca maoni an illust at by Roco Lombardi I probably didn't say those names perfect but we know how I am but yeah Untamed spirit animal Oracle wisdom from the wild within this is different because it's completely an animal deck and I do look at connecting with animal spirit different than tarot you you know what I mean it's almost like like how there's ancestor cards you know ancestor cards are different than tarot because you're you're doing something different but so these it's almost like if you were trying to connect with an animal spirit I could see a use for these if you were trying to maybe find your animal you know what I'm saying right you and I have had a conversation recently I keep seeing a particular type animal around me and around my Homestead that is not necessarily normal for these parts and I have actually started to look at the card in this deck that relates to that and you know as a overall Oracle to like do whatever like the things you would do with tarot probably not no not for me anyway but is a animal spirit connection um trying to get with that that animal connection  yeah man I love this now these cards are skinnier they're about the size of regular playing cards but longer I would say they're like I'd say just a tiny bit fatter than a normalized tarot card they're kind of a cream colored card stock I like the card stock it's very nice it's a good thickness it feels good this is a 50 card deck by the way on the back it looks like peacock feathers which I love it's very very pretty these are also very simple I think these are actually were drawn on that scratch art you know where you kind of like scratch away the wax to the color underneath and uh the artist said that they kind of did that and just let the animal come out the way that it was just going to come out but the other thing I do like about these cards as well CU you know we're not all familiar with all the attributes of say 50 random animals bugs uh mammals fishies whatever the case may be so they have uh each card has like two keywords at the bottom so like say for instance I just picked out the owl card and at the bottom it says vision and silence so it kind of gives you two like keywords or two prompting words that you can kind of meditate with or or kind of visualize with as you're looking at the card whatever you're doing with the card I do like that I have a LoveHate relationship with those mostly hate if I'm honest why because I find when I was using these cards at first I thought you know oh great there's key wordss on them but as always happens anytime I use an oracle deck or a Tarot deck that has words on it that's all I can see as soon as I put it down and I see the badger and it says determination mental energy I can't get beyond that like that's what that card means is determination and mental energy it doesn't give me in my opinion when I do it I just get so stuck on those keywords that I I can't let it mean anything else or I can't let it be more nuanced than that you know what I'm saying so I just get distracted I think and then the way I look at it is I kind of like I see like this owl card you know he's kind of there's a big moon behind him and kind of like a a weed leafy field and maybe some clouds in the background so yes it says you know vision and silence but I also kind of see that sacred knowledge and mystery and you know yeah the pictures are nice they're very nice pictures and you can see that there honestly what I might do with these mag py them cut off the bottom you know if you would have said that to me 20 30 years ago I would have dropped dead where I stand but nowadays I've matured and grown a little bit and I can see I could you know that could work and you could square off the card you could do across the black line kind of make it a smaller card if that works for you rock on yeah and these cards they have the picture in the center it's very framed by the cream color of the card and like the title and the keywords are bars of that background cream color so you get a very big Bard on the picture but Lea's gonna cut off yeah I like edge to edge I like edge to edge picture pies I really do and I don't love the keywords I do love this deck though it feels a lot to me like an expanded like a 50 card version of the 33 card Druid animal Oracle you know and I actually I have that and I I haven't pulled that out in a good many years and I do have that and when I saw this I it did kind of remind me of that the Druid animal Oracle came out in the '90s and I just recently got another copy of it I'm very happy with but when you and I were kind of coming up as witches one of the things I think we both Learned was reverence for nature and reverence for animals and you know our brothers and sister animals and how their Essences can work with us and and so being good to Nature being kind to animals and feeling that symbiosis was a big part of our magic you know you sometimes might even call in aspects of animals for the different quarters so I think being close to that is something that we learned as we came up as witches so that might partly be why that resonates with us that could be and I think what I like about this is it kind of exposes me to maybe ones that I for whatever reason here there everywhere didn't didn't want to was too scared to maybe work with or brooch back then for example if you would have told me 20 years ago to reach out to you know some spider spirit I would have probably died of fright whereas you know now you know I I see that the benefits and the uses of that relationship ship um and how we can benefit them and they can benefit us with a good relationship it isn't all they're biting me and eating me in my sleep yeah this this has anacondas but it also has fireflies you know you're G get a little bit of everything um so for me I would look at it more not so much Oracle is like your true definition of an oracle but more of like an animal spirit type deck yeah if you're going to kind of look for guidance from that direction and I I love the book that comes with it this is a fat little real little book like I you know unfortunately though at my age this is a get out your readers friends it it's small print but yeah I was impressed and I love this box by the way it's the kind of box that like slides out like the bottom slides out of it it's it's I like it but it also comes in like a regular playing card deck box like it's a box inside a box box but this book is great and and I know shell loves it when there's pictures in the book and this is a big picture of each card next to the meaning which is and I love the picture on the cover of the book of the Stag that is a fabulous photo like the photos on this deck and in the book are just fabulous like this was a very well illustrated book by the way or deck and book by the way yeah it's it's very pretty it's it's very again kind of simple because it's just that cream and black kind of scratch off look right but they're such pretty pictures and well done animals I liked it I liked it a lot I liked it I liked it and I would I actually believe it or not folks I hope you're all sitting down I will actually use this you heard it here first yeah I was actually I I was surprised and when I surprise myself you know it's crazy Untamed spirit animal Oracle wisdom from the wild within nice tagline I know right but now let's switch gears we got a bunch of books we do I was super happy because the topic of these books has been something that I have been so immersed in for 30 years and I'm so glad the world is too and that is the goddess hiate our beloved hkat so we got books four different books all featuring you know one of them I didn't realize was going to feature hkat and then it kind of did we got three books entering hiat's cave and entering hiat's Garden both by the same author Cindy Brandon we we got hiate goddess of witches by Courtney Weber and then the one that I wasn't 100% sure what it was about year of the dark goddess a journey of ritual renewal and rebirth by Lara Vesta so let's start with entering hiat's cave so the full title is entering hiat's cave the journey through Darkness to wholeness by Cindy Brandon Cindy Brandon is also the author of keeping her keys which is another book about hiate I I had a hard time with this book and I'm not going to lie I know that a lot of folks out there either haven't heard of hkat or just recently you know I feel like she's kind of the craze and the fat all over the the old Facebook and the Tik Tock but this was hard for me because it's not what I know and it's not what I've it's it's not the hkat I've known for a long time and it it was hard for me and I I okay you've hit I'm let me before we go any further let me just say that Cindy Brandon is one of those authors that I think people really either very much like or very much don't like and I think it's due to a particular style that she has of writing about hiate it comes from a very psychological lens and it comes from a very personal lens she has a lot of what's commonly called upgs unverified personal nosis and that's basically when you have a knowing or a feeling about a deity or about a spell or maybe you have an ecstatic experience where you literally feel like the deity has spoken to you but no one else has seen it or heard it and you can't prove it that's an unverified personal nosis so there's a lot of that in there which I get and I understand and I fully respect all I'm saying is that my personal unverified nosis with hiate is completely different yes and yes absolutely and that's part that like I said that's part of the problem with Cindy Brandon and you know I can I can honestly say the same thing about entering hiat's guard and I see your point it's just not the hkat I've known for a very long time a very long time that was my point though yeah I just I don't know what do you think about entering hak's Garden I mean so well entering entering hak's cave is basically a shadow Journey um as you go through this book you will learn about hkat from Cindy Brandon's point of view and there's some good stuff in here and and there's definitely you know there's some really great stuff about healing about working through Darkness about working through difficulty and having hkat with you through that so I can see where people could would find a lot of value from entering hiat's cave and I feel like entering hiat's Garden is kind of the same type of thing but from more of a plant witch perspective yeah this almost seems like something that Amy Blackthorne you know might have helped write or whatever because it has a lot of properties and correspondences of plants and it has formulas and how about this this may be a more fair assessment I would have been less salty about these two books had they been books about the content that they are and you didn't say hkat in them oh okay yeah so okay so I guess entering so basically what you're saying is entering hiat's cave you would have preferred if they had left cut her personal version of hiate out of it and kept it more as a a magical Shadow workbook if they would have started the the ti you know entering the cave a journey through darkness and wholeness I'm all for it rock on or the magic medicine and mystery of the plant Spirit witchcraft I'd even go out and buy that but the part I guess it's the it's all the hiate stuff that kind of just is there anything in particular about hiate that you can put your fing on that you didn't like I'm not sure I am all for where am I I am in entering hiat's Garden where she talks about the three worlds it's like she goes on these seven sacred forces and you know M there's a little bit of woo in there there's a little bit of new Agy spech you know mapping planetary energy and the hkat I know would slap her for even putting that in the same sentence as her name but that's the hkat I know that's all I'm saying saying you said it right a lot of woooo a lot of fluffy bunny hkat is not fluffy bunny people hkat is not and entering hk's cave isn't really either there is a lot of new age speak and a lot of new age ideas which I think is what kind of turned me off but there was also I kind of liked entering hiat's cave you know as as a shadow thing working with hiate you know it it's not awful I didn't hate it like I said I would be more on board if it was about Shadow work and journey and she left hiate out of it that's all I'm saying and I guess what I'm saying about entering hiat's Garden is it was okay it's all right but there's better books about hiate out there and there's better books about herb magic out there I wouldn't necessarily have purchased this one unless I was a Cindy Brandon fan and really wanted that slightly hikes herbal book in that perspective yeah yeah so again not a bad book yeah is a devout follower of hkat for many decades I say me so they were all right I I think if you don't have any other herb books and you really like Cindy Brandon and are into hekate entering hekate's Garden is a good place to start to give you some ideas of herbal correspondences you know spells that you can do with different herbs but there's better herb books out there so it's all right two brooms as far as like a psychological workbook working through Shadows it's not bad I mean it's not bad there's better Shadow workbooks out leave the stuff out of it am I being too critical maybe a tiny bit but I think you know that's the hkat in you and here we are but yeah it it's just a little new Agy for me I think it just had a little too much both of these books had a little too much of a new age Edge for me but I thought they were okay two rooms now recently when uh Lila and I were together and we had a awesome in-person experience with a bunch of our listen shout out to Central New York I had a wonderful conversation with one of our listeners so Sylvio if you are out there listening to this you need to listen to what Lila and I say about these next two books okay so Sylvio first of all we love you and second of all listen because these two books my friend soila what are our next two books our next two books actually we had a hard time determining which of these we absolutely loved more we have year of the dark goddess a journey of ritual renewal and rebirth by Lara Vesta we also have hkat goddess of witches by Courtney Weber love these two books so which would you like to start with sha since you were so disappointed in the first two all right let's start with hkat goddess of witches by I love this book this you know history you know some of the good mythology like I liked this I liked this solid book very solid book on the history and rights of hiate gives you so much information it it explores so much about our beloved Queen of the witches and it talks about working with hkat and ancestors working with the dead it talks about the crossroads why you would want to go to the crossroads you know it gives you really good information about hiat's lore and background but she also kind of tell she gives you and I you know I can go either way sometimes on this she goes over some of the best practices and ethics I you know be a good person be a good human but remember who you're dealing with um hiate is not all love and sunshine and when you're working with her you are working through some deep dark serious and I think this is a good solid book but keep your ethical opinions to yourself because not everybody is Wiccan not everybody believes in the rule of three and you want to do you do you so that was my only that was my only criticism of it was the the part about her her ethics and best practices so definitely a very solid book has some great spells in the back to work with hiate but I really very much enjoyed the idea of even though even though you know you're talking about the the ethics portion she does touch on the fact that hiate is a dark goddess she does not try to sugarcoat her in no no she doesn't yeah no no not at all which I love feel this is a more accurate what you're dealing with when you're working with hkat like this one right here really struck me it's uh hiat's rights of the Dead I was like yeah yes no fluffy bunny this is like this is what you're dealing with this is this is the I have known and loved and yeah I like this I was going to touch on that as well because those sections really are what struck out to me as well because hiate is that intermediary we've talked about her before she's the ri or die bestie who goes down into the underworld she's very familiar with that underworld and going in and out of it taking pranie and guiding and guarding her as she goes from one space to the other through that Lial period when she goes from the underworld back up and and vice vers so she is a conduit to the dead you know she's that doorway that Gateway that gatekeeper and and I loved all the information that Courtney Weber put in here about hekate and and the dead book some of the rituals and the Spells like this one um a spell to open the symbolic door a spell to close the door Bravo and it it was fast I read through this so fast I wanted more I mean there's so much information but it's it's a good read and it's it's a quick read her style of writing makes it like not a chore I mean what are we talking here about 200 pages I mean my only negative thing here would be that it was too short I wanted more because it was easy to read and and it seemed like there was a lot of information but it just went by very quickly Courtney Weber if you're out there we need a part two woman we need a part two so next book this one Sylvio you better be listening to this one this book year of the dark goddess a journey of ritual renewal and rebirth I've said this title like 50 times anyway Lara Vesta wrote this book this is like an actual yearlong plus practice this is a practice let me start off by saying that even after all of my Decades of work and closeness with hiate this book makes me want to do this year of the dark goddess no know I read it to and I'm like I'm so going to do that I'm so glad we got this before December because okay so what we're talking about here is this book it says on the back a guided journey of empowerment and healing year of the dark goddess offers practical tools including embodied rituals writing prompts seasonal self-care practices and Community creation it is basically a stepbystep yearlong starting at Ule journey of Shadow work of working with the dark goddess working with yourself working with hiate but you know what I actually and I was hoping you'd read this line off the back and you didn't um this is one thing that caught me year of the dark goddess provides an anchor in a road map for navigating the disorientation of Life Transformations and offers resources for embracing change as initiations that strengthen us and make clear our purpose and power Bravo to this person Lara Vesta this is fantastic and it's got awesome illustrations in the beginning that I thought were super helpful to the point where I bookmarked them there's one here the dark goddess uh the dark goddess wheel of the year which I actually ended up drawing in my um Book of Shadows and then on the very next page cycle of ritual I don't know maybe it's just because I think in a similar fashion as the author so it was easy for me again this book I made quick work of this book but this is the type of book you don't really read or you read through it once and then you use it as a workbook and you know that lately that's been my thing I love books that are like workbooks and this is one of those it's not just a book you read you then go back a second time and make it a workbook love yes it has practices it has meditations it has daily self-care practices that you can do it has so much and I'm I'm very much looking forward to getting deep into this it has little stories about deity and folklore throughout that relates to the different things that you're working on and like sh said this is a book you read through and then it's gonna take you a long time to work through yeah and I'm looking forward to doing the work and and the one thing I liked about this and I was thinking about this as I was reading through it is you could technically take a lot of that and insert any goddess really yeah absolutely or you know any goddess that's of the dealing with the dark side of life she does mention pepan and core and here and stuff but um you know say say you kind of Jive more with the Morgan you could even swap the Morgan out with I just think this is a damn good book and it could be used in a lot of different ways and there's a lot of journaling and you know how much I love that saw that I saw that there's a lot of letter writing she talks about it as letter writing in a lot of these sections yeah I read it as journaling you'll go through your Journal you have you have workshops you should do that she talks about anchoring the day with certain little rituals take a flower bath how can you hate someone who's telling you to take a flower bath right seriously and for each holiday there's different things that you can do she breaks this down quarterly and seasonally it's just a really good workbook this one I am so excited to get into it just seems to be well researched the information is solid it's got a lot of information an excellent excellent workbook to connect with your own dark goddess I'd go so far as saying five brooms oh hell yeah easily five brooms up five brooms lar Vesta so Sylvio get the year of the dark goddess I'm just saying yes definitely and also very much love hiate goddess of witches by Courtney Weber and we didn't have any books by this author but Serita dest is a phenomenal author on hiate um I guess the the thing that I really want to make sure because we did have a couple fluffy books and a couple you know darker books if you get called by hiate if she reaches out to you or if you think you're going to go on a journey to reach out to her know what you're getting into I've warned you yeah that's an excellent advice for any dark deity if you're if if a dark deity is calling to you if you or if you feel very attracted to a dark deity it usually means that that you're working through something to get real right that life is about to get very very interesting in a hard work and crying kind of way that's right that's right be prepared to do the work be prepared to put in the time and be prepared to be in the fetal position crying but when you come out the other side you'll be stronger it'll be so great after be so much better yeah what is that they say after you break a bone you it's much stronger where it broke is that how you've seen you've seen hiate put me through the ringer okay I have I have and look where I'm at I'm better on and every time it's happened I've gotten better each time better and better each time so thank you again to Red wheel wiser for these books and uh we love you do love you and all hail hiate you're of the dark goddess here we come see you at the crossroads keep it witchy
