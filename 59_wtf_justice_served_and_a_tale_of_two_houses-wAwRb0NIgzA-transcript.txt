it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 59 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends separated by way too many miles get together to tell each other spooky paranormal Tales while smoking enormous quantities of the finest Devil's lettuce in the land bringing you Poltergeist activity type houses I'm Leila and flipping the switch and going all True Crime Ona I'm shell wait a minute you're going True Crime again you don't do True Crime that's my thing I I I got sucked in again to a story and I I couldn't help myself so yeah I just I was like what the heck you're doing two houses go True Crime I love that it's the stories that we get sucked into that are the most fun it's the unexpected topics it's seeing how thing is do or don't pan out the mystery of it oh you've got me intrigued and that's really what brought me to do two houses not just one I had to do two they were too similar and too weird and too mysterious so I had to do them both well before we delve into that you mentioned the devil lettuce I did indeed sh one of your favorite favorite things I just got to jump in here because I did a crazy thing what did you do now shell went to a new store you cheated on Happy Valley again you hussy you well where'd you go I went [ __ ] I don't even know the name of the place Mission that's what it's called Mission and what got me to go there was I just had a little bit of cash I needed a little bit of weed and and you were on a mission and I was on a mission and a little birdie told me I could get an eighth for $27 and I was like what who can pass up an eighth for $27 especially when we've talked about what I've paid I was like I'll give it a go how bad can it be then I realized they have good cheap weed really I went back because it was good I was like okay this will be worth a go I went back and was actually able to get like an ounce for like $204 which again if you've heard what I've paid in the past that's like highway robbery that was a steal you can't pass that up even if it's dirt weed now you normally pay closer to how much for an aid 45 to 60 and this broke down to 27 and eth wow that's pretty good for that area Michelle we're still waiting for prices to come down in Massachusetts and it doesn't look like they are how good is it it is good never heard of it TK 43 and you know how one of our last episodes we talked about labels and what all the labels do and don't tell you and how different stores have different labels this tells me total cannaboids is 28.8 and then they have a listing of breakdowns which are Irrelevant in my mind I see the 28 I'm like all right we're good to go like we're good that's fine but TK 43 never heard of it don't know what it is don't really care good weed how's it smoke it smokes really good but it can kind of get you a little tongue twisted the brand is Island flower I don't know what the hell that is or where it's from don't really care still good what me and my sweet love were talking about when I got this you can't just get an ounce in one container I don't understand why no matter where you go what you do who you buy it from you're getting that [ __ ] package by the eth so here I am with eight of these [ __ ] they're not used to people buying in bulk a lot of the stores particularly in New York where I am currently I've been finding the same thing most of them are used to selling in an eight they don't have ounces some do most don't I just think it's silly get me a Ziploc bag put a freaking ounce in it and be done with it like really I agree I'm with you on that one instead I have eight of these beautiful glass jars currently oh boy well you know hey at least they're recyclable what are you going to do that is again a good score I feel like I've been getting some good scores lately that's my good score this week and good pick good pick what do you got what are you smoking what Devil's lettuce is hitting your lungs well like I said I am in Upstate New York right now near Lake Ontario and I have found a wonderful online delivery place that right now I'm kind of liking and they're called HotBox let me ask you this do you pay extra for delivery no oh nice like other places that I have been in California we had a couple different delivery places and other than the tip you know there is a tip involved and we will tip anywhere from $5 to $20 depending on how far away they are so there is there is that fee I guess you would have to say there is you should tip your driver yeah but I tip the pizza guy what's the difference the same thing exact same thing tip your weed driver just like you tip your pizza driver maybe a little better I don't know but this place has actually a couple very very cheap ounces and they also have something that we first were introduced to with Lisa Anne from Washington she had a whole bag of pre-ground flour this place also has what comes in a you know little plastic container oh cute is't that cute and it's oh gosh it does say open carefully on it and I did not but it's all you know preg ground flour yeah but does it dry is it dry no oh the um the canister that we got before this was a little bit squishier this is a tiny bit drier than that was but I thought we were taking a chance I was like you know it's it's $60 for a half ounce no [ __ ] 6 bucks a half and they also have they have Humbolt OG Humbolt OG for $40 a half and they have gushers indoor for $60 a half I'm sorry $65 a half and that's what we got we got the gushers and it's quite good it's very good actually the other thing we got was a full ounce a full ounce of humble old G hum you can't you're so stoned you can't even say it I'm so stoned Humbolt OG ounce of flour not the pre-ground an ounce of flour for $100 so oh my God so for 165 we got an ounce of flour and half an ounce of pre-ground flour our listeners can't hear this or see this right now but I am crying tears of sadness and you know for $100 ounce it is surprisingly St worth your 100 bucks oh yeah worth 165 all day every day and getting it delivered is always nice who doesn't love to get an ounce delivered I mean we've talked before about the horrendous days of having to wait for your guy right or worse yet your guy is waiting on his guy or worse yet your guy doesn't pick up the phone yeah and then they stop texting back so you're you're like in the dark like do they have it do they not have it why aren't they responding I need some weed what's going on here I hated those days I hat don't miss that don't at all no so getting it delivered is fantastic I'll take a little bit lower THC these are probably I haven't looked them up I definitely feel high you know they're they taste good they smoke well so $100 ounce I will smoke all day every day I just wanted to kind of divert uh a little bit if some of our listeners haven't been made aware we've started a another podcast very witchy based very Pagan based called back on the broomstick and I think in Stow we kind of laid off some of the witchy stuff here so I just do want to mention on a witchy note uh check out our latest episode of back on the broomstick where I am going to be talking about gushing over reviewing whatever you want to call it a recent Pagan witch whatever you want to call it Festival online witch con I attended this online Festival it was fabulous and if you are interested in hearing what I thought some of the things I participated in and how you can get in on the action next year check out our other podcast back on the broomstick wherever you get your podcast that is definitely where a lot of our witchy stuff has gone you may have notice we don't have any more wheel of the year or even the full moon or New Moon we did just have a full moon when this episode goes live it'll be like a day or so after the full moon in March the worm Moon the last winter Moon last moon of winter that's right we are almost on our ostara the first day of spring so check out our witchy podcast back on the brims and uh you know speaking of other shows I have been binging lately on a show that on Hulu it was originally on Vice called bong Appetit back from 2017 I used to watch this show all the time and I've caught up on some recent episodes have you ever seen this shell I've never even heard of it but it sounds bong arrific oh you would absolutely love it it's a cooking show oh but they Infuse weed cannabis products into every single dish and it started out more as a um like a dinner party the host would invite some chefs on and show them wait till you see the Cannabis Pantry they'd show them all these different cannabis products and they would cook with them and then serve a big dinner party with famous people and talk about the dishes very very cool the most recent season has changed format a little bit and be real is one of the hosts do you get high off the food oh yeah okay you know they talk about how much THC is in each dish and they're like this dish has 2.5% THC and I'm like I bleed that I bleed that okay Lord so I'm like all right for an appetizer maybe but you better be saying that the M course has 100 anyway so yeah they Infuse everything and it's a great show really fun a lot of cooking but I noticed in the most recent couple episodes that I saw that in the background be real has a dude rolling joints for him I need I need a guy like that yeah I guess this guy's name is Pedro and he has B's official joint roller and when I started looking into it apparently this is a thing people can just be other famous people's weed rollers they just go around and I need one of those I would love to have my own personal joint roller how do you become Snoop dogs joint roller that's the question I read about a woman who was his joint roller she said that she rolled 115 blunts for him a day now anybody who knows me Lea can back me up on this I couldn't roll a joint to save my bloody life okay I've been smoking for like 30 years and if I had to roll a joint or die I would be dead in two seconds it's true so that's not my profession but if you need a bll packer I'm your girl she's got you covered but yeah and then I went down this Rabbit Hole of decorative joint rollers or competitive joint rollers competitive oh yeah they roll all these different shapes shell you have not lived until you have seen a drum set joint that you can smoke someone paid like $50,000 to this one joint roller guy for a whole arsenal like a fullsize AK47 that's a smokable joint hand grenades that are smokable joints and everything anything you can think of some of these professional joint rollers can turn into a smokable work of art I feel like anytime I've tried to roll a joint it actually looked like a hand grenade well if you're putting a full ounce in there like some of these people do I think that would be that would be the bomb you know just for my personal experience watch out folks because Lea can break into this industry in a hot second She's Crafty and can roll like a [ __ ] right hey be real if you ever need an assistant joint roller I'm your girl call at the stone hour gmail.com but yeah I just thought that was a lot of fun so they combined a couple of my favorite things food and Edibles who doesn't love that and then joints I mean come on we would be shoin to uh be guest judges on this show shell that's where I would shine as a judge that's my Niche right I could show off my joint rolling skills to be real we could eat you love to eat I do I do no lie food is good we would be so good so be real hit us up hit us up man we need to figure out how to make this work man totally but since we can't make it work right at the moment I got to tell you story all right I'm packing a bowl I'm getting comfortable and I'm ready to be scared what you got for meich what sucked me into this is I have a story for you that has been a true crime Cold Case for the last 35 years oh wow that's a long time to wait it is and um it involves the murder of a woman and in a weird turn of events after 35 years actually within the past I don't know from the time we're recording this I'll say in the past week or so they have actually made an arrest wow not only have they figured it out they arrested a suspect they arrested a suspect after 35 years damn that's amazing that's fantastic are any of the relatives still alive just real quick before you get into it I never found that part out oh but there was a child involved so I would imagine that there is a child who now knows what happened to their mother wow I'm guessing was genealogy DNA involved somehow you know you know how the government is they didn't necessarily come out and say that but in a roundabout way kind of did I gotcha all right so tell start from the beginning tell me I'm intrigued I'm intrigued ironically enough this story and I didn't even realize this until after I had read a bunch about it the story originates in Salem Oregon opposite Coast from you Salem okay yes not to be confused with Salem Massachusetts but this is in Salem Oregon we're talking like 1988 around late November 1988 I think it was the 29th of November there was a woman Deborah Lee at tropes aged 30 and she was reported missing November 29th and her body was discovered on December 1st uh just a couple days later you think of how police work is done now and I understand that we're talking 35 years but like I don't know I feel like we were old enough to know what was going on in 1988 and I feel like this was a case of were the cops that dumb I don't know I'll get into why I think that but so so we got debor Le here like in a lot of the True Crime that we've talked about before there's been a little bit of incompetence or cover up are you're kind of implying something like that may have happened I think incompetence I do understand that technology is very different than it was but in my opinion there was some blatant avenues that could have been looked at that weren't that 35 years later or who ended up being you know where it all ended and I just feel they should have known this 35 years ago it seems like some people aren't deemed important enough maybe or weren't they just didn't care enough to pursue those Avenues at one point I guess how this and like I read some of the original uh news articles because you could actually find those um online and you know like I said different time different technology but I still feel like the police let this woman down Deborah was EST stranged from her husband and they were co-parenting a 9-month-old girl and she was supposed to go to the hairdresser run an errand and then go pick up her baby from the husband but it sounded like from what I read in at least one article it almost seemed like they still lived together but weren't together you know what I'm saying yeah okay I've seen some people try to you know for the sake of money or for the sake of the child you know try toay St in the same house yeah sometimes at work sometimes not so she she had been at work she went to work had a great day left work did her errand went to the hair salon she was supposed to pick up her child by like seven and they know that she left the hair salon approaching s and she was never seen since oh wow around 9:00 her arange husband called the police was calling friends have you seen her um she was described as someone who was a a very dedicated mother she would not just you know ghost out on her kid very responsible very reliable not the kind of person that wasn't where she said she was going to be when she said she was going to be there kind of person right right she doesn't show up to pick up her kid and the estranged husband starts calling friends and family you know calls the police after a few more hours at midnight the police put out a APB on this woman weird wow my my purse this is the second time in a few days that my purse just randomly falls off the shelf interesting so you're talking about a mysterious crime and your purse randomly falls off the shelf by itself yeah strange any so the husband seems very concerned very upset they search they search for a few days they say they did a full investigation I don't believe them I'm sorry I feel like the police failed her so like I said they they had only been kind of estranged for about five months at this point so you know there's still that rawness you know what I'm saying it's not like there had been a lot of time right but a few days later on December 1st they find her car well that's a pretty big clue it is but picture a CU AAC but at the end is like a construction site okay so an active construction site so she disappears on like a Monday and Tuesday Morning the construction crew notices a car but thinks nothing of it okay yeah it could have been just parked on the coldest act sure Wednesday morning the police are just Rando Patrol in the area and notice this car APB has gone out they have put out the type of car she has they find the type of car no license plates really but it's the right kind of car so of course they stopped check it out right right correct okay good cool but like no license plates weird yeah so they get the VIN run the V they find out it yes is indeed her car so they call the husband hey husband guy we found our car do we have your permission to search the car CU back in 1988 that's what they did today they just bust that [ __ ] right open would they probably oh we found it open um the husband is like oh my God you found her car by all means please search it holy [ __ ] you have my permission oh my God let me know how this works out find her body in the trun no no oh my God find her body in the trunk oh no how long had she been dead had she been alive the day before Oh my God that's terrible was probably dead the night she disappeared so she had probably been dead in the car for a good two and a half pushing three days oh wow that's awful where the [ __ ] was the car where was she and why were the license plates gone yeah how did she die she died from strangulation and asphixiation come to find out you know they had to do an autopsy blah blah blah they also said that she was severely physically abused damn so it sounds like she got the [ __ ] beat out of her and then she was strangled they believe that she was dead before she was put in the trunk based on like how her body was or whatever I don't know I guess they never did figure out the deal with the license plates but they did obviously determin to a homicide but then it just went cold wow no fingerprints no nothing now in my younger life all I wanted to be was clares from Silence of the Lambs it's true I just wanted to be an FBI investigator you remember that yeah you were going to be an FBI investigator yeah that was your dream like to the point where I even started off my college career taking criminal justice CL classes so like it's it's not like I have a zero frame of reference here wouldn't your first [ __ ] person be like oh let's investigate the estranged husband that she just broke up with five months ago isn't the estranged husband always or even the current husband always the first suspect you don't even need a degree in criminal justice to like even think of that Avenue like come on they were just like eh Don't know what happened sorry so the husband was never considered a suspect never weird never never I mean they even offered a reward I read one article one newspaper article where they offered like some significant reward it was like it was only like $1,000 but in 1988 a th000 bucks was goodange by the way they did find the keys in the ignition which is one of the other reason reasons why the police wanted permission from the husband to look at the car because they're like this is her car and the keys are here something is a the weird thing was is that there was houses around at the end of that road and like I said an active construction site some of the neighbors said that they heard screams one neighbor said she heard like running footsteps nobody act in this [ __ ] you know nobody did anything well I mean you hear somebody running outside you think wow they're running very loudly you don't think [ __ ] someone's getting murdered well yeah but well yeah I mean I guess nowadays you would I mean nowadays that's going to be all over next door be like some stranger was running down my sidewalk call the police right now it's just some kid playing tag from everything I read they never had any suspects ever not even the husband who's like not even the husband always suspect number one in all the stories you ever hear Lord for real so let's fast forward 35 years so not one person came forward with anything substantial not one clue in 35 years it almost seemed like they found her and by the time the funeral was over they were like oh got nothing for you all right we're done she didn't have enough money enough connection c s they didn't care they didn't really care and you know I would imagine this was a more rural area that people just kind of fade away and this this poor poor lady faded away again with a nine-month old baby so in 2020 authorities with the Washington District Attorney's Office had happened to secure a grant for prosecuting cold cases using DNA which led them to launch a Cold Case unit and they were going to focus on cold cases um with crimes of violent nature in May of 2021 an investigation into Deborah's death reopened they started it all over again and the collaboration of the Washington County Sheriff's Department in the District Attorney's Cold Case unit went like balls to the wall with this nice over the next year and a half up until like a week ago detectives in in in investigators reinterviewed multiple Witnesses um like some of the people who heard the screaming the pitter patter of footsteps type people yeah that would definitely help establish a timeline but they still had forensic evidence that they reexamined really yeah what did they have details of the evidence was revealed to the Washington County grand jury on uh February 28th so like just a couple weeks ago the grand jury on March 2nd has just decided to charge with one count of second deegree murder the husband D no [ __ ] the very person you and I both were very surprised why the hell did they not look at him first they always look at the significant other first right why not this time who did he know I mean I don't even know but like so now the guy is 60 years old he based on DNA evidence is getting charged what was it was it like something under her fingernails they didn't say and I'm kind of wondering and I actually want your thoughts on this and I'm sure our viewer our viewers our listeners want your thoughts on this too they don't say what the evidence was so I don't know if it was finger I don't know but they don't say how they matched up that DNA to bring it to him either and I'm one in these Cold Case units have been in the news the last couple years of using the likes of ancestry DNA well it's not actually ancestry there's a specific company out there but I'm pretty sure ancestry does not participate there's another one and I can't think of the name of it it might be the other one but I'm just wondering what do you think about them utilizing these genealogy databases that folks are using for genealogy fun to then what do what do you think about that well first of all any anyone whose DNA is being used make sure you read the fine print before you sign anything because you can opt out of having your DNA used for any type of forensics or or anything like that so make sure you read the fine print to know what they're going to be using your DNA for that being said I don't know on the one hand all these cases would never have gotten solved without this database on the other hand by you opting in it's a little weird because you're not just saying that you can use my DNA you're now basically opting in your entire family everyone you're related to or will be related to you're opting them in without their consent well that's how it always works out when you see these pan out this way it's like you know cousin Suzy from down the block went and did her ANC R and now all of a sudden Uncle Bob from wherever 200 miles away is finally getting charged with a crime he committed yep so I I'm of two minds on it on the one hand I love seeing these cold cases get solved and Justice being served but it's not as consensual as you think right on the other hand it's a little weird what are they what else are they going to do with this DNA without your consent or without your family's consent so I I don't know I haven't figured it out yet I'm still learning this is where I I became an aandry with this because you've been hearing a lot about this lately I had done a true crime about a local Massachusetts story a while back and it's the same kind of thing here is this first of all a nine-month-old baby who loses her mother has to grow has to grow up without a mother like that's heartbreaking begin how we be raised by her mother's killer it sounds like to be raised by your father who's all you got in the world you love Daddy and then when you are 35 [ __ ] years old you find out everything you knew was a lie your father killed your mother and now you feel like you have no parents it's heartbreaking heartbreak I can't even imagine my poor child how this pans out creates basically a whole new victim yeah yeah and this is now a girl that is unfortunately going to have to live with knowing her father killed her mother and it's tragic it's heartbreaking we're seeing a lot of that lately and it's [ __ ] up that's terrible oh that poor child oh I feel terrible for them but yeah because this was very recent and in the news I just I got sucked in and like I said the whole heartbreak for the daughter just kind of pulled me into this story but on the flip side of the Heartbreak Justice being served yep that woman's family can now now put it behind them you know they're not going to forget and you know they're not going to ever stop grieving but they can have some sort of peace with it wow so I I think I need you to lighten the mood here my friend and start giving us some ghosties well I I don't have any whouses to help bring the mood up this time I apologize I know I'll I'll up my game next time I'll try but I do have two tals for you shell and I'm going to give you a choice of which one I start with what are my options here your options are blood and fire blood and fire oh my God both sound fantastic and they are you can't go wrong here there's no wrong choice I'm gonna go with blood First Blood very good choice okay so blood first does this have to do with vampires no no vampires oh wow so it's not vampires and I'm even more intrigued right so I am going to take you to 1987 what is with us in the freaking late 80s tonight who doesn't love the 80s come on right so we're going to go to 1987 to Atlanta Georgia actually to 11:14 Fountain Drive the house that became known as the blood house the blood house the blood house so this seemingly normal house was the home of William and Minnie Winston and they had lived there for two decades they'd raised three children there who in the late 80s were adults Willie was 79 years old and Minnie was 77 and they lived in this little seven room house and they had a very good life I like how you call it a little seven room house well not seven bedroom just like seven rooms total oh okay so not very big so they lived there alone again their children were grown and out of the house and will had quite a few health problems and was on dialysis he had to have regular dialysis that he did at home oh that sucks so he was pretty frail and on this fall evening Minnie had taken care of Willie put him to bed and had decided to take a bath to relax for the night as one does sounds like a good time right love me a good bath I think we've been talking about magical baths like a lot lately I know right so Minnie gets herself into a nice hot bath she's Rel relaxing she's taking a little time for herself she's quite occupied like I said taking care of her very frail husband so she gets out of the bath as she steps onto the floor she notices that the floor's not just wet it feels almost like sticky and she looks down and realizes she's stepping in a puddle of blood oh my God where's Willie that was her first thought too oddly she said the blood seemed to be kind of bubbling up from the ground a little bit but her first thought was for her husband and so out of the FL yeah yeah she said that was the weird part about it but she immediately wondered that maybe her husband had hurt himself while she was in the bath so she grabs her bathrob and leaves the bathroom and discovers that there is blood everywhere it is coming down the walls in the hallway it's covering the stairs in the stairwell oh my God it reminds me of the bathroom scene and it she says it was in the basement in the crawl space she got to her husband and his room was clear there was no blood there and he was fine um and she you know took her husband Willie and they went and explored the whole house and found this blood everywhere but no body anywhere but not in Wily's room not in Willy's room but he saw the blood after many got him and took him out of the room he also saw the blood on the walls and the stairs and in the kitchen oh my God oh my God right and so they look through the house and they discover that there is blood in most of the rooms so of course they call 911 right here I am I'd be calling my freaking coven I'd like people come well not to mention I'd be calling serve pro but yeah I'd be calling my coven never even happen yeah right 911 ain't gonna do [ __ ] for you people you need to spiritual leader on that right that's a coven 911 moment if ever there was one but they call regular 911 and say neither my wife nor I are bleeding and there's no one else here but there's blood all over our house how to get the cops to your house in a hot flash exactly so the cops did get there and spoke to Minnie who told them that she had locked all the doors and set the alarm before she went up to take the bath that night as she did every night and she knew for a fact that no one else had been in the house the alarm had not gone off there was no evidence of an intruder and the police saw the blood too right the police saw the blood too interestingly enough one fact that I found a little weird was when the police were searching the basement they picked up a TV off of a table and there was blood underneath the TV so just blood in weird places they took some samples of it and sent it off to the State Crime Lab it was human blood even better or more interesting depending on how you look at it it was type O human blood guess what type of blood Willie and Minnie have no oh you're right type A they both have type A yeah but what was that at a point where they could kind of use that blood to determine the source or not necessarily well this was in 1987 I can't remember where we were with DNA back then yeah in 1987 they could not I was actually wondering that myself and I could not find if they had kept it anywhere to do DNA testing on it today so it's definitely was blood and it definitely was not either Minnie or Willies and no one had gotten into the house so the police searched the entire house from attic to basement and found no bodies no nothing just blood everywhere they're like oh call Surf Pro have a good night that's pretty true a detective cartright detective Steve Cartwright was an investigator on the case and he told us the Associated Press that he'd been on the force for 10 years and he said quote I've never seen anything like this the house baffled police for decades they still do not know to this day what happened did it happen again or was this just like a one off according to Minnie and Willie it never happened again and if you ask them about it when they were still unfortunately two years after it happened Willie passed away oh Minnie lived until she was 104 no [ __ ] that house sh her ass alive and she would actually get quite angry when people would ask her about it and always said that she felt was she said it was rust and water even though the State Crime Lab tested it and it was definitely typo human blood well initially I was thinking about you know how there's those trees that bleed I can't remember what type it is but there's those trees that bleed and I was like oh maybe their house was built out of that but well the crime lab kind of threw that theory out with saying it was human exactly and they'd Liv there for decades raised a family there and had never had anything like this happen any paranormal experience any voices any apparitions any anything as far as anyone who has lived in the house or Minnie would say nothing now some people do say that in order for Minnie to continue to live there she had kind of said a couple times that if it was blood she wouldn't be able to stay there so they think that she was kind of in denial and just insisted that it was rust and water the people that live Liv there since she died have not no incident no nothing no Amityville Poltergeist [ __ ] there has never been an explanation and it has never happened again so on that note my second story we will go to fire like what the [ __ ] I I wish I had more information but I couldn't find anything so if anyone knows or if you happen to know someone or if you yourself live at 1114 Fountain Drive in Atlanta Georgia email us at the stoned Witches Hour gmail.com I need to know more I need to know more because this is like a [ __ ] tease man it was in the New York Times it was in the Associated Press it it there were writeups all over for it at the time but no explanations whatsoever we we should title this episode what the [ __ ] okay we will okay so player what is this like now I'm really intrigued with this fire business so now we have a what the [ __ ] fire story this one is in Odon Indiana and this is Willie wait a minute hold on don't tell me they're both named Willie and Minnie that no no that can't be possible wait what they have the same exact name okay so hold on I I didn't I didn't even catch this until just now what's going on are you having your own Poltergeist moment I think I am William and Minnie Winston are the ones with the house that bled in Atlanta Georgia but it's William and Minnie Hackler in Odon Indiana what okay I'm freaked out now I had I didn't do this on purpose I swear I could see the look on your face and folks she did not do this on purpose because she's kind of freaked out right now I'm a little freaked out right now but so okay in 1940 William and Minnie hackler's house caught fire 28 different times first of all if my name's I refuse to marry someone named William at this point because you're gonna have Poltergeist in your house and it's going to be bad and I think either Earth or water or next I have the same thought okay anyway moving on so we're gonna go back in time a little bit because this house has a little bit of a history whereas The Bleeding House did not wait where are we Indiana We're in Indiana okay A House was built just after the Civil War by a gentleman named Marshall Ketchum and he moved there in the 1840s and he married a woman named Margaret cederwood in 1852 and they had a whole pel of children and built this cute little house unfortunately tragedy struck in the late 1880s and five people in Mitchell ketchum's Family died of the burning fever or typhus that's some [ __ ] that is pretty [ __ ] and then a few years later Marshall Ketchum himself self died of some type of debility you know after that sad start the house was sold to a gentleman named Andrew wickle who happened to be a spiritualist and his wife who was also a spiritualist weren't they all at that time I think they were I think everybody pretty much had to be you either sold an elixir of some sort or you were a spiritualist unfortunately while living in this house their two sons were killed in a hunting accident oh you know wickle inconsolable could not handle the loss of his sons and as we know spiritualists very often are going to reach out to these family members right so I'm sure he did a lot of that in the house probably was all consuming from all accounts he never got over the deaths of his children not that I can blame him that sucks he was so inconsolable with grief that it's said that he buried his sons he made a casket that had a glass window in it oh God that's creepy like like that's creepy so that he could always see the face of his child a and he told everyone that he knew that he had made Regular contact with the ghost of his son and that his son's Spirit regularly made his presence known that's sad I mean that's just sad after he passed away his wife was like yeah enough of this [ __ ] and had the kids properly buried so okay no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding the wickles sold it to the Hackler family William and Minnie I still can't get over that William and Minnie Hackler so they'd been living in the house for a little while it's early June in 1940 and Williams headed outside to do some farming chores and he smelled smoke coming from the house and so ran back into the house upstairs to discover in one of the empty bedrooms one strip of wallpaper was kind of curled up from the wall and burning oh [ __ ] they called the Odon fire department and the fire department came out and quickly put the fire out and said now at the time this Firehouse didn't have any electricity a lot of houses in this particularly farmhouses in the area did not have electricity built yet that was like for super rich people at that time so it could not have been a an electrical fire in the walls the firemen figured that maybe it was an old chimney that had gotten bricked up that maybe had a coal or something so they broke through the wall and Not only was there no chimney there but there was nothing burnt on the back side of the wall so it hadn't come from inside the wall at all it was just that one strip of fire weird so no chimney damage nothing so the fire departments leave and they're not really sure what happened no sooner did they get back to the fire department than they're getting another call from William and Minnie and said that in another bedroom of the house a mattress was smoldering the fire seemed to have been started from inside the mattress so the fire department goes back out to their house and while they're putting out the mattress fire more fires start popping up in the house in random different locations in random different locations Wily's clothes hanging on the back of the bedroom door first into flame one fireman in the living room saw a book on the bookshelf start to smoke so he pulled it off and found all the pages on the inside were burning but the cover was intact now were these people spirit cists too or just the people prior just the people prior and these people had lived there for over a decade before this happened what the hell did they bring anybody in please tell me they did well this day is not over before it's over over 100 firemen from two different towns were called to come help put out fires holy [ __ ] between 800 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. over nine fires were put out in the house and then after that it was just one fire after another two neighbors came over to see what was going on and while they were standing in the living room talking about it the curtains across from them in the room caught on fire and they never figured like was there ga there had to be some like gaseous fume that's what some people did suggest that maybe some type of fumes were there or maybe someone was trying to play a prank but there were people crawling all over the house and the fires would start where no one was another one was in the while they were in the kitchen after things had seemed to die down and they were talking about it a calendar on the wall burst into flames but did no damage at all no burn marks no Scorch marks no nothing to the wallpaper underneath the calendar okay was that house built on a portal to hell that's what the family wondered because that night around 11:00 p.m. the fires died out and no more came and so all the fire department left and every all the neighbors left the family took the beds that weren't burnt and put them outside and decided to sleep outside William told reporters quote I don't believe in Spooks so the only thing I was afraid of that night was fire breaking out again that way don't let him fool you he's a scared [ __ ] right so after that day they took the house down piece by piece and moved it over a mile away and rebuilt it on a different spot and never never had another fire all right so that tells me that portal to hell some shit's going on on that land because it's literally the same freaking house right some people did say that some sort of random gas may be floating through the house one gentleman uh said that he thought that the house was situated at the center of magnetic fields a triangulation of magnetic fields others said the house was haunted or cursed the Indiana State Fire Marshal just said it was quot the most baffling mystery he had ever seen have they built anything on that specific plot of land since as far as I can tell nothing has been built in that specific plot so maybe it was related to the spiritualist so I don't know what to tell you but those are two really weird houses I have to say I feel like you're leaving me hanging tonight all the way around well yours was a
