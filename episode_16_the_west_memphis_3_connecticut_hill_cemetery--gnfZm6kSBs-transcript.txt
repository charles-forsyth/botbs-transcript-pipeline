that does look like a lot of fun kick our music festival patronage up a notch go to Romania yeah right what was the last Music Festival you went to like mother earth or something I guess it depends on what kind of Festival what was the last um we went to that one that had um Snoop Dog and um Bone Thugs fck you it wasn't really wasn't really a festival it was just like a multi concert Dr Dre um it wasn't really a festival though we suck we did go to some music or to some pot festivals that had music Ice Cube yeah we went so we went to a Pot Festival with Ice Cube to out um but yeah I know like Pagan music festivals the hour Festival Mother Earth Harvest Moon Harvest [Music] Moon haven't been to those in a long time Coachella is happening right up the road from me actually isn't that like a rich celebrity thing it really does seem to be that way I thought before I got here I thought Coachella was going to be you know it's the Music and Arts Festival and and you always see people with flowers in their hair and dressed like hippies and no it's really just rich people cosplaying as hippies for the weekend sometimes there's really great music there don't get me wrong but it's kind of yeah yeah they have you know VIP sections and everyone's trying to get their Instagram photo and it's it's very much a different kind of vibe music is great the festival is very commercial you're not you're not buying your grilled cheese sandwich for $3 from a guy who hasn't showered in a week no there's no Shakedown Street right festivals were fun I miss it but from what I've seen it looks like it could be like that at un told it could be that does look like a lot of fun I mean anything that's going to have those Gothic arches and a laser light show and fireflies that's interesting I'm there I want to check it out it could be fun not to mention you know Vlad the impers castle I bet there is probably a ghost or two there what do you think that's not even a question I me is that isn't Romania where that that one queen or or Highborn lady that literally used to bathe in her maid's blood did wasn't she there oh shoot what was her name literally bathe in blood like she'd kill her maids and have their blood drained into the bathtub the lady b was it lady b I'd have to look hold on oh yeah Lady B the Hungarian serial killer lady ba she was a Hungarian Noble woman and supposedly a serial killer she just felt like the blood made her skin look younger that's all don't be hating that was it right don't don't be hating on her she just she just needed a wrinkle cream that's all she's just don't we all need a little of that freshening up you know what's what's a couple Maids here or there right who's gonna miss them it's pretty terrible actually but I don't have no idea if that's anywhere near Romania or not but that's who I think of when I think of like the whole vampire Legend is Lady bathy in her literal bathtubs full of blood actually Romania borders Hungary oh well see there you go I guess my geography isn't too too bad yeah Romania is bordered by malova Serbia Hungary and freaking Ukraine so we got to let [ __ ] kind of settle there for a minute right yeah I guess we won't be visiting but yeah that's just wild her whole story just wild anyway different podcast different podcast back to the US ass I you know I remember we were talking about how you always reach for high THC and we were talking a little bit about celebrity weed and so I thought I'd go looking for some celebrity weed and we mentioned what did you find chich and Chong were my Idols as a teenager and a Young Stoner who didn't love them back in the day who doesn't still love them advocates for the cause I mean great guys they're just a lot of fun and apparently they have amazing weed and I don't know if you remember but I mentioned fuchi K pesta which means like what stinks or who farted in Spanish isn't it just Chong that has the weed isn't chich out of it isn't it just Chong that has the company nope this is Chichi stash fuchi K pesta is directly from chicha stash and um he does have a few different types this one is a hybrid and it has 32.3% THC shell and I know you love the big thc's wow how does it smoke really good this stuff is great it certainly lives up to his name you open the bag and oh my God the aroma fabulous it hits you right in the face smell like does it smell like skunk or flour like what's it smell like I would say a little skunky kind of earthy you know it's got that little bit of really really heavy green smell and it just hits you right in the face slaps you right up the face and you're like oh yeah literally who farted what's that smell fuchi pesta okay that sounds Italian why do I sound Italian that's bad fuchi K pesta so fui k pesta um good stuff little purpley smokes really good is it dense or it's dense it's sticky it's fabulous really great High great body high little expensive for me and honestly I was just going to ask you that what is the price of celebrity weed celebrity weed is pretty pricey it's about $60 e oh that's what we pay here in Massachusetts so that's just the norm yeah I don't like that price I've heard other places are a lot less expensive and that's why I grow my own man that's that's expensive that's crazy crazy price and I've had other weed okay this is good it's kind of purpley it's dark it's dense it's sticky and the smell literally does smack you in the face with that kind of earthy skunky goodness what did you say it was 32% 32% yep 32.3% it's good definitely very Stony body high good stuff I would say more on the indicia side of a hybrid you know really Buzzy and relaxy however I can get that same really good wonderful but not quite so expensive you know but like you said that's pretty much if you're going to buy top shelf that's what you're going to pay if you want the higher thc's and as we all know sometimes it's not always the THC percentage but the other tpin and different chemicals that are in there that can interact and give you different types of high so even though shell and I do tend to to reach for the smack in the face higher thcs you can sometimes get a a longer lasting high a better High a more body high a buzzier high from lower thc's um with different tpin which is why having a great bud tender makes all the difference you really need to talk to someone who smoked it who knows the experience Bud tenders are key so do you think that you really ultimately were paying more for the name as opposed to the quality of marijuana I I have to actually give it to cheat in this aspect I would say it's just as good as other top shelf and no more than other top shelf so and as far as packaging goes just a little simple seal pack is is far preferable to the plastic that's shrink wrapped in a cardboard box that's also shrink wrapped that's in another plastic seal pack I would say it was really good it was very enjoyable honestly because I'm I'm paying this the same price pretty much on the regular uh here I would be interested to try to get my on that to see if it's any better than the normal $60 e I'm getting here right good point because you are continuously grabbing from that topshelf and smoking it where as I go back and forth between I like to try a lot of different types and different price points just to see where things are at plus I supplement a lot with my own weed so I have a little bit of a different perspective so I'd be curious to see what your take on this and again I wish I could just send it to you why can't I just ship this to you and be like hey sh I tried this great [ __ ] out why don't you get a buzz and tell me what you think I would love to BU in the mail right that's it's just not fair I should be able to overnight ship this to you roll up a joint send it to you we could smoke together and you could tell me you know um in in honor of our our 420 episode um I did want to mention uh since we last met for our podcast the bill what did it it passed the Senate and needs to go to the house or pass the house needs to go to the Senate something like that but it it's a step it is a step closer to that that Federal acceptance and then if that were to happen you could pop a bud in an envelope and ship it to me if that were to happen yeah that would be nice let's see which one was it it was the so it passed the house and and then it has to go to the Senate then it's also got to go to the president after that and I guess Democrats are working on another legalization bill so even if this one fails somewhere which it doesn't look like it's going to cross you know knock on wood they'll have one they'll have another one one a plan B in the wings oddly enough Chuck Schumer I mean I didn't think I'd ever say this but you know New York go Chuck Schumer you want to know why don't give the man credit he's a greedy [ __ ] and he sees what Massachusetts is making and he is jelly he's like show me the money you know you're probably right I'm not an adult yet we all know this and I'm coming to realize that no one is and there's no such thing as good guys or bad guys there just isn't no one is just a good guy or just a bad guy it just doesn't happen like that and so that was one of those false things we were taught as children that like somebody pulled out of their ass and they're like this sounds good let's teach this to our kids so let me tell you about my my my 420 yes what are you smoking for this wonderful High holiday I keep forgetting to mention that it's 420 I mean 42 what did you get sh the score of the Year oh do tell obviously I know you're not used to having to pay what we pay for premium quality marijuana here true but so generally more often than not uh what you're looking at in in the state of Massachusetts is about 60 bucks an E I can't tell you the other prices because I generally go eth by eth they do on occasion you know I've I've talked on previous podcasts my complaints about how some stores charge 60 and then tax and then some the some stores charge 60 which already includes the tax for the same grade weed right right right so you know I already have that dilemma here right so the store with the good pricing we'll we'll actually shout them out because I just love them Happy Valley what a great name for a weed store Happy Valley it works it totally works so they do have have some that are maybe a little lower than 60 on occasion we'll call it a quote unquote sale who doesn't love a good sale I mean come on right we all love to Save A Buck especially on cannabis so I go up there yesterday and of course they're having their their big 420 week sale and they have mix and match any 88 for 288 which is 88 oh [ __ ] what's 8 time 60 hold on let me get the calculator out 480 isn't that 480 * 60 isn't that 480 holy cow that's a deal right like I saved like almost 2 ounces for $280 oh no wait eight that's 1 o 1 o 1 o for $280 which okay I can do some math you were close still a deal still a deal I saved like 196 eight top shelf eights nice and because they have such good quality weed at Happy Valley you could only get two of the same cultivar and I'm like I know what a cultivar is because Lea taught me I'm like I'm like that's a flavor I know what that is of course I know what that means good for you that's fantastic I feel I feel accomplished now you're you're educating me it's a slow and steady uphill climb but it's happening we'll get you there so what I'm smoking today out of my mix and match 8 for8 for 288 I have Lio which is this batch is 2827 THC and that's actually the lowest THC out of the mix and match choices I made nice to have that as the low bar is pretty sweet I went back to good old standbys you know when I love something I ride that wave so I I got some um Super Lemon OG love a lemon I love a lemon and I got white wedding in Jasmine silver haze oh yeah don't get me started on Silver hazes a [ __ ] to grow [ __ ] to grow but so so good why are they hard to grow sativas are sa sativas are picky [ __ ] they're picky picky [ __ ] uh they take forever they like their light a certain way they're temperature and humidity a certain way they like their noes just right get them off a little bit and she'll start to so show signs of stress or nutrient burn or nutrient deficiency and and then once you have one little problem with a [ __ ] sativa then it Cascades into more problems they are picky [ __ ] so are indicas just more weedy easy to grow kind of more resilient honestly yes um some some cultivars are more resilient than others too and and yeah there are some sativas that are easy to grow and there are some indicas that are picky [ __ ] but most of the time sativas uh [ __ ] what are they called Autoflower sativas aren't as bad they don't take as long but they still take a long time but photo period sativas can take a long long time like four months in just in flow 3 4 months just from the time they start to flower and that's a long time particularly now when people are used to you know 3 month turnover with auto flowers or less you know even less after four months you're starting to panic right and that can take up you know sometimes I would have just a couple of them in my garden and they can take up a lot of space you know you have to tie them down they get very very tall they get very tall and stretchy and so you have to accommodate for that in your garden if you're growing other indicas that are short now you've got weird light situations so then you have to use some type of low stress low stress training or LST and tie them down to kind of try and keep an even canopy like a sea of green kind of canopy what a pain in the ass they are a pain in the ass worth it delicious Fabulous High a lot of Growers will keep those as their head stash as their personal stash because you just they're that good and you're just not going to get the return that you deserve for the amount of time time and care and again there's a lot of new things that make that easier autof flowers definitely simplify that process you can still get sativas and honestly hybrids are way more popular and now we've gone off on a growing tangent holy [ __ ] so tell me more about your 88 shell so like these these are like really you know high quality for the for the deal 28.8 4 THC for the silver haze nice they what is this white wedding 34.64211 Place White Wedding nice also I have the Cannabis Cup uh High Times first place in a different category of the Super Lemon Hayes and that was 31.12 you know it's not like these deals are on like the 16% this this like mix and match eight8 is like for the good quality [ __ ] like I feel like I went to a thrift store and found gold nice and you still spent almost $300 yeah but I saved so much that it's worth it it was so worth it because it it's not like I'm not going to smoke it too right right it's going to get smoked absolutely so that's pretty good so yeah we're smoking on a lot not so many um Edibles or you know dabs this time mostly flow mostly flower for this 420 yeah I'm I'm doing my traditional stick with my pretty little pipe for for my 420 celebrations so tell us how you guys are celebrating 420 did you buy anything special did you buy anything extra are you planning on going to a park and smoking in

show us your show us your smoking apparatus show us what you're smoking show us what you're smoking I'd love to see that happy 420 happy 420 anyway I I what's your story today I know that we we talked a lot about about weed today and 420 stuff and celebrating 420 but we were going to put in put in some some actual ghosty Ghoulies yes and this is a big story I'm going to try and keep it as short as I possibly can but there is so much to the story this is a a story that actually I have been following since the mid 90s back in the mid90s I was on the internet all the time and was constantly looking for witchy stuff you know was a young witch myself and when the only the only witchy site you could find back then was the witch's voice remember the witches voice website they're still up they're actually still a presence online go witch Fox right and I do remember looking for different sites different message board W different places where I could meet witches other witches whether across the country or where I was I was new to my area right around the same time I met you yeah and um so I was new to where I was living I was trying to find pagans anywhere and at that time it was very difficult to find anyone who was a pagan it was difficult to be out of the broom closet quote unquote and and so I did connect with people online and that's where I met a lot of people and eventually met you and the local Pagan group in the area so I happened to stumble across a story out of a a city called West Memphis in Arkansas where um three young boys had been murdered and there were three local teens that were accused of the crime and it was a big Satanist story that what was it didn't they call it like the West Memphis 3 or something if I exactly this is about the West Memphis 3 I vaguely remember that from like the news back then it actually became a three-part documentary on HBO that kind of blew up the story and and became famous with Johnny Depp with Eddie veter from Pearl Jam with um uh one of the Dixie Chicks and all these people joined this cause and I'll get to that but I'll tell you why but before it was even a documentary The the boys were on trial and I found it because one of them at the time was Wiccan and was was into witchcraft so at the time the fact that he was Wiccan and into witchcraft was paraded as proof positive that he was a Satanist and he was even quoted In Articles at the time talking about the goddess and talking about wiah and it being an earth-based religion and and it blew my mind because no one talked about it at that time and here is a young man who was a witch just like me who was exploring wiah just like I was at the time and he was being literally persecuted for a murder that he didn't commit and called a Satanist because of his beliefs so so I was I was drawn into the story and they were found teenagers they were 16 17 and 18 at the time they were um Damen Eckles Jesse Miss Kelly and Jason Baldwin Damen Eckles was the young man at the time who was 18 and who was accused of being a Satanist he was actually under the care of a social worker because he did have a lot of he had a lot of depression he had some mental health issues and so he was under the care of a social worker Jerry driver was a juvenile probation officer for criten County and he was obsessed with Satanism this social worker literally would drive around at night of full moons looking for Satanist activity the guy saw Satanist in every [ __ ] Shadow and this is right at the end of do you remember the satanic Panic that was going on in the 80s like every freaking daycare they were satanists every other star was a Satanist and Satanist they were like Satan is hidden in every nook and cranny of society it was like the 80s version of the witch hunts exactly exactly so this was the early 90s again tail end of the of the satanic panic but it was still there we knew people who would not say that they were Pagan or Wiccan or witches because of legitimate fear of losing their job or losing their children or or having people of a town work against them and here's proof positive that it was happening and then in 1996 the HBO documentary but let's rewind for a moment I'm going to take a to Let's rewind and I'm going to tell you the story okay and I'm I'm I'm I'm curious about this because this is also sort a time you and I happen to have the same job at the same company at that particular point in history correct right around there and people used to think that we were just batshit crazy because we would go to work in that particular environment and wear our Pentacles and they were likeoh my God how can you do that and we're like loud and proud [ __ ] we kind of relied maybe very naively but it worked out for us we relied on our constitutional right and made it a point to point out that was our constitutional right freedom of religion but there was a lot of people that we knew and and were a part of the the local community with that couldn't accept how you and I were at that time I was in the newspaper at that time we all were remember we were on the front page we were on the front page wearing regular clothes using our real names our legal names and it caused a big stir not only because we were willing to be on the front page but because everyone's like you look so normal and we're like well this is how we do ritual [ __ ] we just wear you know everyone thought you had to dress up and wear weird clothes and and and of course that's fun don't get me wrong I love to dress up in ritual G I had to work I had to work all day and I got to take my kid to a softball practice I ain't got time to change clothes you're I'm doing ritual in my work clothes here people we were one of the first groups to show people that witches were just regular people they could be people who just went to a circle in their work cloth after work and before picking up their kids to to give thanks and and and it opened the eyes of a lot of people but we were not hidden we were not in the broom closet and like you said loud and proud We wore our Pentacles and a lot of people thought we were outing them as well they felt like we were outing the greater local community and they were angry at us there were people that were angry at us because we chose not to be hidden in any sort of closet per se but we never never would give anyone up because again we knew that the possibility that people could lose their children over this we were lucky enough to both have Partners who are witches at that time and so we knew that that wasn't something that could happen we were safe in that but we also knew that other people were not so safe people were losing children because they practice wiah or Witchcraft and and that was a legitimate fear they just kind of misplaced it onto us but somehow you and I we were just very defiant against that stereotype very against that stereotype I mean I remember back in that day people would be like you can't be a witch you're not wearing black well when I went to the store I like that shirt and that has nothing to do with my religion I just liked it and I bought it and now I'm wearing it people were under the impression at that point that you know almost like that gothic look it was like oh you know we were the original assumed Gothic people while if you're a witch you have to be wearing dark makeup and dark clothes and combat boots boots I've never owned a pair of combat boots in my life people I have I still do but the point is is that you know we kind of we bucked that stereotype they saw us in nice shirts and nice pants and you know not that ritual Garb isn't nice but it they saw we were in work business clothes we were in soccer mom clothes um we were in PTA clothes exactly and it helped people to see that with are just people we're just people who have a different set of beliefs than you do nothing different and in Damen eckel's case the young man in that is part of the West Memphis 3 his belief in in witchcraft led to people literally calling him a Satanist and blaming him for these deaths but you know he he was at a disadvantage as well because not that rural Upstate New York was super Pleasant and diverse friendly but the South here is this this teenager in the Deep South you know in the Bible Belt saying he's wicked super conservative super religious super Baptist exactly and he stood out like a sore thumb because that's the Bible Belt and to them he was Satan he was literally they called him that so here's what happened so it's 1993 May 5th 1993 three young boys Chris Byers Michael Moore and Stevie branch uh local 8-year-olds they were all second graders they were in Boy Scouts together uh well known by The Neighborhood love to play together they were together that afternoon they were supposed to be home by 5:00 p.m. at least one of the boys was supposed to be home by 5:00 p.m. right around 4:30ish they were all seen two of them on bikes going towards a local wooded area you know just behind the houses the kids like to play in it was kind of between the suburb and a Truck Stop and it was kind of a like a creek like a river drainage ditch that ran through a wooded area and I feel like every kid has grown up with some sort of scenery like that exactly the best place to play in when you are a young kid 8-year-old [ __ ] catnip place like that to the creek man going to the creek to the woods in the creek so they were seen headed that way the place was called Robin Hood Hills by the local people and so they were seen going towards Robin Hood Hills some people saw them headed that way around 6:00 p.m. on May 5th and some people also recall seeing Terry Hobbs The Stepfather to to Stevie Branch one of the boys calling them to come home right around that same time however they didn't come home around 8:00 p.m. the boys were reported missing by John Mark buers who was the adoptive father of Christopher buers 8:10 the police got to John's house and questioned him by 8:30 John Mark buers is out looking for his son and the other boys 9:00 p.m. the mother Pamela Hobbs of one of the other boys Stevie Branch she gets home from work it's told by her husband Terry Hobbs who's Stevie's stepfather that he hasn't seen the boy all day so now she's worried and the other mother Dana Moore at this time 9:00 p.m. both of them report the boy's missing and everyone starts to look for the boys 6:00 a.m. the next morning the boys are officially declared missing by the Chief Inspector of the West Memphis Police Department a gentleman named Gary gell and there's video there's quite a bit of video of this there's actually a documentary Called Paradise Lost it's the first part of three and I did see this documentary in 1996 which was after uh the West Memphis 3 had been convicted of these crimes but anyway so you can see that video if you want to it is online so there's search parties looking for the boys you can see a couple of the mothers you can see uh the one adoptive father um John Mark buers in the video and they're searching for these kids and can't find them so around 1:45 in the afternoon one of the Searchers is in Robin Hood Hills near the creek and he sees what he thinks is a sneaker on the bank opposite and he goes to reach for it and kind of Falls steps into the creek now picture a small small River small Creek they call it a drainage ditch sometimes but it literally looks like a little river that runs through the small woods and the area where this gentleman is looks like it could be a small swimming hole um when he's in the water it's up to the top of his thighs so an eight-year-old boy or a young kid it would be pretty deep you know a decent place to go swimming potentially waste th exactly so it when you hear drainage ditch it's not tiny it's literally has places you could a kid could swim and play in so he kind of Falls in and and steps into the water to reach the opposite opposite bank to get the sneaker that he sees and in doing so his foot gets Tangled in what he thinks might be roots or a log underneath and so he gets the shoe and as he's stepping out he kind of Falls backwards and what he's actually Tangled on is the one of the bodies of one of the boys oh Jesus so they find in that in that hole uh where he had found the shoe they find two of the boys Stevie and Christopher were there and then a little bit further down they found uh the other boy Michael Moore and all three boys were naked and they had been tied hog tied with their hands behind their back their left wrist to their left ankle and their right wrist to their right ankle with their shoelaces um the boys appeared to have quite a few wounds on them one of the boys Christopher buyers um had multiple scratches and bruises all over his body and what appeared to be bite marks and also his his scrotum and the skin of his penis had been ripped from his body oh my God Stevie Branch his cheek was torn off and he had multi also stab what looked to be stab wounds scratches and bruising and Michael Moore uh who was the boy that was found a little bit further away he appeared to be the least injured of all the boys but he also had extensive bruising and scratches and what appeared to be puncture wounds the autopsy you can find all of the autopsy information online Christopher buers um died of multiple skull fractures he had bruising on both of his ears and around his eyes and he had fractures um on his face and the base of his skull and the coroner determined that that is what had killed him the other two boys also had um it looked like they had been beaten extensively in the head and they all had multiple skull fractures that would have killed them according to the coroner but their cause of death was drowning oh yeah so the the brutal manner that the boys appeared to have died their their brutal wounds the fact that they were naked and they were tied their their clothes were found like whoever had killed them had taken their clothes and wrapped them around like logs like and sticks and shoved it into the creek to kind of hide it so they wouldn't be found weird right according to reports there was a social worker on the scene when the boys were found and he said that it looked like satanic activity and this is Damen eckl social worker who again was obsessed with Satanism oh God I don't know why he decided this was a Satanic ritual but he's like looks like Satanism I know just the guy did did anybody look into that guy just saying right I don't know but honestly don't call me an investigator but I'm just throwing out ideas right they almost immediate now normally when a child dies who do they look at first parents exactly do you know who they never looked at especially because it sounds like some of them had stepparents and adoptive parents which is technically statistically not all the time don't be flooding our mail but statistically speaking abuse would happen more by an adoptive parent or a stepparent more so than a biological parent and it seems like at least two of these three children if not all three had either a stepparent and an adoptive parent so I'd be like hey adoptive dad what you've been up to hey guy hey stepdad they never look at the parents and here is the second greatest tragedy of this murder is that the police immediately jumped to the Satanism angle and if you watch the first documentary the town's people were more than ripe for this type of [ __ ] they were seeing Satanist everywhere they were convinced that these boys who wore black and listen to Metallica and read Stephen King and one of them was into wika they were convinced that these kids were Satanist that was us we were black we were into Metallica yeah we read books about wiah Stephen King man the stand how can you how can you hate that exactly oh my God so all of this the main evidence was just the suggestion of the social worker that's where it started they did question Damen Eckles in the beginning and let him go he said he didn't know the boys had had never heard of them where things kind of went sideways was there was a woman uh Victoria Hutchinson I believe her name was is she wanted to play detective and she decided she was going to crack this case and even described herself as a as a detective and was going to help the police her son who was a Playmate of the boys who had been killed was babysat by a young man who lived in her apartment building Jesse Miss Kelly Jesse Miss Kelly has a below average or um very limited IQ she said that um she wanted to know more about Daman Eckles because she felt he was a Satanist like a lot of kids like a lot of people in town did and so she asked Jesse Miss Kelly to introduce her to Daman Eckles Jesse didn't really know Daman and Jason Baldwin um the other two boys as part of the West Memphis 3 they were familiar with each other from school but didn't really hang out so she recorded a conversation with them where she tried to get them to talk about the murders and they just didn't really nothing ever really came of it however the police did bring Jesse Miss Kelly in for questioning again Jesse is 17 years old and has the comprehension of a six or seven year-old his father gave permission for him to be spoken to by the police basically the police are like we just want to ask your son some questions and there's a reward if he knows anything and can lead us to The Killers and so Dad said okay by various accounts they questioned Jesse Miss Kelly alone unrecorded for anywhere between 2 and a half and 12 hours depending on which account you believe is that legal technically they asked his father for permission and the father gave verbal permission today none of that would be allowed none of that would be allowed there was no lawyer present they only recorded 30 minutes at the very end of all of their questioning and in that 30 minutes he supposedly confessed and said that he and Daman Eckles and Jason Baldwin had gone to the Robin Hood Hills to drink and decided to attack these boys and kill them in a Satan satanistic manner he claimed that Damian and Jason sexually assaulted these boys and that he only helped hold them down and tie them up and that the boys choke uh that Damian and Jason choked the boys with sticks as well as beat them up and stabbed them multiple times and mutilated them again one of the boys scrotum and penis skin had been ripped off and one boy's cheek had been ripped off so they basically coed a mentally inept person yes into an elaborate story that fit their need very much so and according to the expert that testified for the defense and even if you just look at the transcripts all of the transcripts and information are available online and I will put a link where you can do all your own research if you'd like to um but the the expert testified it's it's extremely obvious that they LED this boy if he didn't say what they wanted him to say like they asked him what time it happened and he said 9:00 a.m. and they're like well what time did you actually get together wasn't it in the afternoon and he's like oh yeah it was in the afternoon and then they're like well wasn't it dark didn't you say earlier it was 8 or 9 and he'd say oh yeah it was eight or nine and they would keep leading him to the answer they wanted him to give and they also said when the expert was questioned as to how he knew about the injuries of the boys the police had already admitted that they had been showing him pictures you know in the 2 and 1/2 or 12 hours prior to the recording they had told him everything they needed him to know and he just kind of regurgitated it investigators later to prove that how easy it is to get him to confess actually got him to confess to a bank robbery that he had nothing to do with because it's just that easy to kind of lead someone particularly someone who's eager to please and has a a low IQ false confessions happen especially now we know this and back in the '90s the coercion tact tactics that they used weren't as known about as they are now so this very obviously fake confession was all they had to go on to convict these boys and again in the town ran rampant and the police did nothing to stop them they talked about that one of the boys testies were found in a jar under Damian's bed which was absolutely not true completely fake at this point film crew is following these kids around and you the documentary is very biased towards the West Memphis 3 being innocent and I do feel that they're Innocent but just keep in mind when you watch the documentary it's extremely biased towards them being innocent so keep that in mind the boys were convicted one and Damen Eckles was sentenced to death however when Jesse was tried he was tried separately from Damian and Jason and in it in his trial they used his confession against him even though he had immediately recanted the confession and told people that they had told him if he gave up The Killers he could buy his dad a truck because there was a $35,000 reward and he'd be able to pay off all of his dad's debts wow oh so he was found guilty however it was determined that they could not use his confession in the trial against Jason Baldwin and Damen Eckles they really didn't have any evidence against the two of them other than that confession so they did use some other things uh in the trials Jason Baldwin was being held and this other gentleman Michael Carson was being held with him at the same time and Michael Carson testified in court that he had had a private moment moment with Jason Baldwin where he had asked Jason if he had done it and Jason said yes and then described that he had dismembered the boys cut off their scrotum and put their testicles in his mouth and so he testified that that Jason had told him that in private and that was used against them in trial however one of Michael Carson's doctors had tried to call the court and contact the lawyers and let them know that he had been the one who had told Michael Carson those details to try and scare him into doing well in therapy saying you know if you get sent over to detention you're going to have to be with this guy who did this to these little boys so saying this is how he got the information he he didn't get it from Jason Baldwin he was never alone with Jason Baldwin it's provable that he was never alone with him and I'm the source of where he got that information and they didn't allow that wow Jason and Damien were found guilty and it was found later that the jury Foreman Kent Arnold had actually had quite a bit of knowledge of the confession of Jesse Miss Kelly and brought it to the attention of the jurors in the deliberation room even though he wasn't supposed to and in conversations with his own lawyer that have also come to light in the early 2000s this jury Foreman was actually trying to get them convicted because he felt that Damen Eckles was a Satanist and that Jesse M Kelly's confession was true they have um sheets you know where the where the jury was writing out notes when they were deliberating and one of the lines in the notes was completely blacked out and they they got one of the juror's notebooks where she had copied that list and that line wasn't blacked out in her list and it was Jesse Miss Kelly's confession which was never supposed to have been brought to the attention of the jurors so this was one big fabrication really from the GetGo start to finish the police at the time were absolutely convinced that Damen Eckles Jason Balwin and Jesse Miss Kelly had done this even though they had been the ones that had coerced this confession what led them why did why did why did Damen Eckles get the death penalty and the other two didn't I believe it it was because he was 18 and they also felt that he was the ring leader and he was the only one that was 18 so he was he was sentenced to death and they were sentenced to life in prison without parole I gota okay I didn't I didn't okay I didn't realize that part I was like what the hell did they do that for especially since to be honest with you none of them probably did it anyway right right so the Chief Inspector of the Police Department Gary gell it seemed like he was on a [ __ ] Crusade he was determined to be the cool guy he was going to solve this and and this had gotten national attention before the documentary and you should see some of the [ __ ] the reporters asked these people they a reporter literally asked one of the mothers if she was considering joining her son and when she acted confused he's like suicide do you think you're going to commit suicide the attention that this case got was crazy and Gary gell was eating it up and he was determined to be the White Knight savior in this super Baptist town they asked him after this confession they brought in the three boys the West Memphis three they asked Gary gitchell on a scale of 1 to 10 how sure are you of this conviction and he said I'm an 11 and you can see the self smug satisfaction he's so sure of himself and in that moment he convinced himself that he's absolutely right beyond a shadow of a doubt and he literally references that same moment multiple times I've seen it in at least three or four different interviews with him where he says they one time asked me on a scale of 1 to 10 how sure was I and I said I was an 11 you can just see he loved that moment and he repeats it over and over and over again so more evidence came out and better DNA technology came out and they've determined that none of the DNA that they found like on a hair that was tied and with the shoelaces that were used to tie the boys um none of that DNA matched West Memphis 3 it did match Terry Hobs The Stepfather of one of the victims and another hair found nearby on their clothing matched uh Terry hobbs' best friend I told you but it didn't match the West Memphis 3 so people have been trying the one defense attorney uh for Jesse Miss Kelly never let this go that guy freaking amazing he doggedly he used his own money this was like his first murder case he ever defended and he tried everything to get these boys free and he stayed on this for decades until they were finally more evidence came in um St got involved again Johnny Depp Eddie veter the Dixie Chicks because this was obviously a miscarriage of Justice every time um Damen Eckles or Jason Baldwin would bring this up in front of the judge the same judge that had sentenced them he would deny them the right to a retrial he would deny the addition of new evidence why were they stuck in front of the same court in the same judge time and time again the judge's name is David Bernett And he supposedly said that he post ton to run for state senate so that he could be the one to reside over their numerous appeals it even went it finally when they got this DNA evidence it finally went to to the Arkansas um Supreme Court Supreme Court yep and I guess at this time the judge that had been presiding over it since the original trial had gotten elected to the Senate and so there was a new judge in place as well these guys just don't want to admit that they made a mistake and even when they this DNA evidence was presented and the state was given the choice to retry them they basically told the guys you can spend the next several years in jail during which time Damen Eckles might be executed or you can take what's called an Alfred plea and what this Alfred plea is is they basically say yes you're right we were guilty but you're just going to let us off with the time we already served and we state that we're innocent which is so weird so they were like yes I'm Innocent but I will plead guilty to time served and so that you'll let me out and basically that was all so that the state wouldn't have to pay them reparations because there's so much evidence to show that these guys are innocent and had nothing to do with it that if they did go to retrial and were acquitted they would these three men would be owed millions they spent 18 years in jail for a crime that they didn't commit and the real killer so much evidence was lost and mishandled handled and it's even now today there this past February again this defense attorney that wouldn't let go found evidence that the sheriff's department had said was lost for decades found it and is trying to get them to allow him to use new DNA technology to test it and they won't let him do it it's just crazy mismanagement and and old boys club boggling and this Gary gell guy just in in like 2010 or 2011 I guess was interviewed again and he's like you know this is after the West Memphis 3 had been released he's like I still think they're guilty I'm an 11 out of you know scale of 1 to 10 I'm still at an 11 and if these Stars just came and talked to me I know I could convince them that that they're guilty that these guys are guilty and the reporter said well isn't all the evidence out there yes you know isn't isn't everything that you is there something that the Sheriff's Office knows that they haven't talked about that proves that these guys are guilty and the officer had to say no there is no evidence there is nothing special but even going through as much evidence as I could find online and every single document is available online there's nothing to tie these three men to this other than satanic panic and a sheriff that was determined to close a case shut the case down so the community settles down do to calm the masses exactly and these three Poor Boys the documentary started to try and point a finger towards um not Hobbs the documentaries Point more towards the the adoptive father because he's he's always there he always was in the spotlight anytime there's anything about these kids comes up he's there his wife um the boy's mother uhuh died three years after her son died under unusual Circ cumstances uh and he he mentions in an interview when he says when my wife was murdered by who right so John Mark buers the adopted father to Christopher buers looks a lot very guilty in these documentaries because he he's he's a little out there he very extreme views very religious prone to spouting off religious views setting things on fire and just generally acting really odd but they already had their convi so they already had their convictions of the three guys and he was determined that the westm three were guilty however when the new DNA evidence came out he even changed his tune and he basically said I was wrong he he said I said since the beginning if evidence showed that they were innocent then I'll go with it he says evidence shows now that they're innocent and he believes that Terry Hobs because it was his DNA that was found on the the shoelace the other reason speculation has going to Terry Hobbs is his now ex-wife wife Pamela um at the time that the boys were killed Terry Hobbs and Pamela Hobbs were fighting she was mad at him because he had been caught cheating on her I I watched a video with him where he talks about beating her and her deserving it and that he was mad at her because she was kissing a guy supposedly in their house and that he was going to get even he has a very violent past and is known to be violent with her oh who's to say was and his DNA and his DNA she now says she thinks he did it and the reason one of the biggest reason reasons why is that she says that her son her son Stevie Branch had a pocket knife that he carried with him everywhere that had belonged to his grandfather and he never left home without that pocket knife the pocket knife was not recovered with his clothing at the scene two pairs of the boys underwear were missing and this pocket knife we missing she found that pocket knife in Terry hobbs' drawer and he had never told her that he had it and she doesn't know why he would have it she had long thought that the killer had taken that pocket knife and she found it later the killer probably did take the pocket knife [ __ ] and she found it and she it's a in a statement again you can find it online and I'll have a link to it in a statement she says to the police she describes that knife and says why she thinks Terry hops should be a suspect because of that pocket knife wow I hope she divorced them she did she did so yeah there's a lot of video out there there's a lot of information it's it's what happened to them to who they're not still in the the the three they're not mhis no they took that Alfred plea in 2011 and were released and they have been released since then Jesse Miss Kelly I believe is still living in West Memphis uh he keeps a very low profile he doesn't have any social media you can snail mail him there isn't address you can mail him through in care of another person the um Damen Eckles has written quite a few books he's been active he's on social media online he's he's done quite a few um interviews with people you can find those he did live in Salem Massachusetts for a while Louisiana I believe he lives in New York City now I'm not 100% sure he's been married actually for quite a long time he and his wife married in while he was in prison and they're still together very cute story I heard he wrote the lyrics to a Pearl Jam song he did he he co-wrote the lyrics to a Pearl Jam song Eddie veter was instrumental and helping to bring this to a lot of people's attention and and getting you know getting the guys to the point where they could take an Alfred plea and uh Jason Baldwin I believe he lives in Austin Texas and he works uh I don't know if he's founded it or if he works with it but he works with a a group a nonprofit that helps people who were wrongly convicted uh to try and get them free yeah so the GU w are definitely doing a lot Damen Eckles doesn't say if he's a witch or a Hindu or Christian now he says they're all the same all religions are the same he does practice magic he's a spiritual person very much so and he does have several books out including a new one called High magic a guide to the spiritual practices that saved my life on death row there's a four word by Eddie veter and that came out in 2018 I believe that was his most recent book came out in 2018 but it just a travesty of the fact that from the very beginning in the the crime scene footage that you can see when they found the bodies of these boys which fair warning if you watch these documentaries they do show actual footage of these boys as they pull them out of the creek and on the side of the creek and they show quite graphic autopsy photos and photos of these kids so I couldn't watch a lot of it I'm not good at that so just to let you fair warning there is a lot of that you will get graphic graphic views of these children as they're found um but amount of people in and out of that Creek they didn't retain any of that water and there were a lot of theories about the fact that there wasn't a lot of blood found at the scene maybe they had been carded somewhere else and then brought back there they thought a lot of the wounds were bite marks or stab wounds when it turns out um upon further investigation that those were actual animal predation postmortem including the extreme damage to the one boy's genitals and the other boy's face all of that had actually been done after they were dead and in the water um the turtle activity there is what accounted for the major bite marks the scratches basically the boys were killed by blows to the head and drowning and the rest of the wounds were all done by turtles in Turtles realized Turtles were that freaking violent they really are they really are and in that area other investigators did lower uh raw chickens carcasses into the water and within literal minutes of the carcasses hitting the water the turtles came out from everywhere and started clawing and biting at the carcasses like zombie turtles no just turtle turtles experts have reviewed these photos since and do very strongly feel that most of those marks were caused after the boys had died and that their actual cause of death was being beaten about the head and and in two other cases drowning and still no to this day no conviction no conviction and they won't allow a lot of this evidence first they said it was lost uh just a few years ago they did find this evidence and now they wanted to try and do more DNA more current DNA testing on it and they're just being blocked at every turn I think the state is afraid of multi-million dollar lawsuits you know what's sad they're going to wait until all of the people who made all of the mistakes are dead and then they'll admit to it and then they'll clear it up probably there's a couple things that people who say that the west west mempis 3 are guilty are going to bring up and those things are some fibers that were found that supposed supposedly matched a rug and a bathrobe in that were found on the the deceased boys that supposedly matched the West Memphis 3 those fibers were found to be so common they could be in anybody's house and matched fibers from the deceased boys houses as well as from anybody in town but it sounds like these three guys didn't even know each other two of them did Damen Eckles and Jason Balwin were best friends Jesse and Miss Kelly was just someone they were acquainted with like what you just going to go pick up a stranger to commit a murder like who does that right right and again every a lot of the things that Jesse Miss Kelly said happened in his confession because they will say that he confessed multiple times and he did and you can find his multiple confessions online none of them match he says in these confessions that they tied the boys up with brown rope it was shoelaces he said that the boys were sexually assaulted none of them were sexually assaulted uh he said that they were they're strangled with a stick none of them were strangled so many things that he said in his multiple confessions were just found to not be true and okay he confessed multiple times they don't match they're not right they're consistent with someone who needs help in even in one of the confessions he's not trying to confess he says he wants psychological help and he's trying to get help and that's why he's saying these things so the confession just doesn't add up I am glad to see that they were able to have some get some sort of life back because these three guys were screwed in 18 years is a long time to get stolen from you and the US government stole that 18 years from these kids there are some people that think they're guilty and some of the things they'll bring up are Jesse Miss Kelly's confessions and those are just they're too inconsistent they're too it it's just been proven how easy it is to lead someone to false memories and false confession and I just can't I don't care that he's done it multiple times it's consistent with someone who was seriously messed with they convinced him that he robbed a bank correct the other thing they'll bring up again are the fibers and and again those fibers just aren't consistent enough to be proof of anything um they also talk about blue wax they'll talk about blue wax a waxy blue substance that was found on the clothing of one of the boys and they'll say the book Damen had had a blue waxy substance on it and damen's girlfriend at the time had a blue candle I'm sorry that's not admissible enough no none of it was ever proven to be from the same candle that's that's a stretch Big Stretch wow wow and there's some crazy theories out there too one of the most prevalent I saw was that proof positive that the West Memphis 3 are guilty is that in Jessie's confession he mentions that they urinate in the mouths of the boys and that two of the boys were found with urine in their mouths and in their stomachs it's not true there was no urine I I've read the autopsy reports there was no urine found in any of the boys mouths or St they underwater how are they finding urine in their mouth when they're found underwater so if they had if they had ingested urine it would be in their throat or in their stomach and they didn't find it anywhere in there they did find um Creek water in their lungs and in their esophagus and in some cases that was described as brownish yellow so maybe that's why they're thinking it was urine but no evidence of urine a Creek Water folks yeah and I have seen uh that as one of the big pieces of evidence that people will cite saying why they think the West Memphis 3 are guilty is this urine Theory and that's just not true this is what a Witch Hunt that's horrible literally it was literally a Witch Hunt literally it was a Baptist town that went crazy with satanic Panic like I said the second scariest thing that happened here obviously the unsolved murders of these boys is horrible and the but the roading and the literal Witch Hunt of Damen Eckles Jesse M Kelly and Jason Baldwin is ridiculous and they need Justice the three little boys sometimes I I've heard them referred to as the Forgotten West Memphis 3 Chris spers Michael Moore and Steven Branch those poor boys they deserved so much better than this [ __ ] horrible police case I mean oh my goodness just and so doesn't their parents absolutely absolutely they deserve so much better it's so scary so that's my story today gez Louise that's that's a take a big hit after that one story I feel very bad for the families of the three boys um that all of them all six boy the families of all six boys but I am grateful that the other three boys were able albe it way too late to get some semblance of life back I agree I agree luckily the one the one boy uh was able to get out of this before he was executed but the reality is is he could have been executed innocently and no one would have given a [ __ ] as far as the government the government the state of Arkansas wouldn't have given a [ __ ] if they accidentally executed this guy they're been like our bad sorry they would have happily executed him they wanted to execute him yeah so luckily he was able to to PR and make it to the Other Side Jason Baldwin um who was Damen eckl's best friend at the time this happened and I believe they are still friends when you watch the video of these men giving the Alfred plea Damen recognizes that Jason didn't want to do it because they had to say they were guilty and Jason didn't want to do that however Jason did it knowing that the state was trying to kill his friend they were literally going to kill Daman and the only way to get him off death row was to say you did it was to do this Alfred plea and say I'm innocent but I'm going to say I'm guilty so that you can charge me with time served and let us all go and save my friend and and they hug you know Damien recognizes the sacrifice that Jason made by doing that and it it's the fact that they can still be positive and make a difference and move forward after 18 years of their life was stolen and that's what happens when you're witches [ __ ] you learn how to rise that's why it scared me I was a new witch at the time and I'm out and proud and I'm like yeah I'm going to let my witch flag fly but it legitimately has danger for some people and it still does today yeah but you know what it was that it was that that background and that faith that that got them through in the same respect exactly exactly like the book he wrote that you know his his spiritual Adventure essentially well on death row it became a big thing and and as a as a young witch to me it was vitally important to see how this turned out and and now decades later you know to see it it come to them with the Alfred plea in 2011 and and now still trying to make their way and even like I said in February they're still trying to clear their names and find the real killer I don't know I don't know if you're going to top this uh West Coast story today sh is an ongoing tragedy I I almost give up without starting but I do have I do have a good one it is a good one I don't know if it's gonna Trump your your West Memphis 3 but it is a good one I I want to talk a little bit real quick and this isn't as long Connecticut Hill Cemetery which is a part of uh the Alpine portal I I think I I do remember the cemetery but what's an Pine portal now I don't think in at the time this was a while ago so you may not remember all of the details but about what year is it 2022 six seven like eight years ago I made you go here we've been here maybe I do remember isn't that the cemetery where like the phone stopped working I I don't remember it being called a portal though I might have better described it some [ __ ] went down and you might not remember the other parts of it but remember that wit Cemetery we went to yes I do everything stopped working and we were panicked yes I do remember that all all electronic things suddenly stopped working batteries died things started acting wonky Alpine portal okay so uh for for our listeners out there this is um the Alpine uh Alpine portal is located on Connecticut Hill in Alpine New York which is give or take roughly round about kind of near the Corning almyra area imagine one Saturday afternoon shell calls you and says oh my God I found this place and we have to go tonight bring your weed always a good time I highly recommend if you're lucky enough to have that happen do it do it go do it right I am like that friend I always have these weird Adventures so I had found this I I think I had come across it online I think you can find it on a on a website called Road Trippers supposedly now this is about an hour or so away from from my hometown but supposedly this Alpine portal they deem it is you can meet Aliens Bigfoot and your dead grandmother in one spot wow that sounds like a party right there it does it does so there's a couple things going on in this location now when when you and I went with a few friends we kind of we kind hen specifically on a very wooded out of most kind of flow of people area this this Cemetery that supposedly had a witch buried in it which we'll get to that in a minute so off we go to the cemetery we didn't really focus on the alien Bigfoot piece of it we were kind of more into the cemetery piece yeah we were looking for The Witch's Grave we were more looking for absolutely you know if Bigfoot happened to hop along we were down but we weren't particularly looking for him at that time right we were more looking for the for the the witch Cemetery we were like hey you know if if any uh green men come along in a spaceship we're down right if you get abducted take me along we'll take a ride with you around the Sun this is um in in the the hills of lower New York State it's on uh what's called state gamelands in this place these lands have been whispered about by locals for decades and decades and decades poor edly it's the home to a migratory pod of Sasquatch oh which for any of our Bigfoot listeners out there because I know we have some um if you know anything about this hit us up because I want more details about the old Bigfoot in New York state thing but what's a group of Sasquatch like is it a pod you know like it's a murder of crows or whatever like I don't know they just call it a migratory pod of SAS pod okay so like a herd sasquan a PO I guess I don't know okay but Connecticut Hill has also been the home uh of UFO sightings wandering ghosts and other strange phenomena that have lent Credence to the land's nickname the Alpine portal this actually also used to be a Native American settlement on this hill there's some different reasons why people think that it was abandoned but some people say that that that the Native Americans left Connecticut Hill because they were driven out of the area by George Washington's troops in the 1700s possible and then they say that more recently people abandoned it because the climate made for terrible farming and there are people to this day that say that they did have family uh that had lived in that area and on that Hill uh more recently even than that but now present day it is a part of the game lands uh the state Wildlife Management Area so it's it's basically like New York State wooded area even a not not just the local people even paranormal investigators have been who have been there say the wildlife on Connecticut Hill is a little wilder than usual really okay like how so well they believe like like to go to Circle to the Bigfoot thing again um they believe that this migratory pot of Sasquatch happened to stop in this area for shelter during the winter months before moving further south for the winter think of it as like a rest stop on their highway to warmer places I don't know so they're snowbirding to Florida and they happen to stop here apparently okay I didn't know Sasquatch is snow birded in a pod I actually thought that they kind of were like singular Rome alone people but you know I guess you have to I am not a Bigfoot expert so I don't know I guess you have to hook up and get some booty to recreate at some point right right so yeah maybe it's a parent maybe they I don't know maybe they stay together with the kids maybe it's a family unit I just can't believe I just mentioned Sasquatch getting booty but you know hey Sasquatch sex that's not what this podcast is about it is not it is not we promise um but they've actually backed up their claims with what they call convincing photos videos plaster casts of footprints taken from the hill as well as uh purported Sasquatch vocalis now for people who are sitting there thinking you know Bigfoot is on the west coast my friend recorded Bigfoot talking that's what they say vocalizations not talking vocalization sounds Bigfoot sounds like yeah like is that like an actual bigfoot sex sound because Bigfoot getting booty right there I think so so okay but I remember when I was younger and like I said you know it's about an hour away from my hometown uh there were Bigfoot sightings so for all all you people who think that that Bigfoot hasn't taken a visit on the East Coast I assure you friends he has yeah there's a rest stop on his way to Florida right there right like this isn't out of the realm of possibility as far as I'm concerned so they you know I witness accounts of quick glimpses of the creature uh violent campsite attacks in the dead of night but my own personal add in I want to say this is Black Bear country people right I'm not saying no Sasquatch I'm just saying there're black bears that want your food they have seen uh reports of big blurry beasts the area is Rife with UFO sightings EMF field disturbances and and this is where our personal experience comes into play people have recorded EMF field disturbances high enough to shut down vehicles and make things such as phones cameras lighting equipment unusable all of which you and I had experienced yes we did did flashlights phones radios cameras everything I remember that was the one time I panicked because I'm like I know my phone was at 100% And it's not turning on like it didn't dawn on me I'm like why is my phone not turning on it was 100% what's going on and I'm like oh [ __ ] and then we were all like why aren't our phones turning on why are the batteries dead in my camera yeah and then we got scared because the car wouldn't start and we smoked a lot of weed and I remember like we the pipe went around or three times around our circle of friends and then our friend that was driving his van started it up and we were like let's get the hell out we are so gone I was so happy when that van finally started up I was so sure that battery was never going to start you know I thought we were I that was after Blair Witch had come out like years after but it you know I had the Blair Witch in my mind and I'm like we're gonna die in these [ __ ] woods today man I think I always had the Blair Witch in my mind when I went in the woods back in that time you know I just one thing that stands out to me to kind of tie this to our 420 episode is I remember when nothing was working and we were all kind of panicking I I specifically remember turning to your husband and saying does at least your lighter work and he flicked his lighter and that's when we're like well at least we can smoke you know we can't leave we can't get our phones to work but we can get high that was our priority we're like well if we can get high we might as well die here it's one of the things we love about my husband no matter what's going on you can always count on him to have a working lighter and a packed Bowl always for real yep and and you know I the aliens could come at that point because we had a packed Bowl yeah right we we were fine we're like all right we're smoking we're okay and then of course the car started and we were good to go right but there is actually you can find online a documentary where they have captured actual evidence of Sasquatch so that is definitely an interesting thing if you want to check that out we went up there you know like I said with the intention of going to the cemetery and I didn't have any UFO experiences I wish I did really I'm not lying I really wish that we would have seen the mother I wanted to see something I would have loved to see a UFO a Bigfoot anything we'll have to go back but you know I I have pictures because if you recall we kind of went there we got there right before dusk so when we were initially there it was still light out and while we were kind of traversing this abandoned Cemetery in the woods it was getting progressively darker until it was dark pitch black I actually still have pictures of when the phone still worked and it was Daylight time because um things didn't start dying on us until it was like that darkish time that's fantastic I remember my pictures of that time a lot of them didn't come out I had a couple pictures like said when it was starting to get Dusk and everything was still working and then any pictures I took after that up until my camera and my phone died they're gone so I'm glad you have some pictures I had been looking back I mean I I probably was only able to salvage like maybe six pictures looking back at some of those if you kind of look at the scenery around it you see some of those thin little branches bend over like how the Sasquatch trackers say that they bend over the branches like I see some I see some of that in the backgrounds of these pictures another thing I distinctly remember that freaked me the hell out we got to a point where the path kind of went into a circle around a circular formation of of tombstones I remember that the couple that we came with they got lost on that Circle I don't know if were super high we couldn't somehow they got lost and then we all got lost it's like wait a minute there was so many paths in this circle how are we just on a circle with no paths out now it was so weird and that was the thing it was almost like there was a time Bend at this Cemetery that's a good way to put it like a Time Bend because you and I and the people we were with we are naturally woodsy people we are not the type of people who are going to walk 50 yards into the woods and not be able to get out because essentially looking back we were really only about 50 yards off the road but yet we couldn't find the road and we had been following very clearly marked paths on the ground you could see the dirt paths where countless people had walked before you and somehow in trying to find the people that were with us we got on to this circular path that had multiple paths leading to it and then all of a sudden it's like it's just a circular path and we kept running into each other but not finding the way out it was very strange it definitely like one of those weird time Bend locations yeah attributed it to the really excellent weed we were smoking but it was definitely a strange vortexy Woods for sure and I I also remember you know they're they're being like not voices but like all I can explain it is dead people talking I don't know better description there were multiple people that thought they heard people whispering or talking to them yeah there was a lot of that going on I remember one of our friends the the one that actually drove us out there I remember him saying he kept hearing a woman crying and there was no no one around wasn't he was trying to follow that sound when he and his girlfriend got lost on that path and then we were trying to find them so weird but you know in retrospect I think that we were at one of those locations that is not right for sure I mean with all the electronic equipment that just failed and acted wonky it was very obvious something was not right right down to the car not starting when we got there or when we got back to it originally and if you want to experience one of those weird vortexy places by all means go there cuz it is it's strange like I had read some um some people had posted some personal experiences online that people have been there um there's been paranormal investigators that have gone there and such tell me what's happened someone someone described it as a sanctuary of strange activity that's a good description not right up our alley yeah and I would say that describes our experiences there for sure yeah yeah I mean like I said I would been super stoked if like the Mother Ship came down and asked us if we wanted to take a ride but you know no such Alien Encounter but there's definitely something not right at that location there was definitely enough weirdness that even I even I remember distinctly that it was definitely odd there there was enough crazy stuff that I don't I can't explain and it was strange the whole area and you know kind of back to the the time Bend thing it felt like we were there for like a half hour when in reality we were there for like hours I was just going to mention that we were like how the hell have we been here this long it got dark and we all remarked on how quickly it had gotten dark and then once we found our friends and we're like you know what let's get out of here and get back to the car I think the longest time someone said you know it's been like 40 it's only been 45 minutes and and we get to the car and it had been like 3 hours or something and none of us felt like it had been anywhere close to an hour yeah no there's there's definitely some funk on Con icut Hill and it's there's definitely some odd time Bend there which then makes me a little more believable to the migratory pod and and you know and the mothercraft coming there has actually been a lot of UFO activity in that part of New York State and it's not just In Articles and in research you'll find about Connecticut Hill alone if you just do some some general UFO research um you'll actually find stuff that points back to the area of Connecticut Hill so not as crazy as people think you and I just happen to not experience any extraterrestrial activity when we were there I would say the things that we did experience were pretty wild so people actually see lights and craft around that area they do they see lights they see crafts um there was actually a a burd mark from what a a resident claimed to be a ship they were able to confirm that burn mark there was residue um in the field that they basically would not admit to what that residue was oh damn so there there there has been not just sightings like possible Landings there's been enough documented in that area that you can see where the coverups begin wow that's that's surprising like you hear a lot about people seeing lights in the sky and unexplained sightings there but you don't too often hear like an actual Landing site where there's burn marks and unexplained chemicals in the field that's wild well that is you know you also got to remember though that part of New York State super super flat and farmy right it's very rural yeah so you know there is a lot of space and not as many people you know if you're an alien looking for a parking spot right the bright lights of New York City are going to attract you and then you're like hey there's a big dark spot where I can go park it's perfect right right right but I don't I don't know you know I haven't been able to find anything that kind of talks back to what the cause of this Alpine portal could be I also found you know there's not a lot of lay lines in Upstate New York but there are some and there is one I think it was like 45 miles from Conneticut Hill I don't know if that's close enough to have like L lines I don't either so I don't know if that's close enough to it to have that have any sort of metaphysical effect but some's ay up there and I think we should go back again sometime but this time I think we should be looking to be like abducted to another world right we should go specifically looking for some Cryptids and uh see if we can find a Bigfoot in some aliens and not just a we know the ghosts are there so check ghosts now we need time weird time thing check now we need to check mark off Bigfoot and the the aliens I agree I agree well I I it is a beautiful place in the daytime but be prepared to a have to find your bearings and be be a little spooked if you go up to Connecticut Hill yeah make sure bring some bring some analog equipment too you know bring a regular wristatch and not an electronic one let us know if your electronics also crap out on you when you get there and and if you have any time anomalies because we certainly did but on the bright side again even everything stopped working including our vehicle but the one thing that kept us through and never died on us that big lighter lighter yeah my lovely husband saves the day yet again the Superman of the weed world we were I I mean I was panicking I don't know how you were feeling at that moment but I'm like the [ __ ] car is not St starting and this is not normal where's your lighter does it work we need to be more High we're not high enough for this [ __ ] yeah and we had a lot of those moments the one thing that I was sad about is is we did actually find that witch grave and and the tombstone said something to effect that that person was a witch so we did find the witch grave that we were looking for two things one I was sad that it was broken half and but it was meor moralized by passor by beautifully but the minute we got to that witch grave is where my pictures stopped coming up I didn't get pictures of the Grave they never turned out and every picture after that did not turn out so it's almost like as far as my photographs go I was good to go up until we found the witch grave and then everything was [ __ ] after that yeah that's about where mine crapped out too it was the pathway leading up there is where the picture started going wonky and it was before I got there that everything died I do remember seeing the gravestone and all the the incense and the coins and the and the the stones crystals the flowers people had left there was was great I loved seeing that and you could feel the energy shift there a little bit but that's also where [ __ ] got real too that's also where [ __ ] got real and and it seemed like that was the one everything was weird there but that was the one place where it felt um it felt Serene and charged I guess guess it was it was very weird and very energetic But ultimately it wasn't spooky because that's what we were going for we were going for that right there all the other stuff freaked us the hell up exactly exactly yeah that I use the description charged and you said energized and I think we all kind of felt that that that place for whatever reason whether it was the intent of all the people going there and all the things they put there whether it was the Wich herself um I I don't know whether it was the lay line that's 45 mil away or something else there that Drew all these different things but you could definitely feel it when you were at that point that was like the focal point I don't know but between the Witch and Bigfoot someone was [ __ ] with us when we were on that circular path I don't know who was making the Sounds in the woods whether that was a Sasquatch pod or you know people [ __ ] with us but there was definitely sounds of people in the woods and again you and I are not unfamiliar with the sounds that the woods in in on the East Coast can make we know the different night sounds and birds and creatures and then these weren't those no these weren't our normal woodsy noises definitely creepy these were the kind of noises that make you look over your shoulder and look behind you and kind of scope your surroundings kind of noises one of those uh unusual places you know everybody says it's beautiful everybody says it's it's it's a very serene place but it is also um one person described it is Myster Myster mysteriously intoxicating I don't know our intoxication was coming from all the weed we were smoking so I can't differentiate that's definitely helped but I think I think that the one person that described it is a sanctuary of strange activity I could totally back that that billing of this place agreed many people have you know we had talked about our our our friend hearing someone crying there are other reports of people hearing a sobbing woman um among the gravestones and people say that they when when they would walk towards where they seemed uh to think it was coming from all of a sudden it would sound like it was coming from behind them again no matter how many times they tried to approach the sound of a crying woman it always kept sounding like it was behind them other people were not the only ones other people um have reported that their cars would not start up that their instrument panels were going haywire so again that's something other people besides us have experienced there have been some um Bigfoot Sasquatch quote unquote Hunters that have reported that they have been able to communicate with the uh well-known knocking signaling that Sasquatch use and not only have they been able to get the Sasquatches to communicate back but they've been actually able to have them go on for over an hour of back and forth knocking wow so they're not only vocalizations here but also the the knocking communication that they're known to do yeah wow and you know I you're also going to find and I did find some of this in my research too you're going to find people who are like oh I'm from the area this is a bunch of [ __ ] none of this stuff ever happened is this a bunch of poppy [ __ ] y'all are crazy sure everyone always there's lots of that everywhere there lots of that everywhere and all I can tell you is I've been there I've done that and I was a little spooked I was a little spooked I'm not gonna lie you had me when the car wouldn't start you had me when all of us were having trouble with our our Electronics every single one of us our Electronics stopped working in one way or another and that's when I that was weird that doesn't usually happen and know and you know we were kind of with a group of people that are pretty techn Ally knowledgeable I mean yeah we might as well had the genius crew with us I mean we were struggling and it it was it was the real deal um loved it I'd totally go back again but Connecticut Hill and Alpine New York Real Deal folks yeah go if you want to experience some anomalies and maybe see some aliens or Bigfoot how fun is that your story is is definitely oh that scary for so many different reasons I mean the but ours was a fun badass road trip that I was just like hey I got this idea guys it was a spectacular good time that's for sure and thankfully you you guys always just are like all right where's she taking us now your ideas your road trips are always fun I would never miss one anytime you're like I have an idea I am there you know that girl I'm right there right there I think I think sometime we should we
