Deck is about mythology and Tiny that world mythology and obscure mythologies and tying those to the cards and so it's going to have a very comprehensive book and so that's the process time  I love that now I do love your books in each of your Decks that we have the cosmic seed and now and they Wiser's medicine tarot your books are lovely they have full color pictures of each of the cards also in your previous deck you included a Tarot spread that you created in each of these books when we spoke to you before we had talked about the spiritual growth tarot spread talking you said that you added two cards to the bottom of that like the route and that really added a lot of depth to the tarot spread and our listeners loved it we sent that out so people could see that can you talk to us a little bit about coming up with tarot spreads and how you like to use them you do for yourself so that is my go-to spread if I'm reading for anybody and I'm planning on giving a semi I like the reading I will use that one because I feel like it goes in and I do create spreads kind of just as needed depending on what someone is kind of looking for  wanting to give them the best the best reading that I can the best information that I can I will kind of create a reading for them but generally I stay with that one I also have a workbook out I don't have it in the world right now I'm repainting it for my Kickstarter people but it's a workbook that is just spreads and has about 13 spreads in it and you can fill in all the blanks and it's really a fun little cool tool I will be looking forward to that one for sure I'll send them to you I like how you mentioned that you kind of create them as you work with someone and I I like that to intuitive tarot spreads you and kind of have positions that means something to you like in your case the spiritual growth spread and then you expand on that as you work with some of the cards come out they start the kind of weave a story together to find that kind of works for you that way yes  shut off the car I need spreads I like the structure that kind of love how that story goes I know how would you tell someone to trust themselves or or two to allow that story to flow cuz I find that some people when they put the cards down whether intuitively or whether they're following a map with a spread sometimes they they falter on weaving the story or I'm putting that together do you have any advice to help someone kind of let go in to find that Rhythm to help them find that story in the car I feel like my specialty really is the artistic side of Taro I'm very logic minded and so it was really important for me to to learn all of the meanings to be able to feel like I'm on effective tarot card reader because the intuitive aspect of it is a little choppy for me so  nothing that I created with a flash card deck to learn all the meanings of the cars just all the keywords for the basic deck so things like that are things as it's something that I I kind of need to have a basic understanding but it's so beautiful to watch people who could just look at the images and Gloom a meaning and interpretation a kind of weave everything together for me I have to kind of have a basic understanding of what the the actual meaning is our and then if I can look at everything together I can start to pull the threads and I can start to go outside of those meetings and into it but I do have to have that find foundational kind of understanding and that's just the way I I work I love having the foundation of the spread and the meanings of the positions tampering with the cards but then being able to build on that use that as your solid foundation and then kind of build up from it like a cake I can check that way I also feel that  depending on who you are different artwork is going to speak to you differently and as a person who owns a gazillion tarot decks I've seen all kinds of tarot art and some even after doing readings for 30 years I'm just like I know this isn't working for me and then other cards like your Cosmic seed deck I feel like that is like that's speaking to my soul and you know the picture is on the cards almost jumped out at me where is I can't say that about a lot of deck so I think some of that also comes down to connecting with your card if you are very much into say all things Celtic and Celtic art work and stuff you know maybe a Native American Deck isn't going to speak to you so I think some of it is and that's how I started my collection of tarot decks 30 years ago was I was looking for the right artwork to speak to me  drawn into the the visual experience of the deck and it doesn't necessarily matter what the book says not love the the writing style of the artists of the deck but if I love the visual spend it's a good fit with Oracle on the other hand I need both the visual and the writing to kind of being fantastic I'm glad you mentioned Oracle decks and Tarot but I have a confession when I first open this deck I fell in love with the art and I told she'll I didn't like it as a terror attack I changed my mind cuz I'm looking at it Instinct was shocked this isn't the page of Swords like what's going on here and it took me aback I hold on these are so gorgeous I'm going to work with this from  because I can't not the pictures absolutely villania drew me in so much I love them so I gave it a second chance and now I love it but I was like this is an oracle Zach this is like an oracle Tarot deck and then I read that you said that right in the guidebook, I get it now and it was really the young it was the devil card that got me the devil card in this card okay so this deck is entirely animals and plants they're all the cars are beautifully themed if you felt like the moon patterns some have herb some have flowers from have animals and have both but the devil card is Poppy's how perfect is that amazingly perfect for the devil card I had to give it a second chance and give it a deeper look and looking at it like an oracle deck sorry to go to wrap up this long story here because I know the meanings of the car  and you do put keywords on the bottom a lot like a a lot like and an Oracle deck wood so that can kind of help you if you're not super familiar and you usually rely on the pictures because these pictures are different but that gives it a deeper meaning to me and it allows me to go different places than a traditional Tarot deck would much like an oracle deck does as soon as I let go of my need for it to be like a traditional rider-waite-smith Zack and let it be a little more orqali I had so much fun and so much inside reading these cars so I'm glad I gave her the second chance of the feeling I really wanted to make it accessible to people who cuz I have a metaphysical shop I saw dexta people everyday and people always ask me the difference between Oracle tarot and often if they're brand new do they end up with the oracle  and it's because of the complexity of the tarot and so my thought was if I could make it kind of cross over then people could get the experience of what it of using the easier type of deck and still kind of subconsciously start to absorb this information and that's why I also wanted the keywords on there because you don't get that instant understanding just from you know whatever is happening on the card you still have access to that information and the medicine of course of each meaning of each card bring so much so much stuff to the card itself to the meaning of the card and it is like the Oracle side of it I guess I just don't make things in the normal way and that's good I think it's particularly where this is concerned and if you didn't know what the devil card was and you saw Poppy's that's an addiction but it's Beauty  yeah but it it's all so seductive it's that thing that can be bad for you but you still kind of wanted you know when two people can understand that with poppies maybe and it might make that that meaning call my little bit more for them than the traditional imagery might took it at a different angle because I'll be honest with you the Oracle thing went right over my head when I first got the deck and it actually took Leila to point it out to my right as a Tarot deck the deck without the book generally so I didn't really see the Oracle side of it until Layla pointed it out but you know what the Ten of Cups has you know what the fit with the strength card means enough over the years that you know you just tell me your card and I've already got a visual you know so when I see things like I'm going to have to talk about this card for a minute  when I equate that to a traditional traditional suit I know what this card means aside from the usual but the visual helps I saw this is a way to connect also with the animal spirit and in in a way to kind of get an in-depth a more in-depth understanding of the animals for me personally I don't know what's it been like eight nine months is business like a literally my whole life never saw an owl ever I move outside of Boston I got this damn I will follow me around outside so I looked at these is a way to get a more in-depth understanding of animal spirit you know some of these animals are also animals that I'm not exposed  what if I am trying to connect with my animal spirit or or a familiar such I look at these is a way to also do that to kind of connect with the different you know I want to feel zebra energy so negative fire I'm going to the concept of what I know about that card and kind of create in my mind I guess my thoughts on how is that going to connect to that particular animal or 10 of Earth what does that have to do with a kangaroo and how am I going to learn more about the spirit of a kangaroo through knowing that you've Associated it with that particular card you know what I'm saying I'm also looking at it as a way to kind of connect with 78 different plant and animal spirits to learn about the wisdom  the Earth and there's so much and there's so many different I mean indigenous cultures all over the world and when I say that I mean all people are indigenous to the Earth and those cultures the ancient cultures specially very much respected the the messages that they received from the presents and watching the animals in the ways that they behaved amongst each other and they derive meaning from that and you know Sophie ated with themselves and all these different ways and and took them as Omens and so it felt like a beautiful way to bring that into the world and I love how you did that with the medicine portion of each card you mention the medicine that that plant or animal can bring to you and you know a lot of us do a daily card Paul or three card poker or we'll ask questions when we need to internal it hopefully  level of the medicine that can bring you like the queen of wind is the B you know I love being and this medicine says that be careful not to get too over stimulated you know I can give you a warning or an idea of where to look into this has to be sure to redirect your mental energy and rest your mind when needed so it gives good advice good medicine good good idea that you can learn from these creatures can you tell us a little bit about animism in your life or how you might work with you around here where I am my family and we live in Aurora Colorado and we are blessed to be right block away from a creek and we're still in the city but there's a creek that goes through the city and they were smart enough to make it a park and to make it so that it had some nature kind of undisturbed nature around it  there's trails and it's just a little section but we get so much Wildlife we have beavers and deers of show up every once in awhile and muskrats and unexpected thing six frogs all the things that could be around here and where we are in Colorado so we're not getting Mountain Spirit Smith the Sara Lee but you might go there and see an egret randomly and if you haven't seen that in a while you might you know we'd come home and we pick up the book we have a really great book it called animal speaks it's an old book and it has a lot of these different beautiful animal messages totems or will go online if it's just happens to not be in that book or maybe you have a dream and you know what is it was random dream and do the baby turtle in it and don't you know want to know what is the what is the energy from this particular animal trying to say to me so  you know as I mentioned indigenous cultures I've been doing this forever it's an opportunity for us to tap into the Earth and to Mother Nature Into You Know What I Call great mother and hear the the wisdom from our spiritual selves and our higher self and just like we use the tarot it's such a beautiful way to incorporate what we're seeing in the world whether it's a b c or you know we have Hawks and blue jays and things around here and it's like oh what it was the blue jay energy about today so I really love that I love being able to touch touch nature in that way but I also think even if you use these individual you can take a card of say the hawk and meditate with that card and spend time with them and start to connect with the energy of the hawk through them that card absolutely and kind of a little bit like what both of you were saying one of the things that I use  these cards for was something more bees I'm seeing more possums running around so some of the animals that I noticed around me I look through the back I grabbed a few of those cars and pull them out and had just a meditative moment with those cars and just thought about what I've been seeing and just kind of find a reconnect with my land and with the energies around me and so that was a very beautiful just to read what those cards meant hold them with purpose and shows them and they still connected to meanings things I needed to learn and maybe some other animal cards that she wanted to work with and seeing how that correspond to tarot and bring that into her life magically that way I think it said you know any place where you may not get animals right here in New York City and the things you see are dogs and cats and this is the way to be able to pull a card every morning and connect  animal energy and connect with the Earth and then I need to bring bring it through this way to is because sometimes people have a hard time connecting with visuals of other people nice or depending on body shape or depending on gender identification culture yes and so it's another way to put a bypass all of those things and still be able to connect with with the tarot on Oracle and I loved how you mentioned you know people who live in the city or you know there could be a lot of reasons why you might feel disconnected from Mother Earth why you might feel disconnected from the and so working with a deck like this that really kind of pulls you outside of yourself and brings you to that natural world even you know even if it is just through the cards I can really help kind of bring that energy into your life I love that you know even if you're not a big huge City like New York or Boston you know I've never seen a rhino  it's not for my region but when I saw that the Rhino was the tower I was like oh yeah that makes a whole lot of sense but I almost feel that Tower energy when meditating thinking about that Rhino I see how that is absolutely a perfect fit or like the hummingbird I see how that is an absolute perfect fit for the star it just some of the ones I'm familiar with at least on a small level I'm like oh yeah now that I see that she pointed that out totally makes sense but then thinks I'm less familiar with I'll be honest with you I don't know but I know the night of water so then I'm like okay well let me try to connect to eat you know so even if it's noon you can connect with animals that are not local to your region even if you're not  in the big city bright and because you know the tarot when you see those animals you're automatically going to understand that there's something about that particular card that is part of the energy or the easier or something for the animal whether or not you read the book right right because like I said you know I just would rather get to know the cards and learn it that way and not make my self feel ancient have to get out my bifocals go get them you got to read it. Going through it a lot of them were like oh I said makes perfect sense or some of them I never thought of before where there any animals or any energies that came through here like I need to be this car do you notice anything that really spoke to you I think there was one of the fun ones that I thought was a unique when was the egg for them for the eighth of wind  normally it's a sword it's that single sword and it's sharp and it has this Vibe right where as the Ace of wind is is little eggs in a in a mess and a genin of the suit and its it just felt very different not as blunt as what were used to be one of the ones that I really love with the vulture I have been saving that image from before round two of the cosmic seed cuz I'm an image of collector because he know a lot of my work is digital Allah so I do have a few know you'll see every single card has hand-drawn little white tattoos little pretty doodle I love that on the magician which is a crow do you have the elemental symbols drawing down his back I thought that was what was one of my favorite so I left that my first one with the elk the elk was my first creation  what was the emperor Empress is a bear with her Cubs I love that yes I had fun with that one I like the silver back for the king of a Silverback ain't the king of the earth I don't know who it is things that made me think like the the bonsai tree for the hierophant that made me look at that card I normally have bad associations with that card that normally doesn't give me that it's not it's not tradition to me so much as the negative aspects of tradition find that aren't good you know the things that you follow blindly I know it has more meetings than that but that's as a bonsai tree you know that wisdom that taking your time and patience that learning and growing and in a beautiful way it just really made me see that differently was there something about choosing these that did  just got on well I'm just going to draw this or did you ever do any type of ritual or any type of medication or any type of work too kind of to come up with an answer or did they all just come pretty easily and intuitively it wasn't some of them came and they were and I just knew like this animal makes a makes sense because I have to do deep research on I like the familiarity of the lion being strong because he been in traditional cards even right away Smith you see that lion and strength and I was like super super obvious ones that was interesting for me to find with the hyena I was having a hard time with that when I was like okay I had done so many by that point and there wasn't tons of them feel like there's tons of animal options left and I was looking for something and I was like okay someday I need somebody whose skill full full that way  they do and isn't already one of these other amazing animals that I've already selected and so when the hang that came up I was like I kind of felt do I really want to do the hyena because he's he's also somebody who's going to come up and eat you if you can but it was so perfect and this one that I found this beautiful image that I found was perfect for the card and so sometimes it was surprising what ended up coming through and deciding to or the decisions that were made around certain cards another one with the flamingo it's one of my favorite cards in the deck it has it's one of the only ones that has multiple animals there may be a handful of them that has more than one animal but there was something about having these six flamingos for the six of wind  flying through the sky and I just I'm so moved by by that image that's beautiful it sounds like you connected with just as many animals is I did through the stack and connections with each of those individual Spirits at my house I cried you know we just talked about the animal aspect of it but was it more difficult for you to choose plant because you know we kind of have this notion of animals in animal behavior when you were looking at the hyena to B spoke to that particular card was it more difficult to find the plants that you used I mean Layla said before the poppy was obvious but I saw a yellow Lily plant Spirit as well do you feel ill somewhere or something obvious like the the Lotus kind of came through of course the Laurel for the six of  wander the six of fire those were things that kind of just for like yeah this is makes sense the Ros for the lovers right so some of them were simple like those things in and others I had to say okay it's been a while I've made a lot of animal that's quite a few insects in here but I haven't put you know as many plants as I'd like it so I'd have to kind of stop and think okay well we're going to plant go and because of all the beautiful metaphysical properties through all of the Pagan is materials that are out there I was absolutely able to find all those correlations that I needed I love the back of the deck when I opened it the stack it has Leila knows the name of it I know it it has a plant on the back of each card and when I opened this my first thought and you're going to laugh Layla my first thought was Layla hahaha  used to have two of these plants in her living room they're big and obnoxious  Lalo's house I'm going to remember that and they are beautiful and yes I do have I do have a couple but that's okay we won't talk about them trying to eat she'll when she comes over in this sack as well you also have a Tarot layout this one's a little simpler and this is the life overview spread and I like how it's almost in an in a spiral starts in the center and moves out in a little bit of a gyro is there anyway that you would like to work with tarot not just for insight do you like to use it as an active magical tool like to ask for something or manifestation or spell work or anything to do you like to work with Heroin that way in any way but you know what I haven't actually and that's interesting to think about generally I just use it for readings I used to read for other people in my  and I realized that I prefer not to have to do that it's a lot of energy to give I loved it and I and it was fun and I I still will like do an event like sometimes I'm going to be like hey we're doing an event we need someone who can come in for 4 hours and then I'll do something like that but I like to just read for myself or for someone close and take my time and go and read the book and think about what I'm what I'm thinking it might mean and go back and forth and really kind of just take my time with the reading and I generally just use the use it but use it with spreads but I have seen some really cool books for people are using it for all these different ways of working as a book about that I'd have seen that there's all these unusual magical ways to use Terrell and I don't know much about them but I think I'd be interested in  Lenny where I love how it is such a beautiful tool for yourself psychologically it's it's wonderful to get ideas about the future and to talk to you now opens conversation I think it's just such an amazing tool for anybody to have some thank you for creating this one as an animist myself I love the ties to the earth and the ties to the animals in the animal energy so it's fabulous.
