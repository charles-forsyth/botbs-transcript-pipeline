it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 33 of the stoned which is our with shell and Lila we are two besties on opposite coast of the USA who like to smoke copious amounts of Fab abous weed and try to see who can creep each other out as we tell truish stories of paranormal events ghoulish crimes and Things That Go Bump in the night on the west coast with the best weed and the spookiest stories I'm Leila yeah right you're so full of it I have the best stories I am generally higher I think and I am on the East Coast which is the best coast the ghosty Coast that's what I'm going to start calling the East Coast it's the ghosty Coast with shell the ghosty Coast oh I like that I'm shell on the ghosty Coast oh okay I I'll give you that one not the best weed but the ghosty Coast sure for sure the most expensive weed how about that oh yeah weed prices right now still man I'm still smoking my own [ __ ] you know it's really weird because here in Massachusetts we're like one of the top three states in the country right now for like extreme drought conditions mhm but my neighbor has these plants that are inching their way towards 8 to n feet tall and you know he's out there with his hose every day so they're getting perfectly hydrated nice just not naturally because of our drought conditions here but these suckers are like they're taller than like a first floor of a house outdoor weed can get get huge can you smell it when you go out sometimes it depends on which way the wind's blowing but he's been trimming and you just see these big huge buds like popping over our fence oh nice oh how lucky maybe he's a nice neighbor and he'll share he is a nice neighbor oh how good well harvest season is upon us the Second Harvest the fall equinox madin is coming up pretty soon so outdoor Growers are going to be chopping down those big old bud trees it is the season and boy let me tell you you know as as I'm sure folks are aware you're going to be headed this soon for a awesome Halloween visit you better be bringing some of your stuff I cannot wait for you to smoke on some of my weed I will bringing you a shakery board of weed a little shorish Bor of things for you to try all my favorite different little cultiv ours that I have grown and just for you sh I have a cutie little box for you now once you start harvesting let's for all of our Instagram followers out there Lea's going to be supplying us with some very beautiful photographs of and we'll be sharing them with you all so that you can all be just as jealous and sad as I am a don't be sad just wish that we lived closer so that you could come help me trim I hate trimming it's wor all day i' trim all day just buy me good curved scissors and I'd sit there and trim all day oh I know and I've got your I've got beautiful scissors out here with your name on them it says shell right on the handle and they're curved and they're gorgeous just waiting for you cuz I I mean once my garden gets rolling I harvest every four to 6 weeks and you know not a lot of plants at a time but enough that it gets boring I don't like it it's not my favorite I laugh because you know you talk about it it's the we're we're approaching the Second Harvest and people are going to be harvesting their weed every two months is harvest season for you this is outdoor harvest season we're talking about outdoor season so indoor you know we have that indoor Sun thing going on we manipulate our Seasons but you can't deny the outdoor the that Harvest Sun so August September people are usually harvesting their outdoor weed here's something I don't understand and you can explain this to me and the people so outdoor the sun it's yellow it's orange it's whatever color and when people grow indoors how come the lights are always purple I don't get it because purple is definitely not emulating sunlight you wouldn't think but a lot of people are using LED lights on indoors and that's especially where you'll get a lot of the that purple color and it comes from the different wavelengths if you look at the bottom of the board you'll often see blue red and white dodes uh little teeny tiny light bulbs LED light bulbs underneath there and they'll give off like the newer lights I don't know if you've seen mine but if you look at my garden you can see that light doesn't look pink right no it looks like a white light but if I turn on my my other lights that I have for my U my baby tent those do look pink and those have oh well I guess you can't see it but they have the teeny teeny tiny little light bulbs oh okay I can kind of see it yeah and when you turn them on they have uh three different colors like I said the red the blue and the white so basically combined it gives that pinkish purpley glow it does and that's you know it it emits the the right wavelengths for your for your plants and they'll come in different strengths and different intens depending on if you're getting a light that's meant for the growing stage or if you're a light that's meant for the flowering stage because people will use different lights for those times that's a funny thing about driving around at nighttime here it's like every four or five houses you'll see all of a sudden this purplish pink light glowing from someone's bedroom window like yeah I know what you're doing buddy we do try to stay a little on the down low so be we we did black out our garage windows but before we blacked the them out if you're driving down the street at night you would see that pinkish purplish glow shining out from our garage and anybody that grows knows yeah yeah I mean it it it's just funny the amount of people because you know there's this weird thing in Massachusetts I I don't think people like curtains here I think they're anti- curtain here so at night time you're just seeing all these like especially if it's like a twostory house you'll see like one of the Second Story Windows glowing and nice I love a legal state growing got to grow everybody should grow everybody should be growing their own it's relatively easy you just got to get the good light make sure you got the space and grow your own because it's fabulous it's easy and it's the best way to keep prices down and to keep you know Big Business from [ __ ] everything up if George Washington can do it you can do it too there you go there you go that's right Mr old wooden teeth Cherry chopping man himself pipe smoking George right right the freaking Constitution written on hemp paper so seriously so I wanted to tell you this like interesting thing I uh as you are aware we're doing some witchy stuff a little more here and I have recently you know I had talked about not too long ago doing these spell jars kind of dig spell jars I love mixing things I'm the mixer of the group I have gotten also into because you know once you get into one thing at snowballs and other things different colored salts oh interesting with different intentions so you know how you get your traditional sea salt and it's white like that crystally white looking sea salt yeah so I started making black salt and I've also made red salt I need to work on some ingredients because I am also going to do a blue and a green and potentially a yellow salt because I want quarter salt is kind of what I'm for but yeah making intentioned salt different colored salts now for for me salt I usually use as a as a boundary as a protection as a cleansing you know um when I was a kid I used to crawl out on crawl out the window onto the roof of our like extended porch and I would do rituals in the Moonlight there until I discovered that the salt circles I was drawing had baked into the tar of the roof and you could see them clear as day I was like oh [ __ ] I really hope nobody looks out that window with the roof but anyway so I use them a lot for cleansing banishing protecting that type of thing what would you use like a colored salt for well let me give you an example you could use a red salt for things like um we talked a couple episodes ago about doing love spells you could enhance things of that nature with a red salt if you know maybe you're trying to do some banishing maybe you want to use more of a black salt to kind of add in additional intention above and beyond your traditional white salt you might want a green salt to use with an enhance either a money ritual or a money spell you know if I was going to do a whole ritual totally focused on Prosperity I could make that ritual circle with green salt if I if my whole rituals intention is going to be something Prosperity driven Green Salt would be perfect if I'm using my Prosperity Green Salt you see what I'm saying the salt would help provide like a grounding protective element to that type of ritual right and then kind of enhance it with the things that you're adding to the Salt basic just an enhancer and I like doing pretty weird things that are a little different than the norm so I was thinking about it because you know I was finding some black salt um at some stores and I thought black salt and then I looked it up online and you know people will use various things to make black salt such as like you know how I do the loose incense they'll take the ashes from the loose incense and mix that with sea salt to make black salt oh interesting okay you're really just enhancing the intentions of the salt with different specific enhancements you know what I'm saying um whether you want that to be a banishing or a protecting or a attracting desire attracting Prosperity um attracting emotional Wellness whatever it may be I just thought what the hell colored salts let's do something fun that sounds really cool I love that I love taking something that you know you traditionally use in one way and kind of enhancing it and beautifying it and and using it in a slightly different way that's pretty cool I mean what's worst case scenario it's still salt-based and you're still using all your little magically stuff with all your little magically intentions mixing it with a salt how bad can it be yeah I like it perfect especially for this time of year who doesn't want a little salt especially with you know the veil of the worlds being a little bit thinner as our Harvest counts down to S you know yeah and you know in our last episode we were kind of laughing and joking about it but I mentioned that you see a lot of shadowy figures in in my neck of the woods just out of your peripheral vision dayto day regular Tuesday type [ __ ] with that Veil getting a little thinner when you live in an area that is extremely active such as I do you know a little extra oomph helps this time of year it doesn't hurt at all and it's not necessarily that my my house is haunted or anything of that nature it's just my City's haunted but you know maybe if I wanted do some say emotional Wellness type stuff which I sometimes do leading up to sa each year I might want to use like more of a blue salt doing some stuff but yeah now is the time to be extra cautious about that Veil dropping in in in ghosties crossing over because if they're ever crossing over they're crossing over right here right now I could see a protection amulet or a protection jar having a a pinch of each quarter colored salt some white and black salt to you know represent spirit and that would be an amazing protection amulet with all the you know the power of salt right there and the different intentions youve put into it I think that' be a great easy way to carry around an amulet right right and you know also it kind of just feeds into my whole I like mixing [ __ ] together to to make different intentioned potions I love that I'm a potion maker I love it I just love potion and I was even thinking you know kind of circling back to my spell jar thing I had even thought about maybe doing a couple intention spell jars with different layers of different colored salts not necessarily like a like a chakra type thing but more just a spell jar but with different salts combined for different intentions and have them layered up and multicolored oh I'd like that as a visual person I I love that component to spells and to Ritual it's how well and good to do it in your head and to just see it but how much more fun is it to actually physically do something and see it there and it just makes it that much easier to kind of get in the mood and to kind of get into that magical Groove and then once you're done creating that thing not only have you created it but then after you you actually physically have it there to look at right and you call back that energy every single time you look at it or use it or pass by in the room so much fun which feeds into the whole idea of the SP it it it's just it's all a part of the pieces of the puzzle so that's kind of what I've been but what I've been doing lately kind of gearing up because you know we are in the witchy season and and mavin's right around the corner Second Harvest the fall equinox it is blink of an eye it'll be swing so leaves have already started turning I think a lot of that here I I honestly think some of it is drought yeah even here in the Northeast you don't see leaves turn in in August for God's sakes not usually it's just so dry but typically right around the beginning of September I mean that's when we're going to even on a non non drought year you'll start to catch those those first hints of that fall smell or that fall wind you know even in California you get to start to feel when the weather breaks when just you get that little tiny hint of something right before right right around the beginning of September I think I start to sense fall coming yeah actually that was this weekend here in the Northeast you were like H it's nice out but it's a different kind of nice yeah exactly it's that different kind you kind of feel the vibe changing as the season gets ready to shift damn you pumpkin spice people I am ready to get my basic fall [ __ ] on absolutely I cannot wait I I'm not a Hu I love pumpkin pie don't get me wrong but I'm not a pumpkin spice and everything kind of person but I do love love it cannot wait I'm excited to be out there for the fall weather and to experience like real fall nothing like East Coast New England fall Oh you mean Southern California doesn't have bitching Falls no no we do not it's it's brown it's dead it's hot it's hot [ __ ] hot we're getting into flannel time at least at night time we I I've been doing this thing lately I've been traveling up to New Hampshire on the weekends and let me tell you I was in New Hampshire last night and it was like flannel you could still wear shorts but it was like shorts with a flannel shirt on weather and it was like yes you sound like an Upstate New York girl right there flannel with your shorts on don't don't forget that I have the flipflops oh perfect perfect you need some fuzzy Uggs flipflops if that doesn't scream Upstate New York I don't know what does perfect perfect so what are you smoking tonight over there shell I've actually just opened a thing a end game I've smoked this before I love this stuff it's it's a great manipulative high you can manipulate it to be down and and and gooey or you can manipulate it to be up and chatty and active I like this I like I I like this end game I think this one is coming in at either 29 or 30 it's exactly what I expect when I get this particular whatever you call it nice flavor that's perfect I love that endgame you you always seem to like that and again I am still smoking homegrown Gorilla Glue and some black Jerry call oh right sorry gigi4 there G4 gotta satisfy the sensors everyone still calls it Gorilla Glue as far as I know you know and the funny thing is is that everybody who smokes weed knows the difference between when you're talking about Gorilla Glue and when you're talking about Gorilla Glue are you are you trying to fix your tent or are you trying to get high we know the difference here Mr glue company exactly exactly and it kind of turned me off the company when they were mad about the homage to them in weed I mean come on get with the times be happy about it yeah I'd be happy if there was weed named after me if there was the Leila strain I'd be all over that [ __ ] I never saw Tutti Frutti gum go after the weed industry just saying it's true but who the [ __ ] knows that Tutti Frutti still makes gum oh is that is that just like telling my age we like to do that here we do like to do that but I have been like totally into these gelato strains lately so even though I'm I'm trying to save money and smoke my own lovely gg4 I had to get some gelato and this is a black cherry gelato everything lately is black something I have had black diamond black triangle black cherry gelato black kn is it like aie yeah all of these have been like a purple they've been a purple strain all the different um black nomenclature ones I've had maybe that's why they're calling everything black right now because it's all coming out purple it's all coming up purple everywhere I love it I do love a purple strain but yeah so it's yummy i' I've found that I am super partial to a gelato if I'm going to go someplace and spend any kind of money then I'm going to look for something really really crystally really tasty and I have not been let down yet if I said show me your gelato and they pull them all out I have they've all been delicious get me out your gelato man yeah no exception they're usually High thcs anywhere from 25 to 35% I don't remember which one this is but it was right up there and it tastes fantastic tastes better than my gg4 but uh what it does still have here the ridiculous packaging yeah yeah some places are better than others lately I've been going to this one grower that just does glass jars ah and I can take the glass jars back and oh okay they're recyclable I'm GNA I love that I am all over that the the person who's packaging them takes responsibility for their package and takes it back yes please everyone should do that take responsibility for your [ __ ] packaging if you're going to put it in a jar and shrink wrap it and then put it in a box and shrink wrap that and then put it in a [ __ ] plastic clam shell case you better take all of that back and have a plan reuse it or recycle it right it's got to be in the manufacturer's hands it can't just be in ours make it out of hemp make it out of hemp plastic that [ __ ] breaks down I mean come on spend an extra Penny here you guys are making money hand over [ __ ] fist and be good to the planet [ __ ] okay rant over damn I was gonna say that's a different podcast but you just laid it all out on the line I laid it right out there so after my nice little rant do you have a a story to tell me while I smoke on this delicious gelato I do have a story and you know with the Second Harvest approaching with September approaching which of course with September approaching means October's approaching I think this episode does this episode go out in September [ __ ] it should hold on with September here so now that it's September we have to Gear Up For What is known all AC cross land is the spookiest time of year the spooky season better known as shell and Lea's favorite time of year correct so I am focusing on some ghosties tonight you know I've done a lot in the Northeast I've done a lot in Massachusetts in in New York and we're gonna spend a lot of October in Salem so I thought I'd do something a little different and we're gonna go to Savannah Georgia there's this place in Savannah Georgia called the Moon Moon River Brewery which of course as soon as I saw Moon River I'm like oo let me see what that's all about so the Moon River Brewery hey I'm down for a Moon River Brewery I I I would drink that [ __ ] I'm not even a Beer Drinker and that's fun to me I know and you know and the thing about Savannah is Savannah Georgia is a very old very beautiful place Savannah's known for many things I wouldn't think they were known for beer mint ulips maybe beer no well I don't know if they're known for the beer but they're going to be known for this ghost okay now it's only been the Moon River Brewing Company for like 10 years oh okay never mind that yeah it's the building and what it was Prior and and everything that happened prior it just is present day it is called the Moon River Brewing Company interesting yeah they've had this Brewery for about 10 years and employees and patrons have reported seeing ghostly beings and Shadow People and even paranormal events at Moon River because apparently there's a river right there called Moon River get it okay makes sense makes total sense also just as a side note Ghost Hunters and Ghost Adventures have both been here and have found what they feel to be entities that live there what it was is the building like I said it's only been the brewery for like 10 years but the building itself was built in 1821 by a man named a laser early and that it was first quite the name I know right in 1821 it was first used as the city's Hotel so basically Savannah's prominent and Wealthy residents would regularly gather here to drink their fancy drinks and have their fancy parties and there was a lot of notable people who stayed at the City hotel they had long stay things like you know those long stay like so they would have like some of those early quote unquote celebrity type people military generals there were some folks that were uh delegations from from other places would come over and stay at this hotel I guess very see they had a wide clientele of of high higher type people Yes actually General Sherman stayed at this hotel but it had its last guest in 1864 right before the city was claimed during the uh American Civil War wow so then it also then became they ended up having it serve as a hospital and it served as a hospital not only during the Civil War but during some of Savannah's numerous yellow fever outbreaks oh no so hundreds of people mostly children died in some of the upper floors uh during these yellow fever outbreaks so it was a hospital during the war it was a hotel for super rich people to begin with you know you can't expect it to not be haunted right right there's so much there I mean just being a hospital there had to have been so Much Death well like I said between being a hospital for the Civil War and then being a hospital for yellow fever breakouts you know yeah they you know they would use some of it for storage space and it sat vacant for 20 years it actually got repurchased in 1995 and that's when it was it kind of became the the the Brewing Company but they have every floor literally every floor they have gotten some sort of activity there's ghosts in the basement the most famous of the ghosts at the Moon River Brewing Company is one that the staff called Toby he has always seen kind of moving silently through the Shadows a yeah it it's almost like he was a worker there at one point for a brief period of time it served as the City's post office and they think that maybe Toby might have been a postal worker who kind of just doesn't realize he's not done working how many incarnations has this building had well it it was built in 1821 so I mean a dozen wow just under a dozen there was a woman that was doing a ghost tour that thought she encountered Toby and actually started to have panic text and then they have to have an ambulance come get her no [ __ ] that's [ __ ] creepy she said the whole right side of her body became ice cold and that she was hearing voices that she couldn't control but she couldn't make out what they were saying oh damn yeah yeah so then the second floor there was a shooting the famous shooting of James Stark he was shot by the town physician and he was killed at the top of the staircase to the second floor so of course this guy is kind of Meandering around people say that they see his Apparition and that he has a hole in them basically like The Bullet Hole and they can see his whole Apparition but then this hole they can see through more clearly oh [ __ ] like that sounds so horrible yeah it does holy crap that sounds like a creepy ghost to see I don't want to see that I know on the upper floors they have all kinds of shadowy figur they have an Infamous lady in white oh yes love those of course you know and and why why is there always a lady in white I don't know there always seems to be though there are people that claim that they felt like they were being pushed down the stairs oh damn a construction crew was chased out of the building by quote unquote unforeseen forces the fourth floor I guess Harbors they claim a dark energy and it is known that during a lot of the yellow fever outbreaks that that part the top floor was where a lot of the older people were that died so between people who lost their battles with disease people who were murdered just a lot going on here yeah that's a lot holy crap and they all still seem to roam the Halls they all seem to still be there they are actually doing ghost tours at this place you can go um anytime and get a ghost tour which I think you know I think the mo the cool thing about this yes ghost tours are cool but you get the things like this building was built in 1821 how cool is that that's pretty fun but you know unfortunately there was a lot of violence here there was a lot of heartbreak here of course in the early 1800s when it was a hotel there were people that were lyed right out in the front damn yeah there were people who were beaten to death in the bar on the first floor of the hotel wow so it's seen a lot of violence not just death yeah I mean they have also had ghostly apparitions in what used to be the bars Bill billiard room they there's been glowing white apparitions people have seen just eyes in dark hallways all they see is eyes that would creep me out just like glowing eyes down the hallway yeah yeah but like I said now it's it's an active Brewery it's one of those micro brew you can go and and have some yummy yummy good stuff get some haunted beer have some haunted beer with some haunted freaking fried mozzarella sticks I I love me some good haunted fried mozzarella sticks I'm so there but then you can also uh do the the ghost tour that they have there you know there's a lot of things going on in in Savannah Georgia but I want to go to all the ghosty places and this seems like a good one I think like everywhere in Savannah Georgia is haunted so that sounds like a good place to start right right and you know I think one of the things that people forget is every city pretty much has some weird ghosty past yeah if you look it up you can find it you don't even have to scratch very hard for a lot of these stories they're right there the local Legends the yeah I thought well gez I want to stay away from the Northeast this week can I F can I find something Lord like every city has everybody has their own story and that's that's kind of the fun thing about doing this is we get to find out all these little stories from all around the country one of these days you and I are going to go on the best road trip to find all of the portals to hell in America and we're going to go to all the states and we'll see all the coolest places and then we'll see if we can find what is really the most haunted hotel what's really the most haunted cemetery who is the craziest Lady in White in all of the land yes and where's the actual gateway to Hell so we can find that out I know we can we just have to go to all these places that's all so I think that this Brewery would be a definite interesting place to check out it's got a lot of years of History a lot of years of History you know if you're think of it it's already 2011 years old a lot of shit's gone down in 2011 years I'd be down if I was down in Savannah Georgia I'd be like let's go I would too I want to go that sounds like a great place and my spot interestingly is a bar so I love that you did a brewery because I did a haunted bar that also didn't start out as a bar and has a history well how IR ronic the funny thing is and I don't know if people understand this but we don't really like chat about what our stories are going to be beforehand no I had told you last episode that I was doing a haunted Pub but I know you had already picked yours you just weren't going to tell so I'm pretty impressed so yes I am doing a haunted Pub it's called Kell's Irish Pub oh it was built in 1903 it's in Seattle Washington okay it's known for having Seattle's largest collection of single malt scotch and ghosts interesting scotch and ghosts scotch and ghosts it's got so many ghosts that Ghost Adventures has been there you know they've had quite a few people come in and do ghost hunting tours or or investigations thank you ghost hunting investigations there they have found that it is crawling with haunts and the reason why is kind of sick and twisted oh boy so Kell's Irish Pub before it became you know this wonderful restaurant serving fabulous single malt scotch food and booze it was uh built to be Mortuary oh not any Mortuary the country's first Mortuary oh so it was built by a gentleman named erer Butterworth and he's basically invented the modern funeral he started out as a um Furniture maker but a gentleman that he knew his wife and daughter died and they didn't have a coffin for him and so er Butterworth used his wagon that he had taken across the United States to get to Washington and he he used it to make two beautiful coffins for this man's wife and daughter and this kind of sparked the beginning where he realized he could make a lot more money doing coffins and taking in bodies than he could making Furniture wow right so he settled in Seattle Washington and he started in a couple different buildings one of them was a old Masonic temple and a couple different places and he started taking in bodies because not everybody at that time in the early 1900s there weren't very many people who would process dead bodies I guess so er Butterworth saw that there was a need for it particularly because in 1918 was the big flu outbreak and like you said there was yellow fever and all these different diseases that happened in Seattle bodies would just kind of pile up in the streets uhuh to the point where the city started offering a bounty of $50 per body wow if you brought in the bodies because there there was tuberculosis diptheria Spanish Flu like I said all these diseases are happening and people are just dying left and right and so to keep the streets clean the city offered a bounty $50 in that time was equivalent to roughly $1,000 a body today wow and so er Butterworth and his son started taking them in and they it doesn't say how they invented the words Mortuary and mortician but apparently they're the first ones to start using those words so they capitalized on this bound County and had enough money that they hired an architect to build a big huge building he hired John Graham who was an English architect and that guy's firm is the one that later built the Space Needle in Seattle Washington oh wow famous architect dude so he drew up this building that was done in the bow arts style which I don't know it just means kind of like ugly ornate flat building I don't know what board style but it had like three Lions on the front of it you know ornate looking for the time but he built it so that he could process bodies he had a crematorium on site and he also had on the upper floors he had places where Services could be held there were offices and this is one of the first like One-Stop shopping for for dead people you bring in the dead bodies you get your casket here you have someone who helps you plan your your funeral service and then they also handle burying the body or cremating it later and this was the first place anywhere in the United States to have everything that you needed for Funeral Services Under One Roof it was a grand fivestory Mortuary it had a chapel with room for over 200 MERS in it a columbarium which I have no idea what that is but I guess it's for storing funeral earns a place to show all the caskets that they made and the first elevator on the west coast that was used exclusively for transporting bodies up and down the this huge Ode to death and dying basically it was it was a place entirely from top to bottom for the deceased and for the people that they left behind and it was the first one of its kind anywhere wow so there was nothing else like it in the US it was Grand they had a big huge Grand Chapel on the second floor and and they were just kind of making money hand over fist at this uh Mortuary now at the same time that the butterworths are having this Mortuary there's also operating in town a woman who is a serial killer so it's it's in the town of olala which is right across the PUO sound PUO PUO sound puit sound puit Puget Sound it's right across from the Puget Sound from Seattle and in olala is a woman named Dr Linda Hazard and Dr Hazard was what she called a fasting specialist she had developed something called The Beautiful the beauty regime she decided that at the heart of all problems in your life was Cravings cravings for anything in particular cravings for food I guess and if you could if you could conquer these Cravings you could cure everything and be more beautiful and be healthy and so she would have people come to her and she'd talk to them about having their digestive systems rest some of this is like real science and some of it's complete and total bunk basically she was selling anorexia she would have people come and she would feed them like a half a cup of tomato broth a day what and they would waste away she said that this was like flushing their systems but she would make them do it for months and then they would die of course and she would send them off to the butterworths and they would split the money the butterworths I still can't get over that name by the way no right so a couple of the people that were victims of Dr Linda Hazard like you'd think with all these people dropping dead from her treatment that she would stop or that people would try to stop her but no nobody did weird she even some of her um treatments involved massages that were more like brutal beatings and they would have to do like vegetable broth enas where they' be laid in these tubs in these various like leather straps systems in case they fainted that's [ __ ] up and given these terrible enemas just the things that she put these people through it was terrible it was awful so this went on for quite a while until she [ __ ] with the wrong people I guess these two sisters named Claire and Dortha Claire and dorothia Williamson and they were orphans but their family was very well off and they decided that um because they had various health issues one of them had something called a dropped uterus and the other one had like glandular issues uhhuh they thought that this new age treatment with Dr Hazard would be the best thing for themselves so they went to get treated and like 50 days after they signed themselves in they both were dropped down to about 70 lbs each oh wow you know they were they were going through a whole an EXC thing you know their bones were poking out and they couldn't even sit down so unfortunately this went on for a little bit longer and they they both passed away and they went to the Butterworth's mortuary but the girls family decided to check up on them and came all the way over to America and discovered that the girls had only weighed 50 PBS at the time of their death oh wow yeah so they of course raised a fuss and there was an investigation done and Dr Hazard was found to not only have starved these girls but she had also been appointed executive of Claire's estate and Dorothy's Guardian for life and in her possession she had all of Claire's clothes a bunch of her household goods jewelry sapphires diamonds and valubles worth roughly $6,000 at the time oh wow so she was definitely not a nice person and she had somewhat of a kind of side gang going with the butterworths he and his sons had to know that something was shady with all the emaciated corpses that they were getting from Dr Hazard but they kept pocketing the money and they never raised any concerns so she did eventually get caught and tried but the butterworths continued on and after they all passed on the building was sold and it it did become a bar it was purchased in the 1990s and it was turned into Kell's Irish Restaurant and Pub oh it's weird to think of a Irish pub in Seattle but anyway well apparently they sell quite a bit of you know fabulous Irish food there everybody loves it o it's been owned by the Mesi the Mesi family since 2005 now you can go there and get your single malt scotch you can watch the ghost people very often see uh a couple ghosts that are considered regulars there's a little girl who has red hair that's in ringlets and she'll often be seen skipping through um the bar she likes to move glasses and move objects that are in the bar and they think that she's one of the children that had died from the 1918 flu ah and she's not dangerous at all but she is known to giggle people will hear her laughing and and uh trying to get people to play games with her and just like one of the ghosts that you mentioned sometimes people will think she's a real child right and will ask about her another one that's known this one's a mirror ghost he often pops up in the mirror the Guinness mirror in the back on the back wall and people will see this older man wearing like a derby hat in the mirror but he's nowhere in the room oh he often shows up particularly when there's Irish music they play live bands at this bar and so he'll show up very often when there's Irish music being played people say that maybe Charlie doesn't like other mirrors because other mirrors being put up on the walls will shatter they can't keep mirrors up in the place things will fall off the walls pictures fall off the walls glasses and things regularly move on the bar and they regularly hear someone asking why are you here or they'll see an older man in a suit walking through the hallway so some people have reported seeing the ghost of what appears to be a shooting victim kind of stumbling all bloody and wounded before dropping to the ground presumably dead and then disappearing right before their eyes and even the people that own it now say that they can still sometimes smell form Malahide oh from the mortuary yeah it's it's one of those very creepy places so there's a lot of bodies there from mining accidents and violence including some people who were killed by gun violence in the city and sometimes they'll see a shooting victim walk through that has like a what looks like it might be bullet wounds just like you said somebody who has a bullet wound that's so weird because you never hear of that happening and we both heard that and now that we both have something to do with beer that's so weird but being a mortuary they handled all sorts of different types of stuff yeah not just from Dr Hazard the serial killer but but also from from the flu from shooting victims I mean this was a tumultuous time and and they handled pretty much the burial of almost everybody in Seattle at that time right you know it was built to handle the hundreds of dead bodies piling up and it it just didn't stop there were so many so many things going on in the early 1900s yeah so in 2010 Ghost Adventures from the Travel Channel went there and did an investigation in their photos that they took one of them has a disfigured child sitting on the steps going up to the bar and they have e P's of tortured Whispers you know people saying help me and people just sounding like that they're in pain and the sound of footsteps oh there's been another sighting was by a woman named Karen mcalice who and it's her family that owns the pub currently and a few years ago she was in the restaurant and she's absolutely sure that she saw a man a strange looking man in a suit come stumbling out of the kitchen she she says quote he was a tall man with a suit jacket on he had very thin hands he walked to the end of the bar and just kind of faded another time apparently a shaman was asked to come to the bar and they ended up counting 19 ghosts according to Mercedes joerger who's one of the people who leads ghost tours in the area a lot of the ghosts that people see appear to be emaciated and gaunt and it's speculated that these are The Souls of people that were killed by Dr hazard's beautiful treatment now the bar is so haunted that they keep holy water behind the bar along with the alcohol I don't know if that's exciting or frightening all the people that work there say that they they regularly feel cold spots you know they'll see people that shouldn't be there there it's one of the very most haunted bars in the country so there you have it yet another haunted bar I just think it's so cool that we both ended up with similar haunted bars and it seems like these old old buildings just kind of go through so many incarnations of different things that they just keep kind of picking up all these different energies and Vibes you know yeah I know it crazy I am eating Crunch and Munch I'm sorry but you know when you're high Crunch and Munch is good I wish I had some Crunch and Munch I would totally eat Crunch and Munch that's delicious ious I feel like that's such like an 80s snack and I love it oh so good who doesn't love caramel and popcorn I mean it's fantastic so mortuaries and breweries a hell craziness too many ghosts to count but how fun would it be to go someplace and have you know have your little your little fried mushrooms and and some good single malt scotch and just sit back and watch the ghosty stuff fly I know I don't know about the mirror ghost though those creep me out I do not like ghosts and mirrors that's just weird too alternate dimension for me you know I guess it just reminds me of the horror movies when we were younger where like something was always coming to screw your ass out of that mirror that's true that's true if you see an entity in a mirror I mean that's just that's when you kind of leave that's the time when you get out really yeah what's the common wisdom should you break the mirror or not break the mirror if you see something creepy in it all right it based on my spiritual beliefs I find it to be bad luck so I cannot do that no it is against my nature no yeah I'm I'm in the don't break the mirror Camp I feel like if you break it you're releasing something so I'm in the spray paint it with black spray paint you know do something maybe bury it somewhere don't break it breaking it you are asking for something that you're just you might as well just [ __ ] around and find out with a Ouija board if you're going to go there you go that's right that's right but you know we should go go to these places because I hear at Kel's they regularly get orb photographs you know they see shapes and figures and blurred figures and there's lots of EVPs that get caught there so I would love to go do an investigation at both of these places and see what we could find hell yeah oh and speaking of Investigation when we come out there we're going to be doing some investigations at maybe at least one of these stops we
