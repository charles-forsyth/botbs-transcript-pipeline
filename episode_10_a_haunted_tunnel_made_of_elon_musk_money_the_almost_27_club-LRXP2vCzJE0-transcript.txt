familial obligations yeah that's really really cool I mean to my son who is listening my son is a faithful listener I love you boy it's nice to have listeners that that I didn't have to specifically call and say your mom is telling you to listen absolutely I mean it's it's really cool to know that people are tuning into more than one episode of their own valtion so thank you thank you thank you we're gonna try and keep it going well yeah much like I'm trying to keep this bowl going now speaking of bowls this latest trip to the old store proved to be quite wonderful for me this week oh did you stumble upon something exceptional show I stumbled upon some new things and I you know as much as I like some good old standbys I also do appreciate the testing of new things and you know I'm always chatty with the bud tender and I'm like well hey if you try this what do you think and they're always so very helpful which shout out to Bud tenders all across the land best customer service on the planet I swear to God these these people will sit there and talk to you about marijuana for like an hour it's like they finally love getting paid to talk about weed oh I would love to meet people like that I don't know if it's you know LA jadedness or what but I think my experience out here has been hit or miss some places that I go to the bud tenders are fantastic and some places it's you know I guess they're just like any overworked counterperson and they just really don't want to deal with any of it and I get that I completely understand but when everyone talks about how great their Bud tenders are and how knowledgeable they are I can only think of a handful of times where I've ever had a bud tender that was more than just just your regular customer service type salesperson you know everyone Raves about great bud tenders and all I ever see are your nine to five salespeople and I get it everyone's got to make a bu but where are the really cool butt tenders they you know where they really are they're actually in coastal Massachusetts because every store you go into and you know I I I go to maybe four or five different stores frequently and every employee every time all the same at every store it it's like going and talking to your best stoner friend who knows everything about their weed they're about to sell you it really is like just talking to your Stoner buddy who just knows everything about what you want to know about that week oh I love that like I walked in they're like how do you how what do you want do you want to melt into the couch or do you want to function a little bit and I'm like well hey what's this melting to the couch stuff you got going on that's called sweets nice never had sweets before I don't know if you've ever heard of sweets this is a 29.91 THC content and nice you know I'm not gonna lie to you people to all you listeners out there I go for the high THC content no shame in my game so when I'm looking at the menu at my local store I am looking at the highest percentages and I go from there the guy recommended sweet sweets he uh did recommend that you use a grinder with it not sure why I have a grinder so I was like well that's what the guy said and he seemed to know what he was talking about you know whatever knowledgeable bun tender but I'm not quite sure why and I think it was cuz I was a little high when I went there so I might not have actually like heard what he said is it really resiny I know sometimes if I get uh nugs that are really dense and resiny if it's not ground up to a light fluffy it has it has trouble burning or staying lit sometimes yeah it's like that these little buds are like as compacted as possible yeah so probably by by grinding it up you're able to to get a better burn on it in the bowl so more than likely they're just nice dense little resy nugs you know feel like in like the last five years I've learned so much more about marijuana that I may or may not have needed to know yes legalization has been amazing for that again all the science I love all that we're learning now this plant is so cool there's so much to it I've come so far from smoking seeds and stems to knowing what the difference between a sativa and an Inda is and now even that's changing everything it changes so quickly so I'm just glad that we can still smoke it in all its lovely forms absolutely absolutely so yeah sweets good stuff highly recommend one of the greatest memes I've been seeing floating around the internet um for the last little while is um Snoop Dog smoking before he goes in to the Super Bowl Stadium yes I love that every time that recirculates around I just giggle I just giggle my favorite one said Snoop Dogg was just restocking his life force as should we all I mean really and how better to counteract the stupid [ __ ] slacker Stoner [ __ ] than to show Snoop Dog Snoop who came from all of those people every single one of those people made themselves every single one of those people in that halftime show and a lot of them I don't know if they all do but a lot of them smoke pot Snoop Dog smoked right before the show on put on a [ __ ] kick ass performance oh my God I was singing and dancing the whole time I loved that [ __ ] how about did you see it how about you you know I have to laugh because in the moment I had said to my my sweet love my darling dear I said to him in the moment I feel like my inner soul is feeling this to the core I am rocking to Mar Jay you know I am rocking a Mary J queen queen when they pulled the and there's 50 Cent hanging I'm like oh my God my God we're going to the club yes you know I thought personally in that moment I was like oh my God this is like my whole life flashing before my eyes same same best half time ever then to go on the internet after the fact I blew my mind every single person in our age group felt the same way yeah so I saw everyone was like My Generation I love this you know Gen X Millennials were like woo this is amazing we got this I had one big huge problem with that halftime show I'm gonna have to air it out right now people all right when the hell did Eminem get dark hair you know that's that's serious I I is that his natural hair color I don't know cuz I've never seen it that color he trying to hide grays is he trying to hide gray he did raise some girls and I as a person who has also raised some girls you get gray you do because let's face it he's also in our age group and you know that's true that's true I like to just you know I actually call it glitter hair so for all you people out there it's glitter hair it's not gray hair glitter hair I do the same thing sh you and me you and me we're right there we're right there right right but yeah em& M with dark hair I don't even know when that happened I don't even know when that happened me either but oh my gosh yeah my only problem was it wasn't long enough I absolutely loved it start to finish I embarrassed the hell

well yeah that was cute yeah that's true that's true I've talked I I I've talked about my my beest weed for the week what is yours oh I'm smoking an old school favorite white widow nice and crystally mhm yummy yummy good stuff I haven't seen that around here on the east coast in quite a bit you know it used to be pretty common and I stopped seeing it for a while I think you know as more hybrids and and uh as more people are getting into growing and quote unquote breeding and you see all these different uh you know different cultivars coming out things like white widow sometimes kind of get lost in the shuffle the other one I really want to see that I haven't seen in a while is my brother's favorite one of my brother's favorites well one of my brothers I have four brothers and one of them his favorite strain his favorite strain I think all but one of them smoke actually and and the one might smoke a little but anyway so the one brother bear his favorite strain is Northern Lights and I haven't seen that in a while oh that's an oldie in a goodie really really good one and that's not something I can find that often so yeah old school White Widow really enjoying it enjoying the high till my new homegrown pot starts uh being ready to smoke again such a horticulturist love it love it you're going to come out and help me trim so it's all good I just what I like is I like the little pointy pointy scissors that have like the curved end I don't know why the curved end makes trimming easier maybe it's just some psycho thing in my head but like the one it has like a little curve up on the end I will get you whatever bougie trimming tools you want diamond tipped I don't care you can have exactly exactly if you want to be my trim [ __ ] I will get you the best trimming scissors ever ever you can just smoke all you want scissor hash is all yours it's the one good thing about trimming actually scissor hash is kind of fun yeah yeah yeah and as I'm uh opening my little Keith box here to break out some more of my lovely White Widow I am reminded to thank all the people who wrote me commiserating with my my cannabis loss last week as you might remember from the last episode I talked about accidentally spilling an entire box of Saved practically an ounce oh Ila I remember that my heart still breaks at that my heart still breaks I know mine too all across the land you know SE SE to see all around the world every single person that smokes marijuana we we know we know that pain it's like it's like a Brotherhood it is it really is there's a net across the world who feels for you right now and and to the those of you who reached out thank you in my time of pain I I appreciate it your words meant a lot to me your your stories commiserating your you know your funny anecdotes I I really appreciate it thank you so much I'm I'm doing okay we're we're in the recovery phase I think I think we're going to we're going to we're going to get through this so thank you we appreciate the kind words thank you so much thank you yeah I was surprised that uh I guess not really I mean we' like you said we've all kind of had that experience so everyone that commiserated I appreciate it thank you I wantan to I want to get into a little bit of this this ghost and ghoul part of our show yeah um yeah so we should probably get into like some I know we've been hanging out catching up this whole entire time shall it's uh we should probably do some stuff for the people not just for us do you have any scary stories for me this week while I pack this bowl I I do I do and you know they're here for the scary stories they're here for us they're here for both come on that's right well I'm here for the weed and the stories and you promised me something super scary this week okay so we are going to go up to like Northwestern Massachusetts this week to a little Old Town near Deerfield River Valley well that sounds pretty that sounds too pretty to be spooky so we talk about this all the time you and I are both uh originally from upstate New York although neither of us are there now that's true but you know that kind of atmosphere of Upstate New York very woodsy very treey you know you could go 10 miles and see nothing but trees and then the next thing you see is a cow field true turn right at the next cow so where where we're talking about this this HK tunnel actually and and I'll get into it in just a second but it's it's a railroad tunnel and it passes through the HK range uh which is a mountain extension of the Vermont Green Mountains so we're in Northwestern Massachusetts so if you're if you're thinking in your head um geographically you are kind of at the corner of where Massachusetts meets Verma on one side and meets Eastern New York on the other side that kind of woodsy mountainy atmosphere you get the idea yeah right so this tunnel um like I said it passes through the HK range which is like this little mountain range 4.7 mile tunnel they decided they needed to have so like we're not talking what no I was gonna say I'm I'm not fan of enclosed places tunnels are not my favorite place they kind of bug me especially if I can't see the other end or see an exit and I cannot imagine being in a almost 5 mile long tunnel just that alone sounds very scary to me well you know and that's that's the thing you know this isn't going into the the tunnel in New York City where you're in there for like 3/4 of a mile at Tops This is 4.7 miles that that that's a long way and what they needed to do or what they decided they had to do was to build this tunnel to continue the rail system so it is a a railway tunnel construction started in 1851 so this was kind of like right smack dab in Civil War time um it took 25 years to build so construction ultimately yeah yeah construction went from from 1851 to 1873 holy [ __ ] to do F Well I can imagine then you know obviously they didn't have access to what we have access to now but five miles a tunnel took 25 years five years a mile that's persistence right there and it was like something ridiculous like $21 million to build which at that time at that time 21 million bucks was a lot of bucks are you [ __ ] me 21 million 1850 money yeah wow I mean I don't know what I'm talking about but I think at that time that was a lot of money a [ __ ] ton of money like I haven't Googled what the comparison is I can't even comprehend how much money that is it's Elon Musk money that is Elon Musk money so when it was complete it was actually considered the world's second longest tunnel the longest tunnel in the world was like 8 and a half miles through the French Alps but the was considered the second longest tunnel in the world and it was the longest tunnel in North America until another tunnel was built in like 1916 but strangely enough it's still actually an active railroad tunnel really so even even to this day um that is an active tunnel and the American Society of civil engineers made the tunnel a historic civil engineering landmark in 1975 so so this is considered some construction historical site I guess basically it was so trains could get from Boston to Upstate New York was the whole gist of why this needed to be there so 25 years it takes in that 25 years now how sad is this in that 25 years 200 more than 200 men had died and actually the whock tunnel has a nickname it had become known as what was called the bloody pit oh wow so 200 people while they were working on this almost Five Mile Stretch of tunnel in that 25 year span 200 people died working on it correct wow because these folks you know you gotta figure what kind of conditions were they working in that that's what I was gonna say you got to figure you know these guys like I said like 1851 to 1873 was the years of construction so so these guys are using um black powder shovels picss their hands um you know we're not talking like any sort of modern dig through a mountain kind of equipment here we're talking Wy coyote stick the dynamite there and hope for the best correct correct so as you can imagine with 25 years in those types of conditions these folks died in fires explosions tunnel collapses and actually in one case by the hand of another oh so there's some murder on this train tunnel correct but the majority obviously were were unfortunate accidents that unfortunate accidents or due to shitty working conditions unfortunate accidents due to shitty working I don't know too much about the railroad history but what I do know is is just steeped in just really shitty practices the way they treated people doing these tunnels wasn't terribly different than say coal mining wow and that and and as we know from history that's Frau with terrible practices and health risks and terrible conditions horrific results absolutely you know this bloody pit you know obviously there there was some some murder in there there was a cold-blooded murder in 1865 that kind of gave the reputation for it being haunted and it kind of only got worse from there oh what happened in 1865 that year or right around there nitroglycerin was introduced to America as an explosive Oh yay new things to blow things up with pretty much pretty much so the construction crew of the HK tunnel actually became one of the first crews in America to use it well that's kind of an interesting factoid interesting factoid no wonder they made it a historic site um yeah no this was like some big construction like undertaking for the time like this was a big deal some big Marvel yeah this was a big deal so they got the honor of basically being one of the first Crews to be able to use nitroglycerin as an explosive on March 20th 1865 three explosive experts named Ned Brinkman Billy Nash and Ringo Kelly decided to use Nitro to continue their work on the tunnel now first of all you're going in with a guy named Ringo that's your first mistake it's dude named Ringo yeah and wait a minute wait a minute who said it was okay to hire Ringo exactly and did they make everything his fault be like where's Ringo Ringo did it wait for it but the other thing I want to point out that I thought was funny so you got three explosive experts in 1865 explosive experts how expertise were they in explosives in 1865 I don't know they've been doing explosives for a pretty long time I imagine I I know zero I know zip about explosives in the 1800s so I I don't know but you know it's feeling a little Three Stooges to me at the moment so let's let's swing it back to Ringo so it always comes back to ring damn it Ringo freaking Ringo man every time it's always Ringo they they decided to continue their work on the tunnel the three of them they placed their charge and then they ran back towards a safety bunker that they knew would Shield them from the effects of the blast Brinkman and Nash never made it back for some reason Ringo Kelly set off the charge before the other made it back to the shelter and the two men were buried alive under tons of rocks oo accident or premeditated murder [ __ ] Ringo man damn it Ringo then you know to add insult to injury you know you can't act like you didn't do anything and then vanish so of course soon after the accident Ringo Kelly oh what did Ringo come up with this time no he vanished Without a Trace many leading many to believe that the accident with a Nitro may not have been an accident after all or did he blow himself up like completely like was it a total accident and it just went off on its own and he was like missed vaporized actually he was not seen again until March 30th 1866 when his body there goes that Thea when his body was discovered two miles inside of the tunnel it was found no wait in the tunnel to miles in the tunnel two was did he go in there to hide what the hell it was found his damn it Ringo his body was found at almost the exact spot where Brinkman and Nash had been killed so authorities what what yeah freaking Ringo yeah authorities quickly thought that he that Ringo had been strangled to death Revenge was it a Revenge killing they estimated that he had been murdered between midnight and 3:30 a.m. in the morning wiing hour Witching Hour will'll get you every time kill you every time no [ __ ] no suspects found crime went unsolved surprise surprise surprise freaking Ringo so he disappeared and then shows up dead on the spot where they died check this out though so you know the cops say that no killer could be found but construction work had their own ideas about who had killed Ringo Kelly oh so they probably knew the beef that was going on well they probably knew that Ringo killed them intentionally is what it was so according to the rumors and The Whispers they believed that Ringo was killed by the vengeful spirits of Brinkman and Nash o plot twist yep they came to feel that the tunnel was cursed and many of them refused to enter it ever again crew members walked off the job and refused to return because they felt that there was Deep Shadows and being watched the dripping water they had like this thing kind of formed not like a stag Mite stalagtite stalagmite whichever one grows from the bottom stag ties are on the ceiling the other one and slag mites are on the floor slag M and I remember that because toag tight you have to hold tight to the ceiling in order to stay there that's how I remember anyway but they believed that Brinkman and Nash cursed the tunnel and that Ringo had gone into the tunnel to do more work and that their vengeful Spirits strangled him to death so a sagite formed in that spot a stag Mite formed in that spot where the all three of them had died where the first two were murdered by freaking Ringo and it took a while for them to actually get workers um back on the back on the site because so many people had walked off and refused to work there that it slowed the construction down because basically people figured that was best to be avoided you can't see me right now but my jaw has been open I cannot believe this so like these two guys get blown up by freaking Ringo now do a year later was there a motive was there ever a motive found for why he might have done it not that I found no not that I found they think that he killed them on purpose and then disappeared only to reappear dead in the exact spot where they died strangled to death strangled to death by an unknown possibly ghostly asent correct and then a stag might formed there and then all the construction workers walked off the because they cursed because it the place is freaking cursed it's a cursed tunnel it wow no that's cursed that's cursed cursed so then in 1868 couple years later the construction site was toured by a guy named Paul Travers who was a mechanical engineer and respected Calvary officer during the Civil War he was asked to come and examine the tunnel and apparently the workers complained of con stly hearing a man's voice cry out in agony what like a guy screaming or moaning correct is it freaking Ringo they refus to enter the half completed tunnel after Sundown whoa now here's the thing they don't want to enter the tunnel after Sundown what are you telling me that the Sun was shining in the tunnel the tunnel's dark whether it's day or night what does the sun being up have to do with being in the dark tunnel that's a very good point it's a very good point dark basements caves dark tunnels just the very fact of they're not being light makes it way creepier but I think the whole power of the witching hour is part of this dude died Ringo freaking Ringo got strangled at the witching hour after killed two people Yeah well yeah but at the witching hour and so they're probably afraid of that whole time period so Travers was convinced that the strange sounds were nothing more than winds sweeping off the mountain side so well you know mountains and tunnels and rocks make weird sound noises I imagine that could make some superstitious tunnel workers even more superstitious possibly so it's it's possible that's why basically why they brought Travers in because not only was he this well-respected um Civil War officer but he was also a mechanical engineer and he could kind of basically tell them these are normal sounds when you gut a hole in the mountain he was kind of called in to like quell everyone's fears correct he superstitious jerks lazy bastards get back to work correct everything's fine correct let's just listen to Daddy on the horse over here correct he's gonna tell you everything's okay all right so he goes down to the site on September 8th and the former military officer did not soon forget what he had encountered there he had later wrote a letter to his sister and told her about the weird experience he says he entered the tunnel at exactly 900 p.m. he traveled about 2 miles into the shaft and then stopped to listen now remember Ringo was dead two miles in that's right that's where the all the murders happened he says as I stood there in the cold silence I heard what truly sounded like a man groaning out in pain as you know he has heard this same sound many times during the Civil War so what a dude sounds like and he knows what wind sounds like when he turned up the wick of his lamb there was no other human being in the shaft except for him and his assistant maybe the two of them were moaning yeah right he told his sister that he had never been that frightened and that it wasn't wind that what they heard and he actually wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait so Mr sober soothe everyone military Daddy coming in to tell everyone that everything's fine children come back to work he SC never been so frightened he heard it and believed it and wrote this down in a letter to his sister that he's scared military daddy the last line of the letter to his sister read perhaps Nash and Brinkman I wonder no the murder key himself whoa so then it doesn't end there um so a month after after his investigation in October um the worst disaster occurred in the tunnel's history worse than two dudes getting killed there was a gas explosion oh wow and it blew apart the water pumping station on the surface and 13 miners were killed and debris filled the yep debris filled the central tunnel where they were working oh God okay okay stop stop for a second stop I have issues sorry sorry tunnels give me a second give me a second hold on I'm gonna eat a I'm gonna eat a peep all right giving me the creeps the hey chibies okay hold on okay take a take a hit off that pipe all right I'm gonna need let me give me a second here oh all right sh I hate enclosed spaces I hate hate hate hate them and one of my biggest fears biggest fears is getting TR nope okay hold on hold on okay okay all right all right okay because the 500 the 500 foot shaft filled with water God after a while the bodies of some of the crew began to surface and Flo it up some of them didn't float up until almost a year later you've got 13 bodies that have been floating and all of that they're probably still there of course it was 13 bodies yeah right so you know a few few years later they get all the water out they keep on working off they go now you can see really why it took like 25 years to build well yeah they kept killing people and having to clear that out and then quell the fears of the workers right right but they were having problems because some of the miners and some of the villagers CU you know obviously there was a village on either end of the entrance of the of with the tunnel they were telling Tales of vague shapes muffled whales they even had claimed to hear lost miners carrying picks and shovels through the mist and on the Mountaintop ghost apparitions see and here miners that had died like as if they were still working carrying their picks and shovels to oh wow ghost workers like they were headed to work like they they it was time to go to work when these bodies would resurface you know they would then try to give them decent burial but basically the the vibe was that their Spirits were trapped there and this is kind of these these were part of the things that made this place called the bloody pit I'm running into more and more theories about different types of stone and water and running water and and a place's ability to attract and hold ghosts and spirits so that's an interesting Theory a listener brought up to me one time and and I can't shake it because I keep running into it I keep seeing it so it's something that's kind of intrigued me you know and and and people people got to test fate they they finished the tunnel right around 1872 1873 so in 1872 these two guys decide to go in and see if anything they have heard around town is real they kind of are like skeptical so these aren't workers they're just some people in town have heard about the rumors of all the the ghosty activities happening up there and and they decide to go check it out for themselves think of it as like the 1872 version of Ghost Hunters yeah that's what I was looking for okay so the 1872 Ghost Hunter people decide to go check it out all right these two men go they they go into the tunnel the two miles um and then they they halted to take a rest there was no light in the bad idea bad idea guys right so there's no light in the shaft other than their dim lamps and they they described it as being cold and as dark as a tomb they were standing there talking and started hearing strange and mournful sounds they described it as like someone in great pain one of the guys that had gone in there had wrote the next thing that he saw was a dim light coming along the tunnel in a Westerly Direction at first he believed it was probably a Workman with a lantern yet as the light grew closer it took on a strange blue color that appeared to change change in shape into the form of a human being with no head no way he saw wow like a ghost light and then a ghost with no head a headless ghost in the tunnel damn I wonder if it Wasing Ringo yeah right the light moved closer to the two men and it was so close that they could almost touch it it remained Mo motionless as though watching them then it hovered off towards the east end of the tunnel and vanished and they basically again were these two random people that got the [ __ ] scared out of them yeah yeah that went there into that two mile Mark now did they know about do you know if they knew about the two mile Mark like did they stop there on purpose or did it sound like it was more of an accident they went in they knew that the tunnel was haunted but they just randomly apparently stopped to rest at that particular spot but like you know the strangeness just continued long after that they started letting trains go in so at that point there were train conductors that would think they saw people on the tracks that as soon as they got close they would just vanish into nothingness oh wow the Phantom people that would show up at that spot right folks on the train were seeing like what they'd call ghostly figures they were just have sometimes when they would be getting to that point the whole train would go cold like the temperature would drop train wide cold spot how yeah wow how Eerie how absolutely Eerie yeah in a tunnel that probably doesn't get it's it's a five mile practically long tunnel it's not going to get a lot of wind in I don't think I don't know there was also some like weird other stuff there's more weirdness yeah the first what did Ringo get up to this time the first train goes through so in 1875 so figure a train in 1875 when I picture a train in 1875 I picture those really cool stage coaches with the amazing personal cars you know dudes smoking cigars and chicks in big big dresses and anyway well this particular train it was pulling three flat cars and one box car and there was a group of 125 people that had come along for the ride so because as you can imagine the flat cars that would be fun scary as you can imagine Not only was it considered uh the Gateway the Western gateway to the rest of New England this was like some engineering feet so people went a fir tender on the rail because you know at that time they did a lot of they were coal trains so they had to shovel coal they had to shove coal in there right big puffs of black smoke they had just gone in with a load of wood and coal and they had been a short distance into the shaft the guy turned around and all of the sudden surrounded by what he felt were the two guys that were originally killed in the explosion now I remember you said that the the military guy that had been sent in to kind of quell all the workers uh feelings and worries he had felt the spirits of those of those two guys and now you're saying or even then conductors were feeling the spirit of particularly those two the first two that were like killed purpose correct wow they seem to have never left and then wrongful death obviously some of the the moaning some of the other random apparitions that has got to just be people you know some of those 13 or well you said over 200 people passed away 200 people were killed there 200 people total died 200 people total died in that whole tunnel so you know I imagine percentage of them stories about the quote unquote bloody pit still continue There was actually in 1984 oh recent yeah is there was a professor parttime Ghost Hunter named Ali all maker and she felt she had a close encounter in the tunnel she wrote that she was accompanied to the tunnel by a railroad official again in 1984 and while there had an uncomfortable Sensation that someone was standing close to her she also stated that several students from the North Adams State College visited the tunnel one night and left a tape recorder running in the shaft they left it there fun I love that what did they get what did they get they left it there and when they returned and listen to the the tape they heard what seemed to be muffled human voices on the tape oh wow so so the stories of the bloody pit still go on today um locals in the area claim that strange winds ghostly apparitions Eerie voices um are experienced in and around the tunnel visitors who Journey to the site really kind of risk becoming one of the residents of the ghost themselves because like I said is it dangerous is the tunnel itself safe to go in or is it well again it's 4.7 miles and it is um the Boston and Maine railroad still run you said it was still in use so it must be well maintained yeah they still run nearly a dozen freight trains through the tunnel each day oh wow um making it you know I think when I was looking at it I think I think when I read it it was like 24 feet wide I mean we're not talking about a wide tunnel it's only 24 feet wide so you figure a train [ __ ] a train's got to be 20 feet wide are they I have no idea how wide a train is you're not talking about having a lot of a lot of um space between the train and the wall thanks true but they do have a museum dedicated to the site um called the Western Gateway Heritage State Park but that's interesting the thing is is that they even like at the entrance the two entrances of the tunnel they say that spirits of the past are reported to linger in Dark Shadows press lightly on all sides of that entrance and HK is a Mohawk Indian name and the HK Mountain was named after that Mohawk Indian uh word uh for forbidden really who sick actually translates in Mohawk to forbidden well that should have been their first clue why in the world would you build a tunnel through something that's forbidden right and has now also garnered the nickname the bloody pit so yeah I mean I think that it would be a spooky cool place to visit but but I also I I would be afraid of the train nope you can do that one on your own thank you but no I I don't do tunnels if I don't have to yeah the train thing would be an issue for me because obviously I don't want to get hit by a train and having like two feet between the wall and the train get sucked there it's not would I take a train ride through there [ __ ] yeah let's do this stop stop the train at the two mile mark I'm down let's do this nope nope nope no NOP you can do that one on your own not a place I would visit just because it's an active rail line but if I could take a train through it or if they ever stopped the trains and let people walk through it absolutely I'm down I'm down Lea you know I'm down it's possible I do it it's possible it's 24 feet wide and almost five miles long if they did not run trains if they like stopped trains for a day yeah that's my I could probably go through that that's big enough I might start getting a little hyperventilate I'm a little hyperventilate at the moment thinking about being in the middle not just because of the two mile Mark ghost but uh just because it's a tunnel but it that's big enough I could probably be okay I don't know how tall it is well I'm very short so yeah I don't know how tall it is it doesn't really matter I'm super short I'm way shorter than train height so we're good we're good I think that that that is definitely a good Spooktacular location just tread lightly and don't get hit by trains I am already super super super creep that sounds really scary I mean freaking Ringo man why it all started with Ringo it all started with Ringo it was bad enough with people dying by accident but then he had to go and do it on purpose damn it Ringo John Paul George they were right man they were right no let's not get into that we're gonna have Beatles fans all on on our [ __ ] what are you gonna talk about now what what are you going to do to scare me scare me now well I'm going to scare you and actually so I picked a place Joshua tree that I absolutely adore you know we moved out here a while ago and one of the first places we went to visit was Joshua Tree National Park and I fell in love with the place which is super weird for me because I am an East Coast Woods born and bred Forest loving Lake loving witchy wild woman of the trees right like is that a desert I don't even know yeah it's two deserts actually it's a desert okay it's yeah so putting this Witchy woodsy Woman in in the desert was a little weird when I first came out to California all I could see was that everything was brown there was dead it was no trees everything seemed weird to me but when I went out to Joshua Tree and really got to see the desert and see the land and how much life is in it it just kind of really opened my eyes just something about that place is so beautiful and so mystical we need to start from the beginning let's start from the beginning first of all if this is a desert is the Joshua Tree a tree are there trees like what kind of trees in the desert like is this a tree I'm confused all right well I'm going to answer your first question yes it's a desert it's two deserts they're often called the high desert and the low desert the high desert is the Mojave Desert and the low desert is the Colorado desert and so I think we like the high desert we do like the high desert and the uh the Mojave the high desert our favorite the high desert is is mostly where you'll find the Joshua trees but in Joshua Tree National Park you'll see both deserts now the Joshua Tree itself is not a tree okay it's a it's a type of yaka it's more related to an orchid plant than it's related to actual trees they look like a cactus exactly similar to a cactus they're in the family or you know they're a type of yucka basically and they can live 500 years on average and I think the oldest one right now is over thousand years old no [ __ ] no [ __ ] and they they kind of look Dr seussian you know they look like Dr Seuss type trees and they got their name Joshua tree from the Mormon people as they were kind of traveling out west to them they said that the the trees the Joshua trees looked like praying hands or arms being raised to heaven and this was in reference to biblical Joshua and not knowing the Bible I tried to look it up and I was kind of getting confused as to why Joshua from the Bible would represent being raised to God so I called my stepfather anytime I have a Bible question he's my go-to so he helped me apparently Joshua LED um the Israelites out of their wandering and he raised his hands to God as long as his hands or the staff was raised to God the people were able to go to the promised land so the the Mormons kind of related their travels across the US uh to the the biblical Israelites wandering to the promised land so they said that these trees resembled praying hands or Joshua's arms kind of pointing West and leading them to the promised land as well so there you go your little Bible story from Lea today Leila the witch gives you a Bible story so thank you Papa for that information I really appreciate it so yeah these trees are not trees they're just kind of really cool Dr Seuss landscape and the place is just stunningly gorgeous shelle are there scorpions yes damn it yeah I'm gonna hit you with some facts I got it right from their the very own website National website uh 57 mammals 46 reptiles 250 species of birds 75 species of butterflies the place is just absolutely alive and if you go out there at the right time you can it's covered in flowers and plants and just the different Rock shapes are magical I cannot wait to take you guys out here and take you there's serious rock climbers that go out there and serious hikers but we're going to go on some of the easier hiking trails and some of the easier rock climbing places where you can kind of play around on the rocks and have a good time you guys are really going to love and Stoners we are not rock climbers professional rock climbers no not professional rock climbers hey I'm the oldest one of our group and I'll go up there every time I love it so you're going to have fun I will take you to fun stuff I promise now you mentioned the Mormons um and I've I've heard of other folks from other religious denominations what about this place makes there be a spiritual attraction I think it's the spiritual attraction of any Desert but it it's not necessar that it has an attraction but you know like Jim Morrison loved the desert he likes to go out into the desert and actually the the the main story I'm going to get into is a a singer that reminded me a lot of Jim Morrison um I love Jim Morrison Graham Parson I was a country rock star and as I I didn't actually set out to research gr Parson's story with Joshua Tree I feel like that name is familiar it might be gr Parsons was a he was a country rock star in this 7s he was in a bunch of different bands he was in the birds he got kicked out of the birds he uh he got kicked out of a couple bands he was friends with Keith Richards kind of influenced some of their sound and uh he was pretty famous he was almost in the 27 Club shell oh wow when he died he was two months shy of his 27th birthday which would have put him in that famous 27 Club you and I had the same poster yeah honoring the 27 club and I have it it's right there I I still have that post um and I actually bought it this past year for my daughter for her 27th birthday oh and in case you're not familiar with the infamous 27 Club it's something that that's been tossed around a lot of famous musicians pass away when they're 27 some of the more famous members of that club include Jimmy Hendrick Kurt Cobain Janice Joplin Amy win housee and Jim Morrison and Jim Morrison there's a whole bunch of them and also would have in two months so I guess he kind of is an honorary member grandpar so I'm going to talk about him in a minute yeah so when I first moved out here we went to uh Joshua tree and I freaking love that place it is absolutely amazing it really kind of opened my eyes to how much life there really is in the desert and how gorgeous it is and and how deadly and dangerous that something that beautiful can be you really have to respect the desert as I was seeing all these beautiful rock formations and people climbing these crazy rock towers and Joshua trees and fantastic flowers we were also seeing missing posters for different hikers and people that had gone missing and had you know hadn't been found actually just this month a man who had been missing for 12 years his bones were found in Joshua Tree oh [ __ ] and back in 2017 2018 when I came out here two of the stories that I I am going to touch on briefly but they're they're current stories is it because of exposure sometimes the heat sometimes yes sometimes no sometimes we never know a lot of times it's because people are unprepared for the Heat and they need to bring a lot of water and you think you're just going on an out and back Trail or something very simple and it's so easy to get lost it's the place looks like Mars and if you go just a little ways away all of a sudden you can't see anything and all the landmarks start to look the same so you have to respect the desert you have to go prepared you have to bring water every time you go even if it's a simple out andback hike we going to just give you a real quick rundown Joshua Tree was formed as a national park because of manura Hamilton hoit I really want want to mention her because she's so freaking cool Southern socialite married moved from the south to New York and had a baby boy and when that baby boy died suddenly she and her husband moved to California and she got passionately into gardening and really loved the native California plants and the cactuses cacti cactuses you know Joshua trees everything and she was camped I had no idea that women in the early 1900s camped like she talked about going camping under the stars and how much she loved it and what Solace the desert that's because camping [ __ ] rocks camping [ __ ] rocks and they've known for a hundred years camping [ __ ] rocks I want to go camping there's some of her quotes she would said things like quote during nights in the open lying in a snug sleeping bag I soon learned the charm of a Joshua Forest above the bright desert constellations wheeled majestically toward the west a Time piece for the wakeful and she just found such it sister right it healed her being in those in that desert under those Stars seeing those rocks that Timeless formations touched her and and helped her helped her heal and she wanted to preserve that and her husband passed away and she kind of threw her whole self into it she joined commissions out here for proposing state parks and she had this idea for a million acre Park I was going to say how big is this how big are we talking not a million Acres that's what she was going for you know so she's on all these committees trying to get this park done and they send someone out under President Roosevelt to look at the park and he says Nope this place sucks it's terrible it's awful and he's like you can maybe have 100,000 acres manura Hamilton Hoy decided to go completely Karen was probably like the original National Park Karen because she was not going to settle for a measley 100,000 acre Park she that was a 10 that was basically a tenth of what she wanted exactly so she H hired a professional artists professional photographers she created books with pictures and illustrations and you know she had the governor of the state write an introduction to this book and she went all out singing the Praises of Joshua tree and she sent that book along with some high positioned friend of hers I forget what uh government official he was so she had the California governor write the introduction and then she had some other high position California government person deliver this book in person to President Roosevelt in order to get her million acre Park she didn't get a million Acres she did get over 800,000 acres and on August 10th wow August 10th 1936 President Roosevelt signed a proclamation establishing Joshua Tree National monument and that was all due to the love that manura had for the desert and for the desert plants and and I love her for it I absolutely love her for this one of her other quotes that's on a plaque it's kind of a hardre hike you have to get to it says say I stood and looked everything was peaceful and it rested me oh if that just doesn't encapsulate Joshua Tree I [ __ ] love this place and it was founded by a freaking woman manura what a cool name I've looked up some pictures uh online and yeah I could totally dig that I could totally dig going there but I can also see I can also see how you better watch your ass or you're going to be lost in a hot second yes respect it you have to respect it beautiful deadly absolutely [ __ ] deadly and I'm not talking about the Scorpions because odds of you getting bit by a scorpion are pretty slim really because I'm scared of that yeah don't be scared of that I mean check your shoes you got to check your shoes you know wear long pants wear the right shoes um you know be be a little cautious got to watch out for snakes you know obviously you have to respect the desert in all of its forms but what's more likely going to kill you is dehydration getting lost and dehydration and the Sun and I'm going to get into a couple stories again I went back and forth on including these recent stories because people involved are still alive and I'm very respectful of that but these touched me so much and so many people have gone missing in Joshua Tree for not being careful and so I kind of wanted to share these people's stories because they did touch me so much um and maybe to help other people understand that you have to be kind of careful so I'll give you the fun the fun death I'll give you the the interesting haunting first that kind of reminded me of Jim Jim Morrison while I was researching this place I came across um Graham Parsons who was a country rock star like I said and his absolute favorite place was Joshua tree and he would go out there and party so freaking hard alcohol drugs he would trip he'd write songs again reminded me so much of Jim Morrison he would go out to this place that was called the Joshua Tree Inn and he would go there every time stay in room eight and he would just party like mad out in Joshua Tree loved to go out to cap Rock he would climb at all the different places party animal right okay sounds like a sounds like a fun time right absolute fun time so this guy in 73 late 73 he's getting ready to go on tour and his house burns down all he's able to save is like his guitar that's pretty much it and so he's couch surfing and he's sleeping on his manager who's Al also his friend so his manager Kaufman is also his friend and he's hanging out at his house sleeping on his couch and he decides that um in the last couple days before his tour he's going to go spend them in Joshua Tree and kind of get ready for this upcoming tour so he goes and he stays at his favorite room room eight at the Joshua Tree Inn which is still there by the way and he's partying with his girlfriend Margaret fiser and all of his friends and they're hanging out and this hardcore [ __ ] decides he's getting completely shitfaced he does six double tequila shots and he's deciding damn right he decides that's not enough he finds this chick who's selling morphine this he finds this drug dealer chick who's selling morphine and she promptly shoots him up with way more than he can handle oh geez of course yeah his girlfriend Margaret Fisher finds him oding in the room and decides hey let's give him an ice cube suppository and when that didn't help she wait wait wait wa wait so they decided to try to help him to shove a ice cube up his ass yeah and I did not look this up because it was a little disturbing I you know was already disturbing enough I didn't want to learn about Ice Cube suppositories but yeah the go-to here she decided to give him an ice cube suppository and put him in a cold shower and when that didn't work she tucked him into bed and decided he needed coffee best thing would be to go get him a coffee so she tucks him all nice into bed hey honey I'm going to get you coffee to help with your morphine overdose and she goes and leaves when she comes back with the magical coffee that's going to cure his OD she finds his friends trying to resuscitate him and and they call 911 and he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital September of 1973 oh wow yeah rumors are he haunts that room to this day so his story doesn't end there in true rock and roll style his best friend his manager Kaufman apparently rented a hearse because they got to bust Graham Parson's body out of the LAX Airport Graham before he had died had told Kaufman they had made a pack Graham loved Joshua tree so much he said man if I ever die I want to be cremated and I want my ashes sprinkled over cap Rock which is one of the rock formations that you can climb so Kaufman was determined that he was going to carry out his friends last wishes on what he wanted done with his body Graham Parson's family wanted the body flown back to Louisiana to be buried there so Kaufman rented a hearse and he and a couple Ries pretended to be what's the place where you go your body what's that house called like funeral home they pretend to be funeral home attendance attendance Kaufman and some Ries pretended to be Funeral Home attendants took this rented hearse drove to LAX conned them into putting the body in its coffin in the back of this hearse and drove the [ __ ] to Joshua Tree so they drive his body out to Joshua Tree take it out of the hearse douse it in gasoline and light that [ __ ] on fire to give great Parson his cremation just like he wanted only they miscalculated how much gasoline they would need they used so much gasoline that the resulting Fireball and smoke could be seen from the nearby town and so they were only able to kind of partially cremate Graham before the authorities showed up to kind of shut down that last party they did manage to sprinkle some ashes over cap Rock and what was left what was left of his remains were flown back to Louisiana and buried just outside of New Orleans but they uh yeah so an artist kind of at one time uh gathered up some dirt and rock from cap Rock which presumably may contain some of his ashes they formed a cement guitar Memorial outside of room 8 at the Joshua Tree Inn where you can go see in and see this Memorial it's still there and that room the room where Jim or where Graham Parsons died is haunted it has a few momentos in it some posters and things that still contains the mirror the same mirror that Graham would look into in that room there's a lot of interesting stories about it you know your your do opening and closing things locking and unlocking um furniture moving around the mirror is said to Rattle if you if you look into it for too long the um room service has to it's a rule they have to carry a cell phone at all times if they're going into room eight why because the doors are known to slam shut and lock from the outside and so they can't get out and they'll have to call someone there's two rooms in or there's two doors in each room a front door that you get in and out of and a back door that goes to a private patio for each room and one of the room service attendants says that she has seen very often things moving and we they'll often have to ask someone to come into that room with them to help them move like the heavy nightstand and stuff because it'll often be moved out of its out of where it's supposed to be and so she had had the back door to the patio open propped open and was airing out the room while she cleaned it after a guest had been there and so when she was done cleaning the room she shut and latched that back door and then went out front and was talking to another room attendant when all of a sudden she hears a door slam and then again slam slam slam like someone was opening and shutting a door and she runs into the room to find that back door that she had just latched opening and shutting as if in a a strong Breeze oh [ __ ] there's also people will that stay in the room report that the radio will turn on at Auto hours playing country music no matter what it had been set to when they went to bed and uh even in one of the articles that I read someone stayed in the room next door to it room 8 itself was empty at the time they weren't renting it at that time and so they stayed in a room next door to it and they were awakened in the middle of the night by the sounds of loud music coming from room eight even though no one was staying there oh wow they say that he's still there and uh his daughter reportedly still goes to stay there so you know it's just interesting that you know something his daughter still goes there yeah I guess Kaufman still to this day will go and stay just to kind of hang out with his friend oh wow which is kind of interesting I had never heard of this guy but I'm like super interested is this like to the entrance of the national park like or you just randomly there's a lot of different entrances oh it's huge this place is huge so you have no concept there's there's several different but yes this is one of the places you can go and stay at that in and have easy access to different areas of the park so depending on where you want to go to the park uh you can stay at some of these different places so that's my fun kind of ghost story haunting but I do want to tell two sad stories that touched me really quickly about this park and they were people that I had seen posters of that were missing the first one is these two young people Rachel nuan and Joseph orbeso in July of 2017 they were reported missing by the Airbnb host where they had been staying they were friends that had gone and stayed in this Airbnb they were going to go hike Joshua tree for Rachel's 20th birthday so they were young so they were very young and the Airbnb host reported them missing when they didn't check out and all their stuff was still in the Airbnb and she said that they may have gone hiking um authorities found their car parked near a trail called The Maze loop trail which is a moderate difficult trail hike kind of an out and back circular Trail and an extensive search happened I mean they used dogs they used helicopters they used drones and no trace of them was found and I I remember following it at the time because I again you see these posters when you go there of different missing people because this is a dangerous place and they were just a few years older than than my do my oldest daughter and I and I couldn't get it out of my head so I kind of was following the case at the time and I know his father was relentless in searching and they over 2100 hours of searching and they they just could not find these kids they were found a few months later in September of that year by someone who had gone out you know they kind of scaled back the search and so 3 months later one of the park rangers found them in a Steep Canyon like far north of the ma loop trail head so they had gotten lost and had gone off Trail and it looks like um Rachel had fallen and had hurt her head um so they had kind of pieced together the story of these kids based on how they were found and it's absolutely sad and tragic so it looks like she had hurt her head and they found her te shirt wrapped around her head and his clothes were kind of draped over her legs as if to kind of protect her from the Sun or to keep her warm at night and they had not brought enough water they had only brought a little bit of water with them and it looks like what little food they had brought with them they had rationed or had been trying to ration so they pieced together that she had probably hurt her head and possibly her leg and some type of fall down the the canyon and he had tried to take care of her and they didn't have any water and just after a couple days he had hydration is is going to kill you pretty quickly he was a security guard and so he had a handgun with him oh no so rather than rather than succumb to the the dehydration uh he they they took the humane way out and he killed her and then killed himself and they were found in an Embrace under a tree and her family and his family know from what again they could piece together they got off Trail didn't bring enough resources and she had a head injury and after a couple days of no water and not and knowing no one's going to find them they they they chose the humane way out and I I can't get that story out of my head it's one of those things that kind of sticks with you that you need to be super careful even when you think it's an easy Trail even when you think that you can handle it you have to be so so careful um the other one got me because it was a gentleman that reminded me of me and my husband and so the the second relatively recent story was of a Canadian couple when we go to Joshua Tree I am bringing a backpack of cheese and pepperoni sticks with like some sort of water containers oh yeah absolutely you need to bring a lot of water one of the other posters that I saw a lot was a gentleman who went missing right around the same time that we had gone hiking was a gentleman named Paul Miller and this was in July of 2018 and we had been hiking in Joshua Tree that same time period And so again this was one that kind of struck me he was a a 51-year-old man and he and his wife were here from Canada on vacation on um an anniversary trip and really fit people and it they were staying at a place in Palm Springs and right near Joshua tree and on the day that they were leaving um Paul had wanted to go back to a hike called 29 palms and take some pictures and because they were kind of in a time crunch his wife stayed behind to pack up their hotel room while he went and took the pictures and he never came back so she reported him missing later that day and they did again extensive searches and they couldn't find him they searched this whole Trail they had dogs they they went everywhere they could to try and figure out what had happened and and he just had disappeared Without a Trace and it wasn't until I think it was either 2019 or 2020 they did a drone search um like a year later and they finally found his body this one was a little bit different he had water and food in his pack he had come prepared they found him seated against a a rock and they think because he had water and food in his pack that maybe he had died of a heart attack maybe he had died suddenly and had sat down to rest maybe having chest pains or something you know so that that's a little bit different you know he kind kind of gotten off Trail and and gotten lost and possibly suffered how easy is it to get off Trail I've been there several times and we're usually very very careful there's a lot of back country and I guess it's pretty easy it's easy to stay on trail millions of people go there every year and don't get lost you know so that the people who do get lost are a small percentage uh because again I think like 5 million people or more went there last year even though you can hike for days out into the back country you can go to to some amazing climbing spots there's there's horseback accessible places um you can go very very far where you can't see any civilization and it's there's some spots where you there's no light pollution so you can see the stars amazingly so it's very easy if you're not careful to to get lost but if you take some precautions it's not that bad so on unfortunately some people take precautions and have a bit of bad luck so you know you never kind of know you have to take every precaution you can think of to go out there so beautiful but deadly place I definitely need more pot after a tunnel and a deadly gorgeous Joshua Tree I think yours was more scary this week I I'm am scared of the the murder pit the the bloody pit the bloody Death Pit I'm scared of the bloody Death Pit Joshua Tree I'm going to go back to multiple times and we'll respect it you know and every time I go I kind of I can't help but think of the people who have passed away who have been missing who have been found I it's beautiful it's deadly and you know there's a little tinge of sadness there but it's also a hopeful peaceful Healing Place as well pretty cool whereas the HK tunnel is just like a claustrophobic bloody pet just like a claustrophobic place I am not going that sounds super scary yep you win Hands Down Yay East Coast gets it this week so all right cool thank you so much for listen to episode 10 of the stoned Witches Hour we super appreciate it thank you so much all of you for hanging out with us while we uh chill and get high
