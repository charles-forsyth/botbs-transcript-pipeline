crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick thank you for listening to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I'm shell and today we're going to talk about not magic this is a Hot Topic have you seen a lot of stuff on not magic lately I have it seems like everybody is wondering how to do not magic what it is what are some good spells to do with not magic and this is a great time of year shell because I have a little bit of Scottish folklore for you about knots do tell it's from a book called stories of fairies from Scotland by Walter Gregor and he wrote this in 1883 about some Scottish folklore and he says that right around Halloween fairies dance around bonfires and they'll tie beautiful blue ribbons into knots with their left hand and then throw it over their left shoulders and if any human is unlucky enough to find one of these knots and picks it up they'll become mesmerized by the beautiful intricate knot and then the fairies will be able to come and steal them away and they'll never be seen again oo I like that right they're just tring to tells you that not magic has been around for a while in folklore from all sorts of different different places well this is something that I think is some everybody can do everybody can tie a knot you got string you've got cord you've got whatever material to tie a knots this this is definitely something that you don't need any extras for which is why I love it and it's also very secret for anybody who's still in the broom closet not magic is something that you can do and no one will know that you're doing magic I mean you could tie your shoelaces that's something I see all over they're like not magic is so easy you can do it when you tie your shoelaces I mean just like with a lot of things I think it comes down to what is your intent what are you trying to put out there what is your your quote unquote spell or prayer you know just as you would you know say Me Maybe make an incense or make a tea with those intentions you're tying those knots with those intentions one little thing that I had seen uh way back and you can still find it online I'm pretty sure you can find it online still remember back back in our day Nightmare on Elm Street and Freddy Krueger yeah love those movies this time of year you know how they had that you know one two Freddy's coming for you yes thing you know not one the Spells begun not two it'll be true not three so mod it be have you heard that I have I think that particular rhyme that by not of won the Spells begun one that one was written by Deborah Harkness I think for her All Souls Trilogy I think it was also in the discovery of witches and it's a derivative of a common counting rhyming spell you see it all over the place you know like you said from the Freddy movies one two Freddy's coming for you so it's pretty common um but this is the one that most people know of and the reason they're so common is because they're so very very easy and our brains love easy and I think that's probably why I always remembered it because it reminded me of the Freddy song but but kind of in a I don't know about other folks but me personally not magic is generally something you're doing in a pinch and on the Fly I don't know it it was always kind of a in a pinch kind of thing for me the rhyme that you're talking about is a is a nine line charm it goes up to number nine and you can actually I don't think I remember I don't think I remember all nine the reason it's a nine line charm is because it's for something called a witch's ladder and a witches ladders have they go back to Charles Godfrey Leland he talked about them in some of his earlier books when he was talking about Italian uh folk witchery and he had seen it from older articles talking about witches ladds that had been found in old ladies atcts and stuff like that aren't they really aren't they really similar to maybe the witch version of a rosary kind of a witch's ladder is is basically a string with nine or up to 40 knots but any magical number that works for you is good people use nine again because it's easy to do with that rhyming charm because what you do with a witch's ladder is you take your rope or strap whatever it is and as you tie the first knot you say your charm or you say your binding and you can even put a parchment with a spell written on it into that I think when I did when I did Stones you can do stones Crystal chips yep so each of those nine knots and sometimes they can be tied in a very specific order depending on the type of witch's ladder that you're doing you can put feathers in it which are traditional uh there's different curses that you can bind into it or blessings you can bind into it but that charm is specifically for something called a witches lad which has kind of an old possibly controversial beginning but in modern day is used as a very powerful not spell can you do notot magic without it having to be n knot oh absolutely it can be one knots are one of those sympathetic magic things we we talk about magic being very like for like our brains like things that make sense and our subconscious and our magical brain in particular likes things that look magical I guess um so a knot when you're saying I bind you or you're trying to bind someone what do you do when you literally bind someone you knot them up with ropes you tie them down and so tying a knot is literally binding something so you can do that for good or for ill if you want to bind someone to stop them you can or if you want to bind good things into something you can one example of a time when you spend a lot of time tying knots is right here shell oh yeah our coven cords our coven cords we are both holding up 9 foot long cords that are three different braided cords so there's nine total cords in this nine foot long cord I think we started out with 18 feet of cord that we had to separate and braid and I think by the time I was done I had carpel tunnel what we're referring to is a coven cord and for our coven we started out with three braids of white and you would move up to different color chords until you eventually got the high priest or high priestess chord to make these cords for each of our initiates or as you moved up and got a different color cord we would have little coven parties and people would come over and we would take this God's awful long lengths of cord like shell said it was like 18 or 21 feet because you then had to braid each color then the three colors together got braided together again and as we made these braids which are a type of knot we would think good thoughts about this person we'd be talking about the coven we'd be laughing about the future we'd be infusing this braid with energy that would then get Bound by those knots into that cord do you know how long it was like years it was years before I realized that that was considered not magic so I had been doing nut magic making all those cords getting my purple tunnel and didn't even know it was necessarily not magic which I laugh at now but sometimes you do things and just because you don't have a name for it you don't realize you're doing it so I had been doing not magic forever in a day and had no clue because it was braiding and I didn't realize that braiding you know in your mind you're like a knot a knot that's not a not it's a braid um but yeah it took me years to realize I was doing not magic for a long time braiding sewing knitting crocheting all of those are forms of binding forms of not Magic macra is a beautiful form of not magic I'm going to hold up another thing that our listeners can't see but shell can this is a necklace like you know those hippy necklaces this one I made for my husband it's wrapped with five different stones and he had picked these stones out while we were at a pagan festival and carried them with him the entire Festival charging them with really positive energy and then I took hemp rope and wrapped a necklace and then wrapped each Stone in its own individual net and there's a lot of knots in this necklace and so each knot was tied with intention and you can do that while you're crocheting something or sewing something and it can be very small it doesn't have to be big well like I said I think there's just some misconception that not magic is specifically knots yeah and it's not it's not no it's not and sometimes it can look like Celtic knots a beautiful form of knotwork is Celtic knots that you've seen drawn all over everything I mean Pagan everything has Celtic not workk in it I have Celtic not workor tattoos exactly and those are magical as well and they can be very meditative following the lines of those knots or drawing one of those knots in one continuous line where your pen never leaves the paper can be a very powerful meditation now I I kind of wanted to get back a little bit to that witch's ladder and how it kind of equates to what some folks former Christians current Christians would know is is the rosary so you know how on a rosary your typical uh Catholic Rosary I don't know how many beads are on it to be honest um I've never really had that experience but you pray to each bead I have done that with a witches ladder same exact thing where kind of not necessarily pray to each not but have a conversational intention with each not because I've done it in a way that I think when I did it I had like a strip it was just like maybe a 8 inch long Strip by the time it was done and like I said I had I had knotted in chips of Crystals and Stones at each knot and kind of did it like along like the chakra color theme oh that sounds really cool kind of did like a meditative intentional mini spell at each color as I went up the color code so you doubly charged those so not only did you have crystals in there to hold the energy but you knotted it in there to hold and keep it well they were those little chips that had the holes in them um like the jewelry chips so I was able to make the chip a part of the knot you know what I'm saying oh yeah absolutely now you doubly have a an energy holder there and kind of every not put in the intention that I had that stone symbolized basically kind of like how you would pray on a rosary going from knot to knot or stone to Stone a spell braid like that could be used similarly especially if you charge like you said you had it done in Chakra colors and you charge each of those with that type of energy anytime you then wanted to do a chakra meditation if you took that braided cord out and then held each knot you would feel that Rush of energy you you'd basically have a a chakra battery an energy battery right there that you could then use later in spells or in meditations I I think that's fabulous and also very aesthetically pleasing I have to just throw that piece in there gotcha yeah they're really pretty oh my gosh I mean my husband loves his necklace he wears it all the time and it's a very wearable spell it looks great on him but another thing with braiding that I like to do while we're on the topic of braiding is um braiding hair yeah and we're not going to get into locks or dread locks or Ros safarian locks because that's an entirely different thing that's a whole religious thing and so we're not going to really talk about locks here but that's another way that that nodding something can be very spiritual very powerful and very magical there is such a thing we'll touch briefly on the fairy locks like in Irish and Celtic mythology there's the idea that fairies at night would come and not your hair and that it might possib like shakespear says it's unlucky to brush those out but that doesn't mean that they wore them as a hairstyle they just have talked about it happening but braiding your hair was definitely something that people in all sorts of different cultures and societies did as a magical tool and same thing as you're braiding your hair do your intent my favorite one is like right before a like an interview or some or or a date take just a little bit of hair from the back of your neck enough to do a very tiny tiny three strand braid and as you're thinking you know I hope I'm confident and and secure and have great answers to every question for this interview while you're braiding your hair and then just tuck it back no one's going to see it and now you have a spell that's going to last just for a little while as that braid Works itself out that will hopefully bind some of that energy that you just raised to give you confidence and good answers and a good interview well I'm glad you I'm glad you made that little point that no one's going to see because Hair Braiding is a a great form of not magic for folks that are still in the broom closet and are not comfortable coming out this is something that you can do all day every day and no one's going to know even the men out there you can braid it and and no one's going to know that there's magical intent there for those that are in the broom closet this is a nice powerful useful tool for you and I talked about a little teeny tiny braid that you could hide but Shell's talking about beautiful braided hairstyles when you're doing your hair in the morning put a little bit of oil in there and braid your intent for strength or similar to veiling where you put an actual piece of cloth on your head you could braid your hair to be your Veil or your protection for the day and even put in crystals or small hair clips that you have charged with certain intents to be your protection on your crown for the entire day that is just a beautiful way to do magic with hair I think so too I think so too and it's super easy to hide which is why it's something that's very very popular and witches ladders can come in all different forms like I said you can tie knots to be a curse you can bind someone to keep them away from you or to bind their energy away or you can bind good things together such as um a coven cord or I also still have my hand fasting cord from when my husband and I were married which similar to the coven cord we took cords that had colors relevant to us and we wo them in a this was a five strand braid I chose a five strand braid for that particular chord but again it was woven with magic and intent and we still have it together and similar to The Binding of them uh you can also unbind knots with intention I've I've done that yeah yeah shelle was also handfasted with a cord and I distinctly remember the ceremony to unwind that cord unwind that cord you know sometimes you got to do what you got to do no harm no foul that's right but it you sometimes you know you you got to undo what you've done and that's easy to do with not magic you can easily I don't want to say easily undo what you've did done but you can you can kind of reverse that magic in an easier way than say other methods you know this may be aging me but I remember back in the day another form of of cute hair magic I would do the little braid you know you talked about getting the little braid from the the tight inside back but remember after we braid them then you'd get the embroidery cord and the different colors and then maybe charm or two and do hair wraps hair wraps were something I utilized for spell work a lot back in the day do people even do that now they do are hair wraps still a thing I think so and hair braids are very very popular now other than hair not magic has all sorts of different uses do you know Sailors used to use not magic people forget that Sailors used to use specific knots to kind of get favor with the Seas or get favor with the weather this is something that that that's definitely kind of goes across the board not necessarily in which circles I think people have practiced not magic in one form or fashion all throughout time I think because it it is so it's so easy to see the magic in it I mean tying something up is binding them untying something is releasing it it's easy to see that it's also you talked about sailor knots they know so many different types of knots and some of them are quite beautiful and intricate and just looking at a knot can be a very meditative experience looking at a Celtic knot or looking at a very elaborately tied knot you can get kind of lost in following the curves and the lines of a well tied knot um there's also the story of of the gordian knot that was supposed to be the this great mysterious knot knot that could not be untied and something about I think it was Alexander the Great was presented with this gordian knot that was so mystical and could not be untied by anyone and he kind of pulled an Indiana Jones and pulled out his sword and just sliced it in half because that is a cheating hey it's one nobody said you couldn't untie it that way how you untie the knot can also mean something differently you can very carefully unpick the knot over time which could be symbolizing untying a problem maybe you've got a particularly difficult issue that you're dealing with and in some spell work you can tie up this crazy elaborate knot and then as the ongoing part of the spell you could try to pick it apart slowly over time and the idea being as you unravel and pick apart that knot you're better able to unravel and pick apart problem that you're having in your life so this a metaphorical reason with it as well right and and again that's why they're so powerful because it makes sense to your subconscious to your magical brain and that's also why sometimes you don't want to pick apart sometimes the answer is to slice it with a big ass sword well you know sometimes you just got to cut to the chase that's right exactly just to kind of circle back to something we talked about with that witch's ladder do you feel that is there ever a time where is one not enough or do you think it has to be in kind of that 139 pattern what's your thought on the number of knots for magic I think that's going to depend on the witch and the situation for me I like 369 I like doing things in in patterns so three knots would probably be the minimum that I'd want to do and besides that charm is so much fun to say anyways you can make up your own they're pretty easy you know any number of rhyming schemes will work for you one is certainly fine you can definitely do a oneandone knot I mean if you're doing a freezer spell you want somebody away from you and you just do one quick knot and throw that in there that'll work just fine oh I got to tell you okay so I got a quick story shell okay I saw a video on one of my witch boards you ever see on all these different social media where people are like I found this outside and all the witches are like leave it don't touch that yeah yeah well I saw something where a diver had found it looked like a 2 L Mountain Dew bottle in a river which first of all people we're witches let's please not litter yes I understand getting rid of a spell but there's good ways and bad ways but anyways this diver opened up the 2 L bottle and inside were what look like knives bound and knotted with ropes oh yeah that looks like yeah oh oh and he Unbound them all oh oh so that's commitment dude right you know there's lots of different ways to do spells you can bind people with them you can you can bind situations with with them and then getting rid of it is certainly important but I don't know I think there's better ways than throwing it in the river I'm stuck on undoing someone else's magic I don't think the diver knew I mean definitely a muggle certainly had no idea what he was getting into and just thought he was like what is this I'm gonna check it out and then Unbound someone's everything wow yeah so a couple things one don't Litter if you're going to be putting things outside put it in a pumpkin shell if you're going to put it in the river or in the Earth put it in something that will be biodegradable that will return itself to the Earth safely and actually this is a good time of year to do that because there's lots of pumpkins and gourds that you can do that with yeah why use a plastic or a glass bottle especially if you don't ever want to see it again put it in a pumpkin throw it out in the in the woods another not spell I this is going to be kind of a spell heavy episode I guess but I love this I love this idea you know we talked about you and your hand bassing cord and un knotting that as as part of a ritual you could can also do this pretty easily for any ex-lover whether you have a hand fasting cord or not if you have one of their old shirts especially an old t-shirt but you can take Fabric and turn it into yarn like you start a little cut and then you just kind of tear it until it's like yarn thickness and you just keep yeah you can just keep cutting the whole thing and even a lot of times you can get one long strand of yarn oh wow if you don't know how to do this YouTube it it's pretty easy but yeah so make yarn out of the T-shirt like I said YouTube it it's easy and as you're making the yarn think about letting go of everything bad in that relationship as you're literally destroying this t-shirt destroy the relationship let it go get out whatever anger you have to you know your faults their faults everybody's faults get it out while you destroy this t-shirt be done be done then now you have this new thing this pile of yarn cleanse it consecrate it think about the Phoenix Rising From the Ashes think about making something new out of the old then take your yarn and crochet something knit something small tie a macra necklace tie a cord just braid it but while you're making those knots think about creating something new and beautiful and what you learned from that relationship that you're going to take into your new life without that person the new you the the lessons you learned the the strengths that you now have as you create this beautiful thing out of this old thing and then when you're done you either keep that as a reminder of what you have created or you burn that and release it and let it go but that is a fabulous way to use not magic to let go of a relationship that's actually beautiful I like that I like that thank you I made that up it's good right is it is good yeah so you can get very creative with not magic it's so simple and so easy to use and it's so applicable in a lot of different situations and I think you know one thing people get a little caught up with with stuff online you know everybody thinks oh I got to do it the way they did it on witch talk or I got to do it the way they do it on Instagram there's a lot of beautiful knots out there I've looked they're pretty I was looking at this one earlier today called the Celtic button I want to learn how to do that but like you can do a shoe tie knot and that is just as effective you do not need to be doing some crazy navy sealed type level knot here you can just do a simple shoot string knot your magic is going to be just as effective so don't let social media make you think that you've you've got to go on some not you know some not learning Mission it's a quick easy way and again I'm really actually instead of knots I'm really more of a fan of the braids I do love the braids myself it's a mean thing yeah I like crocheting too you know I used to always have that long long long hair so it was easier for me now that I've kind of shortened it up a little bit maybe not so many braids but I I am definitely parti to the braid magic I've always liked the the knotwork of making jewelry and the the hair wraps like I was the always the person doing the hair wraps for people you were you were I like to do the knots just like shell said keeping it simple is fine do what works for your intuition if you feel like you need to make a complex knot like look up a style of knot learn how to do it and do that knot specifically then do that there's power in that there's magic in the studiousness of learning that and then doing it exactly there's also power in you I'm tying this knot just once and you're done there is both of those work whatever whatever you need you're going to know so if it feels right to you that's what you need to do because your magical brain is different than Shell's magical brain which is different than my magical brain and the symbolism and the archetypes that work for each of us are very personal specific so find what works for you if you need a specific type of chord specific type of color that can help for some people's magical brains but not for others yeah I definitely got to learn that Celtic button because I think it's cool and it's calling to me there you go see that's exactly why you should learn it once you learn it you'll find some reason why you'll need that in a spell I bet and then and then just wait because everything that you see is gonna I'll be like hey Leila do you want this it's got a nice Celtic button on it that I just knotted up yeah and hey notwork is really pretty like I said I make jewelry so you can knot all sorts of cool things for people out of it so definitely knots can be used all sorts of different ways in your practice you should try it a couple different ways try braiding something try a simple knot try a complex knot look at some Celtic knots while you're meditating but you know see what works for you in your practice it's a very underrated uh use magical use and I think that you know people are doing it more often than they may realize again I was doing not magic and didn't even know it for years it's quick it's easy and super super effective highly underrated thank you so much for listening to
