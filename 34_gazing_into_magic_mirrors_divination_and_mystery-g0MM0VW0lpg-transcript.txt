welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and today we are going to talk about something that I actually think is fun you could twist it any way you want but I think it's fun mirror magic and I think it's a little freaky but very effective yeah but you got to think the first time you were exposed to mirror magic and and this is true for most people in our age group I believe um the first time you were you were exposed to mirror magic was in Disney Disney movies man mirror mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all oh yeah and let's not forget right after that then in our pre-teen years sleepovers what mirror magic did we do there oh Lord Bloody Mary oh I'm not even gonna say it nope nope nope I'm not gonna say it three times I'll say it once but I'm not gonna go looking in a mirror and saying it three times because the Gen X in me says hell no that's not something any of us will do nope no you know I'll do a lot of things and I'll call upon a lot of things but I ain't doing that thing I'm gonna say it again I ain't doing that thing because my pre-teen brain says hell no danger danger but you know mirror mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all we grew up with that as little girls right we knew mirrors were magic even then and the mirror would talk to her a face would appear and talk to her how would I not think mirrors are magical everyone thinks mirrors are magical right back into the Greek myth of Narcissus when he saw his reflection in the water and fell in love with himself I mean yeah what isn't magical about seeing your reflection being able to see yourself for the first time mirrors are inherently magical and freaky I do want to point out this little tidbit I came across that that involves mirrors what you got 1894 Finland okay okay height of the spiritualism time actually yeah it was um there was a CL a clairvoyant named armis sonen and he was given this nickname that basically meant mirror boy I'm not going to try to say the nickname because it's in Finnish and we all know I'm bad with pronunciations but it translates to mirror boy he claimed to see the future as well is past events by looking in the mirror um and this actually was kind of tied to a tradition in Finland because what they would do is they had um what was called New Year's mirror magic and in Finn Folk magic the New Year's tradition was to use a double mirror for looking for signs of your future spouse oh okay that's kind of cool spell yeah I mean that was like us as teenagers using Ouija boards to find out spouse sure so in Finland that that they would do that so he kind of took a Twist on that and was able to kind of see the future and past events most of his village thought it was positive but some people as you can imagine thought he was like a product of the devil as a child he had been lost in the woods for a few days and some people feel that he got the gifts of looking into the mirrors after his stint being lost in the woods so as you can imagine is with some folk things some people saw that as an evil thing some people thought saw it as a gift but he would come and he would he he was able actually to see his future spouse who did you know he saw this little girl in the mirror ended up becoming his wife but he also was utilized by the police to solve crimes oh he would also help and finding lost items one of his most famous cases using his mirrors was um in 1934 there was a merchant named Marta Sachs and it was like this famous murder case he actually was able to give a description of the murderer to the police through his mirror magic Wow and it was accurate they got him you know to spot on here we go mirag kind of like those modern day psychics who like to work with the police in some cases yeah yeah yeah but he was using it all through mirror magic I always thought it was really for scrying other than you know that we shall not mention from our teenage years yes mirrors are excellent for scrying because obviously you can see things in them and so if you use a mirror particularly one that has a surface that you can get lost in that's why people like crystal balls because you can't really see your reflection clearly you can see other things in it or an obsidian or a Black Mirror like in our newsletter we talk about how to make a black mirror that you can use the idea is to have a reflective surface that you can kind of soften your eyes soften your gaze let your subconscious and your magical self gaze into this but not necessarily looking at yourself right not looking at you specifically or an exact reflection of something you're supposed to let your intu and your magical mind go and and a a black reflective surface or crystal ball or something like that is much easier to do it in what I like to do is the Black Mirror um with the candle um and kind of focus in on that flame but you could just as easily not have the candle and just have had it right with just the flat surface I do remember one ritual at the land where our local Pagan Community would gather we had two large fields that were connected by a path through the woods along the river and we would often use that path as a transition from the mundane world into our magical and ritual space and so very often that path would be decorated with candles and different things different gateways very often to help you pass from the quote unquote real world into magical space and I do remember one particular ritual I think it was done multiple times where at one of the gates someone had a large shallow metal bowl that they had filled with water from the river and the moon shined right into the water of that bowl and you were supposed to stop and do some scrying in the water of that bowl and that is a a beautiful way to do scrying do you remember that ritual shell I do I do and I I remember stopping at that bowl and you know that was kind of a more personal experience we won't get into but it was very moving and you know just on the point of scrying it doesn't have to necessarily be a mirror like you just said it can be water I've even done it in a stream not even a confined container per se but you know crying in a stream any reflective surface yeah any reflective surface but with the mirrors I think what generally scares me with mirror magic is you see a reality that you might not otherwise see and it's right in your face and sometimes that reality is maybe Spirit activity I I have done some mirror work in the past and I haven't been the only face in the mirror you know yes and I think that's where the mysticism and the magic comes from mirors and why they freak me write the out because there is a reflection there that sometimes isn't always this reality sometimes it's reflecting the spirit world sometimes it's reflecting the future I think everybody is a little tripped out by mirrors at some point because they are such a strange view into the world it sometimes they feel more like doorways than reflective surfaces you know we've been touching on ancestor work here and there um and Rec T the season but I've actually done some really good ancestor work with mirrors because people show up and you just have a conversation but yeah when you're not the only one in the mirror yeah probably one of my most intense ancestor meditations came when I was doing a ritual using mirrors and I had one regular mirror up to reflect myself and to use as a portal which was probably the first dumb idea and then I had a then I had a Black Mirror set up you know how you can put two mirrors together so they reflect each other and make a chain going back I use that Black Mirror to then reflect myself back into history to reach back to touch ancestors you created a portal and a portal and a portal and a portal thankfully it was a very good controlled portal it was an excellent spell it very very powerful and very moving but I mean take two mirrors and have them reflect each other and and you'll feel something when you look in that you're going to feel creeped out you're going to feel magic you're going to feel you're going to feel those portals feel those doorways and you know I think with mirrors there's also a way you know you kind of can do your own internal work um the buzzword now is Shadow work but your own internal work whether that be Shadow or light work buzz word or not it's good to do right right it's almost like you're talking to your own soul you're having a conversation with your soul is opposed to I don't know talking in your head is one thing but when you're looking yourself in the mirror and having that conversation it's almost like you feel accountable yes and do you remember the old SNL skits with Jack Handy yeah yeah I'm awesome I'm beautiful and gosh darn it people like me I mean there's there was a whole movement at one time to talk to yourself in the mirror that can be as corny as those skits are that can be very powerful it's mirror magic yeah but there's also you know there there can also be that um that divination side with scrying and and such you know I love good divination tool I truly do you can do things to kind of get yourself in that meditative State whether you use regular mirrors black mirrors what have you such as the story from Finland you know you can use that to tap into that quote unquote psychic energy to see what is coming ahead or see what has come behind I would think if you were going to try to do divination on past events in my personal opinion I would use the Dual mirror and for future maybe just a singular mirror but I really love the Divination aspect of it but again um I have used it to do ancestor work because I don't know I have better conversations when I'm in front of people and can talk to people and I can see people and we're chatting and what's the difference if it's my best friend or my ancestors so I like that mirror aspect but then I get that whole bloody Miry thing going on I'm like because of that Bloody Mary thing and remind me I have a story to tell you one of the reasons why mirrors trip me out so much but I like to use them for scrying as well but I prefer the water in a bowl method for a couple reasons one because mirors are a little too freaky for me to use it for divination and two because I I like the surface that water particularly on a very dark Bowl gives and I also like to add herbs or stones to my water when I'm going to do divination I'm lucky enough that I have a very cool Stone table in my backyard that I can set up as an altar and so on a new moon or a dark moon particularly or a full moon depending on your intention pick a pick a phase of the moon you feeling the vibe go out banana moon man there you go take your bowl of water I like a very shallow dish with a dark bottom and I put some Moon water in it matching the phase opposite the phase again depends on your intention and the witch and then I'll put in some Rosemary some I love me some Rosemary but for clarity and to help for protection and some Bay and some uh maybe some blue lotus to help your divination to to focus your intent you can use whatever herbs you like maybe throw a crystal in there and because the bottom is dark and it's water you won't see them it's not going to disturb the surface so much and you can still use it for scrying so I kind of like that type of surface and and because I can add things to and because it's it's different than a mirror I also think there's an aspect of Glamour magic that can be done in mirrors oh absolutely we do it every day when we put our makeup on you know we're all talking self hopefully we're doing good selft talk while we're doing it which is a type of spell so if you're doing your makeup don't be talking negative about yourself you should be hyping yourself up because that's a type of Glamour magic right there and by the time you're done last look in that mirror you just be like damn you look good there you you go perfect love that spell one of my favorites but you know I mean there's just I I think they're Universal because you can use them for divination you can use them for Spirit work you can use them for spell work the other thing that I'm a fan of and I actually need to do this and have been remiss on this lately is I need to do some magic Protection work with my ears so there's there's a there's a protection and a binding aspect of mirror work that I want to touch on too when we were kids I'm rubber you're glue whatever you throw at me bounces off me and sticks on you that is like mirror magic in a nutshell okay the reflection spell right you know I'm not saying I want anything good or bad to happen to you either way all I'm saying is whatever you're putting out to me I would love for you to get back threefold and if that is good love and light then great and then if you're throwing me some and you get it back three times you're bad that has always been one of my favorite go-to spells may you get what you deserve basically whatever you're putting out in the world particularly in my direction you're going to get it back at least threefold have the day that Karma meant you to have that's o ouch for some people no that can be very good have the day that Karma meant you to have that's got nothing to do with me and my wishes that's got to do with you and your karma and the same thing with the mirror spell if you if you want to protect yourself one of the very positive ways is to throw up a ward is to put a ward around yourself and why not put a mirrored Ward around it so that like shelle said everything that people are sending at you gets bounced right back to them good or bad or indifferent and I want to just put out a quick little you know I know we've been Spell heavy but I want to put out one more quick little spell for folks you know I I I'm almost shaken at the amount of times I see people online thinking that they have you know they've been cursed or someone's doing negative spells against them or this or that if you feel for any reason I am not negating anything that you feel about being cursed if you feel that you are the best thing I can tell you is think of yourself being put in the center of a sphere of mirrors all the way around you and you are inside this little ball of mirrors anything being sent to you is just getting reflected back to sender Return to sender address unknown and and if that's positive then great if people are sending you positive love and energy then that's what they're going to get back but if people are sending you they're going to get back so get in your sphere of get in your sphere of mirror and if you want to protect yourself using mirrors and you you know maybe know that there's a few darker things being sent at you and you want to be a little bit more maybe forceful with your spell you can do a witch bottle or a witch jar that we've talked about before and instead of putting glass in there you can put broken shards of mirror because again that reflection and refraction will bounce the energy back around over and over and over in that jar and keep it trapped there so your tag lock that you put in that jar will direct the energy there instead of to you and then the mirrors will keep it trapped there but it was a little PSA please don't be a jerk and put your Bot your spell bottle in some inappropriate place that's going to kill the Earth we appreciate it thank you dispose of your spells properly I'm going back to that Mountain Dew bottle story you told and oh my goodness yeah I mean I just find that mirrors are a super Universal usage thing right down from your own personal magic to lift yourself up right down to Return to Sender magic just like with anything mirror magic it is exactly what it says it is it can reflect good it can reflect bad you can use a mirror to flash an SOS you can use a mirror to reflect the light and start a fire just like you can do that in the physical world you can do something similar in the magical world you can use that mirror to call to your ancestors send that SOS out to your ancestors you can use the mirror to light the fire of love you can use the mirror to burn down past things that no longer serve you so whatever you can use it for in the real world you have a spell equivalent even to at one time we protected shells apart whole entire apartment by creating a mirror image of it much like a taglock does in a spell jar we created a mirror image of it to direct the bad energy there and then mirrored all that bad energy back to the person so all sorts of different creative ways that you can use mirrors in your magic but definitely divination is is something that I I I I want to do more of I want to do more mirror divination work I think that's that might be my next venture so I think they can also be portals to I don't know what I actually agree with that to what I'm not sure and they always freak me out I am a grown ass adult and to this day a mirror in a darkened room gives me the heebie jeebies I feel the same way about mirrors that are against each other because I feel like that is creating that endless portal when they're mirrored against each other yes I think that as well mirrors that reflect each other definitely very trippy when I was a kid in my elementary school we had everybody had those bathrooms right the big bathrooms with all the Stalls and the big huge mirror behind the sinks right yep yep one of the many bathrooms in my school was haunted had bad energy something but every time I went into that one bathroom that was identical in every other way to all the other bathrooms bad vibes hated that bathroom and it was the mirror in particular that freaked me out the hallway you came into in the bathroom you couldn't see down the hallway in the mirror but you could see the opening of it and I just knew that there was something there well one day I was in this bathroom I come out of the stall and I'm trying not to look at the mirror and I go over to the sink and I wash my hands and I look up but my face isn't in the mirror I just see the sink and then the stall reflected behind me and I look over to that hallway and I see myself walk into the bathroom and then walk into a stall what for a second I was like in shock and then I heard the water running in the sink and I looked down and looked up again and my reflection was back in the mirror never happened again but it freaks me out to this day and I hated that bathroom hated that bathroom I would have never peed at school ever ever ever again never again I would have held it till I got home all through 12th grade I tried even harder after that to not have to go into that particular bathroom but mirrors to me are freaky and I'm pretty sure they're portals I I do think that I think they can be made into portals I don't know if I think that they're naturally portals I think they I agree with that portals absolutely when I when I go to to my aunt Susie's house I don't think her mirror is a portal but could I make a mirror a portal yeah I do I do think that yeah yeah any mirrors you get if you get an old mirror if you move into a house with mirrors it's always a good idea to cleanse them to clear them you can do that in all sorts of different ways and whenever you're doing protection magic and you're you're kind of cleansing and protecting your your home area you know people always say you know Sage your doorways Sage your windows people Sage your mirrors I mean like that is almost as important as a doorway like that is a doorway it literally a doorway yes I know there's a lot of cultures that after someone passes they cover all the windows and mirrors in the house yeah because it's a doorway it's a reflection it's a ref gate yeah they're closing that gate because yeah it is a gate it is a gateway just as I I do ancestor work well yeah like that's that's that's exactly yeah and now this time of year when the veil is thin this is when I think that I generally do do the most ancestor work with mirrors because it is so easy because it is a portal they definitely trip me out but they can be very very powerful Tools in your magical tool kit whether for divination whether for spellwork whether for ritual I mean we've had when we were talking to the guys our old coven mates John and Kevin we talked about old belain rituals and I gave up the secret that at one point you know digging the hole for the mapole to go in at the bottom of it we put a mirror and every woman would then peer down that deep hole and look at herself in the mirror and that was freaking powerful so powerful so sometimes mirrors can be beautiful I know that that our listeners can't see this right now and I'll definitely get a picture of this up on Instagram but I have this mirror that I've had oh gez I want to say it might have been my grandma's like it's got that like weird pearly crap on it kind of like not a pocket mirror per se but like a pocket like a compact like a large compact but the way this particular one like kind of folds into itself it folds into itself to be a double mirror to reflect within itself oh that's pretty and I have used this thing for so many different different things but this is the one that I like to use for ancestor work because it belonged to one of my deceased grandparents so you know it doesn't have to be some $200 mirror that you found on some magical website it could be your Grandma's old compact and it's like nothing fancy but yet I don't think I would want to do any ancestor chatting in any mirror other than this one you know what I mean that's a beautiful sentiment I love that and and on your point of it doesn't have to be fancy you can go get two cheap Dollar Store mirrors oh yeah write your spell on your bay leaf your parchment or whatever and then put it between those mirrors facing each other to amplify that energy right it doesn't have to be fancy it can be super cheap and again and then if you do that and you have a different mirror that you want to reflect you can always do the Return to Sender with the clothes tell me you did A Return to Sender with that mirror I did do a Return to Sender with that mirror oh good just a PSA everyone if you're ever given a mirror as a gift clean that before you use it absolutely but I I definitely think that if you haven't delved into the world of mirror magic it's it's worth you taking a look see because there's a lot of great things that can come of it but you need to have a little bit of a little bit of stones in you because there's also a little bit of freaky decky with it too yeah yeah I agree I am freaked out I tend to not do mirror magic very often when I do do it it's very powerful it's great but it's definitely not something I do on the daily because it it just freaks me out yeah I'm a little freaked out about your school bathroom story I'm not going to lie but I feel like I feel like for me mirror magic is a good go-to for ancestor work it channels to the Past for whatever reason mirrors do seem to be excellent channels to the past and to the Future for divination they just kind of seem to tap into that for a lot of people you're looking at that reflection of the past which is pretty much exactly what ancestor work is and some people think that capturing your reflection captures your soul or can capture part of your essence so every time you go past a mirror if that's part of your belief that that glass that mirror is holding part of your essence so that mirror that was your grandmother's has a little bit of her soul in it well and you know and I think that's what goes along with some of the Traditions that um of of covering mirrors after a death because what they're really doing is they're like kind of closing that door they're letting them pass on without having them reflect back into the present it's it's a Letting Go period it's it's kind of the closing of the door by shutting access off to that mirror to that portal yep and making sure that that Spirit doesn't stick around in any of those surfaces that they go where they're meant to go right that they move on absolutely definitely a freaky time of year for some mirror magic that's for
