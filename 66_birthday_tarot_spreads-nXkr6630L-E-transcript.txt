join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick and today I am super excited to say that we are doing tarot cards again because I love Tarot cards and it's my bestie's birthday happy birthday shell thank you you know every year it just gets better it really does and this year I knew we were going to do a Tarot episode so instead of doing the traditional birthday spreads you find online or what have you I have created a new birthday spread so in this episode not only are we going to talk about Shell's custom tarot spread for her birthday this year we're going to talk about why you might do tarot birthday spreads how to find your birthday number your tarot significator we have a lot in store for people today shell I'm excited so why don't we talk birthdays numbers and Tarot awesome so before we die in I'm Leila and I'm shelle the birthday girl the birthday girl Gemini I was going to sing you a happy birthday song but I am not going to subject our listeners to that so you're all welcome well I just want to point out that when this airs is on my actual birthday so you know not that I am asking for some love messages but feel free I'll be I'll ask for you send her some birthday love give her messages say happy birthday on our Instagram on our Facebook on our YouTube wherever you find this podcast right in my day people she needs a little cheering up so let's tell the birthday girl how much we appreciate her witchy fabulousness so I have a couple things for you shelle before we get into your tarot spread okay you've talked about birthday tarot spreads before I've talked about birthday tarot spreads and we like to do tarot readings on significant dates on New Year's on a birthday you know on the of the Year holidays or I have even I have even mentioned in a past episode that I don't like that January 1 plot out your year reading I think that is more of a birthday thing you know you you do your what does the next year have in store on your birthday as opposed to January 1 I do both I want to know all of the information I want to know my full year spread and my birthday year spread so yeah I'm a little tarot greedy that way well you know actually for me that might not be a bad idea if I started doing that because with my birthday being May 31st it might as well be June which is six months after the new year so it's almost like I'm at the halfway point where am I at now you know that's a great idea I I never thought of that sorry you know my birthday is so close to the beginning of the year and almost doesn't even make sense but I love that you see what I'm saying I'm like one day off of exactly six months that's pretty cool I didn't think of it that way all right put that in my notebook for next year now I know a lot of people are very familiar with a birthday tarot spread that I believe is in a circle with 12 cards to represent each of the 12 months and then a card in the center to represent like the unifying theme of the whole year I'm not sure who did it was it Ellen can and Reed I don't remember who did it but I do remember that spread and Ellen Canon Reed is the creator of my all-time favorite Tarot deck ever in life just saying yeah and I I apologize I'll see if I can find it and stick it in the show notes I'm not sure who made that particular spread but that was popular back in the day when we started doing tarot spreads everyone was like oh you have to do this birthday spread or or this year-long spread because you can do that 13 card spread at any point it doesn't have to be on your birthday it's just these dates sometimes hold a lot of emotional weight meing yeah so that can imbue your spell or your reading with a lot of power because the date itself has power to it so your birthday obviously your solar return has a ton of energy that you could use to fuel this reading and find out what your year has in store for you but you can do it anytime kind of like the cinnamon blow for your door you don't have to do it on the first if you don't do it right on your birthday it's okay right exactly so you can do this wheel of the Year spread and basically it's shuffle your cards and then lay them out in a Circ going clockwise I like to start at 1:00 and go around clockwise up till 12 and put one card for each number where do I start at 12 and honestly whatever floats your boat whatever works for you maybe you want to picture it like the numbers on a clock and pick the number that corresponds to your birth month if you did it on your birthday you could even pick the hour of your birth yeah instead of starting on the number that corresponds to your birth month or your birthday you could do it on your birth hour just like the I love that I didn't even think of that I mean you know I'm just pulling out of my ass here but what a good idea some of the most magical stuff comes from there right oh that just sounds awful birthday or not that's bad all right so now talk to me about birth numbers because I think we should talk about that before we talk about using them in spreads birth numbers are one of the very first things I learned from buckland's Big Blue Book love it I remember going through that book as a witchling and again very very Wiccan based but honestly I still think it is a phenomenal foundation for magic any magical practice even if you don't go the wiccan route it has such good foundational information there but one of the things that he talked about was how to determine your birth number and the way you do that wit even in witchcraft you can't get away from freaking math maam no you can't Jesus math is magical shell math is very magical it's scary that's true too but it's pretty easy to figure out so you take the twod digigit month of your birth the two digigit day and you know for our European friends swap that two-digit day two-digit month doesn't matter how you add those then you're also going to add the four digigit year all four people so you can also do your number for this year so take your birthday May 31st so for this year you would take 05 Plus 31 + 20 + 24 wait why are you doing why are you doing this year because you can also do your number for this year so you'll have your birth number and then every year you'll have a different number that's your number for that particular year if you don't like your birth number pick another well the birth number will always be your number but every year you'll have another number that will give you even more influence so you can go by both of those numbers all right so there's two different ways to do this the first way that I learned from Buckland is how to determine your birth number and it's very easy you take the two-digit day the two-digit month and the four-digit year of your birth and you just add every single number straight across as if it's a long number problem of addition if you come up with a multi-digit number then you keep adding down until you get one digit so for your birthday 5311 1975 you would add 0 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 7 + 5 and you come up with a number 31 so you simplify that down and you get the number four to find your tarot card birth number you do it slightly differently because you're going to end up with two numbers the first one is going to be a number 22 or lower and the second number is going to be the single digit that's the same as your birth number sounds confusing it's not really so the way you do that is you add it just slightly differently you still take 2digit day two-digit month and four-digit year but you break it up into chunks of two so for she would add 05 + 31 + 19 + 75 those numbers add up to30 so you take the first two numbers and then either the second single digit or two digits and add them together so a Shell's first two numbers are 13 and her second number is zero you add those together you get 13 so 13 is her first tarot card which is the death card and then you would add the one and the three together to get four which is her second tarot card the Emperor the second number will always equal your birth number Yik it's a lot easier when you write it down and start doing it I swear if that's too confusing there are a number of websites out there I'll put a link to one or two of them in the show notes where all you have to do is put in the day month and year of your birth and it'll calculate your two cards for you so that's how you find your birth cards in Tarot so you would be able to use either of those cars as your significator what would be my number for this year eight all right well to calculate the number for this year I'm going to save our listeners and myself a lot of pain and we're just GNA use the website so if I put in your month day and this year the calculator gives you 17 and yes eight so the star and strength are your cards for this year now there's a list out there of each astrological sign and what it corresponds to as far as tarot cards go so you could use that list as well to pick your special spread significators like Gemini according to this list and this is from benel W's website and has the correspondence of Gemini is for the lovers so the lovers card is what corresponds to Gemini so you could also use that as your significator and a significator is basically just a card that you pick to represent you to represent your energy and that's really what all these numbers are all this crappy math that we've been doing is really just a a magical way to pick a card that aligns with your energy and then every reading that you do if you start from that card will carry your energy through the reading and give you something much more personal to yourself now the spread I'm going to talk about that I kind of made up here I use the emperor because I always thought that four was kind of like my birth card my birth number and it is four is your birth number yes so I go with the emperor for my significator is my card but I kind of like using the lovers for Gemini that's a good twist ah do you know that we have the exact same two cards 13 and four really even though we were born on different days different months and different years my numbers are also 13 and four are you me I am not I am not see and you know what that is why we were meant to be BFFs that's exactly right so 13 and four are also my cards according to my birth number but I'm an aquarius so my astrological card is the star and my card for this year is let's see so mine are 11 and two wait what is what is the Aquarius card the star I'll list them all I'll also put this list on our website as well but I'll go through them very quickly Aries is the Emperor Taurus is the hierophant Gemini the lovers cancer The Chariot Leo strength Virgo The Hermit Libra Justice Scorpio death Sagittarius Temperance Capricorn the devil Aquarius the star and Pisces the moon these are all the astrological correspondences and again I I'll put betabel W's list up on our website here's an idea you could use your Sun Moon and Rising Associated cards is three significators yes you could absolutely pick according to whatever wherever in your chart you want and that could really narrow That Into You you know you could use your sun your moon your rising and your birth number card and really make that tuned up to you now here's a side note we're talking about significator cards but I know generally I don't use them I kind of reserved for special occasions kind of thing with me I used to but if you're not into it you know the the readings we talk about today or any other you can just ditch that whole significator part because yeah usually I do when I first learned tarot many many moons ago I learned the Celtic cross and I was told you must choose a significator you had to yeah I was told that too I was told it was super important like I don't know you're gonna unleash the Demons of Hell or something if you didn't pick a significator you know it's kind of like using a Ouija board without a circle I don't know yeah and and then I met you and we both questioned it and we're like  it we're doing it our way we gradually just stopped doing it we were doing tarot readings for each other and for other people and honary it didn't feel necessary in Magic that's going to happen if you're doing something and it just doesn't work it doesn't feel right don't do it anymore you know if there's like a huge reason for it obviously research it but that's kind of like the whole tarot thing where you must be gifted your Tarot deck no that that's that's pretty new actually but you know it doesn't work for you if it doesn't resonate just leave it alone now I want to talk about my birthday tarot spread now I am not going to discuss the cards I pulled that's just for me but you know like you said you could do a round circular 12 month thing you know you can do any one of these you find on Tik Tok or Facebook but I've come up with a an interesting birthday spread it actually involves putting out cards in the shape of the number you are turning unfortunately to use my example to explain this I'm going to have to divulge how old I am turning but you know whatever here we are so I have done a spread in the shape of a four and a nine I'm going to be 49 you might say to yourself well what order are you laying down these cards first and foremost when you're laying them down and I've done this two ways now I did a four and a nine separate and I laid down the cards in order as if I was handwriting it and that would be my suggestion if you use the spread at home lay out the cards in order as if you were writing the the number but then you gave me a good idea turn it into a Sigil yeah so I reversed the nine and have the four and the nine sharing that leg and made my 49 spread really a 49 sigil after you had laid those cards out and you showed me the spread I felt chills like it's perfect I love the tarot sigil spread it looked like it worked really well so I have my significator as my birth card uh number four and then I did like I said a four and a nine which I will post pictures I'm not going to post pictures of my actual spread but I will lay out a spread and show you and no matter how old you are going to be I think this works I kind of do it in a you know just as you would a new year spread what does this year bring you know where am I headed what is on the horizon and same as writing it and laying them down kind of read it in the same pattern as you would write it I really like the idea of turning the number into a Sigil like not just I mean okay say you're turning 36 and you know you do a big three and a big six that's a lot of cards and that's okay you know that could be great but I also like the idea of playing around before you lay the cards out and put that three and the six on a piece of paper and start messing with it until you get a Sigil made out of those numbers that maybe only has nine cards like the three plus the six nine cards total in it you know find some way to magically and mathematically relate those things and then make a Sigil out of it and do the reading in the form of that sigil and that's going to be very very powerful and have a lot of meaning for you personally well you know I I I showed you the spread and it did seem like a lot of cards but I look at it as maybe I got a big message this year exactly yeah and the traditional one is 13 cards anyway so I figure as long as you're keeping it under 20 you're probably good yeah yeah and you know maybe one year you're not going to have as as big of a message as maybe the next right I I kind of look at the significator is the kickoff and the ending you know like what does this mean with the significator card but it kind of also wraps it up at the end I feel too yeah and I love a significator in this case like we were just saying that we don't really use them anymore except for special occasions this is really a time when you want it you know right right just shuffling the cards and reading them that's one thing but if you purposefully pick a card to represent you and your next year of your life from your birth date forward that's powerful and I think that adds a whole another layer to the reading well and that is why I liked your idea of well actually kind of sparked it was kind of my idea but whoever it doesn't matter we'll both take credit us together we're a good team using not only my birth number but the Gemini card and my moon in my rising card which would be the star in Temperance so that would be almost like shell what your cards for this year your numbers are 17 and eight and that's the star and strength well star is Aquarius and Aquarius is me isn't that your Rising your moon Aquarius is your moon right my Rising is Sagittarius which is temperance okay use all four you know my my Gemini my moon my rising and my number my birth number and have kind you know what I mean exactly you can do anything now in a spread like this in a Sigil spread like this each position doesn't necessarily have a specific meaning but together this is supposed to be read more intuitively you know especially if you've created the sigil ahead of time once you start putting these cards down as a reader you should start to see a pattern you should start to see a story unfold there'll be major themes that will run through it that you'll be able to pick out I'm going to tell you to journal it of course take a picture and write down all your impressions write it all down this would be a good one for a Tarot Journal you should this is this is a ritual and a spell in and of itself you should write it all down keep it digital write it handwritten take pictures of it if I'm not opposed to taking pictures of readings I know some people don't like to but whatever I think it's fine I usually do and send them to you H yeah I think that's always acceptable but definitely cool to keep it for yourself as well so that you can look back on it but then once you've done your whole this is how I feel about it these are the feelings and the ideas and the thoughts that are coming to me this is what my intuition is saying these are what my guides have to say then get the book out right get the book for that specific deck get your favorite book of correspondences get more than one book I don't care and then write down what the book says to go along with it because especially when you're reading for yourself or someone you know really well man you have a lot of layers in front of you you have rose-colored glasses or smoke colored glasses or you know kind of like how you and I are bad at reading for each other because yeah we don't want to hurt each other's feelings or yeah or sometimes I'll already know something and I'll say well hey shelle I know you told me you're going to the Thousand Islands next weekend but I see a trip near water coming up so I don't know if I'm seeing that because I already knew you were doing it or because it's in the cards we know too much that's right so sometimes you have to put those disclaimers out there but when you're doing it for yourself especially then you're going to want an impartial person on the other side an impartial book to tell you what you may have missed or what you may have colored differently balance out your intuition because there's going to be a lot of preconceived ideas and hopes and dreams and fears in there too so the book being neutral ground is going to be good for you and for your reading I mean and if you don't have a book handy or though you know I'm getting to an age that who can read those who who has who has the eyesight for those things Google that card we did just turn 49 like you told everybody so maybe it's time for glasses geez Louise but you know what that just means next year party of the century that's right we got big trip planned for your 50th man so Travel Channel call us right for real get yourself a Tarot deck for your birthday shell does she gets a couple you know I I feel like the whole month of May I get one like every week oh I love it that's wonderful and then my kids they get me one for Mother's Day and my birthday yeah May big tarot month for me it's like your tarot month I I do have I do have a recommendation for your number sigil spread and that is 49 is AIG big number people it really is it's not like I'm 10 I ended up using a mini deck is it regular playing card size or smaller a little smaller actually I did the tarot of pig and cats for my birthday spread so cute because it's smaller the read didn't seem so huge you know what I mean yeah so yeah like if space is an issue get yourself a little pocket deck those are super cute I love those come in all different sizes from huge to teeny tiny I have huge and I have teeny tiny you could do things like add up your age and just do that many cards you could do as many cards as you are old though some of those can get really big I am a self-confessed anti- Oracle person except for the very very few that I I do like can you give any suggestions about using an oracle deck for a birthday spread or would you kind of say maybe the same thing put it in a similar spread style but just read them more in the Oracle context yeah I think I would do a little cardany there so make your birthday sigil and then lay the oracle cards out exactly the same way I also like Magpie decks or Frankenstein decks for this if you have those or if there's a specific maybe I should explain what those are a magpie deck or Frankenstein deck is a deck where you have taken cards from multiple different decks and put them together either to create a 78 card traditional deck or one that has a lot more or a lot fewer cards I've also seen some people who will create a 78 card deck that's all the Star card from 78 different tarot decks so you could do something like that maybe there's a certain energy that you want to bring in for your year maybe you're looking for love so you would choose a whole bunch of Cups cards and Pentacle cards for ility and everything that says love and relationship to you and just do your reading using those cards there's no rules with a magpie deck you can do it any way that you want or you can do Oracle deck Magpie deck or Tarot deck and again you're not reading specific positions you're more reading the cards as a whole as a story as a an intuitive reading for your year now I I am going to put an offer out there and I did not discuss this with you prior and you are going to be just as surprised as the listeners yay what is it what is it what is it okay because it is my birthday and I am

is gonna message us because her and I are birthday besties oh well happy birthday Brook Shields dang right there are lots of different birthday tarot spreads that you can do not just the circle one not just our sigil spread I mean if you're if you're comfortable with a Celtic cross do the freaking Celtic cross on your birthday like nobody gives a if you're doing that or my spread or the circle spread or anybody's whatever works for you that's the spread you do just pull two cards I mean you can do anything it doesn't have to be some special sigil spread you can just do one or two cards I've seen a seven card spread it's really nice just in the shape of like a a crescent moon three cards Rising the top card and then three cards descending sometimes I think about you know whatever my question is or or what my what my what what is the point of my reading and sometimes I just lay down cards until it feels right to stop for those of you who saw our beautiful B tarot post on the Instagram and Facebook I had done a spread for that and for some reason I just felt like three cards on top three cards on bottom I don't know sometimes I just lay down cards until I feel like stopping and that's okay too right it doesn't have to be a traditional spread the traditional spreads have the benefit of the weight of history of a lot of people who have used them they've been worked on they're tried and true you know people know that it works and maybe each position has its own significant meaning you know what I mean there's nothing saying that you can't just pick cards until you feel like you're done and then read them as they come or read what you have there like shell said sometimes those positions have weight to them yeah the weight of magic of synergy they work together really well in those positions the Celtic cross has been read I don't know for freaking ever right longer than Shell's been alive that's for sure hey now hey now hey now hey it's older I'm saying it's older than you there's not a lot of things but at least that spread is older than you just remember it ain't gray hair it's glitter hair glitter hair people so you can do anything that you want really I really like our sigil reading mostly because we've tied in so many different things to tie it into your energy to bring it back to you every single time it's your age it's your significators it's your sigil that you created the more personal you make this the better it's going to work for you and the better reading that you're going to get you know maybe some people celebrate their birthday month I've done it on occasion it's fun to just have every day be your birthday my daughter literally thinks her birthday is 31 days long and whose fault is that Mom right her father her father that's right she deserves it though she's wonderful right but you could do a one or two card draw every single day of your birthday month you know pull your significator or not you yourself are your significator so you don't need a card to do that which good definitely Journal them because this is something going to want to look back on as you go through the year as you move through this solar return you're going to want to take a look at that reading that you did on or about on your birthday and see what uh how it's holding up see if the year has really gone that way and there's so much fun I have a ton of them particularly for New Year's readings going back you know quite a few years and it's really great not just that year but years and years later to look back at those readings and see where you were at and you know what worked what didn't work well and you know I liked what you said about doing a card a day for for the whole month because that would be a good way to kind of journal and plot that out my birth month 31 days I could pull 31 cards and make that 31 cards kind of my story and just do it one card a day and then look back at all the cards together and see what kind of story it's telling you right right the cards are really here for you they're here for your subconscious they're here for you to get inou with your magic with your center with your intuition the more you make it your own I think the better the message absolutely and I know I keep harping on journaling but the more you keep track of it the better you're going to get at it I call it note taking hey whatever works if you're writing it down taking pictures of it putting it in a Notes app on your phone as long as you have it to refer back to with your feelings and ideas it's going to help you grow as a reader I got sucked into tarot journaling and you know why the freaking stickers they got me with the damn stickers like come on you might as well make me meditate who doesn't love a good sticker especially tarot card stickers I know so yeah if you ever doubt journaling tarot get stickers you know as far as when I talked about using your son your moon and your Rising as significators yeah what kind of that view can be is your son which for me would be Gemini is kind of what you show other people and my moon which is Aquarius who you want to be and my Rising uh which is Sagittarius who you want other people to think you are there sometimes what other people think and what you think are two different things and I'm not saying one is better or worse than the other but they are two realities we all must live with so if you used your sun your moon and your Rising you can kind of use those significators is like almost like the different aspects of who you are you know what I mean you know who Who Am I who do I think I am and who do I want to be that's so true wow you know what what other people think about you could be the who I think I am you know who are you who do you think you are and who do you want to be and that could be how your sun your moon and your Rising are uh represented as significators you know what I'm saying right I also like once you've laid those significators Down based on your astrological major Arcana cards to then Shuffle the deck ask who Am I who do I want to be and who do I think I am and Shuffle those cards and then lay a card on top of each of those significators and see what the lesson is for that part of you oo I like that right so then you get the lesson for each of those aspects of your personality and F this is how a podcast is born when Lea and I get together right we're so good together damn we are but yeah so as a reminder if you are a Gemini email us back on the broomstick gmail.com give us
