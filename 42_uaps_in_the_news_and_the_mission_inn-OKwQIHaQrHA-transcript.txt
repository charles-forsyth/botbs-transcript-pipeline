it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 42 of the stoned Witches Hour 42 that's like the meaning of life man that's right life the universe and everything and it's 4:20 a.m. our favorite time to get high and downright witchy and tell spooky spooky stories to each other while smoking copious amounts of cannabis so yeah here we are at episode 42 of the stoned Witches Hour and this evening telling creepy Tales out of California I'm your host Leila and I'm high and I'm really getting into this meaning of life 42 thing and I'm shell I'm high this evening too I'm smoking some up up up weed looked it up and it's like 32% THC or something it's called Wedding cheesecake o so yeah Aly my lovely husband surprised me with this because we have so much going on this week it's just a super super busy week and so he surprised me with a little bit of extra weed I have a lot of harvesting going on so we're busy over here well you know it's so funny this must be like the week of opposites oh so listen to this you're going to love this you know I don't grow I can't grow anything cats and kids that's all I can keep alive you have a brown thumb when it comes to plants I do I do but I uh have someone I'm related to that has a super green thumb so I had gotten you know how on occasion in your store bought weed every here and there and now and again you'll find a rando seed yeah so that had been happening to me for a little bit you've been a seed saver since I've known you oh my God i' I am like the Armageddon queen of weed seed saving I probably have strains from 20 years ago that aren't even findable right now and I have a seed of it in a jar somewhere I have tried to get you to contact some of the bigger breeders because of that seed stash people look for these old seeds all the time and you have probably so many genetics just sitting on a shelf I do they do so anyway so a few months back so I had gotten some of my good Happy Valley weed that had some seeds in it and I had saved them in a little jar and then had had passed them seeds on to this family member and they said that they'd grow them and give us like half of what came about of it so who knows what it is it might have been it might have been wedding cake or it might have been gorilla glue or it might have been endgame is really kind of all I can a mixed bag oh and grape diamonds I think I had some seeds of so it might have been that too nice anyway long story short it's been a few months and all of a sudden this family member shows up at my house the other day and it's like oh yeah hey here here's your ounce from that plant I'm like oh my God I forgot about that thanks nice so I didn't homeg grow it but I offered up the seeds so I guess I'm a CO I don't know if that makes me a co- grower kind of you're like a grow sponsor not really I didn't put any water on it you're like the producer of The Grow I guess you're like the like the director the grow director not really I guess you're like the you're like the investor you're like the grow sponsor yeah grow sponsor there you go more like the sponsor I love it so so I don't know what it is I don't know what the THC content of it is it is a little Airy because it's homegrown I mean it's not trimmed like store bot I'm not complaining don't anybody think I'm a complainer but it's it's very crystally and it's got like those ready orange hairs on it so it it it's pretty and it gets you high and you know hey it's free my favorite price that sounds perfect so I don't know what I'm smoking but I love it and I'm high and I'm good hey that's all that really counts right and I love that there's a difference in trimming you can definitely tell homegrown weed because we tend to leave on a lot of the sugar leaves that don't look as pretty you'll get everything from people who trim super tight just like store bought to people like my dad like I just recently smoked a whole bunch of of uh I cured because I don't trust him to cure it but I cured some of my dad's weed and it is really really Shaggy he even leaves on some of what I would call like fan leaves that have almost no THC zero crystals so he's kind of on the Other Extreme end where he leaves on what I would consider too much I'd say this was probably 80% trimmed yeah yeah so most most Growers will fall kind of somewhere in that middle ground where they'll leave on some portion of these sugar leaves depending on their personal tolerance I will still crumble off a lot of those sugar leaves because I just don't particularly like the taste of super leafy weed even if it has a lot of crystals on it so I kind of fall towards the a little bit cleaner but yeah you'll find people that fall into that range somewhere as Growers well and I also think it's a patience thing or like OCD thing like you're super OCD that shit's going to be high and tight but you know if if if you're just kind of you're like me you're just like me good enough I'll just smoke what's left no harm no foul or if you're like me by the time you get to plant six you are so overt trimming there's an awful lot of leaf left on those but you know then you if you get really really high you can kind of get in an OCD mode and be like Chim CH Chim Chim see what you need to do is you need to get me really really [ __ ] up with a good pair of SC and just let me loose oh when you come out you know if I can really get you out here in the spring I'm going to have you trimming like mad I have a beautiful set of scissors they're curved they're golden they're beautiful and they're set aside just for you they have to be curved that's I don't know why but it's it's a thing oh I know my shell gets the good scissors I'm not giving you any cheap ass scissors I'll give you the good curved ones you got it but I I mean you have to do it right I definitely roll a buch joints ahead of time because they're just easier to smoke while you're trimming plus I like joints and make sure to have your tools there I have alcohol and paper towels and lots of scissors so that I can wipe them down make sure to save your scissor hash it's one of the joys if there are any of trimming and yeah got to have good music hopefully good friends some good podcast maybe you just got to go into it knowing that the only way out is through and you just have to make the best of your time while you're there I just think it's really funny that we're like total opposite I'm I'm smoking this like mystery homegrown and you've got like this 32 point something and I'm like whoa right I'm over here high as a kite on this fabulous wedding cheesecake I picked it because it had three of my favorite things in it anything that says wedding anything that says cheese and anything that says cake is usually right up my alley this one had all three words right in so I guess I am you holy [ __ ] did I picked it based on the name and the fact that it had 32 something per th well recently recently when I was at the weed store I had to buy something and I and my sweet darling love was like well why you picking that I'm like because there's cheese in the name and Lea always says buy cheese it's good it's good I mean sometimes it tastes a little cheesy but it's usually really really good yeah yeah my mystery weed it's really good I will say though and I I don't know if I've exper experienced this in a while this is like a 90s side effect of weed kind of dry mouth oh okay there are I feel like I'm very thirsty on this weed like I am I am ripping through you know I love iced tea I am ripping through tea like nobody's business on this stuff I'm not sure if there's a correlation on I don't know that whether it's a sativa and indicia high THC low THC I don't know but this is like this is dry mouth weed dry mouth weed I love it cotton mouth is not my favorite thing but you know at least you've got some good stuff there to drink it's just weird how sometimes some weed is like that and some weed doesn't give you that effect you know what I mean right yeah I guess it it just depends on how it reacts with you it probably indicates that it's a higher THC that's the only thing I I can find about that I'm still Ling it yeah that's great you know honestly like it gives me back in the day Vibes too because I didn't used to know really what I was growing I grew a lot of bag seed a lot of clones from friends and we just called it ganja whatever you know it was Green Goddess or it was Green Crack or this is Mother Earth weed and we said okay how are we supposed to know we had no clue we were talking [ __ ] nobody knows I think it's really really funny I'll see post all the time someone will ask me they'll say hey what strain is this and they'll send a picture of the plant or or the bud and I'm like uh that is Cannabis sativa Northern that's the Wonder Woman strain right there right that's right or whatever you know cuz you can't tell by looking at it there's nowh 98% THC there you go you hit the jackpot with that one that's yuk gold I did want to Circle back to our last couple of podcasts and I wanted to point something out on a witchy note what's that I'm diverting from weed to witchy right now oh I love it okay transition we're we're transitioning funny because we're in that transitional point of the Year hahaa T nice did you realize there's this like big insurgence of people into witchcraft into witchcraft absolutely I love it there was an insurgence I'd say what early to mid 90s and then here we are again good stuff welcome everybody we have cookies I wanted to point something out that I've been reading some debates on um online I have not participated in said debates but I've been reading about them oh tell me I'm interested sin yes so sin Halloween and sin are not the same thing which we are all intelligent folk enough to know that I mean they have a few similarities they do and I would say that Halloween is derived from s but it Roots it certainly doesn't have the ancestral connotation at all correct modernday Halloween is not the same no not at all when you really look at it it's based on like some astrological stuff oh okay like 90 days what is it 90 days from the Autumn Equinox is that right 90 days from the Autumn Equinox is the winter solstice and then you subtract from that like 45 days and then that's sin so long story short s is actually November 6 this year I've heard that that it is it does kind of it's one of those floating things which made me laugh because I'm reading these these people are debating it they're like absolutely not sound is on October 31st no matter what and I'm thinking back to our days in our old Pagan Community back in Upstate New York and if October 31st was on a Wednesday folks we were still doing that stuff on Saturday you're exactly right I mean now not that we were necessarily following that astrological calendar at all we were more weekend folk but there's so many new new Baby witches out there that think it's so rock solid that all of these holidays are set in stone on a day well I'm gonna blow everybody's mind blow our mind blow my mind the calendar that we use right now was not in place when these people were celebrating the solstice there was no such thing as October 31st to the Kels mic drop that date this calendar is completely made up and it has been revised many times over the centuries October 31st is Halloween right right trick or treating November 1 is All Saints Day sin we do traditionally colloquially celebrate on October 31st it's easy that way but it's really kind like a floating holiday exactly much like the solstice is on or about the 21st it's the 20th 21st 22nd that kind of thing the same goes for this type of holiday the true actual day that the Kelts would have celebrated as Sin would have been calculated by whoever did that in the village and kept track of time they would have done it by their Harvest by the seasons and by the Stars not by by the the Gregorian calendar that freaking Julius Caesar helped in and for all of our southern hemisphere friends first of all shout out love you but also same goes for belaine folks like this hard and fast May 1 uh May 1 for us here in the northern hemisphere no no right right I mean do we celebrate that traditionally kind of like having President's Day on a Monday yes yes we do it like that because it's easy but if you really want to celebrate having November 6th as the as the date this year when it is celestially and historically s like I said it's not like the veil slams shut people right whole time of year the the veil is very thin and it will kind of gradually thicken as the season wears on but you know celestially November 6 is sa but I just kind of wanted to just touch on that because there's been a lot of online debates lately um basically since the quote unquote Halloween night and I found it interesting enough that I wanted to mention because I know we have a lot of of witch type folks Pagan type folks um Wiccan type folks that listen and follow so I just wanted to point out that that perspective folks if you want to celebrate it on October 31 rock on with your bad self but celestially if you want to celebrate it on November 6th rock on with with your bad self and if you celebrate it at any time between there that's fine too much like many Traditions recognize that the new in the full moon you have what is it the three days you know is it three days before and three days after or three days around the full moon there's so many different ways to do it they the energy is still there do I feel like it's like that sound vibe from like October 1st until like Thanksgiving I agree I completely agree like you still got that Vibe for like that whole almost two months you're still gleaning those last little bits I just got some sunflowers out of my garden you know just the other day you're you're still getting those last little things out of that last Harvest it's it's not exactly over things are still dying and going back into the Earth and I don't know about California but right now in the in the Northeast we're going through some like crazy ass Indian summer stuff like 75 degree weather like I love it but it's so weird but it's beautiful with the leaves like the blanket of golden leaves on the ground but like you can still wear a tank top and shorts the weather in California and the weather on the East Coast now is almost identical you know you guys get a little colder at night I think but other than that we've been having almost exactly the same weather right now which is so strange to me but such a lovely time of year to kind of be starting that going within process and I I love that we've been given a little bit of reprieve but at the same time it It's haunting because it's probably global warming so I don't know how I feel about all of it it's just a little bit of a it's a strange Lial in between space but you know it's still there's something about the nighttime this time of year and even with the warm days we're having right now our our quote unquote Indian summer days you're still getting that Eerie crisp the leaves are crackling almost where you think that there's someone walking watching you in the dark it's almost just it's just creepier at night this time of year and I don't know what it is and I love it I love it I agree the full moon blood mooner blood lunar eclipse it'll be at 5:06 a.m. between the 7th and the 8th which is what wow Monday to Tuesday lunar eclipse and it's visible in North America oh wow okay so this episode is actually filmed or was actually recorded prior to the full moon but it comes out the day after the full moon and as you just mentioned there's an a lunar eclipse on the full moon we haven't actually experienced it yet but I'll be doing something that night but while I was doing my research on the mission in I discovered a story in the same area it was called the Riverside Bridge monster the mission in is in Riverside California the Riverside Bridge monster was reported by a man named Charles Wetzel he said on the the bridge north of the 60 Freeway near the 215 and 91 interchange I know where that is I'll show you when you come out this man said he encountered a quote green scaly pumpkin headed monster with long thin arms and Claws that came out of the brush and clawed his windshield oh my God I love it yeah he said that he'd run the creature down and police said that there were scratches and green smears on the car and this happened November 8th 1958 it's like like the like the pumpkin head crypted right but the date that was probably actually that was probably astrological s that year just saying that's possible we could look it up I just happened upon this crypted story that happened on November 8th 1958 the full moon is November 8th and it's a total Eclipse so I don't know let me ask you something did you ever see did did you oh I know you didn't you didn't totally investigate this story but I have to know do you know if there was ever another sighting of this pumpkin guy after 1958 yes Riverside Police were given a second report by a different driver the next night on November 8th that they saw a very similar creature and then in the 1970s people saw odd tracks um large strange tracks near the bridge oh but then once the river dried up uh no more sightings were reported oh my God it makes me want to go just put a lot of water there and see if it comes back right see if it like Springs from the rivered right right but I will tell you that on November 8th I will go to that intersection oh yes on the blood on the blood moon on the lunar eclipse oh my God on the same date 50 some odd you know 55 57 years later take theboard we made I'll take our homemade Ouija board intersection absolutely see if I can find that pumpkin head crypted so that's just my little side note for November eth in the full moon oh my God I love it wild right but yeah I think it's gonna be it's like one of those like lunar eclips it's it's only the second and well the last total lunar eclipse of 2020 2 and thankfully we can see it here in North America and our friends in Australia can see it and a lot of our friends in Asia will be able to see it wow and this episode will come out right after that happens so let us know did you do anything did you do any rituals for this event did you see anything did anything creepy happen you know so I kind of touched on Halloween and and sin and that led me to a story okay now I don't have a lot of like personal stories or or or stories to touch on but we're going to talk about UFOs for a minute ironically to coincide with Halloween um the government had released some UFO reports oh really yeah I heard a few hints of that but I I don't I didn't delve into it I've been pretty busy I was a little busy but I was also a little no you know I believe in in extraterrestrials so I I delved into some of this and I found some interesting stuff now I I fell upon a story from this man he was a former Air Force fighter pilot who is now a commercial pilot so I mean the guy's got experience is the point he just some Jo blow he's been in the sky yeah he's he didn't just get his pilot's license here he's got experience so this guy's baffled and I watched this YouTube video um I didn't catch his name but if you if you Google it you'll find this guy's interview on YouTube in the last seven months and you figure seven months isn't a lot of time in the whole Grand sche of the history of time in the last seven months there has been in the Skies over anywhere from Missouri to above the Pacific Ocean so I mean we're not even talking like a small little SW land here that's quite a large area and know it encompasses your territory but I don't care he has seen at least at least eight UFOs what just in seven months between the Missouri and above the Pacific Ocean what here's the weird thing you know so we were talking about astrological stuff with sin yeah it seems more frequent or at least noticed more by him that these sightings are happening pretty much always at the bottom right below the Big Dipper like I don't know what that means oh whoa so every one of these UFOs he has seen has either been at the bottom or slightly below the big di the Big Dipper Ur a Maj single one every single one of the eight ones he's seen URS a major that points to the North Star I'm just telling you what the report says from the guy I'm just saying but yeah I don't know what the coincidence is with it with this this this gentleman always seeing it right below the Big Dipper but it's odd to me like okay so you see a UFO to the North and then to the South you know but like you're all you are consistently seeing them basically in the same location right right it's got to mean something I'm sure our UFO followers will know you guys tell us like what is the significance of Ursa Major what's the significance of the Big Dipper well I'm just wondering if one of their planets is one of those one of the plan in the Big Dipper could be their home planet I I'm not I don't know there's got to be like what solar system is out there like you said is is that they're planted are they coming from that direction like what's the connection and this guy you know between being the Air Force fighter pilot and being a commercial pilot you know he's got some experience up in the air and right he's not just some random person who's like oh hey I saw a flying object in this guy he's someone who knows what he's looking at in in the guys what he is seeing in the movements they are making he says it is 100% impossible for it to be planes Jets satellites or things of that nature like the guy's not dumb when it comes to what's up in space and what's around there like space garbage and all that satellites and he says it's absolutely 110% imposs possible for it to not be either he said it he wasn't sure if it was being run by AI or biological but essentially aliens aliens aliens aliens whether they're AI or biological in my opinion damn damn so that's wild they also had a recording part of this YouTube video interview with this guy was he had a very close encounter above La one night La seems to be a hot spot you know there was that whole battle over La that we talked about so they have a they have a audio recording of from his cockpit of him basically calling air traffic control being like what the [ __ ] and they're like and you know what the girl says uh literally she stuttered she goes uh uh uh all we can tell you is there's no military craft in the area wow no way but like crazy that's wild I did just see um a video of someone recording out their plane window as they were flying and they saw a formation of those Tic Tac flying things I'm not 100% sure if it wasn't stuff on her window but it definitely looked like a formation of those Tic Tac things kind of flying not too far off the wing of her commercial airplane just a regular old passenger plane oh really yeah and and she has a a video I don't remember exactly it might have been a Reddit board where I saw the link it's probably on YouTube actually the YouTube video that I found the interview that I found um with with the pilot was actually an interview that was broadcast on The Today Show American morning talk show type show um so this was actually uh put on a talk show and like on the Morning News yeah yeah the Today Show so I will actually um get Leila the link so that she can post it for you guys because it is it's it's very interesting because you know the government can say whatever but these Pilots these these folks up in the skies why would they lie what are they gaining exactly one interview one interview on TV like is that really like you're not getting rich off one interview what are they gaining and these are people who have been in the guys for a very long time they've been flying back and forth for military for commercial you know for passenger flights for all of these different things they they know what they're seeing in the sky they're not unfamiliar with this right so when they're saying something is unusual and different that's when I really start to pay attention because you know like I said these men and women know what they're talking about and they know what they're looking at and they're creeped out that makes me creeped out and that's the thing you know I mean if if if the people people up there are in a panic when they're seeing it what the hell do you expect me to do I am going to panic okay because I think it is is is very naive of us to think that we're the only ones but oh I agree some interesting points that I would like to just just point out about some of these you know like I said some of these reports are coming out ironically coinciding with Halloween don't know why yeah this is a very interesting Eerie time of year but out of these 366 classified reports that they have now made unclassified 150 of them are still unexplained UFO encounters you know they're they're trying to say you know some wait wait wait how many reports out of 300 366 366 reports almost half of them yeah 150 wow because some of them can be some of them can be explained away as Chinese drones um or as like space junk space garbage or satellites um but there's still 150 that even the government cannot explain cannot explain and like there's some F-18 Pilots that come across these objects hovering above the sea like I still wonder there was a movie and I don't even remember what it was but I still wonder if there's the Poss possibility that there's like some alien freaking city under the ocean somewhere oh I've often wondered if that wasn't an explanation for Atlantis these F-18 Pilots they're they're highly trained individuals they're not crackpots just flying around and they're seeing unidentified flying objects hovering over the ocean for what like what are they what are they doing there are they looking for Atlantis I don't know if I find it settling that the government's finally admitting it or more scary super scary of course it's scary first that they kept it secret or tried to keep it secret for so long and they have a reason to admit it now like that's just as scary well this new report they're not actually calling them UFOs anymore the government has officially started calling them unexplained aial phenomenon yep uaps I don't know if they're doing that just to confuse people but they claim to be trying to collect as much data as they can and and following to see where that data leads to and they claim that they're going to share their findings whenever possible oh yeah because they've been so honest with us in the past I know right but just the military alone from June of 2021 until last month the military alone has um reported 144 sightings the military you know like like Pilots military Pilots they're calling them military aviators because obviously not all of them are fighter pilots some of them are cargo pilots I don't know whatever the hell people fly in the military military aviators have reported how many 144 in like the last what do we want to call it 16 months oh my goodness in the last 16 months yeah freaking amazing that's like almost 10 a month you want to hear something great yes so the government looked into them and they attributed one incident to a large deflating balloon but found the rest to be beyond the government's ability to explain without further analysis what's this without further analysis oh you're going to tell us everything you're just going to stop looking so you don't have to tell us anything right or they're going to continue looking and just keep it the rest of it silent and why is everything always a balloon we always say it was a weather balloon or swamp gas can I just say how many freaking weather balloons do we really use right and why are they always causing these types of sightings I mean I've seen balloons in the air before and they're pretty obviously balloons are these like experimental balloons do they look so much different from regular balloons well and here's the other thing I find hysterical is this report also talks about how some of them are just foreign spying and Airborne trash dude if you know it's foreign spying why ain't you shooting that [ __ ] out of the sky okay pick Point you're just like yeah we're just letting people spy on us you think it's aliens but you know it's whoever it's whoever we're just going to let them spy I don't want to pinpoint anybody but let you keep thinking it's aliens right but another interesting fact that I I I found a report this was a oped that was done by a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester and part of this report this kind of I don't know how I feel about this so they're saying that yes there are unidentified flying objects out there but we have unidentified aerial phenomena what whatever unidentified aerial phenomenon but that we just because they exist and that they're out there we have no proof that they are being manned by anything intelligent so their argument is just because there's UFOs doesn't mean there's aliens well who the hell is directing these things is this like a radio controlled car equivalent like so so this this report is trying to make the argument that and I think it's just another way to try to confuse people now that they're classifying stuff that just because you see UFOs doesn't mean there's aliens now I actually would like to know what some of our listeners opinions are on this because you could say it's an interesting topic because could these be AI absolutely we don't know I haven't been on an alien ship I don't know if it's AI sure there is some studies that are suggesting that we have no business saying that just because there's UFOs is that there's aliens well that's true I mean unidentified aerial phenomenon doesn't necessarily mean a man or aliened spacecraft it just means that it's something that happened in the air that we don't understand what it is yet they're not necessarily saying all unidentified flying objects or unidentified aop phenomenon they don't necessarily have to be aand anything it could just be some sort of aerial phenomenon it could be space trash it could be some type of meteor right debris or or man-made debris or or as they said a lot of it very well could be technology that we don't know either ours or or some other countries or a lot of it could be spying so they're just kind of covering all bases and here here's you know speaking of of country spying and things of that nature another interesting report that's come through recently as we're all aware of the unfortunate War that's going on currently in the Ukraine there have actually been recent reports of uaps unidentified aerial phenomenon flying through the Skies of Ukraine they have been officially discredited by Ukraine's National Science agency but there are a lot of folks including folks in the military that are in the Ukrainian military as well as militaries from surrounding countries that do believe that they are uaps this report was released in mid-september so it's about maybe pushing two months old but they describ a significant number of objects whose nature is not clear including multiple so-called Phantoms which appeared completely black against the sky and seemed to zip through the atmosphere it up to 33,000 miles an hour roughly twice as fast as one of those intercontinental ballistic missiles so it couldn't have been a ballistic missile from Russia or or wherever because it was actually going at 33,000 miles an hour of course the government's trying to say oh no there's nothing out there that's always their first reaction right but there there are some scientific communities and astronomical observation communities that do believe that there is some UFO activity currently happening over the Ukraine area I'm intrigued by that because somewhere in the recesses of my steel trap of a brain I I have a memory of of reading about how UFO sightings and UAP sightings happen a lot around wartime and even a lot of the the old paintings and historical paintings we have they'll have uh what looks like uh UFOs in the painting in the sky like over battle scenes and that type of thing I think I've heard before that um it it's a historical thing that UFO sighting seems to increase over over battles and over War but again I I don't have any basis for that right now I'll have to look it up and see if that's just something my brain made up or if actually something I remember I mean it's it's definitely an interesting addition to to the latest Rumblings about UFOs currently yeah for sure I have also heard that too and it is kind of what is it about wars that attract UFOs and and what's the correlation yeah what's are they is it like are they trying to see what we got you know right right how how how crazy are these humans how far are they willing to go they instigate it just to see what would happen you know kind of like a little kid shaking up an antill like I said though the Ukrainian government is dismissing it um so you know who knows but also our government dismissed it too for how long right who believes that anymore but also recently like there's just so much been going on recently and that's why I wanted to talk about this there's been more than 40 more than 40 UFO sightings reported in Idaho just this year alone Idaho Idaho like I don't even know what's up with Idaho but so far this year 40 um 40 UFOs in Idaho yeah wow yeah yeah I think some of our listeners live in Idaho have you guys seen any UFOs like what's up with that so and I have like a breakdown of a couple of cities Boise Idaho 12 reports Namba nine Idaho Falls three Dalton Gardens two Patell too um Idaho National Forest has had them like like the some's going on in Idaho right now so if you are in Idaho or in any of the surrounding states if you have seen something let us know because there is something going on there right now curious it's kind of like the the zipping across the sky the formation the omnus formation of Bright Lights you know kind of the the typical UFO sighting things you know but yeah 40 in the in the in so far this year something's going on over there something is heating up in the alien world or in our alien atmosphere I don't know so this I thought was very interesting as well you know everybody wonders where NASA is in this game guess who just jumped on the bandwagon especially ironic because all these El musk no NASA NASA oh NASA has never been a part of the alien thing up till now which is weird because they're the spaceship people they've probably been trying to stay out of it not anymore and and it's kind of weird that now all these reports are coming out that now NASA's getting involved but here's the thing with NASA and this is where I think folks are going to get annoyed with some of these alien reports myself um goes along like this data proof so it's really weird that now is getting involved right now especially with all these reports and stuff coming out because NASA they have this weird way it's not weird it's actually super good they have what's called a standard of evidence oh yeah that's awesome every you know things have to meet a specific standard of evidence to be proven yay or nay I love that I'm all for that well that's what I'm saying but I think some UFO followers are going to be disappointed because there's a very strict stand standard of evidence that's going to be followed now that sure some people might say that it's too strict correct correct but I think the pros of having NASA involved is yeah they're kind of a government agency but they're really still kind of third party in my opin yeah hopefully they can stay open to the people while still maintaining that standard of evidence and being rigorous in their search right right so there there is going to be some things that may appear to be alien life and UFO and UAP and nature that NASA being involved is going to kind of stamp out just because they're very rigorous and that's what we want that's what we want 100% so I I'm very happy that NASA's get invol involved but I am very interested in the timing because I feel like the timing coinciding with all of these reports getting Declassified in the last couple of weeks is just what's up people what's up yeah that's that's so coincidental I'm not I mean the synchronicity with all of it is just so intriguing I'm I don't know what's going to come out in the next couple years I'm just with them admitting so much truth to so much of what for so long people said was absolute bunk absolute he say you know crazy you talk what's up with Bob Lazar has anybody checked in with him you know because damn all this stuff is really starting to you know come true so to speak makes me want to go watch The Simpsons because let me tell you if anybody's predicting [ __ ] right now 110% it is The Simpsons yeah they have been pretty spot on on a an awful lot of things The Simpsons Oracle for sure but I definitely think it's something to keep an eye on as far as news stories you know stuff like this might get second third page on your news websites but keep up with this stuff people because they're trying to brush some stuff under the rug that we should know about and they're trying to do things like I said with NASA on the up and up that we should know about yeah and and it's been going on for so long and like you so much is happening right now and if you're in freaking Idaho we want to know if you've seen anything I mean what's what's up with the hot spot in Idaho I'll have to see if I have to maybe I'll do some LA on the street interviews here this see if I can find if anyone seen any other activity in LA and you know we don't generally talk about other countries a lot but you know I talked about Ukraine Mexico is ramping up again Mexico for some reason has always kind of been a hot spot for UFO activities that whole area that whole Southwest Southern California New Mexico Mexico that area is very popular but some of the stuff I was coming across in recent news shows that there there's activity ramping up again in in Mexico you know it's not just I think sometimes you think just America these UFO sightings are worldwide man I know they're all over the world absolutely all over the world but because there's always been so much activity in Mexico the fact that it's ramping up again is like uh are they coming this time I'm pretty sure I heard that it's usually Americans that report UFO sightings and I'm not sure if it's because it's a hot spot here or if we're just AIG large large population of people who are more than willing to tell Tales like that I guess I don't know well I would think that you know if you're if you're in a place where you are under say a dictatorship for example you might not be able to voice those experiences you know what I'm saying and I I imagine in places like uh like uh Great Britain or whatever it's probably just not the done thing I don't know well you know us Americans we're just kind of like hey we're just gonna say whatever and there are people that are more subdued than us in this world that's true we are kind of loud but I but but there are so the sightings are ramping up and and in one sighting in particular that I wanted to point out to you we you and I have always been fans of the the Mayan ruins the Aztec Ruins oh yeah all of the the the Central and South americ American pyramid sculptures fascinating history there's been a bunch of sightings around those the ones that are in Mexico and you know depending on what you think some folks think that some of those pyramids in in Central and South America were created by aliens so the fact that there's alien sightings near there currently is like hey what's up fun so wow that really blows my mind I love these old sculptures these old buildings these like the the Mounds I guess they're not really pyramids but the the building structures in that area and the pyramids in Egypt and all these places that are rumored to have alien influence how cool that there's s you know what I found interesting if you look at a map that goes from Mexico to Canada like if you look there there's like that line not necessarily the ridge of the Rockies but to the maybe if you're looking at the map maybe to the left of the ridge of the Rockies that line going from Mexico all the way up to say Idaho there seems to be like a straight line of a lot of alien sightings through that Alleyway going from Mex yeah is there a corridor and if so what is it about that area because I feel like at least in the United States there's more sightings there than say here on the East Coast makes sense you know I don't know I'm curious again I beseech our UFO expert list listeners you know let us know what what have you heard about that strip is there something there what what's to it so I just wanted to talk about some top news stories in the UFO world so not to consume the whole podcast what do you got for us today Lea because I could talk forever about this oh my gosh there's so much interesting historical things about UFOs things happening right now with UFOs we could consume several podcasts and I'm sure we will with UFO sightings oh yeah we'll come back to it again at another time don't you worry folks I am going to talk about probably the most haunted place in Riverside California o which is the place near and dear to my heart it's called The Mission Inn and the Mission Inn is absolutely gorgeous I love this building it takes up almost two city blocks is it a hotel it is it's a hotel and it's a restaurant it's also a museum but they have a lot of artwork and a lot of artifacts there that you can wander around and look at they do tours the the place is a huge mish mash of styles it started out in 1876 it was built prior to 1876 I'm not exactly sure when but the original structure was a 12 room Adobe boarding house and it was purchased in 1880 by a gentleman named Frank Miller who was the son of a famous architect called Christopher Miller and he started adding to this 12 room adobe house with different wing wings and Courtyards and garden there seems to be a theme in California people who start building a house and never stop building it what's up with that I'm not sure I had the very same thought while I was researching this and then the place of course becomes haunted and has all these Legends and rumors attached to it so he continued until his death in 1935 he continued to add onto this hotel and listen to this list of styles so the house has morish Revival architecture Spanish Colonial architecture Spanish Gothic architecture it also has all different like Gothic elements such as like arched doorways and and recessed artwork alcoves and it's I don't know how I feel about indecisive people there is a central Garden that has four floors of a stunning spiral staircase all of which is open to the Garden at one time I believe it was a a monastery can you stay at this place currently yes so is this more like a is this more like a bed and breakfast nowadays because it sounds like a house though to me it's huge it is absolutely huge and no it's definitely a hotel it's very imposing it has these beautiful Adobe walls and large gateways you there's a restaurant there's an outdoor portion of the restaurant and the food there is stunning I highly recommend they'll make your guacamole for you tableside so good definitely recommend it so who's the ghosties there the ghosties there are definitely Frank and Alice Miller who are the Son and Daughter of char or Christopher Miller who was the original owner and then his son Frank purchased it and he's the one who added on to it so Frank changed the name to the Mission Inn and again kept adding all these different styles and he and his sister were known to live there their entire lives one of the rooms is also called Aunt Alice's room and it is rumored to be the most haunted room in the entire Hotel oh makes me want to stay in it it oh absolutely this hotel has catacombs underneath it that Traverse most of the city and are rumored to go all the way to mount rubido nearby and have a secret entrance you used to be able to tour these catoms that were underneath the hotel and they had all these different rooms that were kind of designed in different styles there was there was an oriental room there was a two Native American rooms one designed to look like a Kea one designed to look like a Hogan oh wow there was a a couple different Catholic inspired rooms down in these catacombs one called a Baptist Tre and they had full wax figures and people have reported many many ghosts in this area shadow people down in this area they used to give tours and I think there's still a slight chance I'm going to try and get one there's still a slight chance you can get tours but they've been mostly closed off to the public but there are rumors that there were many suicides and even a murder down in those catacombs now why did he build all these catacombs and why was everything like of such different styles is there a Rhyme or Reason to any of this not really there's a lot of urban legends about it they say that construction of the Catacombs themselves began well after the construction of the hotel around 1910 and continued for about 7 years they say that he began building the with there's a place called The Cloister music room that was built nearby and so he started building these tunnels to kind of connect with this cloer Museum and also the idea was to bring more attention back to the monastery in the area so a lot of the Catacombs would connect to the monastery as well and so the intention was to kind of like capitalize on the area's Catholic influence and the the Resurgence of Interest in like the Catholic missions and the old the old missions in the area gotcha the hotel was originally named the Glennwood but after he did all the the huge Renovations it was then called the Glennwood Mission again trying to capitalize on that Resurgence of the Catholic Mission interest and then eventually they dropped Glenwood and just kept the mission in and so there were 12 rooms in the catacombs and they say that when you go down into these catacombs a lot of electronics will stop working and you're often told you have to bring a flashlight with you to go on the tours and I did read several firsthand accounts of people going down in there when they would talk about as soon as they would descend the stairwell their battery operated flashlight would start flickering and cease to work even if they knew they yeah but that could have to do with The Rock in the area and not necessarily anything paranormal I would say that would have a lot to do with like if you couldn't get cell phone reception but like a battery powered flashlight would that affect that too I don't know I don't know about the battery powered flashlight but the cell phone I got yeah absolutely so Frank and Alice are rumored to haunt the entire hotel but in particular the fourth floor and Frank did have rooms on the fourth floor and his room is currently blocked off no one can uh no one can rent that room but room 215 which is a room that Alice is rumored to have stayed in every time that she went there that room you can stay in and that is the most like the second most haunted room in the hotel other than Frank's so you can definitely stay in that room that's available and people report cold spots and they'll often hear Alice singing if you walk through the hotel you might hear a disembodied Voice singing now did they die in the hotel I haven't found that I have heard a couple people say that they both died in the hotel but I can't confirm that I I don't know for sure but it could just be a matter of because it was theirs and and and all of that that even if they did not die there they could have just gone back home kind of thing exactly they they definitely spent their entire lives there Alice they both had rooms there that they lived in and stayed there so again if even if they didn't die there you're absolutely right because they put so much of themselves into this building so it's kind of more like ha happy haunting it's not anything defin necessarily benevolent well I don't know because all of the accounts of people that go there as soon as you walk up to it there's that whole horror movie Vibe it's stunningly beautiful I just get kind of when I go there I just kind of get a sense of old California it's the Adobe walls and the the flowers and the archways and the stone floors and that different time period yeah but the place it's not just the architecture that's a mish mash of styles it's also the the artwork and I mean you'll walk down a hallway that's that's decorated in Kobe and r iron and roses and then there's like a bust of Theodore Roosevelt you know it's just random art in different places because weird right there just they collected all sorts of different things and also another interesting thing I found about this place is that Anne Rice the author Anne Rice who wrote Interview with the Vampire loved the Mission Inn so much so that she was staying in one of the Suites called the Amistad suite and she used used that and she wrote one of her books there actually two of her books she set in the Mission Inn oh so while an rice stayed at this Suite she came up with the book of love and evil which is the second in the songs of the seraphim series and it's set in the Mission Inn in Riverside California and she's quoted as saying she spent some time in this room that has a huge like cupula ceiling and as she looked up at the the beautiful paintings on that Cupa she had this whole idea of an Angel visiting a Hitman that she wanted to set the series in that hotel interestingly enough the woman who painted that room an artist named Tiffany Brooks and she painted quite a few of the murals in the mission in and when she painted the mural on the ceiling in the Amistad room she was reading an Rice's series The Witching Hour kind of an interesting little coincidence there yeah people are always reporting seeing go and Shadow People um also there was a Craig Owens is an author and photographer and he wrote a book and he went to all these different haunted places in Southern California and took pictures of people kind of in Period dress at these places he describes himself as a quote reluctant believer in the Paranormal he's not really a ghost Chaser he just likes these places more for the look and the vibe so he says that uh while he was doing photographs at the Mission Inn that's kind of what made him a believer in ghosts while he was taking photographs of one of his models he says he saw a shadow person so in 2009 he was doing his uh photographs here he says he saw what looked like an Inky black two-dimensional figure that was roughly 5 fo2 wearing like the cowl of a cloak over their head as soon as it like he saw it and it like noticed that he saw it it like darted around a corner and there was no one there and it freaked him out so much that he had to sleep with the lights on for like a year and he's not a ghost believer but he saw that shadow person in the mission in let's see Sam and Colby the guys who go on a lot of different oh yeah I love those guys yeah they went to the mission in and they had some interesting things happen to them including while they were asking for ghosts or spirits to come around they had lights in the room turn on and off and different things in the room get moved around on them any who goes there they often get a bad Vibe as beautiful as the place is people very often will describe it as like the room itself doesn't want them there like the place doesn't want them to be there others I wonder if the land is haunted you know how we've come across those land hauntings sure I wonder what was there before that adobe bed and breakfast was there who knows what could have been there at that time uh there's a one woman named Angelica she said that when she stayed there she felt like someone was spying on her and following her the entire time she stayed there and she would hear footsteps come across the floor right up to her and this is a common thing that I've heard people say they'll be standing in the hallway and it'll sound like someone is walking down the hallway towards them and even past them and they'll feel the cold wind as the steps go by them but there's no one there there's also a recording some people were doing an interview in one of the rooms of the hotel and after they stopped the interview they still had the cameras rolling and you can distinctly hear someone in high heels walk across the room even though no one's moving oh wow people think that it's it's the brother and sister Frank and Alice walking around the house but they're not sure who the shadow people are so I wonder like you said if there was something there before the Adobe building and the mission in were built there well that was also built right after the California Gold Rush time so you know you don't know what or who was occupying that area exactly and they do say of course that there is a portal there they're not sure where is a portal too but it's rumored to be at the door to Aunt Alice's room people will feel that that is a portal to some other dimension I love portals especially portals to hell that's right they're my favorite this is one of I cannot wait I'm going to go there on a tour here in the next unfortunately um not before this episode goes out but I get some pictures to you for the Instagram but I'm going to go there and see if I can catch some orb photos because everyone loves to show their orb photos from this place it is you love orb photos what are you talking about I do and I'm super excited to try and catch some of myself but not all over the hotel just in the areas where people report seeing these ghosts and Shadow People and feeling the cold spots and the people watching them those places people take photographs there those are the ones that seem to have in particular bright blue orbs in those areas so I'm hoping to see if I can catch some myself there are also several pictures where people will see the ghost of a girl on the spiral staircase and a woman named Alicia says that she was in a restroom and the door locked on her and she thought it was her friends playing a prank but none of them had locked her in the bathroom it had locked by itself and it's again common for people to see doors opening and closing including Sam and Colby and their group of friends they also saw a door open by itself I love that [ __ ] I really do but IA has a very clear picture of a of a ghost girl on the spiral staircase that they didn't notice till they got home another woman named Lynette went to the bathroom with her friends and they weren't staying there they were just on a tour and they were trying to see if they could you know find anything creepy on any of the floors she says while she was waiting for her friends to use the restroom all of a sudden it got super cold where she was standing to the point where every single hair on her body stood on end and she got goosebumps and chills she says she felt like she was on a roller coaster you know that feeling you get when your like stomach drops out and you kind of break out in a sweat so she kind of got that feeling and she heard someone walk up to her and she thought it was her friends but there was no one there and then she says standing across the room next to the red velvet curtains was the figure of a man just a shadow man about 510 and very very masculine but very angry she said she did not get a good vibe from him at all and they kind of stared at each other for a long time and the shadow man started shaking his head no and then disappeared right after that her friends came back and they're like hey let's go to the fourth floor and do some ghost hunting and she's like nope no we're out we were distinctly told no we are out yeah so they were listen to the ghosties right she says we are out of here we're not staying the ghost told me no so yeah I don't think I would go if a shadow person told me know but yeah people are always they feel like they're being pushed they feel ghostly hands but the singing and the cold spots and the seeing Shadow People is super super common there so I can't wait to see if I get any ghost pictures or orb photos when I go definitely update us and if you do get any of those pictures send them to me and I'll upload them to Instagram for everyone to see absolutely and I'm so sad that the the catacombs underneath are closed I really want to try and get a tour if at all possible but from what I understand they're mostly closed the rumor is because there's too many dead bodies and too many suicides and murders happened down there oh wow I couldn't substantiate any of that the public notice that was given is that too much dampness had caused it to be unsafe so we'll see yeah yeah yeah but kind of an interesting you know historic place and like you said I also had the idea of like what is it with California and these haunted places and the weird fixation on continuous building like what what's up with that crazy crazy so wild so wild maybe it's the maybe these ghosts in California like you must continue to build or I will haunt you forever and then when they pass away and the building stops the hauntings start happening right so there you go that's our tale of the UFOs going around the USA and also the very haunted Mission Inn in Riverside California tell us what you think of this week's
