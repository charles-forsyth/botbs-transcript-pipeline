they had then they tell us it was Hydro like Hydro was a thing and it's like you didn't didn't grow in freaking water people like Hydra was a type of weed when oh my goodness yeah yeah remember those

smoke things like Crystal coma and it's this sativa strain it's very nice I'm dabbing that and in between I'm just smoking a little homegrown let's talk some scary paranormally blah blah blah stuff what's your story tonight well my story this evening is going to be about the life and the murder of the Black Dalia a young woman named Elizabeth Short give it to me give it to me all right I even have dude while I was researching this this was some of the craziest stuff and it it bugged me a little bit I knew we were going to run into things like this but I was not exactly prepared the media was all over this case one of the things I saw was a photograph of this young woman's dead body covered partly by a sheet like the actual like police photo like actual her body the actual police photo of her body her face her arms her legs and there's just a sheet covering like her torso and her upper legs and another photo I saw I scrolled past it so quickly and I am not going to show you but you can find it if you look you can find a photo of this beautiful young woman's face that has been the photos are out there I I didn't really expect that I was going to see as much as I did about this but I guess that's kind of part of the whole story because the media was all over it because a beautiful woman died in the 1940s and and there's sex there's this gruesome murder and there's a woman that they claimed was a Hollywood Starlet wannabe that came from Boston Massachusetts to California and all these stories got blown out of proportion let me hit this bong and I'm going to tell you a gruesome sad story about a woman who was just starved for love and ended up maybe possibly on the wrong end of a mob boss it's always the way man always the way okay so I'm gonna set the scene a little bit here all right grab your pot showell I got it sit back I got a story for you at about 10: a.m. on January 15 1947 it's a dreary rundown weedy Block in a place called lemert Park which is around Los Angeles California a young housewife Benny buringer had left her home on Norton Avenue and again the details of this are insane because the media was everywhere on this why because it was in California why was the media all over it the media was all over it because she was beautiful she was a beautiful young woman there was rumors of lots of lovers and she was murdered in such a brutal fashion that it just hit every every nerve at the time they interfered with the investigation to the point where they may have contaminated evidence so anyways this woman Betty buringer left her home in Lemer Park and she was going to the shoe repair shop to pick up some shoes for her husband and with her she had her three or maybe five depending on the account three or five-year-old daughter with her and she was kind of scolding the little girl because they were passing all these weedy vacant lots that were kind of seedy that sometimes people threw their garbage in and the little girl wanted to play in the vacant lots and of course the mother did not at all want this probably not a place you should have been taking your kid in that day and age no probably not I guess all accounts it wasn't exactly a bad area but it wasn't really a good one either so she thought she was doing okay kind of cutting over to this shop to pick up her husband's shoes she said later in an interview that she felt slightly disconcerted at the time she just was everything felt kind of off but she kind of blamed it on the cold gray morning and as she walked further along she discovered she saw something very white in the weeds and that was what kind of caught her eye was this this bright white amongst the the dirty if you've ever been to California everything here is kind of a shade of tan ochre you know this dust gets on everything and anyway so this white thing in the weeds caught her eye again it wasn't uncommon for people to toss their garbage out in into the vacant lots and so she thought maybe someone had left a a store mannequin there and the child was very curious and was like Mommy what's that what's that and so the mother obviously didn't want her daughter to see it any further because she had gotten an eye full and that's when she turned and ran for the nearest neighbor's house to call the police she said again in an interview later I glanced to my right and saw this very dead very white body my goodness she says it was so white it didn't look quite like anything more than perhaps an artificial model it was so white and separated in the middle separated separated that's her exact words so yeah this woman what they saw was this woman Elizabeth Short in an abandoned lot face up her some account say green some say gray blue eyes were open she had these pale pale eyes and she had been posed with her elbows bent at right angles her hands over her head and her legs were spread with her knees straight her body was cut cleanly through in the Middle with surgical precision and they found her intestines coiled neatly under the lower half of her body oh wow wow like that's sadistic [ __ ] very sadistic it gets worse she was completely drained of blood not a drop of blood that's why her body was so pale and white and there was no blood at the scene so someone took out her blood before they dumped her body exactly I'll get to that part what's wrong with people what is wrong with people so there was more there's more oh god there were chunks of Flesh missing from different parts of her body again cut out with surgical precision and some of the most brutal things that they know noticed on First Sight was that her face had been cut from the corners of her mouth to her ears kind of like the Joker smile oh wow it's something called the Glascow smile I found and they don't know if this is a connection at all but apparently a Glasgow smile which one of the newspapers described it as is it's inflicted by cutting from one or both corners of the victim's mouth sometimes all the way to the ears it originated in a dark period in the Scottish City of the same name Glasgow in 20th century Scotland these roving gangsters would punish each other carving the size of their victim's mouth in a demented grin known as the Glascow smile and she wasn't a gangster she wasn't a gangster she was rumored to have been with some there were also rumored later that there were cigarette Burns also all over her body and it looked like she had been bound hand and foot so an autopsy was performed on this poor young woman and marks on her body suggested that she had been bound and torture and her official cause of death cerebral hemorrhage and shock and blood loss possibly due to the wounds on her face they discovered that a chunk had been carved out of her thigh where a tattoo had been so they had carved a rose tattoo out of her thigh and why would you do that even worse they found it stuffed in her vagina wow now what year was this again this was in 1947 so again the gruesome details of this were everywhere the reporters were telling stories of the of her being bound and of the cigarette marks and the police were trying to keep some of this silent and actually the tattoo chunk and where it was found had been kept out of the news until someone mentioned it that shouldn't have known W and and where was this again this was in Hollywood California the coroner in a private conversation had also suggested on multiple occasions that he had found her stomach full of feces Oh wow he suggested that he thought in his opinion that she had been forced to eat feces while still alive and that the blood loss that caused her death was due to the Glascow smile being performed upon her while she was still alive so basically somebody really hated her like really hated her correct and just and tortured her that's crazy her identity was discovered with the help from an very early fax machine a fax machine a fax machine one of the first ones they called it at the time sound photo ah they sent this poor dead woman's fingerprints to Washington DC so that they could be checked by the FBI and actually they did have her fingerprints on file so they knew right away that her name was Elizabeth short and so they knew who it was they did they found out very quickly her fingerprints were on file because she had gotten a job earlier at an army base in California so she'd had to use her fingerprints to apply for that and also shortly after that she had been arrested for underage drinking and so her fingerprints we all haven't we all she lived an amazing life again which is partly why the media like jumped right on this story once her name was identified by this early facts machine the media went crazy one of the things the Press had done that was really out of pocket was a newspaper reporter called Elizabeth's mother Phoebe short telling her that Elizabeth had won a beauty competition and that they wanted some background information on her for a story that they were doing because she had won this beauty pageant the mother was obviously very happy to gush about her daughter and when the interview was over the scumbag reporter told her that actually her daughter had been murdered and that's why they were calling and because the press was so on top of everything they had actually gotten to the mother before the police had gotten to her to inform her of her daughter's death oh wow let me show you a picture of her so that you can see she was like very beautiful woman and it's it's interesting hair yes her black hair was a big part of why she was called the black doia and also her penchant for wearing sheer black clothing I like I like even in the description they talk they talk about how very attractive she was but she had bad lower teeth who like why do you have to say that why do you have to say that in a news article exactly she was very sexualized well that's what they did at the time remember they talked about her black address book and that she readily makes friends with both sexes which is Black Book yeah code words for [ __ ] right they're absolutely [ __ ] reporters jumped on this story and they started spreading things and the police tried to keep as much of it as they could out of out of the news for a lot of different reasons but reporters found her luggage actually before the police did and they discovered that she had checked her luggage at a bus station in Los Angeles like all of her belongings were shoved in luggage at a bus station in Los Angeles andir yeah nobody really knows why so as they found out who she was stories of her life began to piece together and part of that was aided by the killer themselves so the med who's the Killer well we'll get into that they still don't know there are quite a few different theories but the media started to Brand her a sexual deviant one police report read this victim knew at least 50 men at the time of her death and at least 25 men had been seen with her in the 60 days preceding her death she was known as a teaser of men busy girl that was in the police report who the [ __ ] cares I mean I guess it was like 1947 yeah so I suppose that's knowing a lot of guys for the time so they tried to figure out who this woman was and a timeline of sorts began to appear her body was discovered on January 15 and on January 21st a person claiming to be shorts killer placed a phone call to the office of uh James Richardson who's the editor of the examiner and he congratulated Richardson on the newspapers coverage of the case at the time because it was just lurid and everywhere they were running stories constantly and this person who claimed to be the killer said he EV eventually planned on turning himself in but not before allowing the police to chase him further this person again claiming to be the killer told Richardson to expect some sort of Souvenirs of Beth short in the mail yeah right creepy three days later a suspicious manila envelope was discovered by a US postal worker and it had been addressed to the Los Angeles examiner and other Los Angeles papers the letter was addressed and written using clippings from movie ads you know like those oldfashioned like rans some letters where they cut out letters from magazine yeah yeah was this like the original cutout letter or don't you know I don't know but in this letter it says the phrase Heaven is here and it said here is Dalia's belongings letter to follow and inside the envelope was Elizabeth Short's birth certificate her social security card some newspaper clippings of the stories business cards photographs some names she had written on pieces of paper and a 10-year-old address book with the name Mark Hansen embossed on the cover and inside this address book were the names of 75 men her little black address book there's the little black address book so with Mark Hansen like why does she have is this Mark Hansen's address book or is it her address book the police launch a massive search and track down most of these men but a lot of them said that they only knew her briefly oh yeah I only knew her a little bit yeah a little bit on the inside I right so yeah I only knew her a little my wife is standing right behind me so yeah so they most of them knew her but had they said they had only known her briefly that they found nothing significant in this search so they also found that the packet had been cleaned with gasoline similar to Short's body like her body Not only was empty of blood but had been completely cleaned using gasoline so that no fingerprints remain that's weird why would you clean someone with gasoline apparently it takes away fingerprints the packet itself had also been cleaned with gasoline and they suspected that it was probably really from the killer because of the similar method they did find however that there were a couple prints that they were able to lift from it and they sent them to the FBI but they were too corrupted and and weren't able to find anything conclusive so the killer was absolutely taunting them and the police also went to find Mark Hansen obviously the guy whose name is on the little black address book and he said this is a Hansen's a wealthy local nightclub owner and he supposedly said that short had stayed at his home or with friends of his and he also said he only knew her just a little bit but she was a nice girl aren't they all nice right he says there's varying accounts both that either he gave her the address book or that she stole the address book from him I found that he either had said both things or stories reported both things but the the address book definitely came from him so then a few days later January 26th another letter arrives this time it's handwritten and it says here it is turning in Wednesday January 29th 10: a.m. had my fun at police and it was signed Black Dalia Avenger and the letter included a location the police went to that place at the day and time but nobody nobody ever showed after that the the alleged killer sent notes made of letters cut in pasted from magazines that said have changed my mind you would not give me a square deal Dalia killing was justified so yeah again all these letters had been wiped clean with gasoline which is one of the things that they used to connect all of them that they had really tried to report too much on at the time and this helped them kind of because so many fake things were being reported in the news and people were claiming to have done it and they were getting so many tips and more letters so this kind of helped them discover which ones they felt had actually come from the real killer oddly enough on March 14th there was some clothing found at the edge of the ocean in Venice California and on this pile of clothing inside the shoe was a suicide note and it said to whom it may concern I have waited for the police to capture me for the Black Dalia killing but they have not I am too much of a coward to turn myself in so this is the best way out for me I couldn't help myself for that or this sorry Mary although very intriguing the pile of clothes and the suicide note never really amounted to anything no body was ever found and it was never proven to be connected to the black dollia case Elizabeth Short was born in Boston Massachusetts and she had scandals even when she was a kid so like her dad lost most of his money when the stock market crashed in 1929 and in 1930 they found his car abandoned on the charl toown bridge and it was assumed that he had jumped to his death so his wife who is now broke with all their debts and five children has to start working multiple jobs to take care of the [ __ ] storm he left behind so it's pretty tough at this time and she's rumored to be like the most beautiful neighbors all said she was the most beautiful of the five short girls so she spent some some of her time in Miami Florida with with family and because the family was struggling so much she dropped out of school and went to work to help support her family then interestingly enough in 1942 so now 12 years later they get a love a letter from the dad he had he had faked his own death and run away to California and he wanted them to forgive him what an [ __ ] absolutely yeah complete [ __ ] like who does that and 12 years later he's like oh yeah I guess enough time has ass I I love you guys sorry yeah can you forgive me so the mom's like [ __ ] you no Elizabeth says hey you know California Sounds okay I'll come out and live with you so she goes and lives with Dad and that does not work out he calls her lazy and shiftless and think she's awful she has now Elizabeth has now met some young men and she's writing to to guys in the military she's looking for love basically she hooks up with a young man a pilot Major Matt Gordon Jr now he's overseas flying p-51s I have no idea what that is probably like some war plane probably and they exchange so many love letters how romantic how romantic all these love letters and he proposes marriage to which she happily accepts so he'd written this letter proposing marriage while he's recovering from some injuries from a plane crash while in India and she's so Overjoyed his mother later told reporters that short Elizabeth Short had sent her son 27 letters in 11 days Little Love Struck was our Elizabeth she loves love like what do you got to say geeez right so they're engaged now and then tragically on August 10th just five days before the war is over he dies in a plane crash oh [ __ ] and she never overcame her grief they say it sent her spiraling into a deep depression and she started drifting around the country and ended up back in California so in the summer of 1946 she's in Long Beach now and she assume resumes a romance with another pilot Gordon Fickling by all account she kind of bounces around from relationship to relationship the relationship with Gordon Fickling doesn't kind of work out people called her a wouldbe actress but mostly she was just kind of a a couch Surfer really ah I gocha and she was pretty much miserable crash in the apartments of acquaintances and she would tell everybody that she met a Sab story you know her her husband died in the war and her baby died in childbirth and she would say whatever she had to in order to get money you know she was that kind of chick I've met a few yeah right so she loved she loved to socialize she loved the Hollywood light night life and by all accounts she loved meeting men and one of the men that she met was Mark Hansen the nightclub and theater owner and he knew all these business people he was reported to be well connected with people in you know shady areas of everything and with Shady police officers but she lived I've met guys like that too right Hansen had a girlfriend at the time an Toth and Elizabeth short lived with an quite a bit and eventually Hansen moved Elizabeth into his house along with a bunch of young beautiful women you know he kind of had that kind of place all these desperate gorgeous young women Hugh Hefner Playboy Mansion kind of place yeah that kind of place very much taking Advantage as much as he possibly could because he was kind of you know schlubby looking he moved her into the house along with all these other gorgeous young women and you know they would entertain the guests of his clubs and you know they would hang out sunning by the pool and eventually she kind of outw her welcome there too she didn't really have an income and she usually only ate when someone else would could buy her food and she was always borrowing money from people she became known pretty much as a beautiful freeloader December 46 and she's in San Diego she was found sleeping in one of the seats of a movie theater and this woman felt sorry for her and took her home then she ends up with another man Robert Manley and they see each other off and on for a few weeks and then she asks him for a ride back to Hollywood he agrees and January 8th of 1946 he picks her up and pays for a hotel room and says they don't have sex and the next morning he has an appointment but he comes back and she says she's going to go home to Boston but she first needs to meet her sister at the builtmore Hotel in Hollywood Manley drives her to Los Angeles to the builtmore hotel and he he doesn't have time to wait around for her sister so he just kind of leaves her there in the lobby and he becomes the last person to have seen her alive no one saw her after January 6th other than the killer supposedly on January 8th she speaks with Mark Hansen via phone it's alleged that Hansen was very much infatuated with Elizabeth short but he liked lots of women though apparently he liked lots of women but he seemed to be particularly obsessed with her investigators were told that he really liked her he had a Yen for her but he of course just called her a nice girl when asked and said he thought she was average looking because of her ugly teeth to those bottom teeth man right other people said he was crazy jealous of her and that he was a man who must have what he wants so is this kind of a a a death by I can't have you nobody can I think so I think the most popular theory is that Hensen hired someone to kill her a man named Leslie Dylan it it's rumored that he told Leslie villan to take care of Elizabeth Short the Black Dalia from what I could piece together from some books and different things that were there is that January 9th maybe it wasn't the six so on January 9th she makes up the story that she has to go meet her sister and her sister said she never knew anything about this but she gets left at the builtmore hotel and no one ever sees her again and then from the 9th to the 15th when she was found by that housewife sometimes it's referred to as the missing week because nobody knows where she was and it's rumored that that's possibly when she was being murdered by Leslie Dylan and Mark Hansen okay here's another interesting coincidence okay so one of the theories centers on Leslie Dwayne Dylan who's a bellhop and a one-time mortician's assistant and he was briefly considered a prime suspect before they kind of disqualified him due to mostly police incompetent but it's rumored that he had links to Mark Hansen the nightclub and movie theater owner who was supposedly the last person to speak to her on the phone and who was obsessed with her so what this Theory says is that Leslie and Mark lured Elizabeth away to a place essentially where they could kill her they lured her away to a place called the aster Motel now the AST Motel is just a little small 10 cabin facility near the University of Southern California and some people believe that that's where she was murdered and the reason why is because the astrom motel owner on the morning of January 15th says he opened the door to one of his cabins and found the room covered in blood and feo matter and in another cabin he discovered that someone had left a bundle of women's clothes wrapped up in brown paper also stained with blood and this was not reported until way way later because at the time he had been arrested days earlier for beating his wife and didn't want to risk another runin with police so he never reported it so they think that that's where she was probably murdered yeah but they were just mean to her like mean they really were I mean whoever did this really had something I mean that's incredibly disgusting so interestingly enough Leslie Dylan who some people thought was the killer one of the reasons why is he would often talk to the police about things and he's the one who mentioned the rose too that had been cut from Elizabeth's thigh and shoved and let me guess they didn't tell anybody that they hadn't told an that was one of the things that they had kept back and he knew it so I mean that sounds like a thing like right there but due to all these incompetencies he was never charged unfortunately he was probably a friend of someone and that's why it never went further he definitely was because Hansen was friend with police officers and Dylan had all these disturbing details that only the police knew and he also told stories like oh like I believe she was murdered in a motel room or you know and he talked about things like that which actually turned out to have been true yeah so dud didn't come he probably he probably had friends in high places he definitely did Leslie Dylan is known to have stayed at the as motel in early January and Witnesses who stayed there said they they noticed a young woman woman a dark-haired girl who resembled Elizabeth Short there as well as a man who fit Mark Hansen's description in that kind of missing week interesting yeah interesting sounds like a cover up to me it does no one was ever charged with a crime and Dylan later named one of his daughters Elizabeth what a dick right so yeah that's the Black Dalia still unsolved to this day not not a nice story not a nice story at all and there's so many people some people claim to be the killer but couldn't have been there and oh my goodness it it's just it's a mess but you know kind of sad to think that that maybe if there hadn't been some corruption or people getting paid off that that maybe it could have been solved well that's not the world we live in unfortunately yeah all right I'm stressed out I need to smoke some more how about you still loving this pipe and the think I live kind of close to that when you come visit we we could I mean we could go on a really creepy tour and see some of these things like we could go to these places totally totally I'm down oh that is such a morbid tour hey Shell let's go on a morbid tour I I want to tell you about this place that I would really like to go to like I don't want to go but like I want to go like I'm so torn like I want to go but I don't want to go oh a place you might not want to go lay it on me okay Forest Park cemetery near Troy New York outside the city of Troy um along the banks of the H Hudson River lies a place of mystery actually this place isn't even on the maps like for real like now not even on the maps yeah like it's hard to find yeah like no like Google Maps can't take you there correct okay so officially it's named Forest Park Cemetery but hardly anyone calls it that instead they call it pinewoods Cemetery wait a minute so it's Forest Woods locally known as Pine Woods Forest Park locally known as pinewoods there there there are people that do say this is one of the most haunted places in the United States like creepy crap headless Angels mysterious suicide grave robbers the front entrance is known as the gates of hell it's an abandoned Cemetery urban legends go way back uh ghosts being seen there go way back this place was created in 1856 by a bunch of wealthy business they thought that like they could make it rich in the cemetery business and they wanted it to be more like a park I guess cemeteries weren't like Parks back then I don't know I wasn't alive then but they wanted it to be like a park with like trails and like a park- like experience and they thought that that would make people buy into it to make them Rich 1914 they go bankrupt at that point had buil that front gate which they think are the gates of hell I'll get there in a minute but never really finished the rest they ended up creating also a receiving tomb now this wasn't a tomb for people to be buried in it was like think of it as you can't bury people in the winter because the ground is hard so it was like a holding place so it wasn't meant to like be a permanent resting place the's frozen solid in New York in the winter time you're not getting into that right this place they they built this tomb and they built the entrance then they go bankrupt sad story so the town takes it over and it was dormant for 75 to 1990 and then they tried to kind of Salvage it but there was so much neglect it's been basically abandoned ever since and here's why so I told you about the statues yes the Headless headless angel statues which already scare the [ __ ] out of me I mean thank you some of them some of them had the arms chopped off too is that how because I know sometimes statues are built with no arms were these built with no arms or were these like they they were built with arms and now there's no arms and they had heads and now there's not well they're mutilated angel statues they're said to bleed from the neck what no no documented bleed from the neck what do you mean documented what do you mean documented bleed from the neck a statues do not bleed from the neck these do no no all right what do you okay all right all right what do youed like there's an explanation supposedly depending on if you're a skeptic or if you're whatever explanation there so happens to be this Moss leave it to [ __ ] Moss that happens to grow rarely in that part of Upstate New York that under certain conditions this moss turns into a red liquid wait wait so I'm supposed to believe either that a statue is ble in or a moss turns into a red liquid yes yes they both sound fake I'm too high for this all right I'm g go with probably Moss turning I know Moss does weird [ __ ] so I'm gonna go with moss turning into red liquid but damn were they High when they came up with those explanations probably probably there is a story that life time that Life Magazine did calling it the gateway to Hell the top most haunted place in the world so this story goes on for like 30 years guess what no one can find any story even Time Life Magazine is like we don't remember doing a story so like there's this huge Legend we don't remember doing a story there are people who swear that Life Magazine did a story on the cemetery that just like Po vanish gone nobody knows about can't find it so is this like the Mandela effect like a bunch of people believe it but it they can't can't find proof of it it's just this particular thing I guess I don't know whoa I like finding ghosts there's a what they call the friendly Soldier now this story this is weird because there's a couple different versions of this there's a guy and a girl doing some stuff in a car in a cemetery oh that sounds familiar oh yeah yeah know kissy smoochi some stories just say he was a plain old boyfriend some stories say he was a husband some stories say he was a soldier Okay I don't know which is is so they're in the car either way no matter what the guy is he gets out of the car for whatever reason the girl falls asleep okay okay if my boyfriend got out of the car in a cemetery I'm not like hey nappy time like I am gonna be like cognizant of my surroundings until he gets back in the car wouldn't you I mean movies have taught us shell that something bad always happens when you are in a car anywhere with your significant other and it's outside and one of you gets out of the car you just shouldn't do it like my first response is not hey let me take a nap no and take a nap would be the last thing you should be getting you should be reaching into the glove box and getting out your machete you need to be getting out a flashlight you need be getting out your satellite phone and your backup cell phone you need to be like calling pre calling 911 this girl chose to take a nap I don't know so she's sleeping taking a snoooo she gets awoken to sounds of something dragging on the roof of the car no okay all right okay my good wait hold on I got to turn on more lights what do you mean dragging on the roof no shell she gets out it's him he would hung himself above the car and it was his toes scraping on the roof of the car as he swung back and for no no no oh no the legend is toes scraping on his toes scraping on the roof of the car why did she fall asleep well apparently he walked through the gate at the front and actually walked through the gates of hell and they say that the demon hung him from the tray so oh my God so he walked through the gate so they like claimed him pretty much oh what did she do she sees him hung there like what did she do you want to hear a funny story they they put her in an insane asylum so she obviously tried to tell someone right and they she tried to tell someone they they they basically blamed her and put her in the crazy house they told they said she did it that she did it and that she was crazy yeah no she swears that like the demons did it through the gates of hell oh wow there's stories like phones dying people go there this is closed off to the public like I said private property which by the the way we do not condone trespassing of any kind this has been closed off to the public for I don't know like 35 years they have decided back in like 2018 2019 that for one day a year they will allow people to go through it semisupervised I don't think they can at night I think it's only during the daytime all the ghosts are gonna come out at night they do allow now one one day a year you know it's a cemetery in the middle of the Woods people have gone in it saying their their phones die they'll take pictures and I looked up and you can look up some of these pictures if you Google uh the Forest Park Cemetery mysterious figures and photos strange orbs weird lights oh I love me some orb photos like this this this place is there's lots of documentation people have who've grown up in the area that that was like the teenage place to go every town has the teenage spook place is it was it the teenage place to go for making out or for spooking or both spooking spooking it sounded like people weren't down with the making out thing they were afraid to die okay but kind of spooky the way it's kind of grown over you have to go through like deeply wooded areas to get to some of these headless statues one story goes that one of the statues that still has a head will sometimes have glowing red eyes at night you know uh you you go into this mum type Crypt type thing it was meant to kind of be a holding area no you don't go in it no no you do not the air is heavy supposedly and and you feel like you're being watched I'd go in it come on oh how creepy no no but you know if you if you if you were to look this place up online if you were to Google it and and see this front gate this Iron Gate like it kind of looks like the gates of hell like you feel like if you walk through there bad stuff's G to happen why would they build that and after it's built why would you walk through it be like oh people say this is the gates of hell I'm just going to walk through it like why just to see I do it you know whatever just to see but like no bad things here's another weird piece to it what they call unearthly animals what's an une Earthly animal um like kind of like a cross between like a person and a dog and like isn't that like a we dog some like half bear half people like isn't that a werewolf or a we dog I don't know the way I the way I had read it in one of these uh articles was demonic animals demonic animals well that's not fair animals are supposed to be cute and nice well maybe not bears but they're supposed to be cute and nice and cuddly you know like the three-headed dog the whole the whole bit and that the deeper you go into the cemetery like these animals are ready to take you um there's there's stories of teenagers disappearing and them finding like pieces oh no of the teenagers yeah oh no no e e e no but then you know you got some other folks that you know back in the 80s and stuff people were going in the cemetery they were vandalizing desecrating there was reports of IC rituals in there and and animal sacrificing in there so you add insult to injury that people are crazy and this place is crazy I want to go but I don't want to go I don't want to get arrested the like I guess the people of the town have made like some sworn oath that if they see anybody near that Cemetery they call the police like serious neighborhood watch stuff going on it's highly patrolled they really do want to keep people away from it and the question is do you want to keep people away from it cuz it's sold or because it's really the gates to hell right like why are they keeping people away from it that diligently I mean like we we have both we have both come from rural Upstate New York and and like are you really telling me that the the highest priority on these cops Minds is keeping people out of this Cemetery really really we've been to some pretty old crazy out there cemeteries you know and they don't really seem to be a hot bed of criminal activity why is this one guarded so heavily and why is it not on Google Maps and why is it not on Google Maps I am a firm believer in places that feel weird places that have strange energy and or and you've mentioned a couple times that that this place itself seems to have like an off energy bad mojo man sounds like bad mojo crazy and you want to go there you yeah you're always dragging me on these high Jinks and you love it I do I do love that love it I love them this is what we do but there I I I've read some personal accounts people who are paranormally people who don't believe in ghosts and never did until they were having an experience at this place like this place has made people Believers you know unfortunately a lot of children's Graves there so a lot of children ghost spot uh spotted a lot of bad stuff going on here on top of you know through through a the depression um through a couple world wars there's there's just probably some angry Spirits there to begin with yeah more than likely now you mentioned that it's opened one day a year yeah have there ever been any paranormal investigations done there like has has anyone tried to contact professionally the ghost I I don't think there has yet um the the folks that seems that do the once a year thing uh whatever you want to call it a tour or what have you is like the Historical Society type folks or like the town historian it's not necessarily par normally directed it would definitely be interesting to check out there's supposedly like a petrified high chair there you know just strange stuff strange stuff high chair like a stone like a St I guess I guess you know people say that they'd park outside that front gate and then their car wouldn't start you know it's just it's just weird like interesting stuff you know people say that they've heard screams in there definitely a creepy joint and like I said for the cops to watch it that much and for the town to kind of be so protective of it it just makes me more think that there's something up there the the most likely explanation is vandalism happens so often that they have to kind of watch it but seriously why so much protection it it brings out the conspiracy theorist in me it's like what are you hiding why you know what are you hiding why do you have so much back there yeah and you know I get the whole you get weird feelings you have to Cemetery you're going to get weird feelings in a cemetery not really I mean I've been to cemeteries you know we all have relatives we've all been to cemeteries for different reasons but you know sometimes they're just places you know and it's it's a little sad but not all of them have a creepy feeling it's just strange that if you're gonna protect us so much what you hide in what are you I'm just saying so yeah Forest Park Cemetery right outside of Troy I I I think that we should check this out sometime time I think we should too well we want to thank everybody for joining us tonight for this interestingly Spooktacular evening where we can get creepy spooky and
