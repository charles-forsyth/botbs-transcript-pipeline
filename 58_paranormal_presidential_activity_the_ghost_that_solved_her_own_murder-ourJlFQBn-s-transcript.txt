it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 58 of the stoned Witches Hour if you've been a longtime listener welcome back grab a packed bong from the table and settle in for a spooky good time if you're new here welcome to our witchy corner where two best friends tell each other's spine tingling paranormal Tales from across the USA while smoking enough of the finest THC dripping cannabis to kill a rhino sucked back into the ghostly Vortex that is Chicago Illinois yet again I'm Lea and I'm shell and I'm heading back to the east coast Illinois is too scary for me I've had enough of it so I'm going back to the east coast which is the ghosty Coast I didn't mean to go to Illinois I really didn't I fully intended to stay as far away from that state as possible and yet the story I started reading pulled me right back in there's some sort of Correspondence there that we're going to have to discuss on a different episode it's a ghostly Vortex or something I'm not sure but here we are so I'll be talking about a woman who solved her own murder from beyond the grave and I'm going to talk about a super haunted place that everybody knows of but nobody thinks about as haunted really o I'm trying to think of all the super haunted East Coast places what is it shell I'm gonna I'm gonna give you a clue the clue is the nation's capital oh DC has so many haunted places I've Heard lots of rumors of different ghosties and things that go around there what have you got the one haunted place no one likes to talk about the White House really the White House itself is haunted believe it or not like I you know actually I didn't realize I guess I should have it's not like it's not been around forever but yeah there's some people wandering the halls there there's stuff going on nice and I know there's some people that have smoked some pretty good weed on the roof of that White House let's see Willie Nelson Snoop Dog I think even um Woody harelson America's first President George Washington the founder of our land was a pipe smoker like shell I think he was also a pot Farmer and the dec of Independence is written on hemp paper well we're not going to smoke the Declaration of Independence oh no no no no but just to show that weed has been around just as long as witches and and white houses and white houses in in this country so hey it's a national weed story so yeah we're GNA talk about some of the ghosty ghosts at the White House you know it makes me want to actually go to the White House weird I've been to the White House I was actually on a tour of the White House back in in the Obama era okay did you see a ghost I didn't see any ghosts cuz I'm going to tell you right now I got a story of the Obamas I did get yelled at by a security guard for sitting on a chair shocking shocking whoops oopsie National Security incident Leila sat on a chair nope didn't see any ghosts but it was a tour and there were a lot of people there and and we did move through pretty quickly lots of history there beautiful I saw a picture of Princess Diana dancing with joh so that was fun I did go on a tour of the White House when I was a teenager we've all shared common trauma stories of vacations with my father this was a vacation with my father where we had we got to skip the line we got kind of back door clearance and got to go where Normal public people didn't get to go but at the time I was a teenager and I wasn't looking for ghosts and now my adult self I just want to wander that place I just want to wander around wouldn't that be a flashlight tour to end all flashlight tours an evening flashlight ghost tour at the White House now we're gonna have an election coming up in a year and a half if you are running for president whoever you are I don't care who you are if you start doing Ghost Light tours at the White House I will vote for you you've got Shell's vote because what a better Money Maker than bringing people people into the White House for overnight tours I mean realistically they're only in one bedroom sleeping or a couple bedrooms if they have kids let us wander the rest of the building I think you've just solved our deficit problem shell I'm telling you ghost tours at the White House it should be a thing somebody running for political office needs to put that on their like their ticket where's Bernie Sanders when you need him he'd do ghost tours I bet you Bernie Sanders would probably do ghost tours I'd go on that tour Bernie Sanders would on the tour with you I was trying to look up a list of who smoked weed in the White House you said woody harelson woody harelson I think said he smoked there supposedly rumor has it that JFK smoked weed there with Marilyn Monro I wouldn't doubt it to be honest they were probably doing some bad stuff in the Red Room there's a Red Room in the White House not that kind of Red Room well on that note what kind of weed are you smoking today not in the White House yeah I am not smoking my weed with any of the president's children in the White House sadly but today I am smoking some pineapple kush which is about 18% THC interesting middle of the road it's got a nice flavor good high I wouldn't say it's anything exceptional but it tastes nice and green a little sweet the smoke hits nicely it's not too harsh it's got a nice Mellow Smoke and uh like I said middle of the road High kind of nice very indicia heavy you know that kush has a nice indicia keep me in the couch kind of stone well I'm kind of smoking friend weed today oh I love friend weed does this friend weed have a KNE no no it don't but what I have done with it I've been using this grinder for quite some time now and every so often I pluck some of the KE off it so I did a half a bowl of friend weed and then I capped off the other half with the KE and that ke is everything from endgame Pineapple Express White Widow like that this is a like a salad of Keith and so I got half a bowl of friend weed with a half a bowl of Keith on top nice I love saving the KE and being able to use that later but a nice little Keef salad perfect topper for a bowl it's very nice I'm very happy and chatty but my eyes are heavy I will say that who doesn't love the freaking Keith man so so good so tasty such a nice little boost for any bowl and you know honestly it kind of gives you that cough to get off not that you're like gonna cough out a l but that just a good enough a good cough you know it gives you the good cough yeah it's the good cough it's that good cough makes you a little higher makes everything a little warm and fuzzy we were so technical with our weed talk last week that I just had to go like on the on the down low this week with weed yep nothing fancy we went overboard with the weed talk last week but I am nice and mellow and high and ready to talk about ghosties and scary things and you've got ghosts in the white house and I am intrigued I guess I should have known but it never dawned on me this place is like a plethora of like people oh really actually it's a plethora of some old president some old administrators some former presidential pets there's presidential pet ghosts in the white house there is there is wow now you know how we've talked about in the past around the mid to later 1800s Spirit circles seanes Ouija boards spiritualist type things of that nature were relatively popular oh yeah that spiritualist movement was huge then right so around 1862 18 63 Mary Todd Lincoln you know her she was grieving her son Will's death and she began to participate in spirit circles and seances in the Red Room of the White House and also in the presidential Cottage at the soldiers home because spiritualism was so widely popular at that time a lot of the Civil War families did seek comfort in these seances and such so Mary Todd Lincoln would have these Seance parties in the redroom wow can you imagine going to a seance in White House imagine proposing that a f idea today yes Mary Todd Lincoln would you perhaps like to [ __ ] around and find out with a Ouija board in the Red Room today absolutely let me get that on the calendar I swear if I was the president or the president's wife seances would be brought back to the White House Pronto well wasn't uh Reagan's wife wasn't Nancy Reagan like huge into psychics we're getting there sh oh sorry sorry so Mary Todd Lincoln was trying to get her son into the White House all the time but you know because she was having these parties so to say I'll call them parties they obviously were like distraught women yeah she was so broken up over this this was this was a desperate woman trying very hard to get a hold of her deceased child but it was also a bunch of effluential Civil War wives trying to get a hold of their husbands their sons their fathers so imagine a room of all these women trying to pull in all these loved ones and some of them kind of stuck around you know the digs were nice yeah that's a lot of energy to have in a space yeah yeah and some of it never left there are other ones in 1901 began the linking sightings no [ __ ] top hat and all top hat and all wow there was a man between 1901 and 1904 named Jeremiah Jerry Smith and he was working at the White House under the ulyses S Grant Administration as a footman became a butler a cook a Dorman and then listen to this job he became the official duster duster dust you know like dust and your knickknacks yeah that was his job Duster but so Jeremiah Jerry Smith um between 1901 and 1904 claims to have seen not only Lincoln but he said he saw Grant and McKinley as well as several first ladies roaming the Halls while he was dusting he even said that Mary Todd Lincoln came up to him one day and told him that he didn't quite get one of the busts fully dusted well I guess that answers the question I was about to ask I was going to ask if these were like the tape recording ghosts where because of all the intense energies and emotions that I imagine would go into running the country I would think that that would leave recordings of people as they walk down the hallway especially in such a a huge Stone building but those ghosts don't interact with people those are just basically recorded video essentially whereas if she's saying you missed a spot on a bust in another room that's an interactive ghost so that's a little different yeah interactive that's not like see playing over like these these ghosts are actually like present day interacting wow so this is another weird one um there's a lot of weird ghosts there in 1911 they had um a spirit of an unidentified 15-year-old boy that they call the thing well that's a terrible name to give to a kid I know but apparently uh the thing was really frightening some of President ta's uh domestic staff and and they even had their military aid one of the top military AIDS archal but wrote a letter to a family member and said the ghost it seems is a young boy about 14 to 15 years old and they say that the first knowledge one has of the presence of thing is slight pressure on the shoulder as if someone were leaning over your shoulder to see what you might be doing but people have seen Abraham Lincoln he appears obviously in the L bedroom as well as the yellow oval room people who have seen Lincoln check this out Winston Churchill like the Churchill claims to have seen Lincoln in the Lincoln bedroom Winston Churchill himself said he saw the ghost of Linn yes wow in the Lincoln bedroom yes and also you know how I'm bad with pronouncing names so forgive me ahead of time Queen will helmina of the Netherlands that sounds about right claims to have seen Lincoln and the First Lady Grace kulage also claim to see Lincoln now the Lincoln bedroom as we know it now that back during Lincoln's presidency was actually his office oh okay so during his presidency that was his office but present day it is called the Lincoln bed Lincoln bedroom but it was his office interesting the grant Administration in the 1870s they also claimed to have seen Willie Lincoln and Willie Lincoln was the son that Mary Todd Lincoln was grieving I see I see he was 12 and he died of typhoid fever and Tad died at age 18 from pneumonia congestive heart failure or tuberculosis they had four Sons it did say that she was grieving Willie specifically let's see Eddie died at four of tuberculosis and then Willie died at 12 of typhoid and they all died before Lincoln right let see I know that Willie died while Lincoln was President like 1872 maybe yeah they all died before he died well his oldest son lived till 1926 um so he outlived him but the other three boys all died young uh 1850 1862 and 1871 nobody says anything about the other two you only see mention of Willie yeah I think he's the one that died while Lincoln was President so maybe that's why and then and then Tad didn't die until 1871 so she was probably doing all the spiritual stuff like right after Willie died while Lincoln was in office and living in the white house now people say that they see Andrew Jackson lying in his bed in the Queen's bedroom that's creepy which is also called The Rose Room and that you can hear him let out a guttural laugh that's been heard in the white house since the 1860s even Mary Todd Lincoln has claimed to have heard Jackson stomping and swearing no [ __ ] yeah well that sounds like a fun ghost I mean that's kind of interesting people have heard Thomas Jefferson playing his violin in the yellow oval room oh that's nice much better than telling someone they missed a spot while dusting they claim that Dolly Madison protects the Rose Garden oh protects like what does she do chase people off boo all I'm thinking of is like icing filled cakes there's been ghost scene of John Tyler haunting the Blue Room proposing to Julia Gardner his second wife a and they've actually said they've seen apparitions of him down on his knee presenting a ring to her that's kind of a nice ghostly haunting William Henry Harrison haunts the attic he was actually the first president to die in the White House oh okay and now he's stuck in the Attic he's stuck in the Attic like Top Notch I guess Abigail Adams hung laundry in the East room and nowadays people can smell wet laundry and the scent of lavender they've actually named it the lavender room they named the room the lavender room after a ghostly smell yeah cuzette laundry in the scent of lavender well that's kind of fun that wouldn't you call it the laender room they're running out of rooms they got yellow they got red you absolutely i' call I'd call it the lavender ghost room they say that there's an unnamed British soldier um who died during the War of 1812 that roams the White House grounds holding a torch that sounds kind of creepy yeah there's also the ghost of Anna Surat banging on the doors of the White House um because she was pleading with President Andrew Johnson begging for a pardon for her mother who was a Lincoln assassination conspirator oh yeah then and this is interesting because this is you know going relatively recent former First Lady Michelle Obama um had gone visiting school children in 2009 and she told the school children that she and and President Barack Obama sometimes heard strange noises in the hallways at night other times some of the Obama family members felt like something was gnawing or chewing at their feet lots of presidents have had dogs so maybe it was a someone's deceased dog from that's basically what um one of the folklorists that was um a part of this article I read basically stated that she thinks it was one of the long dead white house pets that makes sense oh that's so cute she didn't specifically say anything about President Lincoln but she did hear you know they did say that they hear noises and stuff Jenna Bush Hager who is the daughter of uh former President George W she said her and her twin sister Barbara would hear 1920s piano music coming from the fireplace in their bedroom oh wow because these were you know teenage girls that were Daughters of a president so they lived in the White House Ronald Reagan told stories of how his dog would bark frantically at the entrance of the Lincoln bedroom and would refuse to go inside that sounds like a hot spot Reagan's daughter and son-in-law also reported seeing apparitions of the room um they didn't specifically say that they thought they were apparitions of Lincoln just that they saw apparitions in the room I think you're right I think Lincoln is probably the most predominant it would make sense since his wife was the one who brought in all the spiritualist and did so much calling to spirits and calling to those energies I I'm not surprised that a lot of the sightings are from them and from that time period I really wonder what the proximity of the Red Room where she did all the seances and spiritualist activities where that is in relationship to Lincoln's old office which is now called the Lincoln bedroom right and there is a bed in there that Mary Todd Lincoln bought but they do not think that Lincoln ever slept in the bed he just worked in there as an office correct but that bed has been slep in by most presidents just not necessarily Lincoln even though it's in the Lincoln bedroom and bought by his actual wife and lots of famous people apparently yeah doing God knows what oh my God right can you imagine staying overnight let alone being a kid that grew up in the White House how fun right I know right but imagine being the bush kids and you're laying in bed here in 1920s music coming from your damn fireplace I'd be freaking I would too and especially because I know that that whole place is riddled with secret entrances and secret passageways and there are some secret passageways and secret hidey holes that they Reserve just for the children of presidents like they don't even tell the presidents about them they're just secrets that the children know about so I wouldn't be surprised if they knew a lot of secrets about that house you know I'm surprised that PE people get surprised that Lincoln's they're like about all the people why Lincoln dude's got unfinished business man oh yeah big time he was assassinated T in his prime when there was a lot of stuff going on with a civil war a lot left to do that link bedroom used to be his office so it's like the guy never stopped working you know what I mean makes complete sense plus you know it's a place where a lot of things that people touched and used are still there the bed that Mary Todd purchased is still in that room and as we know items of people's especially ones that they're around or use or have associations with hold on to that type of energy so makes a ton of sense plus she did a lot of [ __ ] around and finding out in that building right seriously Ladybird Johnson um reportedly felt Lincoln standing over her one night when she was watching a TV show about his death oh that would freak me out oh my e that would totally totally freak me out even Elanor Roosevelt said she's seen Lincoln like I said Churchill FDR like these aren't just Susie Smith from down the Street who's a little cuckoo think she sell Lincoln presidents of our country yeah respected heads of state and people you know you would think would have a cool head or you know a Discerning nature you know they'll be paying attention to things not prone to Flights of Fancy right and I mean Laura Bush kind of tried to poo poo her daughters off um publicly on the Today's Show and stuff but when push comes to shove it it it's not just the odd folk that talk about these things like you said well-respected influential socialite aristocratic community members [ __ ] are seeing Lincoln so it's not just us man right Michelle Obama herself I very much respect her I think she's you know she's saying she she's seeing these things and hearing these things so you know it's not just people from history where you're hearing about it this is a contemporary person who says that she had these experiences so that's kind of fun you don't hear a lot about it now but back in the day there were a lot of presidents involved in the Masonic temple and in masonry if you look at the design of the White House and a lot of Washington DC itself the street patterns and stuff a lot of masonic imagery and all of that a lot of our founding fathers you know Declaration of Independence that whole thing all Mason related like they brought this on themselves yeah there's magical energy built into the placement of the streets themselves it's not surprising I really think it would be cool to go to the White House and at the very least okay if you're not going to let me do an overnight candle light tour great I understand whatever let me sleep in the Lincoln bedroom I just want to sleep in the Lincoln bedroom because that's where it's at ma'am well I want to sleep in the Lincoln bedroom and bring a Ouija board oh my God yes I think probably the best we're going to be able to do is to sneak in like a miniature Ouija board do you think the Secret Service agents would get on the Ouija board with us absolutely of course they would they seem like [ __ ] around and find out kind of people they do they'd be hanging out you know they've got the best weed too and they would probably the best stories I'm sure they've seen some [ __ ] and to be honest with you probably half the Secret Service there has seen Lincoln oh I'm sure they all have I bet they all have it sounds like they not allow no if the Secret Service is listening to our podcast today email us the stoned Witches Hour at gmail hear about we want to hear about your Lincoln experiences because we know you've had them so it does seem like there are some random other ghosts there like I said you know beating on the door the dog you got the Rose Garden under lock and key but I think the the prevailing stories especially from former presidents first ladies and presidential family members all surround Lincoln you know I have to say the one that intrigues me and scares me the most is the one about the teenage boy that no one knows where he came from I half wonder if Mary Todd and all these spiritualists trying to call to her son her teenage son brought other teenage boys yeah who or what did they pull in and trap in that house and I I kind of feel bad for him maybe he's someone or is it or is it just one of her other sons and people just don't realize it because if she had three sons that die and they only specifically talk about Willie it could be one of the other two yeah well if that that's where all Abraham's hanging out right maybe his kids are all hanging out there too and they just don't recognize him they're just like hey I'm GNA go be with my dad ghost over here at the White House right but he definitely sounds angry I mean if they're calling him the thing then it sounds like an angry ghost no either either that or I'm thinking Adam's Family maybe if anybody has any stories about because I don't even know if the Public tours because like I said when I went I was probably like 14 I don't know if you get to tour the Lincoln's bedroom or I don't remember do you we didn't on our tour I want to I want to know if anybody has any experiences out there I'm curious as well let us know your white house ghost stories there's obviously something going on and because it's so huge I mean just imagine walking around that place alone at night oh that' be so great with like an EVP recorder and some flashlights and there's got to be a president at some point that agrees to at least at least let a paranormal group come in oh yeah a profession paranormal group how great would that be you know a weekend you know go over wherever you go camp David or whatever and and let us just come in and talk to Lincoln maybe they could do it during that transition period you know when one president is done and the next president that's being elected is coming in and we swoop in and do some ghost hunting in between just a couple hours you know nobody's living there then we could just kind of get in and get out I don't I don't see a problem with that secret service can you Ouija board with us like yeah so Secret Service hit us up up you know let us know we just want to tag around with the professional Ghost Hunters while they go that's all but yeah so you know the White House is pretty it's got a a storied history as you can imagine as we all know I guess I didn't realize just how haunted it actually is I guess you look at it as this like palacial residence that is just free of everything and I was wrong because it sure as hell ain't free of Lincoln I love that there's one more piece to this that might answer your question about the 15-year-old boy yeah and that is that the White House was kind of made by slave folk Yeah by Yeah by enslaved people they did all that work so all these enslaved folk were building the White House and as was common at the time slaves were put into work as young children so there was a theory uh that the boy was actually potentially a Slave laborer who may have died during construction oh that's so sad that would definitely explain the anger because there are you know some of the first families that lived in there also um had some some experiences that's true even before Mary Todd did all the spiritualist stuff there you know people that just origin you said that originally lived there had some experiences as well right and you know it it's so the there was ghosts in the White House you know long before Lincoln and those are kind of being traced back to potential enslaved folk that were tasked with creating the property creating the building building the building maybe some of the first you know they had people that had to actually dig I think I I think I read like three stories deep they had to dig down the White House doesn't just have a traditional onlevel basement it's got like a three-level basement they had enslaved folks dig that down and you know you figure what three stories is like 35 40t that's wow so there is some theory that some of the activity that they can't necessarily pin on either Lincoln or someone specific such as the thing could be the spirits of enslaved folk that would make sense you know again suffering and and that type of that type of expenditure of energy really can make it negative imprint on a place and that could be more of some of the spirits that are kind of on that repetitive reel as opposed to Mary Todd telling people that she hasn't they haven't dusted properly right how rude I mean if you're gonna be a ghost and you're gonna wander around a place as interesting as the White House why the [ __ ] bother with dust I mean really how Petty do you have to be cuz she's a perfectionist first lady duh I guess so but so yeah I mean the White House is just like a treasure Trove of [ __ ] truly a lot of ghosts that's a lot of ghosts well I don't know if I can compete with the number of ghosts but I'm only talking about one ghost but this one ghost actually solved her own murder all right now that's impressive I've gotta say right so this actually happened in 1977 so we're going to go to Chicago Illinois in February of 19 19 77 February 21st to be exact wow I feel like this there was like that was that was just happened that this just we just had an anniversary of this this whole story you know sometimes we get into these stories and you start to see little synchronicities or little weird tid bits start popping up this was one of those stories I had gotten a tip about a woman who had solved her own murder as a ghost and I started looking into it and her name was Elva and for some reason I thought that we had talked about her in a previous episode but while researching Elva I found this other woman named teras Baza and so I started researching her instead just in case we had already talked about Ela well then I realized that this case happened in Chicago Illinois where we've been desperately afraid of the last few episodes and also happened in February right now same time period that we're recording it has one more coincidence that I'll get to at the end so three in total oh man why in threes right so funny all right so so this story is about teras basa and we're going to go to Monday February 21st 1977 so at about 840 p.m. that evening at a an apartment building in Downtown Chicago the Chicago Fire Department got called by the buildings janitor when they get to the apartment building everybody has been evacuated one of the apartments has black smoke rolling out of the windows probably the source of the fire I would imagine you are exactly right when the police get into the apartment they see that it has been completely trashed and the source of the fire is a burning mattress in the bedroom yeah when they pull the mattress away and get the fire put out they discover a smoldering pile of clothes underneath it and under the smoldering pile of clothing was a woman's naked body and she had been stabbed in the heart a oh that's shitty the woman's name was Terra Baza a 47-year-old woman she had been born in the Philippines as an only child and graduated college in Manila and moved to the United States where she got a master's degree in music from Indiana University and as many of us do she did not work in the field where she got her degree shocking right she actually worked in the medical field as a respiratory therapist so she was employed at Edgewater hospital and by all accounts was very happy lived a great life and she did give music lessons on the side so music was still a part of her life she was actually back in school at that time going for her doctoral thesis in music at lyola University so she by all accounts had a great life a lot of friends had a great time that Monday started out as a normal day for her she worked her normal shift at the hospital and then went home and spoke to a friend that evening her friend Ruth loab recounts that she had spoken to teras at about 7:30 and teras at that time said she had to get off the phone because she was expecting a man to come over and Ruth didn't ask for any details and that was the last time she spoke to her friend well obviously the man must have did it right but nobody had a name at that point they couldn't ascertain if anything had been stolen from the apartment and they at first thought that maybe teras had been sexually assaulted a Coroner's report said that she hadn't been but I'm going to go on record right now and say that's probably [ __ ] I'm guessing they probably said she hadn't been sexually assaulted because they found no semen and they found no bruises but honestly you and I both know that someone can be sexually assaulted without that and she was found naked nothing seemed to have been stolen from the apartment they found her wallet there her keys were there you know nothing seemed to be gone although the apartment was trashed so they were quite surprised the autop autopsy said no sign of sexual assault and they had no leads the only thing they had was the phone call with Ruth loab and there was a note on a table that said remember to get theater tickets for as but none of her friends none of her friends knew who as was was and so the case kind of went cold for a couple months they interviewed her boyfriend they interviewed her friends they had no leavs back then there was no security cameras no security cameras no DNA you know no way to check any of that there was a detective on the case named Joe stachula and he was determined to find out who had murdered teras and the case had kind of gone cold until July of 1977 so that July Joe got into work one morning and found a note telling him to call the Evanson Police Department regarding the Bosa murder he of course rang them right up to try and get this information so an officer at the Evon Police Department said that a man named Dr Jose Chua a doctor who lived in skoki which is a suburb of Chicago had come to them with some information so stula and his partner Detective Lee epin went to the doctor's home to ask him what he knew what information he might possibly have about the teras Bassa case when they got to the home Dr Chua seemed reluctant to talk about what he knew and kind of embarrassed he asked the detectives if they believed in the Supernatural if they believed in ghosts what Dr Chua says that his wife Remy his wife Remy claimed to have been possessed by teras boss's ghost she also worked at the hospital where teras had worked at as a respiratory therapist and they knew each other a little bit they weren't friends but they knew of each other Remy claims that one day after a long shift she'd gone into the break room to take a nap and had disturbing dreams where teras was trying to talk to her and she says when she woke up she saw teras standing next to her and she told her that she needed help and that she knew who had killed her and that she wanted Remy to help her and then she disappeared oh wow Remy thought that she had been sleeping and so she just kind of forgot about it but the dreams kept getting worse and worse she told her husband about it and they decided that it was just dreams and they weren't going to do anything about it until one day Remy was sleeping at home and she woke up Suddenly and her husband Joe was right there when Remy started talking in a different voice Not only was she talking in a different voice but she was speaking Tagalog which was a a language that she knew a little bit but wasn't fluent in what language is that that's a language from the Philippines where teras basa was and teras new Tagalog was this a case essentially of she knew that this was basically someone who would be receptive like you reach out to someone who's going to listen quite possibly it very much seems that way while she is speaking to her husband in this strange voice speaking Tagalog she said she was Terra Baza and asked him for his help oh wow she also said that she was murdered by a man named Alan shy and that she wanted Dr Chua to go to the police and tell them during this time talking to Dr Chua she said that she had uh asked Alan shy a man who also worked at the hospital I believe as an orderly to help her come fix her television and that he came and killed her instead and stole some of her jewelry oh [ __ ] yeah but they didn't they say they didn't see anything missing they did but you know it was just a couple pieces of jewelry how would the police know right she asked Dr Chua to go to the police and then the voice was gone and his wife woke up having no memory of what happened they decided not to call the police they thought maybe this was just some weird dream effect or some type of sleep talking it happened again a week later oh [ __ ] that's when you know just pick up the damn phone and call the cops and be done with it same voice different from his wife speaking this different language and this time she's angry and she wants the doctor to go to the police she says she has proof she gave Dr the names and phone numbers of family members and said that they would recognize her jewelry that Allan had taken from her and said go to the police with this information so now he and his wife decide okay feel like they have something tangible to say this is an awful lot of very specific information let's just go to the police that's when uh the detective got the information and showed up at Dr chua's house after getting all of this information the detective believed him he says that in all of his experience as a detective he's gotten very very good when Witnesses are telling him stories he says he can tell pretty much whether they believe it or whether they're lying right he could tell that this doctor believed it and the name Alan shy matched the initials on the letter that they had not released yes so they figured this is at least enough information to kind of go on so they went to alen sh's apartment and found his girlfriend there his very pregnant girlfriend and asked her a few questions and she said that Alan had given her some jewelry and said that it was a belated Christmas present so they called the family members and had them come in and they also asked the girlfriend to come into the station with all of her jewelry not just the pieces that she said Alan had given her recently so she comes in with all her jewelry and spreads it all out and these family members of teras basses look at the jewelry and say yes this ring and that necklace and they picked out several pieces that had belonged to teras oh wow those matched exactly the pieces that the girlfriend says that Allan had given her just recently they use this information to bring Allan in he initially denied all of it once they confronted him with this other information he then admitted that he'd gone to her apartment but said that he left because he didn't have enough tools to do what she needed and he said he never went back so the detective Ives now although he says you know he wasn't there they're pretty sure based on this information that they've got the right guy so even though they kind of originally got the tip from a ghost they continue to follow up on researching these Clues into Allen showy so after confronted with the jewelry information he finally confessed to the murder he said that he after he left the apartment they had had a fight and he decided he was going to go back and Rob her because he needed rent money he came back with the tools and and as soon as she turned around he killed her he said he had stripped off her clothes to make it look like a sexual assault and then piled more clothing on top of her and started it on fire then put the mattress on top of that and lit it on fire to try and cover up his crime so you were wrong she was not sexually assaulted right I I don't know his history he has a history of sexual assault um and robbery so I don't know I think he was just trying to not get those charges but maybe not doesn't look too good with a pregnant girlfriend no he did ransack the house the apartment looking for money and didn't find enough and that's when he decided to take the jewelry to at least make it worth something so the case went to trial on January 21st 1979 but it ended up in a hung jury I mean can you imagine being presented with the information that it was a ghost that tipped the detectives off but they still got the right guy because he confessed so why was that relevant he then recanted the confession and said that he was pressured by police officers and the only reason that he confessed is because they said they were going to charge his pregnant girlfriend because she had the stolen merchandise oh but then again after the hung jury this is another weird part after the hung jury he was awaiting retrial he was probably going to get off he then went into court voluntarily against the wishes of his attorney he was on the verge of being a free man this is February 20th 1979 he's going to be a free man a mistrial had been declared two days later February 22nd he shows up in front of Judge Barbaro who tried over the case and against his attorney's advice again plad guilty and confessed to the murder of teras what what yeah I don't know it's kind of a back and forth back and forth so he confessed then he said it was a coerced confession the jury was hung they were going to have a mistri and then against his own attorney's advice he confessed again I don't know maybe the ghost visited him in jail I was going to say maybe his girlfriend put the pressure on him it's possible he was sentenced to 14 years in prison and additional four years for arson in burglary and he went to Stateville Penitentiary but he was paroled in July of 1983 after serving just a little over four years oh wow that's [ __ ] up I kind of was looking to see what had happened to him because he should be roughly 76 uh 77 right now and interestingly enough he bounced around Chicago area and then to New York City and then ended up in Colton California and now resides in Riverside California nuh yes as far as I can tell he is still currently alive and living in Riverside California wow now I have to give you a little more information here because some people say that it's possible that Remy Dr chua's wife maybe had overheard a few things you know maybe this ghost story wasn't necessarily a ghost story maybe she had heard some things and this was the only way she knew how to get the information out safely possibly I don't know why she wouldn't just go to the police why yeah but what about the phone numbers and stuff you don't just pull people's phone numbers out of your [ __ ] and have them be accurate right and while she knew teras basa from all accounts they weren't best friends not the type of people who knows your family memb phone numbers right exactly now another strike against Remy's testimony is that uh Remy had been fired that same day when she first said that she had seen the ghost of teras basa and she had actually blamed I believe Alan shy was part of the reason why she had gotten blamed so there was a little bit of bad beef between the two of them yeah but if you know someone's a killer you're not going to be their friend that's very true that's very true so I don't know the jewelry is pretty damning and the second confession also pretty damning I'm just saying where the you know you don't just make up phone numbers and have them be accurate exactly and and how would she know of the specific jewelry and there's a lot of details that I don't think could be explained by hearing random rumors and if so many rumors were flying around why didn't these people come forward why didn't she come forward why make up an elaborate ghost story hoax that the lece might not even listen to so I don't know teras Baza seems to have come back from Beyond the Grave to possess Remy Chua and uh solve her own murder when the police had been stumped and had no leads that's what happens when you're a woman and the fate of your destiny of your soul is in the hands of some guy and move over [ __ ] let me just handle this myself yeah it's been five months you haven't gotten anywhere I gave you the initials let me handle it I'll give you the full name right so this is actually in court records witness number 46 ghost number 12 it's in actual court cases that this information came from a ghost and came from a possession that's funny I got to admit that's funny right how cool is that so yeah so sometimes people can come back when it's important enough I guess apparently like I said she was just pissed off that the men in her life and around her were just not getting [ __ ] done and she's like move over hold my beer I got my own murder to solve because you're obviously not doing it she had to bring her own justice so good for her good for you terita Baza I'm sorry you had to get murdered but I'm so glad you were able to solve it you know this leads me to a question what's that sh did she have any sort of spiritual background and the reason I ask that you and I being witchy type women I could see both of us being like you [ __ ] if you cannot solve this I'm just going to haunt a [ __ ] and figure out how to tell you how to do it for yourself because obviously I have to do the work for you even dead can't even rest dead still gota do the work so I could see someone like you or I being like all right we're gonna haunt some people and get this [ __ ] done did she have any spirituality background that could potentially make us think that she knew enough to be able to reach out to someone who would listen I don't know I haven't seen any of that but I do know that she was you know she was born to a wealthy family she was an only child she obviously loved education before she moved to the US she got her degree then while she was here she was working on her doctoral degree she was a respiratory therapist so she was definitely someone who loved education and learning and in the 70s she was a single woman living in a fashionable apartment in Chicago so you know that's definitely a strong powerful person I mean [ __ ] you pretty much couldn't get your own credit card until a couple years before that at that time so without a man without a man you know she so she definitely was a force to be reckoned with at least in some ways to be a single woman with that many accomplishments at that time because I'm just thinking you know if I go down dirty the first thing I'm doing is phing a friend you better [ __ ] come to my house tell me what the [ __ ] happened so I can go curse that [ __ ] right just from what I could find of her she seemed like a very cool woman nice but I I still think I beat you this week just with linkoln oh my gosh you have so many ghosts I just have the one mine is the crime solver yours is the spooky overabundance of Paranormal Activity I love it yours is smart enough to get her own [ __ ] done and mine just won't stop working that's just wild I think I still I don't think there's anywhere we can go for this one but I think I'm still going to avoid Illinois because that is spooky there's something about Illinois that's just getting creepier and creepier and I never knew this and like recently I just feel like yeah let's avoid that state because they just no you know let me retract that let's go to Illinois and get the [ __ ] scared out of us that's what we need to do that sounds good so we will visit all of Illinois and then we will go and decipher all the Masonic symbolism in DC and see if we can convince someone to let us do a flashlight overnight night haunted tour of the White House someone's got to let us do it you know we've talked about the White House and some presidents enough that we probably on some like flagged list now there's probably some lowlife minimum wage secret service agent that's now tasked with listening to our podcast oh hey CIA agent who's signed to us now so if you are from the CIA or the Secret Service and you've been tasked with listening to us because of how much we've mentioned the White House please call your superiors let us let us get the breaking paranormal story just let us one night like it it doesn't even have to be overnight I'd be good with six hours wouldn't you be good with six hours sure give me two hell yeah like I just want to just be in the Lincoln bedroom and chat with Lincoln so make that happen because if you're sitting in here listening we might as well get something out of it too and I want to talk to Lincoln and to be honest I'm totally going to smoke a joint on the roof you know I want to go with Dolly Madison in the Rose Garden and then here's the thing so we'll go smoke in the Rose Garden and we're going to take a box of Dolly Madison cupcakes with us that should bring all the ghosts out and we are going to go pay homage to Dolly Madison by eating Dolly Madison's while getting high in the Lincoln bedroom I don't know if they'll let us smoke inside it might be the Rose Garden okay let's smoke in the Rose Garden and then we'll take the Dolly Madison to the Lincoln bedroom right right so yes CIA we got a plan give us a ring let us know and if you've seen a ghost email us and we promise we will not say who you are you will be an unidentified inside source yes you'll be an unidentified
