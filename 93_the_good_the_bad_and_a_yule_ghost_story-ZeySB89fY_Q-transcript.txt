Cardinals and it has Cardinals on it don't Cardinals have like a some type of meaning for like a spiritual meaning so here's the thing they say if you see a Cardinal it is like the spirit of a loved one coming to visit okay so it's like a it's like your ancestors coming back like one of your one of your beloved Dead coming to say hi yeah basically but I think instead of being more like far back ancestors it's more like people that you've known in this life who've passed on right like your recent dead your beloved dead right right like you know maybe your grandma or something and when you see a cardinal I guess it's that like them saying hi it's funny because you know there's the theme of our our show today right there it is ghosties coming at Christmas time well before we get to the Ghost

01970 and I just love seeing stuff in the Box me too how fun now we've had our sweet let's get to the Noto Sweet let's get to some scary things that have been in the news lately shell man I hate the news right now nothing good is coming out of the news no nothing good is so I've kind of been avoiding it but this got pointed out to me by some of our witchy friends um because there's a couple cases of witch discrimination going on in the United States this pisses me off I just need to put that out there first and foremost so the first one that happened is in Tulsa Oklahoma at the Tulsa city council there is times an invocation given in the past it has usually been Christian recently christop Patrick who is an outgoing council member asked her High Priestess Amy Hardy McAdams to come in and to give the invocation now I just want to I have a problem already what's that if you are going to exercise your your your freedom of religion and all that but like why did she do it at her last one when she was outgoing why didn't she try to do it when she you know midterm you know you know what I mean yes but before we jump to bad reasons a good reason for doing it that way is exactly what happen happen the backlash because she knew that it would not be accepted and it was not in fact there have been several comments made including by Governor Kevin stit the Oklahoma governor Kevin stit said quote Satan is trying to establish a foothold but Oklahoma is going to be a shining City on the hill Tulsa city council needs to stand strong against actions like this and tulson need to remember who allowed this at The Ballot Box can we just start with that's your God not ours buddy right exactly and that's the point sh is is yes maybe she should have tried this earlier but he's not the only person to have called her a Satanist quite a few people in government are saying that this was a satanistic speech and we know that it isn't so the fact that she did it on her last day she still did it knowing that it was going to get this kind of backlash they just make themselves look uneducated but they have a base and those people are riled up and starting to call this Satanism no I I I heard that that both of these women were even getting death threats that's ridiculous in this day and age the fact that witchcraft is still equated with Satanism is absolutely ridiculous and interestingly The High Priestess Amy Hardy McAdams got the idea for this speech from one of our favorite pag Lara Tempest zakov Lara has recently said a few things for these coming troubled times and she's invoking Medusa and she says uh snakes up tits out which I think is an excellent slogan but this invocation was to Medusa to that protection that Justice figure we actually have the speech and I'll post the speech on our social media but she invoked Medusa to you know to bring Justice and you know if you if you read the whole thing it's quite fitting for the current times just but you know I think that there are still a lot of places that are setting their ways and are hypocritical and do as I say not as I do and that puts people's safety at risk it really does and uneducated or not they're putting people back in that room closet and that's not where we should be in 2024 I agree and I have reached out in this particular case to Governor Kevin stit to Amy Hardy McAdams and to Christa Patrick for comments and I haven't heard back from any of them as of yet future Lea will pop in here if we do hear from them I just love the fact that you freaking reached out to the damn Governor like well you know if he wants to call me a Satanist bring it on and and and I just want to point out we are not knocking folks who follow the Temple of Satan satanists are some of my favorite activists I just happen to not be one actually here in Salem they have um the the headquarters of the Temple of Satan and every time I drive by it I'm like look there's Satan's house um nice people we're not knocking it but we also aren't them either they give out free hugs they really do they really do seriously though for just a second the satanic temple in Salem Massachusetts is very cool they were founded in 2013 and part of their mission is to stop quote the intrusion of Christian values on American politics and I can definitely get behind that so we do like the satanic temple but that doesn't mean that that we are them that's right the thing here is that not that they're calling us real Satanist this guy is is calling them the Christian version of Satanism you know it's their own God that they just won't knowledge and I was willing to think that maybe it was just a one-off and then I heard Another Story Another discrimination story why why is this happening right now this one has to do with a Christmas parade in a town called parkerburg in West Virginia they have a parade every year and you're allowed to submit a float and the group called The Appalachian Pagan Ministry had a float all ready to go in the parade and we're told last minute that they were not allowed because of their faith now first of all that's illegal like that's that's that's illegal and I'm not saying that what happened in Tulsa isn't illegal but like this is like like red flag illegal yeah yeah well at least in Tulsa she was allowed to speak they just called her names afterwards right right but this is like blatantly illegal like you can't do this because you are pagan like that like that is illegal it gets worse shell I reached out to Donna I love that you just like got pissed off at all of this stuff and like just started emailing people about about these things I am not going to be quiet anymore I am no longer going to allow like this to pass it just should not so if I can amplify it in any way I'm absolutely going to you know solidarity is is definitely the way to to go and for those who can kind of stand up and Unite Here we are absolutely and no disrespect to those who are not able to for a myid of reasons but for those who can you know Now's the Time to be loud and proud so I reached out to Reverend Donna Donovan who is the organizer for this and she did get back to me you tell she saids that her application the application for the group's float was approved at the beginning of the week the day before the parade she gets a call from the parade volunteers and they said that the mayor had decided to not accept their entry because they were Pagan and quote on your website it states that you work with satanists and Donna said yes we do we are a pan Pagan organization that works to facilitate the practice of those non-abrahamic paths who are incarcerated formally incarcerated and or in recovery from substance abuse everybody deserves a second chance  exactly so Reverend Donna said because she apparently is taking no either that she was going to make it very clear that the mayor was violating their civil rights and she is 100% going to file a complaint with the doj Civil Rights Division and they got back in touch with the mayor even after telling him exactly what title and section of the law he would be in violation of they called back and said I'm so sorry Donna the mayor said absolutely not now I don't know if you've looked this guy up online but I've looked up the parkerburg West Virginia mayor I'm not surprised and again you know this goes back to to lack of education and how he is not being prosecuted he should be just discrimination it's literally religious discrimination and is a clear case of religious discrimination and Donna knows the letter of the law so she will be following up on this and I will let you guys know what happens you know go Donna you know rock on and we are proud of you and we appreciate you standing for all those who can't stand up for us and thank you for all that the Appalachian Pagan Ministry does what a great group I know right so there's our sweet and our sour for this episode damn well you know hey this is this is the modern Ule this is this is winter solstice with pagans we we're not going to shy away from the bad you know we're we're gonna Embrace both sides of the holiday okay let's get into some fun stuff though all right now we've talked in the past about ghost stories and UL traditions and this is something I think that the Western world needs to embrace we did talk on our last episode about how Ule is kind of almost just as thin veiled as as sa and ghosts go hand inand within Veil come on now yeah and there are several Traditions that talk about you know your your Dead come back around sin and then they get escorted back to the other world to the Nether world to the summerlands at this time of year so this is when they're they're kind of like the last Harrah they're going to say goodbye now now I don't know how this ever got lost because obviously I love this but in Victorian times this was like a huge huge thing yeah exactly they think the ghost telling tradition goes back to the Victorian era and possibly even further back it is the middle of winter it's dark it's cold and creepy so that goes hand inhand with telling ghost stories but there's also the tradition of the Beloved Dead uh walking the land and one last time before they get carried off in the wild Hunt and you know the Victorian eras also when the spiritualism movement was really popular so ghost stories of course were a huge part of that now even though people kind of have have lost this tradition there are hints of it still and one of them is what is the most favorite thing people go watch um like a theater production or or whatnot Miracle on 3 4 Street AB which I can't stand I've never seen that all the way through I haven't either it's too depressing to be honest um a Muppet Christmas Carol Muppet Christmas Carol come on now I mean it doesn't get better than the M like the Muppet version the best version yeah L take a step back and okay yeah that was okay that was a good one right yeah yeah all right right but yeah so anyway yeah A Christmas Carol pi step back and look at it that is a ghost story right I mean Scrooge has the three ghosts past present and future and you know I kind of like that and and that's kind of really why I've always liked A Christmas Carol you kind of end the year with this is what you done this is where you're at and if you don't get your together this is where you're headed kind of like how we said that's probably why Krampus and figures like that are getting to be more popular right you know on the new year everybody's like oh I'm going to start a new all my resolutions that I'm never going to do you know you have that sense of starting over on the new year so you know Ule time is really a good time to reflect and sometimes your Ghosts come back to haunt you figuratively and literally isn't there that um that Christmas uh Carol that's uh the line goes they'll be scary goes stories and tales of the glories of Christmases long long ago it's the most wonderful time of the year yeah there you go yeah that literally says there'll be scary ghost stories yeah but so but people like kind of almost miss that when they're singing the song but you know it really was kind of a Cornerstone of this time of year we were talking about before we started recording that you know I'm trying to get more in touch with this season I've spent quite a few years in California in Southern California so I've been out of touch with the natural Seasons that I grew up with the cold ass wary say that's right now that I'm on a Mountaintop a literal Mountaintop in Pennsylvania hker down I have a lot of snow you know so I'm I'm connecting with my land in ways that are a little different you know and I'm I'm trying to embrace the cold but I'm going within a lot more I guess is the point I'm I'm reading more I'm journaling more I'm you know I could see where you know it can get a little heavy well and also you know it's getting darker we haven't quite hit that you know Darkest Night quite yet it's kind of that you know you're prone to go within you're you're you're prone to kind of see into the Shadows you know Shadows are there longer this is why we have lots of lights and the trees why you have a tree in your bathroom one of our listeners said she had three trees in her bathroom sh I love I love it my people my people and that's why I kind of embrace all the lights and the decorations and we just got our tree today and how fun is that you know to kind of really Embrace that part of the Season helps to bring you up out of those shadows and you know I can see we're telling a ghost story could also do that like those are fun scares you know those are scares that you can kind of feel good and safe afterwards right yeah I mean it's it's you know kind of like that story of Scrooge and and the whole thing you know it's yeah it's scary to kind of see where you've been where you're at and where you're going just like a tarot reading nothing set in a stone and you have the ability to kind of change things or get things on track if that's what's needed so you know they they almost kind of play into the ghost stories help that wheel turn to the next Notch and we also talked about in our last episode that this can be a good time to do some letter writing you know write a letter to your recent dead you know people that you know that have passed in the last year maybe burn it in a in a cauldron or keep it in a journal but this is a good time to write those letters in ritual space to them maybe when you see a cardinal you know you can uh send a message to them with that Cardinal I love that now do you have a ghost story I do have a ghost story I actually reached out to a couple friends because you know that I love a lady in white ghost story you and your grand lady and white it's my absolute favorite ghosty folk tale and I vaguely remember that that one of my college friends from Way Way Back hi Lindsay had said something about a a christmy one so I got in touch with her and indeed I have a lady in white Christmas ghost story for you oh Lord here we go let me guess let me guess she was in white and on the side of a highway yes how did you know oh my God that's awesome because I didn't know you must be psychic no all the lady and white ghost stories are all pretty much the same this is a folk that usually has um a kernel of Truth a tragedy that happened but every single one goes very similarly a woman usually either a bride to be or a recent bride or a woman going to meet a man meets a tragic end then her ghost keeps coming back trying to get to a certain place and scares everybody but the ghost stories usually do have a kernel of Truth to them not always but sometimes now how does this relate to this time of because it happened this time of year so let me tell you okay so let me tell you the whole story now I'm going to leave it to you guys I could not find online any information about this particular lady in white folktale so if anyone is from the Ashfield area of Massachusetts please let me know if this is something that you have heard of before and Lindsay while she is a fabulous Storyteller and an amazing repository of folk knowledge and ghosty Tales has been known on occasion to embellish them so she's not exactly a reliable narrator I'm sorry Lind but it's true I love you so we'll see you guys let me know what you think wow you're hardcore man all right you ready shell I'm ready all right are you comfy you cozy got some tea I do all right here we go okay so this happened again in Massachusetts in rural Massachusetts now is this far from me am I going to have to like find different ways to drive I don't know while I telling a story you look how far Ashfield is okay so Ashfield this story supposedly has been told a lot in Ashfield apparently this is a popular folk story that everyone tells all the time particularly around the winter solstice especially when it snows and I'll tell you why the details kind of change like a lot of these stories do hold on this is actually near the New York border H okay so we could like meet there right right all right so maybe we'll have to plan a trip for that all right so this Story begins on the winter solstice in the in the early 1800s so there was a young woman her name was supposedly Elanor gray this name changed very little depending on the different uh tellings so it's probably true so this young Elanor gray Was preparing to go to a grand annual party at a nearby Manor on Ashfield Lake like a lot of these stories go she was very kind and beautiful but also very poor and every year at this big estate there was a huge winter solstice ball and pretty much all the young people would go there and that's where they would all hook up and meet their future spouses nice nice that'd be so romantic right it's like Bridgerton and wichter Solstice right so Eleanor of course really wanted to go because she dreamed of finding a rich husband right so she prepared for years she scrimped and saved you know she worked different jobs trying to save enough money to make a beautiful dress and she and her mother sewed this gorgeous white silk dress that she was going to wear to the solstice ball now rumor has it that Eleanor had not actually waited for the ball to find her one true love and had hooked up with not one but two lucky gentlemen in town she was involved with the blacksmith hot right big arms can't blame her s right she was also involved with one of the sons I don't know if it was the eldest or not uh depending on the story it was either the oldest son or the youngest son but one of the sons of the very manner where this yearly ball was held so rich Swanky dude right now rumor also has it she was pregnant and didn't know who the father was and neither guy knew about the other supposedly yikes yikes so this winter souls's ball was very special to Elanor because she had told one one of the gentlemen that she was going to meet him at the ball and they would run away and be married yeah they all lie she had told the other guy she was going to meet him the morning after the ball when everyone was still sleeping and distracted and run away and get married so she was going to see if the first guy showed and if he didn't she'd fall back on the other exactly yeah yeah nobody knows who was who which guy she was going to leave with at the party and which guy she had as backup the next morning so the night of the winter solstice rolls around and she dresses into this gorgeous white silk gown and her parents don't want her to go because the weather is getting bad I get it if you see on the map where it's at I totally get it she knows that this is going to be her last night at home but she's not telling her parents so she's piling on everything she can find of value all her jewelry she's pinning ribbons in her hair and beautiful silver clips and as she pins in the last white ribbon the snow really starts to come down uh oh Father forbids her from going and she leaves anyway oh yeah there was a terrible argument she storms out of the house jumps into the carriage and off she goes into the woods and to the bridge over the South River to get to the lake where the party was going to be and that's where people think that tragedy struck what happened she never made it to the ball so of course she never met guy number one or guy number two later the next morning by now people are worried CU she never came home either where's the horse they go looking for her of course they try to trace the route that she would have taken and by the bridge they find the horse and the cart nobody knows exactly what would have happened because there was nothing wrong with the bridge it didn't look like she had gone off the bridge there were no tracks that went down the road to the water there were no Footprints of any kind there's a UFO I know it it was just the horse the horse was lame and there was blood on the seat of the carriage was the horse lay before it left they don't think so at least I didn't see anything about that so they searched the area and on the shore of the river they found a large piece of white satin covered in blood but no tracks around it and nothing disturbed by the water there was no sign of her body in the water under the bridge or anywhere in the woods she was eaten I know it maybe or aliens there were rumors flew of course they said that one of the boyfriends or the other boyfriend had found out about the other one killed her right confronted her on the bridge and killed her or you know maybe it was a highway man maybe she got cold feet nobody knows what happen happened maybe it was aliens maybe she went into labor and tried to run and hide and froze to death as far as I know she wasn't noticeably pregnant yet so I don't think that but maybe it could have been a miscarriage right yeah and maybe she went towards the water maybe but all I know is they never found her body but very quickly after that she was on the bridge wasn't she the people started seeing her every time it would snow they'd see her walking across the bridge but as soon as they would get to her she'd be gone people that didn't know about it when it would snow would talk about seeing this pale woman in a white gown bloodied but as soon as they would stop to offer her a ride she'd be gone oh my God I want to go look it's only like two hours away from here sometimes they would say she'd climb up into the carriage and then when they would get across the bridge she would have disappeared and typical sometimes there was water or ice left on the seat which is a common Trope in these white lady stories now there's a few more things so the first few people that would see her ghost obviously thought it was her only to have it disappear when they would get close to her now sometimes people would find themselves after they would chase after her they'd find themselves at the bank of the river without realizing that was the direction they were going in almost like the ghost was trying to lead them to the river oh and it's thought that at least three drownings that happened in the decades after right around the winter solstice that they're pretty sure could be attributed to the lady in white like them like trying to chase after her and then like falling in the water right they obviously don't know for sure but because these drownings happened on or near the winter solstice during a snowstorm and because of Word of Mouth comments of other people saying that they had been chasing this woman during a snowstorm and ended up at the river without realizing that was the direction they were going in so they kind of think maybe those Dr are attributable to her it kind of went away for a little while until a Salesman in the 1970s was driving through the woods along the road during a blizzard on the winter solstice and he saw a woman on the side of the road walking in a white dress and her hair was like wild around her head and he said that something something about the way she was moving kind of freaked him out so he really wasn't going to stop even though it was a woman in a dress and a snowstorm but he went by her very slowly because the roads were slippery and he looked over to her and she turned to look at him and he said her face was quote a pale lifeless mask and her eyes were solid black and glinted like shards of ice oh my God he said she was bloodied down the front and he just freaked out and without even realizing it he just floored it and was gone when he looked back nothing nobody was in his rear view we really need to go there another one said that a farmer's son probably in the late 70s early 80s picked up a hitchhiker along the road during a snowstorm on the winter solstice you guessed it and he gave her his coat because she was shivering badly she actually got in the car but she didn't talk he said uh she smiled and he just kind of paid attention to the road because it was really slippery and snowing really really badly then he get across the bridge and he was going to let her out and looked over to where she was sitting and the seat was empty where was his coat aha no coat there was no coat there but when he got home his coat was folded on the front porch covered in ice no no now I look up this town and we're talking a population as of 2020 of under 2,000 so like this ain't like no big ass town no I guess not so from what I understand that the bridge is no longer there but there is a a modern road that goes near where the bridge was and um on the banks of the river well I'll find it don't worry supposedly it shouldn't be too hard to find because supposedly just off the road before you get to the river where this bridge was the local people have built like maybe a little Shrine they put white ribbons and little things there sometimes they'll go on the winter solstice and make offerings to the white lady of South riverbridge God I love it I love it supposed supposedly my friend stayed there at some point and was there during the winter so here's her story she says I saw her once and I swear I'll never drive on that road again so it happened on the night of the winter solstice she had been at a party but didn't you say that the bridge was no longer there so how did your friend ride on it the road next to it the road that goes next to it is where people see her now like not necessarily across the bridge that bridge is gone there's another Bridge across the river from what I understand but as far as I know the river the road goes by where the bridge was and the river and that's where she walks okay she said she'd been at a a Ule party with some friends and because the snowstorm was getting worse she decided to take a shortcut home and go that road along the river and the snow started coming down really fast and she was getting like tunnel vision you know when it comes down really fast yeah yeah yeah and she said as she rounded the bend near where the old South River Bridge was that's when she saw the woman standing in the side of the road in her headlights pale figure long white gown crazy hair billowing in the wind her first thought was that it was just a woman who had somehow maybe left a party and gotten stranded and she thought that her dress was really inappropriate for the weather obviously but she says there was something weird about the way she moved which is also what someone else had said and so of course Lindsay decided she'd give her a ride cuz you know she's a girls girl and she says every hair on the her body was standing on end but but she was like even though this feels weird as I cannot leave this woman on the side of the road in nothing but a dress she said every psychic alarm Bell was going off but she slowed down anyways and as she slowed down she says This Woman's head tilted towards her and their eyes met through the snow and she said they were black Hollow pits and the way that this woman looked at her made Lindsay's stomach lurch like she wasn't looking at her but was looking through her and all she could feel was just like a sense of loss and Dread and she said her warm car got icy so she physically froze and she said her car had kind of idled as she had been thinking about stopping to pick this woman up and as she was deciding whether or not to come to a complete stop this woman raised her hand and it wasn't like she was saying hi it was more like she was commanding her to stop and Lindsay says the snow kind of muffled everything and she said her ears started ringing and she realized that her radio that had been playing Christmas music was completely silent and she says when the woman took a step towards her that's when she saw the blood and that's it she said her fight or flight kicked in she hit the gas and she took off she looked in the rear view and just like everyone else nothing no one was there how reputable is this lindsy girl let me tell you the last bit because it's cool Lindsay gets to her house and much like the gentleman with the jacket when she got out of her car she saw on the passenger side a handprint in the frost on the glass and there was just a little bit of blood dripping down from it oh  okay I'm gonna call probably  on the handprint but everything else probably true okay okay I trust your judgment good story though right my God I still want to go there right me too especially on the winter Solstice it's coming up maybe we should make a trip seriously it's not that far it's like a half hour from Albany not to to go left turn here but all of the white L stories are similar and they're
