it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends on opposite sides of the USA tell stories to Spook each other out while smoking mass quantities of the best cannabis in the land welcome to episode 24 and if you've gotten this far and are having fun along with us why don't you give us five stars and maybe a review representing all things West Coast witchy and wedy I'm Leila and I am somewhere I am shell I am I don't know what I am today you are shell in The Ether lost in the clouds yeah up in a cloud of cannabis smoke new Grandma clouds or lost in the land of work haziness not sure where you are it's the beginning of Summer does that to me I think I don't know what day it is anymore I'm completely confused I don't know what's going on it happens I feel like I'm like that on the regular and before anyone says that uh it's all the marijuana that does it I think we were like this I know I was like this before I started smoking yeah yeah yeah it's just a personality flaw What can you do what can you do but today shell is a very special day what's today today is World UFO day oh who knew I didn't know there was such I didn't know there was such a day isn't that the coolest thing now there's two different dates that it could be celebrated on one is June 24th and one is July 2nd and the most popular one is July 2nd and do you know why they picked those two days first of all why did they pick those two days and second of all why was July 2nd more relevant I'm so glad you asked they picked those two days because June 24th 1947 is the first recorded sighting in modern times of flying saucers and I think we talked about this gentleman it was uh Kenneth Arnold above mount rineer in the Cascade mountain region and I think we did talk about that at one yeah and he's the one that kind of coined the um flying SAU even though he said they were Crescent shaped he said they moved like they were skipping across the water as if you had thrown a flying disc and so that's how they got this the term Flying Saucer even though he said that they were shaped like a crescent anyway so what's the July 2nd Date has to do with whatever and the July 2nd Date is something else that we talked about that's the Roswell incident same year July 2nd 1947 that's the day when the famous Roswell incident happened I got GOA that makes sense and because the Roswell incident is the more well-known of the two that's why people have pretty much unanimously voted that July 2nd is World UFO day well I don't know if you've seen this you know how I've been I've been scouring news lately we talked about a news story last time we have that so you're normally not a newsy you I really not but what has happened recently is they came out with some reports about how the Navy or that maybe it was the Air Force I don't know they were surrounded by like a hundred UFO crafts and that just came out in the last week or so out in the news more of those Tic Tac shaped things I don't know if they were Tic Tac shaped but they they were being basically bombarded by UFOs oh wow yeah you know it seems like it's coming maybe because they've kind of lifted the veil of secrecy in the last couple years but it does seem like there are more and more accounts that we've been hearing in the news yeah but that's the thing is it still the same consistency or are we just hearing about it now publicly because they decided to stop lying I think that's I think that's a big part of it I think because they've come out and said hey yeah we were kind of covering this up and there are things in the sky that we don't know what they are so between that and of course obviously the ease of taking pictures and video and the pr proliferation of social media it's so much easier to share these things now right so it's harder to hide or could it be Elon musk's satellites I don't know are we throwing so much stuff up there space link or starlink or something I don't know I'm not a citizen of Mars that's the thing you know we're putting so much [ __ ] out in the atmosphere I don't even know are we stirring them up and so they're coming knocking on our door more often they're like hey buddy I'm trying to sleep up here what the [ __ ] they're probably like those [ __ ] earthlings man they need to get their [ __ ] together you know and I really think is missing he's totally missing the train here because growing cannabis on Mars would solve so many problems it's going to make the soil better it's going to help with the oxygen production you know you can use it as a building material but they don't have water on Mars well yeah they do there's those ice caps they have a ton of water on Mars yeah but how are ice caps gonna feed a plant well you melt it and then you pour it on there I don't know bring a candle light a fire I'm not sure I don't know but it's Elon Musk he can figure out how to melt water he's gonna sit out there with a freaking blowtorch melting these Martian ice caps to grow weed on Mars Elon if you do this call me right he can take those flamethrowers he sold some flamethrowers a few years ago take an Elon Musk branded flamethrower to Mars melt those ice caps water your weed and there you go boom atmosphere on Mars problem solved this is why you and I are geniuses I just we are we're so smart we figured it all out so NASA call us we have we have thoughts I just want to be the first Zar of weed please I just that's all I want as my title that would be nice I'll take princess weed since I'm a stuff and Packer yeah since I stuff and pack I can handle princess okay Padawan you can be my queen in training for the for the weeds no you need to you need your own title you need your own title you need to be like princess of Adventure or you could be the lead ghost Hunter on Mars oh yeah you know there's got to be ghosts on Mars there's got to be you can search out ancient ruins and all the ghost stories on Mars there's got to be a ton it would be fun there wouldn't be no East Coast West Coast no that's true there wouldn't all right I don't know about this plan anymore let's shove it for a little bit we'll we'll wait and see we call Elon and see what he says what are you smoking today that's making you think that uh weed can grow on Mars well I am actually pretty excited today I have done a little swap with another grower and I'm super thrilled oh I've traded them some of my straw Nana and they traded me some pineapple punch and so I'm smoking a fellow grower good stuff this is really good it's very tasty the buds are not super dense and he warned me that that was going to be the case but he is new to Growing but other than that these are fantastic they're very tasty very crystally does it have that any citrusy flavor it does this is a very uplifting sativa and it does have a little bit of that maybe more of a lemon than a pineapple but I guess if I pretend it could be pineapple but it does taste a little bit sweet a tiny bit citrusy and and I like that you know me I love a good tasting smoke and this has it so other than not being super dense like you're used to seeing in the stores and this is a little shaggier oh that's pretty still with a little shag nothing no no honestly When I Grow I do the same thing I'm a rough trimmer I like to leave all the sugar leaves on there I don't like it to be uniform and all cut up perfect perfect that's because she doesn't like to trim guys that's her real story don't let her fool you that's probably a big part of it I would have to say you are you're not wrong you're good enough good enough guilty guilty confession I used to trim very much I was very strict all leaves had to come off meticulous trimmer and um my husband liked the sugar leaves and so I started leaving them on for him and because I'm freaking lazy I don't like all that trimming it's a lot man if I get friends over it's no big but if it's just me I mean it's every couple months so it does get to be a lot but anyway so I started leaving the sugar leaves on and I found that I liked it a lot better and I I see that more and more with other Growers that the it looks a little shaggier you know you'll see the you'll see the leaves on there but it doesn't seem to harsh the smoke if if it's just the sugar leaves it just seems to add tricomes and just add a nice tasty goodness well that's good yeah so this is fun and this is a this is a sativa dominant it is almost a I think it's like an 80 or 90% sativa so it's right up there which could also contribute to the the lighter the fluffier buds sometimes ativas will sometimes have a fluffier bud but it I don't know again because hom grow I don't know what the percentage on this but I did look it up on Leafly and they have it as a higher THC they show it as a 22 or 28% THC so again like a daytime smoke and this is on an energizing side and it does make me very happy I find this this P pineapple punch makes me very giggly very happy very uplifted nothing wrong with a happy high no not good for work I wouldn't say that I I could do a lot of research with this because I'm I'm a little can't really pay attention that long I'm just kind of happy this is more for hanging out relaxing with friends and just having a good time not like a get stuff done no no this is you know go to the coffee shop go to the park you know go have fun with your friends hang out this is just a nice high how about you what are you smoking today today I'm smoking the GMO Skittles little bit lower THC it's more like I think it said 25.7 good stuff still not a dis disappointment it's very wood taste Woody tasting is the only thing I say I wouldn't say it's the best tasting [ __ ] I've ever had but it's better tasting Than Dirt weed I wouldn't really give it a 10 out of 10 in taste yeah I found that sometimes uh at least around here some of the the smaller dispensaries in particular if they're working with local Growers I'll find that the midshelf sometimes will have as much THC is the top shelf but it won't look as good or it won't taste as good yeah so that might be kind of what you got there it's definitely lacking in The Taste department but again not disappointed still high no complaints but it's not the best I've ever had yeah you had mentioned last episode that you were going to try a lower THC and and see how that went and no like I said the high is good it just tastes kind of me unfortunately we don't always get those fabulous tasting stre High te cont yeah Ah that's what we all want right just the perfect bud that's perfect squishy crystally consistency delicious delicious it smells good when you open it up it tastes good it makes your finger sticky after you pack it oh yeah yeah yeah but you can't have that all the time every time no you don't get that every time it's not Christmas every day that's true that's true I guess it can't be it can't always be perfect it's not Christmas every day some days it's GMO Skittles some days it's GMO Skittles but again not disappointed whatsoever not too disappointing at all that's good and I'm glad I have a happy High going on today because I kind of have a sad story oh is this true crime it is a true crime this is a missing person and it's got an interesting sad twist to it just a very mysterious twist oh boy all right lay it on me this involves um do you remember Polaroids yeah you know kind of shake it like a Polaroid picture yeah this involves a Polaroid that was found that appeared to show two children in the back of a white van your stereotypical white van who looked like their arms were bound behind their backs and they had duct tape across their mouths oh [ __ ] mysterious they looked quite a bit like two children who had gone missing from New Mexico now the picture was found in Florida which I know is your territory but the story starts in New Mexico which is mine so I kind of am claiming this under eminent domain that's okay that's okay all right cool I have no idea what eminent domain means but it sounded good and that sounds very official by the way thank you yes so I'm pretty sure I own this story all right this starts in a town called Bellon which is south of Albuquerque New mexic Mexico and this is back in 1988 I was a kid back then and I remember this story when the Polaroid was found and again I was a true crime scary story junkie back then so I kind of paid attention to things like this but let me know if you if you've ever heard of this show okay okay so this is in September September 20th 1988 this little town called bellan again south of Albuquerque New Mexico we're going to tell you about Tara Calico a young woman named Tara Calico she was 19 in 1988 great girl very very smart I guess she started taking college classes in her junior year of high school oh very nice doing all the right things and was pretty ambitious super sweet girl very athletic as well by all accounts and she was on her high school track team she played tennis and she took a very long-distance bike ride about 17 miles out and 17 back so roughly 34 miles roundtrip bike ride every day every morning wow right I take a bike ride every day and it's not that long blocks and back right you go a few blocks down back and she would cycle mostly along New Mexico State Road 47 which is a mostly straight road that went down to some railroad tracks where she would go and then kind of back same route every day all the time she usually rode with her mother Patty do and this particular day she hadn't gone her mother didn't go with her because recently they had kind of been run off the road by a car and it really spooked Patty and she she didn't want to go she actually didn't want Tara to go either and try to talk her out of it but Tara insisted you know she wasn't as scared as her mother was about it she heads out with her Walkman and her Boston tape all freshly rewound and ready to go she tells her mom kind of half jokingly if I'm not back by noon come look for me she had a 12:30 date with her boyfriend and she was going to go play tennis with him and then she had class at 3:30 so she jokingly tells her mom if you don't see me by noon you know come find me and she was never seen again and her mom has never stopped looking for her so about 12:05 she hasn't come back and Patty starts looking for her daughter she drives this whole route and doesn't see her anywhere and informs the police the Valencia County Sheriff's Office that she thinks her daughter is missing now unlike other kids of that age again she was Tara was 19 they took it pretty seriously because she was a very responsible kid well known in the community so they immediately suspected Foul Play and the sheriff at the time was a man named Lawrence Romero and he said quote we feel this is an involuntary disappearance we understand from talking to her parents and friends that this is totally out of character for her to turn up missing so they immediately start looking and they find on the side of the road where she had been traveling they found bike tire tracks and they see where possibly it skitted or stopped they were like scuff marks where the tire tracks ended and just off the road there were footprints in the dirt some beer cans and parts of her Walkman like pieces of it and the Boston tape oh geez so on further searching they discovered several people remembered seeing tar riding her bike that day they didn't see anything happen to her but some people did report saying that they saw a truck a white or cream colored truck with a homemade camper on the back of it with two or three men inside of it kind of following Tara and possibly like harassing her she had made reports and had told her mother that people had been following her and there were reports that there was a man in town who was interested in her and she didn't return his interest and he just so happened to be the son of Lawrence Romero this was Lawrence Romero Jr was interested in her and he was one of I feel like that name sounds familiar I don't know Joey Romero isn't he like an actor or something Joey I don't know I have no idea so people reported seeing him possibly in this truck that was harassing her that that same day that she disappeared they're searching for her all over the place and a few days later on September 24th they find right at the foot of the Manzano mountains nearby at the entrance to the John F Kennedy Campground they find more pieces of her Walkman there oh and that's roughly 19 miles from where she was last seen oh [ __ ] so the trail kind of went cold at that point nobody knew what had happened oddly Patty says that she was kind of getting the runaround like she said both the sheriff's department seemed to very much be helping but also some of them seem to be hindering there was even a detective that kept calling her and saying oh I got a tip that your daughter is part of a satanic cult then he would call her and say that she was part of a sex trafficking ring and she was getting all these terrible right he was it was just all these awful theories she was constantly being bombarded with these terrible theories um from this detective and he even went so far as to tell a newspaper reporter that Tara had run away that she was just a runaway and it was after that that I guess he got fired but she did feel that even though she was getting a lot of help from the Department she also seemed like there were people in the department that were working against the case that's shitty and it it seemed like everything kind of brown to a halt until the next year in June June 15th 1989 in Florida of all places Port St Joe Florida in the parking lot of a grocery store a woman saw a man get into a white van kind of suspiciously and drive away and in that spot she saw a Polaroid and she picked it up oh [ __ ] I'm going to share this picture with everyone so that they can see it now this particular picture is a little bit close in in the original picture you can see that they're in a white ve van an actual the stereotypical white van and they look to be on blankets pillows but it looks like there's a young girl a teenage girl laying down with duct tape over her mouth and and it appears that her hands are bound behind her back and a young boy laying next to her with his mouth also covered in duct tape his arms also behind his back now when this photo surfaced in 1989 Patty and her husband Tara's stepfather learned of it and notified the Sheriff's Office Patty immediately thought that that was a picture of Tara and if you look at the two of them there are a lot of similarities and what really convinced Patty was there's a scar on the girl's leg can kind of see it yeah you can kind of see it and she says that that's the same place where Tara had a scar on her leg and that's what really convinced her that that was Tara plus the book there is called my sweet Audrina by VC Andrews uhuh and if you remember VC Andrews like every teenage girl in the 80s was obsessed yeah with VC Andrews and she said that was her daughter's favorite book and favorite author so that was another thing that convinced her that kind of tied it together exactly and at the same time the boy was identified by his parents as a boy named Michael Henley a 10-year-old boy who had went missing five months before Tara did in the zi mountains which is about 150 m miles west of where Tara went missing he went camping with his dad his dad was setting up camp and the boy was just gone they never found him but in this picture his parents said that's definitely Michael again they went missing roughly 150 miles and five months apart from each other but how did this Polaroid of what supposedly them show up in Florida of all places so the FBI got involved Oprah did a show I mean it was everywhere and the FBI and analysis said that they felt in their opinion it was not Tara Scotland Yard did an investigation and they said it definitely is Tara so nobody was really sure and that's what I remember hearing about was that this this mysterious Polaroid was found and these families were convinced it was children that had gone missing from New Mexico and how creepy is that that some white van just kind of peels out of a parking lot and leaves behind what looks like an abduction photo I guess that was like stranger danger and like panic at the time everyone was going to get abducted all kids were afraid that they were going to get abducted at that time that was a thing in the 80s though like you know abduction started happening unfortunately and and stranger danger did become a thing and yeah it's because of [ __ ] like this right and so this made news and I heard about it in New York the next break in this case didn't come until 1990 when the remains of Michael Henley were found just a few miles from where he he had gone missing so he had not been abducted unfortunately it looks like he had just gotten lost and he died of dehydration and exposure that's not any better that's not any better to be honest with you it's not any better no no but now the mystery of who this little boy is kind of deepens about the same time the internet's becoming more and more of a thing and some sleuths are starting to kind of look at this picture and a lot of people are starting to say that it looks like a staged photo like one those creepy shitty photos parents would take back in the 80s and 90s my parents never took a creepy photo of me duct tape to up to no but did you ever have a photograph of you or one of your siblings holding an alcohol container of some sort at like two well yeah but that that was 197 what I have a whole series of one of my brothers with a pack of cigarettes and a whiskey bottle and I think he was six months old nice nice shout out to parents that was like a thing then man I mean they took all sorts of messed up photos but a lot of people say it was staged because if you look at the photograph underneath her legs is a plastic cup tipped over and there's a book just to her right those are things you need your hands for why would they be there also if you notice her shoulders are relaxed if you're a kidnapper you still got to hydrate them and you're going to hold the freaking Red Solo Cup up to their mouth and then you're going to toss it because you don't give a [ __ ] and if you notice her shoulders are very relaxed if you put your hands behind your back and put your wrists together your shoulders get kind of pulled back you know go ahead and try it put your hands behind your back and put your wrists together like they're tied you can't keep them as relaxed as that so either her hands are tied very Loosely or they're not tied at all you know it almost looks like she just be sitting on him it does and the same thing with the boy it just kind of looks like he's laying there also it's been pointed out by and this is kind of creepy I don't know why regular normal people would know this but apparently duct tape does not make a good gag because if you have it over your mouth like that all you have to do is kind of wiggle your lips a little bit just keep wiggling your mouth and you can get it Loose pretty quickly and pretty easily thankfully I've never had to know that that's not something I would have known I think I saw that on a Reddit board so shout out to Reddit some Tara Calico subreddit I found that but yeah apparently duct tape doesn't make a good gag because it's too easy to come off so a lot of people are thinking that this might be some sort of stupid joke photo like oh hey we were on a trip with the kids and they wouldn't shut up so I had to gag them ha haa here's a picture that kind of thing so some people think it was staged other people think it's creepy my first thought isn't staged right the boy turned out it's not him it's definitely not him because they found him back in New Mexico so he was never in Florida so they don't they don't know who the boy is in the picture then is that what you're saying correct they don't know who the boy is and like I am no sleuth I am no detective nor am I a facial Reconstructionist but when I looked at the pictures of Tara in the van and Tara Calico I immediately saw that Tara Calico had very high arched eyebrows and this girl has very very straight flat eyebrows they look very very similar but their brow shap not the same yeah how grow or how your eyebrows grow period now even today Tara's steps sister Michelle she's alive and her father Tara's stepfather is also still alive and they're still looking for her Michelle feels she's not 100% sure from the things I've seen but she says if you have to ask her say yes or no right now she would say yes that is could this just be a kid that just ran away and kind of disappeared got a new life started a new life kind of thing maybe but there's more to the story there always is damn it more has come out so in 1991 Patty and her husband John John Dole The Stepfather became authorized deputies in order to do their own search because they really felt that the Sheriff's Office was not doing the right thing theyve said that the department failed to follow up on leads misplaced evidence and were possibly involved in covering up or hiding things September of 2008 Renee Rivera who had been a deputy at the time Tara went missing and was now a sheriff announced to the public that he knew what had happened to Tara Calico 19 years ago he says according to him four boys that Tara knew were kind of [ __ ] around with her and were trying to scare her with a truck and they hit her accidentally with a truck while she was on her bike so as a as a as an actual policeman you're just going to not say anything about that for 19 years what the actual [ __ ] seriously he says they threw her in the back of the truck biking all and took her to a gravel pit and that she threatened to get have them all thrown in jail she was going to make sure they all went to jail they then killed her and disposed of her body and the sheriff says that he knows this but he doesn't have enough evidence to charge anyone so he never thought to like maybe go look for the body like I'm just saying he probably was friends with the family probably or is he family he's friends with the family rumor has it that Lawrence Romero Jr said to people that he was involved in this and that Renee Rivera knew it but Rivera had been hired by his father and was on their side and wouldn't say anything that's how it always goes down south the rumor is even worse it's rumored that Lawrence Jr had a crush on Tara and that she didn't return it at all she had a boyfriend she wasn't interested he was a known troublemaker and possibly a drug dealer he and his friends had been harassing her for weeks following her with their car causing all sorts of trouble shortly after she was last seen being followed by this truck on that afternoon they hit her whether on purpose or by accident pulled her off the side of the road and then threw her into the back of the truck they took her to the campground where they raped her beat her up when she said she was going to turn them all in they killed her they killed her Romero Jr Lawrence Romero killed her stabbed her to death while two of his friends Silva Chavez and another man held her down wow there was a a man named Henry Brown made a Deathbed confession in 2013 he said he was in the basement of a trailer they dug like this hangout basement underneath a trailer I guess you know real classy so he was in Lawrence Romero Jr's hangout hole he noticed a body wrapped in a tarp and Romero Dave Silva and another man told Henry that it was Tara and that they had hit her by accident to took her to the Gravel Pit raped her and then killed her they had originally hidden the body there by the John F Kennedy Campground and then as the searches got closer they took her body back and hid her in the basement did anybody ever go back to that basement supposedly but that's not where it ended he says that he saw them throw her body into a pond near one of the houses and that her bike had been disposed of at a junkyard where they were friends and that they crushed the bike and that's why it was never found found another man had come forward and told police that one of these gentlemen had confessed to him as well however none of these confessions were ever entered supposedly this um shocking Renee Rivera these are some of the things he's supposedly covered up in 1991 Lawrence Romero Jr was found dead of a gunshot wound to the Head he's alternately said to have committed suicide and left a suicide note ad committing to what happened Tara the suicide note disappeared never to be found convenient and it's disputed some people say that he liked to play with guns and that he was playing Russian roulette but I mean that's still kind of like suicide I mean Russ how is Russian Roulette not some form of suicide but supposedly his suicide note was hidden by Renee Rivera and his and Lawrence senior damn so many coverups so many coverups so it's a well-known secret what happened to her and the Polaroid picture is just an unfortunate creepy sad red hairing yeah her mother Patty died in 2006 Tara's biological father died in 2002 her stepfather John Dole is still alive and is still searching for her Patty never stopped searching for her they moved to Florida after this Polaroid was found and continued trying to search for Tara she never stopped hoping that Tara was alive and that that photograph was real and I guess she had a bunch of Strokes towards the end of her life and couldn't speak and she would still point at people on bikes and write down Tara and was still looking for her right up to the day she died that's so heartbreaking that's heartbreaking hopefully there might be news I guess last year in early 2021 a search warrant relevant to the case was executed at a home in Valencia County and the results of that have been sealed so it's still ongoing they do say that they are still looking into this it's still being investigated and uh I've heard rumors that there's going to be a pond dredged so maybe we'll have some answers her family deserves it and the the memory of this girl deserves that totally they really do and and the other mystery here is who are the kids in that photograph no one's ever come forward and claimed hey it's it was me and my brother and we were just joking they've never been found in a missing person's database um it's it's quite the mystery my guess is is unfortunately that's probably not a spoof photo unfortunately right it looks very creepy and are those kidnapped kids are those kids who are in danger I mean it it's kind of sad and scary and and as far as the photo goes we'll probably never have answers the the only thing we can be sure of is it's it's not Tara and it's not Michael right but it it is to to other people's children unfortunately yeah exactly exactly so today I looked into a place you know it's so funny you always end up doing True Crime and I'm I I seem to go back and forth between Cryptids and insane asylums that's true I think maybe we've gotten in a rut we should swap I know right I should start looking into some true crime here so this was actually something that was recommended To Us by one of our listeners Kay shout out to Kay hi Kay hey Kay and this is the Trav see if you write nice things to us we shout you out we read your things on the podcast we research the stuff you tell us to we love it when you guys send us stuff so thank you K mail us the stone Witches Hour gmail.com send us mail we love it we do we do so so Kay had asked us to uh give a quick look see at the Traverse City State Hospital which is actually almost I didn't realize this but it's almost as far north in Michigan as you could possibly go and still be in America that's cold that sounds very cold yeah so it's like the tippy top part of Northern Michigan Kay's been listening from what I understand Kay kind of binged quite a few of our episodes K you know I don't like asylums they're creepy that's probably why she picked it that's probably why she picked it was like ha I'm gonna creep her out it's extra ookie all right let's here so Travers City host Traverse City State Hospital which this place opened in November of 1885 and and that's another thing like what is with all of these insane asylums in like the mid to late 1800s was that like the thing I think actually it was like there was a big mental health movement then there there must have been because wasn't it like in fashion or something when was Freud around was that Freud times oh geez I don't even know I don't even know honestly but it just doesn't it seem like every Asylum story I've started with starts in in 1885 they're all right around the turn of the century there for sure so this had a couple of different names including the northern Michigan Asylum the Travers City Regional Psychiatric Hospital in the northern Michigan state hospital before it was finally closed in 1989 so you got to figure this was open yeah this was open for 104 years which for a say asylums that's kind of long just saying got the longevity going for it probably not a good thing most of them were really shitty places actually they still were housing patients at that point so when they closed in 1989 they actually had to force patients to relocate after its closing and it was one of the largest employers in the city and they all lost their jobs oh wow damn yeah I am going to go ahead and blame Freud for this whole surge of crappy insane asylums because he definitely was practicing right around that time and writing all his books right around then so I'm just going to go ahead and and blame this whole mental health we need to do crappy terrible things to people we're g to blame it on Frey probably not his fault for real but this one is like weird because you know how normally they're just like oh shock treatment tie him to a wall you know and that's kind of their method give a lobotomy or let them roam around free and beat each up not here at the Traverse City Hospital their philosophy was beauty is therapy well that sounds nice straight jackets were forbidden okay creativity was encouraged because the hospital was located on 135 Acres they had a working farm patients were given the opportunity to work they would like build furniture and have like Gardens and and farm products opportunity to to do cool things Farm outside get fresh air have a job feel fulfilled I think it was a combination of a of a self-sustaining place as well as selling some of their goods to the greater public So This sounds too good to be true is this one of those things where it sounds idyllic on the surface but it was really more like forced labor and absolutely okay okay I was starting to wonder where you were going with this now ironically enough the farm was also this is such like an Upstate New York thing the farm was also a home to a world champion milk cow because you know we have world champion milk cows it was an insane asylum and they had world champion cows apparently their world champion cow's name was Traverse colantha Walker and they actually this is how shitty they treated people back then so we all know that none of these asan asylums ever did proper burials some stuff um so this wh this cow this Championship milk cow has a grave and a headstone located between the former Asylum and the hold up hold up you know they have a pit with just numbers for the people but the freaking cow world champion cow has a headstone in a grave site I'm already pissed off this already sucks that's why I said you know the you you you already know that this is going to take a downward spiral like all asylums do I mean I Like Cows don't get me wrong super sweet love cows cows are adorable and very tasty I'm sorry but super sweet and really nice cows are great you're gonna Mass Berry humans and then put up a tombstone for a cow you treat your yeah no that's bad that's really bad yeah but again you know these were people who were mentally ill suffering from addiction the facility expanded during out breaks of disease and took on patients when the hospitals were overwhelmed so I translate at the current times during covid you could have gone to an insane asylum hey fun times in the beginning they really did try to do this you know beauty is healing therapy is the way to go um you know but of course nothing good lasts forever again back to what we were used to with similar stories they almost doubled the amount they were allowed to have in there I think they were allowed to have something like 4,000 patients and they were pushing 8,000 at one point what is it with these places and double triple quadrupling the occupancy you know they build them with all these great ideas and it seems like while they're under capacity they seem to operate okay and then as soon as someone I I don't know why something happens and they decide to start stuffing people into every nook and cranny that's when it rapidly deteriorates yes yes and and that's basically what happened I found pages and pages and pages of stories of hauntings you know patients medical staff that were there some people have even claimed to see the the the the world champion cow you're telling me the prize cow the ghost of the prize cow wanders the grounds of the Asylum and that's one of the that's one of the selling points okay I'll buy that so people you know people have not only thought they've seen the animals but they've also thought that they've seen patients and stuff screaming in the middle of the night wailing in the middle of the night they actually do little tours here you can go on like like a haunted tour or is it just like a check out how how shitty this Asylum was tour uh kind of like a haunted tour they have a slightly creepy Cottage number 30 where they have this Asylum after dark tours so wait there's cottages on the ground listen to what you know and and I've talked about this when when I did the Danver state hospital here in Massachusetts same same thing happened so they take this Asylum you know so it's now it's like 1990 something and they're like all right we've closed this big Asylum what are we gonna do with it I got an idea let's turn it into Apartments oh no not again not again that I what is I really I really if you live in one of these places that used to be an asylum and is a now apartment please tell me I am dying of curiosity what's it like living there the Paranormal Activity has got to be off the charts the weirdness level alone oh my gosh and they call it now it now modern day times it's called the historic village at Grand Traverse Commons well that's a mouthful it is a mouthful so you can live there you can tour there you know it is a lot of these working farm asylums were you know they had multiple buildings eight 10 different buildings a lot of those buildings are gone but they do have a few of the original buildings which they do utiliz today and like imagine going and living in one of those apartments living in one of those apartments where some poor soul okay so they didn't get straight jacketed but who knows what other atrocities were performed on them I wasn't able to find any specific atrocities per se like you know with other places we've heard about labotomy and and and starvation and things of that nature I didn't really find anything that focused on any of that necessarily but you know we all know what to expect from a place like this especially once they've reached the overcrowding stages if nothing else you can't tell me they had great bathroom facilities come on now so the official stories really don't site anything other than the overcrowding factor yeah yeah but you know again you'll hear Tales of ghosts wandering the Halls crying screaming yelling kind of the normal I don't want to say normal Asylum haunts but kind of the normal Asylum hauns nothing really odd and out of the ordinary is as far as the the activity happening here it's it's just your kind of your typical bad juju man bad and I still can't get over the you have a tombstone for a cow me either and not for the people that's ridiculous I know that I know what that Kay said in her email that she was kind of afraid to go back because of some experiences that that were going on when she was there but K I'm so curious if you're listening please I'm begging you for the love of whatever go back spend the night tell us what is going on there because I'm curious because you know like I said there there's nothing specific um about specific hauntings that I found but people have always said you know they always felt people present it was always a chilling experience but they didn't necessarily get into what made it a chilling experience you know what I mean but it it definitely seems like a place that is is starting to gain interest from the ghost hunting Community they're they're definitely looking to kind of hone in on this place but for 45 bucks a person you can go check that place out you know how I like orb photos so have there been any orb sightings or any EVPs or anything like that nothing that has been noted it seems like a lot of the big ghost hun groups have not gone there yet um I'm sure it's coming but so far I was not able to find any sort of EVP logs or or anything of that nature again nothing really specific other than people just saying it's haunted and saying it's scary but not necessarily being able to to come up with specifics so to say right so I think that Kay gave us a gift here and unfortunately we're not equipped to take it yet how cool would it be for us to go and do an investigation there we should oh my God yeah like apparently they the mo the majority of their investigations they offer are during the month of October obviously obviously but it it it's it seems like it's becoming kind of an upand cominging ghosty tourist spot in Michigan so I do think that there's definitely more to find out I think this because there's not a ton of information I think this is one of of those places that is better left to be investigated I would love to live there that's me but the apartment complexes look beautiful now you still living there knowing what's been going on you know yeah knowing what was there and knowing what other asylums are like and that people have had experiences there you know when you go into these places a lot of people report that you can kind of feel a difference you feel like a presence you can feel a heaviness or like you're being watched and I think that's probably the kind of thing that that people are reporting here you know they're they're hearing things they're feeling like they're being touched and and I think doing an investigation there would certainly be interesting it would open the door I think and give a lot more insight to what the deal is at this joint yeah maybe go there with our tarot cards have our psychic Impressions on full alert see what's going on there use some equipment see what's going on this would be a great opportunity to kind of do some preliminary ghost hunting get in on some place before other people have kind of and that that's how this place feels this place feels like it's a place that hasn't had a whole lot of in-depth investigating yet and is just kind of being I don't want to say outed by the ghost world but outed by the Ghost World this is definitely something I think we might hear more about as these tours continue and some of these more professional ghost hunters get their hands on this yeah some of these investigations get going I'd be curious to see what happens you know and if there's any type of you know any new information that comes out we'll have to keep an eye on it and certainly we'll have to we'll have to add that to our list of places that we need to go right at the top since no one else has kind of been there yet right right we should go and do our our little investigation you know too bad our non-existent GoFundMe to send the witches on haunted investigations hasn't taken off otherwise we could do these things right yeah maybe we need one we need one first yeah but one of these days we will definitely get out to some of these places for sure I definitely think that this is a Nifty a Nifty place to check out I just definitely would love to find out more information about it I would too yeah and and and sadly a lot of the Back stories aren't quite there yet but I think they're going to start coming out as time goes on so if any of our listeners have been to or
