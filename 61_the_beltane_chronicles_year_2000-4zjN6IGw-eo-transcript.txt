welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick today we'll be talking about all things belain so if you missed our last episode belan is May 1st is a cross quarter holiday on the Celtic wheel of the year it happens on the midpoint between the Spring Equinox and the summer solstice it's traditionally the Irish Festival of the first day of summer and it is celebrated today as the very Pinnacle of spring I for one am super stoked because shell has promised a blast from the past she has cracked open our old coven Book of Shadows back in the circle amarat days to our ritual of belain for the year 2000 I am so excited to see what she has found and to hear all the things that we did for belain back in the day anxiously anticipating some tidbits here I'm Leila and the keeper of all things old and decrepit in books of Shadows I'm shell and I would like to initially point out Lea what the holy hell here do you realize that we did belaine 2000 like 24 years ago obviously I can do the math between 20 2024 but like mind blown it's been 24 freaking years you pointed out when we recorded the episode before this about beltine history and lore you had pointed out that next year will be the 25th anniversary mind blown yeah we were so proud of our ourselves I mean we had done some big rituals but this belain was a major ritual in our community that was attended by large numbers of people and every year it just got bigger and bigger so it was quite a responsibility and we felt very important and grown up and like our coven had finally made it and you know we we talk about a lot of different magic and and ritual type stuff and I thought what better way to celebrate bellan than crack in this bad boy out and telling the people what we did for belaine 2000 so you know we are going to talk about magic and we are going to talk about ritual but we're going to talk about a specific ritual that we did oh so long ago and I am so very grateful as usual that you kept all of our documentation you were the keeper of all that knowledge because I think between people moving and me having the flood I don't know how many copies of this still exist I am anal retentive about keeping this like I have it in tubies so that you know no matter where I go in the world it ain't getting damaged it ain't getting ruined and Treasure Trove I'm telling you Treasure Trove now we were pretty anal even back in the day so I know we took lots of notes we had spreadsheets of costs we had lists I still have them oh that's cool we had lists of what we need need to do what we needed to bring and of course there was the big ritual for us for our coven the two things that we really liked to do when putting on a community ritual was one something called a Passion Play we liked to make it visually interesting we wanted to do a not exactly a skit but we wanted the ritual to almost be a skit representing the holiday and the themes of the holiday cut to the chase we liked drama okay I think we thought were like Hollywood actors or some well that too but the second thing we really like to do was to get the people involved and I think that was a big part of why we liked the big dramatic acts because it was much more visually fun and interesting than just kind of going to the ritual and seeing some people I call West Water I call North you know if you have kind of an act I guess it's like your English teacher used to say it's better to show than to tell right we wanted to show people what was going on to help them get in the mood better well we were also from a very eclectic Community all kind of different belief systems deity worship Etc so I liked the Passion Play because it kind of gave you the backstory you know who is the Holly King well you could tell me or you could do a little Passion Play that I'm not going to forget you know the whole we we kind of brought all of that into context via our passion plays yes and when I remember when I think back to the belain ritual that we did we chose the theme of the triple goddess we started out with the triple goddess and I remember when we started you were the maiden with the white cloak and I was the Crone with the black cloak one of our coven mates had the Red Cloak for the mother and so we came out as these aspects of the triple goddess but because the season's changing and the cycle was turning we did something I don't remember what and took our cloaks off and exchanged them I went from the Crone to the maiden you went from the maiden to the mother and the coven mate went from mother to Crone so underneath we had dresses that were different color and I I remember being annoyed because I had an infant and a toddler and I remember being annoyed that you wouldn't let me be the the mother the whole time oh I wouldn't let you I was in charge of that okay folks don't don't let Lila fool you she really is a puppet master she really is yeah I yeah okay yeah I I did kind of have a heavy hand in things I like I like things to be a certain way but I thought it was such a cool idea because it is a time of change you know it's that time when you go from being underground and inside and now we're really bursting out you know and so I loved that idea of change I want to I want to break out some steps here that we took here's a good one we actually laid out consecrating the circle where we that anal back then we wrote we need to have a second table beside the rose bush so that we can serve it as a place to put our gates and our stuff for the gates remember we would do gates in the place where we were able to worship we had a camping field where everybody kind of congregated and we would do pre- ritual events and things there then we had this lovely path through the woods along the creek that went to another clearing that was our ritual field that had a bonfire space and a space for drummers and so we very often would line that path with candles with torches decorate it in some way and create Gates and what gates are is we would create Elemental Gates an East air gate a water gate you know fire and Earth Gates so that you would pass through each gate and receive a blessing or you know something You' have to do something to help you embody each of those elements before you ever get to the ritual Circle and to kind of break it down to Bare Bones it was like when you were in the camping field you were kind of in that quote unquote mundane space and as you walked down the path and through the gates you were kind of mentally and physically entering that Sacred Space and did it work it worked that that that place I miss that so much taking the time to walk down that pathway I can still see it in my head with the different colored tea lights we'd often put it in plastic cups that got reused over and over again for ritual but you know we did it in Chakra colors you know red orange yellow green yeah different color cups to get you down this long long path and then you know every you know 20 feet or so would be another gate or something it was almost like a physical walking representation of the crystal countdown and it would definitely get you into magical mindset there's no way you could walk down that pathway through those lights the incense the candles we also have drummers going too and drummers going people you know chanting and offering you blessings as you went through these Gates I mean you were tripping with Magic by the time you got to that Circle and uh I love that so we had a second table set because we had each gate probably had you know some incense or chalice for the water you know candles for fire so we had things we needed to set down cuz we are not basic witches we are pretty fabulous witches we had a lot of stuff now speaking of being fabulous I just want to touch on how we had cast The Circle because once I saw it written down I visually remembered it in my mind and remember how cool it was you actually walked around the whole circle and kind of dragged a sword with you and created that physical Circle dragging that sword I love that one of us did it in the beginning to create it and one of us did it at the end to open it is that the ritual we got the swords for yeah yeah you and I got matching freaking Warrior goddess swords yeah we did still have to kind of circle back to the gates really quick because we had some freaking fabulous ideas back in the day for our airgate people had to walk through incense and ring a bell our fire gate we had people hold candles that people would kind of gaze into at our water gate we had someone holding a bowl of water that would anoint people's forehead and at our Earth gate we had someone holding like a really big quartz crystal like we had some good ideas we had Bunches of feathers tied to tree branches to symbolize the spirit and Consciousness and we had someone at at the end of the gate which we had as a representation of the fool who would be holding a wicker man and what we did with this was we had people prior write things down on a piece of paper and then when they got down the path we had like a wicker man and they would put their piece of paper into that their sacrifices so in the pre- ritual in the pre- ritual field we had people write down things that either wishes they wanted carried or things that they wanted to sacrifice the fire and they put those in the wickerman at the end of the path and then once you went through the gates when you got to the edge of the circle we had uh a couple people there smudging people before they entered yeah so they would smoke cleanse with the with sage or something like that as they entered the circle we were pretty crafty yeah all right now we did the blessing of the chalice and the blade and then we did the great right ah the here gamos yeah you want to kind of talk about what those are for folks who don't know yes the Heros gamos is the great right the sacred right and in a lot of Wiccan Traditions usually this is represented with an athame which is a knife and a chalice and now depending on your tradition usually either the woman holds the chalice and the man holds the atheme or the woman holds the aame and the man holds the chalice and there is a saying that gets said back and forth let's see if I can remember it I have it written down here let's see if I get it right okay let it be known that no woman is greater than a man nor is man greater than a woman for what one lacks the other shall provide for something something we are one in truth and when conjoined the Two Become One In Truth for behold there is no greater magic in all the world ah yes right yeah so I was close I was close I almost had it cool yeah so you would say that in alternating lines with the person representing the God and the person representing the goddess while dropping the a into said chalice right to represent obviously the sex act that belain very much represents New Life sexuality new beginnings new starts I do want to point out that the great right can actually be literal and not with a athe and chalice just putting that out there for all you Yep this is the figurative great right symbolic great right uh some covin will do an actual great right and hey you know get your freak on consenting adults do it do it but yeah so then we did we did the great right and then we called quarters now that is one thing I don't have Blast from the Past because what I have written down was that we would let people come up with their own and so everybody kind of came up with their own quarters on the Fly that were a part of the actual ritual so I don't have those written down but I bet you they're were kickass no cell phones back then typically right and then we move on to the invocation of the god and goddess which we did a chant and you know when we talked about energy raising and that previous episode I don't know what number that was but go find it we talked about different ways to raise energy we kind of like chance even though we're ton deaf mofos um so the chant we decided to open our invocation was Isis estarte Diana HEC demer Ki Anana and then pan Osiris Apollo dianis Shiva Odin konos I'm not going to sing that folks you can't pay me enough to do that but to really good chance that we had I mean we had what 250 275 people chanting this all at once like that's some magic right there those are some pretty common chants and so they're really nice to get people involved because a lot of pagans know them they're very easy to pick up and chanting anything simple and repetitive is a great way to raise energy and then at this point Leila came into the center of the circle and told a story and she told the story of belan I don't remember what you said do you have any idea don't remember a damn thing but it was a story it was a story I think it was a story about the young goddess and the the green man I think it was a story about the maiden and the Green Man and the marriage of the two more than likely probably something relevant would be my then we did the charge of the god in the charge of the Goddess which gotta love them we did a fivefold kiss talk to the people tell them what a five-fold kiss is did we really do that it's  written down what I I can't change the five-fold kiss again is a Wiccan thing and from what I remember I don't remember that was 24 years ago and I'm not as wicking as I once was exactly so basically as you kiss each part of the body you get uh a blessing the feet the knees the womb or the phus the breast or the chest and the lips so it goes like this Blessed Be Thy feet that have brought thee in these ways Blessed Be Thy knees that shall kneel at the sacred altar Blessed Be Thy r or phace without which we would not be blessed be thy breasts formed in beauty or formed in strength Blessed Be Thy lips that shall utter the sacred names It's All Coming Back to Me Now sometimes they do they go straight from the womb to the lips and then go to the third eye so sometimes it's feet knees womb lips third eye so it really depends on what your tradition is do what you want people just do what you want so we must have done some type of blessing I think it was my at the time boyfriend very very soon after this to be my hand fasty husband boy husband we did get handfasted on belain of that same year so it was right after this ceremony or a week after I don't know shortly after we did belain but um yeah so I think we did the five-fold kiss basically kiss each of these five points and say the blessing uh and you do it to each other it's a way for high priests and high priestesses to honor each other and honor the deity within but very Wicken and like shelle said we are not as wiced as we once were now at this point in the ritual we had our drummer Friends start laying down a beat here we had folks jump the fire and we talked about that on the last episode about jumping the balefire the God and the goddess kind of did a d probably some sexy luring type its belan dance a lot of times in our community there was definitely jumping the fire which is a traditional Irish blessing where where you jump for fertility for luck to bless yourself to cleanse yourself and then usually we would do a scarf dance of some type right and what a scarf dance is is it's usually started by the god and goddess or the high priest and Priestess and they would each have a scarf they do a little dancing and then they would offer an end of that scarf to someone standing in the circle and then that person would come in they would dance together and then you would typically then each have a scarf and then you would just keep kind of going and bringing people in and dancing what you're saying is it's a shitty way to force people into the circle and dance that otherwise would not willingly go in there and dance me oh come on now pointing to me pointing to me that's true most of the time people are more than excited to get in and especially once people get going but yeah it was definitely a way to get people involved whether they wanted to or not but that drumming and dancing was basically how we kind of raised energy and built that kind of cone of power so to say and we had prior to that given everyone kind of a focal point to direct that and everyone knew that that's what that dancing portion was we all knew that we were raising energy to power the spell and that intention that we had talked about in the preit it wasn't like everyone was just dancing and having a good time we knew that this was to Direct Energy to what's called a cone of power to push that energy out to the universe in this case mostly blessings and thanks now we talked about in our last episode how we would pick a May Queen a May King and then our community also picked a fool so during this ritual this was basically the point where the fool would hand the Mak King the the Wicker man and the May king would throw that wicker man which as you remember everybody put their little slips of paper in with all their things the king would put the Wicker man into the fire that would kind of put everybody's wishes and whatnot out to the universe then at that point we immediately switched to grounding and what we did was we had a big pot of dirt and we had the May queen go around the Circle and give everybody seeds and then what they would do at that point was ground all that energy into the seeds and yep put it all in into the the seed and then everybody put them in the dirt which didn't we do something with the dirt afterwards yeah you ended up growing it on your porch oh my God yeah that I think some of it got spread out at one coven M's Garden and I think the rest of it stayed in that pot on your porch and then this is also a good point to talk about we chose to leave the circle open and we invited folks to either stay or go and then it was kind of party time after that we didn't close that Circle remember yes until like a day later or two days later yep the next day traditionally in our community belane Circle was left up all night we kept ritual space going all night long and then the next day uh there was was usually a ceremony right around noon to close that circle like a closing ritual yeah a closing ceremony was usually the next day around noon so we kept that up all night long and usually belain was pretty pretty wild the bonfire was going to the we hours the morning the drummers the Dancing Yeah it was it was a good time now I don't know if you remember this movie I want to say it was like early 90s um Midsummer Night's Dream when I think of belain and Lissa I think of that movie I know summer Night's Dream It's litha but that is belain and litha kind of wrapped into one in my I don't know why but I associate that movie with with both of these oh yeah I mean that that's the Shakespearean play with the with the fairies and everyone going off into the woods to have sex you know that's pretty much belane in a nutshell it is a Time For Fairies it is a time for sex it's a time for new beginnings and dancing and and we're all just so freaking excited that Winter's over finally we're so happy to get out there and get in the dirt and get camping everyone's excited but our our final notes on this ritual were we had a quote I don't know where we use this in the ritual but we are an old people we are a new people we are the people stronger than before that's a chant that I won't chant for you but our point of this was we're sacrificing the old planting the new and we wanted people to celebrate life and renewal and just be just be I mean remember at that point we had been ramped up half our lives that when the clock went from 99 to 2000 we were just all going to die and we didn't die in January and when we were able to camp for the first time in may we were ready to do it up did yeah yeah it was just a very exciting time it was the year 2000 how cool is that well and again because of where we were from and and living belain was like the first time you could go outside without a winter coat you could go camping you could be in the woods you could walk Barefoot on the earth you know we had waited almost six months to do that and so belan was just a big deal just because of that to us and where we were from yes we're big Believers here shell and I about adapting your rituals and your your Festival to your place to where you live and belan is traditionally an Irish thing it's an Irish holiday that celebrates the first of summer to them it's the very beginning of Summer to us it's more like spring has finally really sprung you know it's it's not summer yet but there's abundance you can go outside our fault spring is finally over here in the Northeast we're about to have a whole another Frost I'm getting frost warning so you can't even plant until after belane here so we celebrate it as the first flushes of spring I can collect violets and dandelions and you know some of the first herbs from my garden and it's just the beginnings of abundance here and damn if that isn't an exciting time what others are able to do ostara where we're from we have to wait till Bain and I think in a lot of of the United States that makes it such a wonderful holiday for all of us because the animals are out the birds are out I mean there's little baby birds and bunnies everywhere there's flowers everywhere you can't help but be excited and trees are budding yeah you want get budding everything is budding you can't you want to get your hands in the dirt it ain't Brown anymore it's green yeah it's perfect now you had said before we started recording that in right around that time of 2000 one of our coven mates uh was initiated at that time we her initiation into the coven and also right after we did that belain ritual we did my hand fasting with my husband who were still together and we'll be celebrating 25 years next year so although it wasn't belain 2000 we actually had a person on our Facebook Discussion Group ask about this two years prior we had done uh fertility magic for me to get pregnant on belain and I wanted to get pregnant I wanted to have a boy and well he's here he's 26 exactly so it works so fertility you know love New Beginnings planting what you want to sew down the road selflove is is a big one this time of year and you know connecting with yourself Awakening your own inner fire and reflecting on how much you've grown you know it's a great time to take stock of yourself and where you're at with you know how you feel about you how well you like you you know how are you doing on those goals that you set back on imul and if you look at the year and quarters that is the government worker in me you know this is like the beginning of the second quarter and you know shit's about to roll we've spent January till now waiting for this at least us Northeast folk you know when Christmas is over all we want is for it to be May when we can leave our house and not have 96 layers of clothes on and see life and see growth and see the things transforming it is it's a transformative time of year for sure because we're going from that everything hidden away and and gone to everything flourishing and growing and it's great you know it's funny that you said about everything hidden away and and everything growing because one thing that I love to do is is break out the sandals and go outside and have my little bear toes out and in the ground so with that being said another great thing to do on beltin is to pamper yourself have a spa day get a pedicure maybe your little winter tootsies aren't quite ready to be shown to everybody on spring and summer so now is the time to get them all taken care of celebrate Beauty and sensuality get a haircut get a massage buy yourself Something Beautiful buy a new bathing suit or you know buy something gorgeous that makes you feel pretty but celebrate yourself but in a more natural way another thing you could do is I'll give you an example so Leila talked about relocating and yay I'm going to visit in a week or two I'm G to see if I can find I don't know what the hell I'll get because I know nothing about plants I'm G to see if I can bring you a plant for your new house no sh I love plants I know you do it's like you know me they come to me to die but they come to you for love and affection so I thought you know I'm going to bring Lea a plant to her new place but God knows what I'll find hopefully you'll keep it alive if you have any suggestions for Shell DM her at Instagram back on the broomstick listeners folks I got I got something that I want to tell you Leila's been moving I've been doing some  and we've been a little absent on social media we apologize we know we kind of in that area it's not our strong point seriously but we love you we do love you very much we're just weirdos so never fear we will be back on Instagram and Facebook and all the things in like the next little bit don't worry we're back don't worry back we will be you know another thing with belain is nothing beats a good flower crown maybe that's the princess in me but t a season for flower crowns man everybody should wear flower crowns men women whatever children all the things wear flower crown makes you happy they're wonderful decorate your house with flowers pick some dandelions and make dandelion ink sigils on yourself you know have a grand old time leave some flowers for the fairies make a fairy altar outside and leave flowers there for them oh my God there is one more belain thing I wanted to touch on and I actually saw the other day on one of the socials someone was like what is that and why do people do it before our rituals every year with our big Community one thing thing we do that is a very important part of belan is the May pole so can we just talk really quick about what is a mapole why do you do it what's it mean blah blah blah go okay so the mapole I'm pretty sure is germic in Tradition it comes from wal perus which is May Day all I can think of is when we would champ put the pole in the hole put the pole in the hole we would have men's and women's Mysteries and I think you can listen to some of our older belane episodes if you want to learn more about that but people would go off and chop down a tree from this land other people would go and dig a hole and basic what that represented in traditional Irish and again in in some germic in lots of different traditions this mapole represents the phace and the hole represents the womb or the vagina am I allowed to say dick on here men women sex it's a dick and it's a no we probably can't say either of those things but we got it anyway so it represents lifegiving sex and you put them together and then the ribbons around it can indicate all sorts of different things depending on who you ask it could indicate blood it could indicate semen it could indicate colors of the Season you know it really is going to depend on who you ask but the the whole dance is supposed to be a fertility ritual but we would like everybody grabbed a ribbon and we would kind of dance around in a big circle and like kind of weave in and out of each other to kind of like weave the ribbon and did we ever make a perfect pattern I feel like we up that pattern every year no it was kind of like a tradition you know how people who do cord cuttings like interpret how the wax melts yeah we would interpret how the year was going to go based on how the weaving looked was it good was it chaotic was it lopsided we would kind of jokingly say how the community's year was going to go was how the weaving went on the mapol and no we never did get it perfectly we had a lot of fun doing it we did and I I remember the May king and the May Queen when the weave got down didn't we like bind them to the m Pole or some the tradition was that the M King was bound to the mapole while everybody danced around and wo him up to the mapole and the May Queen everyone had different colored ribbons and the May Queen had a white ribbon and whereas everyone was supposed to dance in a specific pattern the May Queen represented chaos and she could dance any way she wanted to and weave in and out out however she chose but in the end the Mak King was supposed to be tied to the pole and not ritualistically sacrificed but um what do you say when it's fake like um symbolically sacrifice along with the pole so it's a big fertility dance which always makes me kind of giggle when I see little kids doing it outside of churches on Mayday but you know hey well we needed you to give perspective because as we pointed out last year you've been May queen and I never have yeah well you've been community staff holder and I never have so there like three times yeah exactly so see I think that's fair so we also very quickly before we go we do have a spell and a meditation that we will put up on the website for you guys and we will definitely get to at this time I promise a spell that you can do I call this the belain wishes spell all you need are some seeds wildf flower any type of seeds you like a small piece of paper if you have tissue paper recycled paper even better and basically all you're going to do is get yourself into magical space and think of an intention something that you want to grow and you're going to write that on the piece of paper and then you're going to put your seeds at the center of the paper and fold it over you know like you're going to close the seeds in like it's an envelope and then charge that little envelope of seeds just do a chant direct your energy into it however you want to charge that packet and then bury it in your garden and water it and then just every time you go out and water where you've buried that little packet just concentrate on your intention and as those seeds grow once they bloom so should your spell and you should see results simple enough yeah it's simple enough when things don't come to you to die when you're like cats and kids man that's it cats and kids that's true if you are a plant killing witch like shell maybe that's not the spell for you but I'll put that in also a a meditation a self-love meditation up on our website if you want to take a look at that back on the Broom stick.com happy belain happy belain everybody and thank you so much for listening we appreciate your likes your stars leave a comment a review it really helps the show out and it makes shell and I giggle like little kids it really does yeah makes our whole day so thank you very much and keep them coming we appreciate it so thank you
