we're here to do a podcast yeah it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to Episode 34 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends on opposite coast of the USA tell each other's spine tingling Tales of Terror from their half of the country while smoking some of the sweetest Tricom coated THC Laden Green Goddess ganja that all the cultivators in good old America can grow I can't believe all that just came out of your mouth so clear well I've been smoking on some fabulous Tropicana cherries we'll get to that in a second being apparently very articulate today I'm Leila and I apparently am very high and can hardly keep up with her articulations but I'm shell East Coast the ghosty Coast the best coast that's right you were gonna start saying you're the ghosty Coast I'm the ghosty Coast well I have decided for this episode I'm going to try and top your ghostin and I have another cursed location haunted location house of horrible history that now has hauntings I'm not sure well I think I can still outdo you because I have a multi-war used Fort o and this little old Fort we're going to talk about goes all the way back to being used with George Washington and his regiment so top that oh so you got a little bit of a history lesson thrown in there well schools around the country have either already started or underway so maybe your little history ghost story will be popular mine's more fun less school like I'm going to the lion house in Montana got a cool name right I just have this picture of like the the red Welsh lion they're Big Stone Lions but you know close interesting all right yeah what's something fun that we have heard in the news lately anything good or fun or Halloweeny or uh come on there's got to be something good in the news anything awesome I don't know I mean the big thing the big talk around the town here is we are 27 days out from Hocus Pocus 2 being released on Disney plus and most folks in the greater Salem area are like it's like the second coming of Jesus so people are pretty excited about it yeah sounds like it a little bit little bit so when I am at my daytime job I do actually have to go into the office a couple of days a week bummer I am starting to see folks walking downtown um throughout the day dressed as the Sanderson sisters it has begun great costumes though like these people go all out like they're hardcore fans and I can't even imagine they're doing um Salem the City of Salem is doing a a free showing of this movie in the I can't remember the date you'll have to Google it people like they they don't just show up like they dress up it reminds me of Rocky Horror honestly I love it got this like Rocky Horror Vibe but Hocus Pocus now if you were a Sanderson sister which Sanderson sister would you be that's hard because I think I embody some of each of them there's got to be a quiz yeah there has to be a quiz I guess I don't know because I I don't know i' I guess I'd have to say Sarah just because I have blonde hair because I do embody a piece of each of them I would be the one riding the vacuum somewhere but right me too doing that you know dancing around like some craz hippie who is like kind of Airhead sometimes but yet get me in a moment and [ __ ] City USA so yeah kind of all of of them really I go back and yeah I agree definitely I mean they're they're all like the three sides of any woman right you've got the the know- itall the I am in charge side you've got you know the [ __ ] sexy get into trouble side and then you know you got your a little bit goofy but occasionally right on the nose side sometimes clueless that's right so we're all a little Winfred a little Sarah a little Mary all of us I'm sure yeah so just I'm just kind of like the fourth sister who's like all of them together so if you're going to dress up as one of them which would you dress as the [ __ ] one definitely s definitely Sarah right I would probably be Winfred I would dress as Winfred I honestly I just don't think I could pull off the wig for for Winfred I know I love it that crazy red uptp hair I could totally do that or Mary I would love either of those costumes Mary I just adore the marry one I think also I would have a problem with the wig piece whereas the Sarah one I could just kind of go oh natural and not even have that's right just your pretty blonde hair just cing down and yeah so I don't know I guess I would have to decide if I was either on my goofy side in which case I would be Mary or if I was on my uptight [ __ ] [ __ ] witch side and then it'd be Winfred just depends on the mood at the moment that's right exactly exactly so there are actually quizzes oh here here this one's kind of fun so this Buzz Feud one are you ready sh you're going to take this quiz okay I'll I'm GNA take it let's see all right as a witch you aim to be vain cruel or liked vain cruel or liked yeah terrible answers but of those three which would you pick all of them but if I have to go with one I guess I'm gonna go with liked there you go don't we all just want to be loved which of the colors is the most bewitching blood orange deep violet or emerald green emerald green green is my favorite color hands down didn't even have to think about it there you go which of these powers do you desire most the ability to cast spells the ability to fly or the ability to enchant people spells hands down oh yeah absolutely what is your ideal mode of transportation the bus walking or a broom of course a broom of course which of these Disney witches do you like the best Ursula Maleficent or the evil queen the evil queen that's my girl what is your what is your weapon of choice electrokinesis casting a spell or hypnosis casting a spell yeah it was a tough one me between hypnosis and casting a spell but I think casting a spell wins hands down there I was kind of thinking which one had more diversity and I think casting a spell is more diverse than hypnosis I agree I agree what is your best trait I'm playful I'm smart or I'm loyal I'm loyal what do you dislike the most being called ugly being rejected or getting old rejected what is your biggest weakness shell is it men food or your short temper my short temper I knew that one and how would you seek revenge you don't need to take revenge you take it however you're told or by trying to inflict the most amount of pain possible go big or go home that's right go bigger go home what witch's accessory could you not live without a book of spells a cauldron or a broom book of spells absolutely oh yeah your biggest fear is others disapproving of me failure or losing your looks failure losing your looks so vain you are Winfred you're a natural you're a natural born leader with great Powers but also highly sensitive the damn wig right now you got to wear the wig what are you gonna do what are you gonna do yeah but isn't she the one who wears the green dress I do like green she is you would look fabulous in that dress I would say I would say you definitely would so so there you have it that's according to BuzzFeed that's which uh Sanderson sister you are well I am going to have to go around and uh walk around town this week somehow being all Winfred like there you go wear a nice green don't you have a green dress somewhere I do and you know the thing is is I'd fit in and no one would even look at me there you go no one would look twice they'd think you were fantastic but I I do I love that movie it's a lot of fun my kids call it Hocus Pocus season because we always get ready to you know we try to not watch that movie until October and then we can watch it as as we want but we can't watch it until October 1st you know the thing is is that now you're going to have to have like marathons we're getting into the Hocus Pocus Marathon now so you're gonna have to like start watching the first one gear yourself up for release date of number two and then once you've watched it and seen how great it is then for the whole month of October you're just gonna have to keep watching them back toback over and over right exactly that's what we're gonna do I mean there's so many I mean there's a lot of scary movies we love to watch scary movies and we're gonna have to watch uh we all podt down here and see if we can find some scary movies new ones for this season but definitely like to watch I love Coraline I love Corpse Bride corpse bride bride um you know one of my favorites Nightmare Before Christmas love it and then of course folks like us how can you forget the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown oh who doesn't love that how sweet yeah the classic you got to watch all of them but yeah it's just a good season I I will admit that on September 1st I started decorating for Halloween yeah it kind of and you know what's so weird is here in Massachusetts on September 1st it was a little bit cooler and that wind just was a little bit crisper like it literally felt like fall that day yeah we were kayaking the other day and uh I saw some leaves changing so I know I know it's coming the time has that's right you can feel it you can start to feel it Southern California right now is baking under a heat wave but everybody else you can start to feel that little hint of fall coming through but yeah I put out some purple lights out front I started putting up my pumpkins inside and uh on the on the Equinox is when I'll start to go crazy with everything that's what I love about living in the Northeast it's almost like a domino effect one leaf in the whole Northeast changes and they all start to change yeah this time of year you you get you start to get those first little hints that that first little smell something starts to smell like fall even before mbin corn is starting to be like four or five feet tall which if you know corn that just means it's about ready and corn means fall like all the pieces are falling into place for it and then you know of course it doesn't help that Dunkin Donuts do you know that they said September 1st is the beginning of pumpkin spice season I didn't know that a there was a season in B that it had a specific start date September 1st I like pumpkin pie and I I like pumpkin spice but I am not a fan of pumpkin spice everything there's pumpkin spice ramen noodles there's clothing that's imbued with pumpkin spice smell wow I didn't know that yeah and I don't I mean I love incense and oil and you know those oil diffusers and all of that but I can't do sweet smells anything that has like a sugar or a sweet or pumpkin iice is too much gives me a headache can't do it you know what I like this time of year boiling oranges like orange slices and cinnamon oh I love that or like mulling spices from mold cider just boiling some of that on a stove top I love that add and like you add some orange peel and just adds such a nice little touch orange boiling that is fabulous oh yeah and it's great for cleansing your space too magically and by a but it just gives you that fall vibe in your house like your house just starts to smell like fall and you're like oo yeah if you're not up for like baking some zucchini bread or pumpkin bread then just boiling some spices on your stove top is enough absolutely absolutely and it's almost like think of it as like a air freshener what's your what's the first thing you like to pull out when you think it's the fall season shell what's your first like first thing the first thing I do is I go and I I go reup as soon as they start putting in in the grocery stores you know how they have the cinnamon scented broomsticks oh I love those I don't know what my Fascination is with those but the minute you can get a cinnamon scented broomstick in the grocery store that's usually kind of like because they don't last very long the scent so then I when I see it I'll buy one throw away last year's put up a brand new one and then it just kind of snowballs from there once I get that scented broomstick it just snowballs I I do something similar if I can find one not too expensive because there's gorgeous ones out there but wreaths door wreaths oh yeah I really like the natural fall type door waths and if I can get one I try to get one like made of dried flowers or something really cool like that particularly if it has eucalyptus in it I know that's not really like a fall scent but that's one of my favorite scents you know it's all what you what it's all what you connect with right and if you put that into a nice wreath with some little gourds and some dried flowers and dried lavender and that type of thing I love those especially on my door and you get a little bit of that scent of the hay and the lavender and the eucalyptus it I I I enjoy that quite a bit so if I can find one uh inexpensively that someone has made nearby or if I can make one out of things of my own that's what I really it says fall to me when my door is decorated my problem is is as much as I find those beautiful they are beautiful do not get me wrong but they bring about the sneezies in me so as much as they are beautiful to me I do sometimes shy away from them because they trigger my allergies yeah and that that can be a real problem this time of year you know I mean you you said the hay and the minute you said the hay I was like so pretty oh it makes me want to sneeze just thinking about it so that's why sometimes I like more boiling the stuff because it lessens the allergen fact I do see in the stores that uh Halloween is in full swing boy is it I mean man are they starting early the only complaint I have is the Halloween candy it's everywhere and who's going to buy Halloween candy two months in advance and still have it on Halloween now two things one here in the greater Salem Massachusetts area Halloween stuff's been coming out since mid August right right and second I am guilty of I have bought Halloween candy already but that Halloween candy will not be making it to October 31st no I don't know anyone who can buy Halloween candy two months [ __ ] two weeks ahead of time and have it still be there I don't know if what I'm going to buy is going to last through the day to be hon right right especially like those pumpkin Reeses oh my god oh so good are they do they use a different kind of peanut butter or something like what's up with that I do something I love something that I am going to get hardcore judged by not just you but every listener we have I know what you're gonna say I love I'm shaking my head already I love candy corn no I knew you were gonna say that I love candy corn I don't even care yeah judging you know judging absolutely judging you know what else I love I also love circus peanuts they're like that orange hard marshmallow thing you probably eat peeps too so oh my God I love peeps yeah I'm that person but yeah I love candy corn e e no I do I do like the candy though I'll admit anything that's got like that peanut butter or caramel or they've been coming out with stuff that like that take five bar that has pretzels and caramel and chocolate but see now we're getting into caramel apple Susan a good caramel apple especially on the East Coast West Coast apples I found are different than east coast apples they are not as good how oh they're not no they're not I think you need that cold snap you know I think you need that cold New York Upstate East Coast kind of thing in order to get a nice crispy Apple similar to maple syrup possibly possibly but it's just not the same they don't taste the same well I guess you'll have to make a trip to the old Southern teer to get some caramel apples we'll stop on the way through because come hell or high water I am coming out there this weekend you better well before we get started what uh what are you smoking on over there in Massachusetts sh so I am actually smoking the rest of some melon baller I've had this before it's very good I think it's more of the relaxy than the go crazy cleaning and get my stuff done but you know hey everybody needs a relaxing afternoon and evening I like a good relaxy high I'm currently smoking on I went out and I bought some new weed o just wanted to try something a little bit you know different I get bored like you know even though I'm trying to save money I do get a little bit bored with what I'm smoking and it seems like there's a lot of runs have you noticed that things seem to kind of go in a like wave yeah yeah like there's a lot of cookies or then there's a lot of you know some type of white widow or some type of haze Haze or some type of runs is now popular for a little while everything was kind of black this black that there was a lot of ices now I'm getting a lot of cherries a lot of cherries so I'm right now I'm smoking some Tropicana cherries it's a sativa hybrid and this just has me feeling really happy very upbeat you know it's defin definitely a very cerebral high and it it does have a very sweet flavor shell I was going to ask you if it had like any sort of sweet fruity flavor it does it tastes very very sweet it has a definite sweet intake when I hit it it's just it has this purple kind of purple pinkish red um look to it it's very very pretty so it's definitely a upbeat High I'm trying to see if I can find what the THC on it is I'm pretty that's always important to me you know so how is yours tasting does it taste very good or it does taste good I wouldn't give it any sort of fruity or Melon type flavor but it it I don't know it tastes like good weed I will say this I had smoked some of it and I had been near a nonsmoker who said I kind of smelled like a skunk really actually what they said is they thought there was a skunk around and I was like oh no that's me yeah it happens hey you gota you got to watch out for that you know so all right so my nice sweet Tropicana cherries is you know it's just around a 22% THC so kind of just a good happy get things done High nothing that's going to really have you shooting for the stratosphere and I think it's just a very very pleasant taste it's very sweet pleasant good stuff so now that we know that we're both smoking something kind of happy and mellow let's uh let's get all scared scary and spooky with our stories o it this you know I I sometimes get really fascinated about how there's so many abandoned forts in the United States because there's really there's a lot particularly on the East Coast I think you know there's a lot that happened over there well you know a lot of them were built to kind of fight off the British that's why so like we're where we're going to go today uh this evening is we're going to go to Fort Mifflin Fort Mifflin is uh right on the outskirts of Philadelphia so as you can imagine you know Philadelphia is kind of where all the action was for the Revolutionary War so Fort mithin was commissioned in 1771 and it was for some reason considered one of the most terrifying places in America really I wonder why well did they torture people there like prisoners of war or something well hundreds of Revolutionary War CU like I said this was a this was a multi-war use uh facility so you know hundreds of Revolutionary War soldiers were killed uh during the battle at the Fort years later thousands of Civil War soldiers wasted away from starvation and disease locked away because it was created as a prison uh during that time period so you know between it serving as a as a active Force that saw a battle in one war it then turned into a prison in the next War so there's no shortage recycling of the [ __ ] right there's there's no shortage of death and despair uh at this place right and honestly this was the most interesting fact I found because you know it's not like I'm chasing down Revolutionary War history by any means but I found out that Fort Mifflin is um one of the last surviving Revolutionary War battlefields really yeah who knew honestly I would have thought uh there were older places but yeah no this is it they actually host a paranormal program and they give visitors a chance to sleep with the ghosts we should go sleep at a fort in Pennsylvania you can go camp out there like sleep overnight and do ghost hunts yeah what I read is that um they give visitors the chance to sleep with the ghosts oh creepy now they there's a couple of specific ghosts um that I found about and we'll get into in a few minutes um one is called The Faceless man that does not sound good well the other one's called the screaming woman maybe she saw the faceless man you know a lot of actually the screaming woman and the faceless man I would scream if I saw a faceless man I mean would she die of fright or something maybe it's me that would be me I would be scream ah and would die a fright because of the faceless band but there's actually been paranormal investigators that have claimed now you know everybody claims this and we've heard this tale before is it a gate to hell or is it the most haunted fort in America are you being like psychic Lea today so first of all Fort Mylin is supposed to be one of the most haunted places in the world yeah okay I was close I was close and I don't know if you ever heard of this show have you ever heard of a show that was on um I can't even remember when it was on it was called portals to hell and it had um no Jack Osborne ay's kid was yeah yeah was it one where he went around to like scary places and like yeah to cool hey Jack if you want to be on our show dude would love to have you so Jack Osborne took his show portals to hell to Fort Mifflin so cool did they find anything what did they hear ooh actually they felt that it was definitely completely full of Paranormal Activity they actually brought in some other Ghost Hunters after the fact they thought that there was definitely a lot of active areas there something about seeing glowing eyes and shifting Shadows question is it a stone Fort yes yes typical of that era you know when you look at I think there's something with stone I really do we keep running into this this isn't really a theory that I had before I started doing all this research and telling stories with you shelle but I think there's something with stone and this Stone Fort having seen so Much Death and so much strife and War I am I'm very not surprised I will say though that that at least half the structure is Brick okay that's all right but same I mean brick is essentially a t i I see what you're saying yes it is a a a structure of that nature but there is definitely something going on there I mean they've had all kinds of famous um investigators there even cbs3 out of Philadelphia did a whole story about in there and they they basically say that there's experiences morning noon and night they've had overnight guests leave in the middle of the night they have had they couldn't hack sleeping with the ghosts couldn't handle it and they have one of your favorite types of activ there there's orbs there are orbs [ __ ] yes let's go I'm there let's go take pictures I'm setting up cameras we're going to have them in all the hallways that's cool [ __ ] cool pretty much every paranormal team that has visited there they have captured orbs of light they've gotten glimpses of apparitions behind door frames they've recorded disembodied voices visitors often see soldiers cleaning their guns oh that's sad kind of like the whole going to work every day ghost that that one where they just kind of replay the same thing over and over again sometimes um visitors will catch whiffs of like um bread that was freshly baked or like a wood fire when there's no fires in the area oh wow but again like I said all times of the day and night you can randomly just hear something that sounds like a woman screaming they're not sure they can't necessarily track it back to particular woman that was there it's like the scream of every woman to find out that her son her lover her husband her father has died absolutely that could be you know it's it's like that banshe not a Banshee necessarily because they pretend a future death but it's like the it's like the collective scream of Sorrow you know yeah or I'm just high no it it totally could be but people claim to have been touched pushed pulled I mean like there there's activity there so this faceless guy they see his Apparition roaming through the property and Civil War attire so they can see that he's wearing like Civil War attire but has no face that's [ __ ] creepy part that freaks me out it ain't the ghost itself it's the fact that you have no face right where's his face why the [ __ ] doesn't he have his face what is up with that is he like okay if I'm being existential with the screaming woman is he like the faceless Unknown Soldier like is he the AR type for soldiers everywhere or is he some sort of [ __ ] demon with no face well let me tell you about who they think it is oh [ __ ] um many people believe that that the faceless man um is uh the spirit belongs to a William H how how was notoriously executed at the Fort during the Civil War oh [ __ ] what was he executed for well some Ghost Hunters are quick to paint him um as a treacherous murdering Outlaw and they claim his spirit is an evil force that stalks the for Fort ruins it for vengeance so they don't think the faceless man is a good ghost no stalking it for vengeance he was killed because he was like a murderous [ __ ] or something and now he's like still there being all creepy in the afterlife now see this is where you get conflicting stories because that is called the legend of the faceless man and then found something else in different research that was called the true story of The Faceless man so I'm going to tell you a little bit about this and then you can kind of figure out which one you might want to go with okay what I found to be the quote unquote true story of The Faceless man they still think it's William H how that's not into dispute but he was a a 25-year-old who was in the Union Army and he they thought he was very uh courageous uh type person but they think that he actually came down with denter o yeah I know that from the Oregon Trail yeah right didn't everyone get denter everyone yeah and you know denter was exactly you were either running out of food or getting that in Oregon Trail pretty much so that was really kind of one of the number one killers of all Civil War soldiers some people believe that he was just a 25-year-old Union soldier that basically died at denter whereas the legend crazy you know paints him as some treacherous murdering Outlaw why doesn't he have a face though okay so you're just some random soldier that had the bad luck to not wash your hands and or drink bad water and die of dissenter and why don't you have a face I mean you're just a ghost ghosts have I never found out why why he doesn't have a face he's that's just how he's described and face I'm sorry he had to have done no I'm I'm more inclined to believe the murderous [ __ ] Theory because you're just a regular dude who died from [ __ ] yourself to death you're going to have a face your ghost will have a face I mean you you might have crappy drawers but you're going to have a face maybe he's too embar maybe he's too embarrassed to show his face cuz he [ __ ] himself to death wouldn't you wouldn't well maybe I mean we've all had we've all had accidents I mean come on everyone has had some sort of terrible accident in their past I'm sure but not not me I'm sure everyone else I was wondering if maybe uh you know because of what happened there who's to say you didn't get your face shot off true good point who's to say what ghost it I mean there's had to have been hundreds of people that they could choose from that would be the ghost but if all these Ghost Hunters are getting some sort of malevolent feeling from it I I would be inclined to think it was probably someone who had malevolent intent in life well remember like I said this fort was used to hold off the British Fleet after Washington's Army Was Defeated at Brandywine so that's where the start was the fact that it was used during the Civil War we all know the Civil War was just some brutal brutal stuff but they used that um in World War II as well they didn't stop with the Civil War using it it was World used in World War I and World War II as well right so now you have three and three is a shitty number particularly when you're talking about things like murder and bloodshed if you get that you know triple in a space what are those stones holding on to right and you know the thing is you turn it into a hospital as well and not only do you have the people who were killed in battle oh no now you got suffering now you have suffering which could go back to the screaming woman maybe she was a nurse maybe she was a a a a wife or a sister or a mother who was there in someone's last moments it's just there's a lot there and it seems like other than the screaming woman all of the the apparitions the disembodied voices all of that all men all the apparitions uh are are usually soldiery in some form or fashion what sense I mean that's what it saw that's what was there like a few women would have been like you said like the occasional nurse at that time or possibly a a relative who had come to collect someone or who' come to visit someone at the hospital now there are people though who claim that you might hear children play uh children playing around and that there has been an apparition of a dog as well but you know it's been in use for a very long time I'm sure there have been all sorts of things that have gone on there right including families staying there oh absolutely and children I mean with that many people dying and dead that that's a powerful force when someone is dying that type of energy so who's to say that that's not yet like I I I know I kind of half jokingly said the screaming woman could be like a collective unconscious you know sorrow from women in general but it's possible and the same thing with the the children that could be like all these men thinking of their childhood or their own children that they'll never get to see again as they're dying or in their last moments or right and so they have all kind of put this memory into this space so maybe it is physical children or maybe again it's that it's those that last dying wish of these men to go back to Childhood or to bring their children to them and and it's just kind of an archetype in those stones it's definitely very sad and I I do find you know there's some some forts uh around where I live uh that we've visited and they're just kind of eerie and historical and cool and sad and the energy is is very all over the place you grew up like I did in upstate rural New York where Stone fences are common and we played around them and the forest in those areas is different it it feels different it just has a slightly different vibe it's old but it's there and there's sadness there and there's there's I don't know even if there might not necessarily have been battle there you can feel the energy definitely palpable definitely helpable and I'm sure this place having seen three three times that type of of energy plus the hospital that's a lot yeah that's a lot I bet it's a creepy [ __ ] place the creepiness has had to have seeped into the stones themselves I don't know if I would totally buy the most one of the most haunted places in the world per they're all that they all have to say that I would agree this is not I definitely think that this is is absolutely haunted and it's probably beautiful because it's right on along the Delaware River right out uh near Philadelphia Airport it's right on the river so it's got to be like a beautiful I can just picture this beautiful old like Stony Fort but it can't be I can't say it can't be I'm just I I have a hard time believing it's one of the most haunted places in the world that's a pretty large statement in my book yeah but three Wars one place I don't know it's it's definitely it's got to be a contend America one of the most haunted places in America America sure I would buy it 100% but in the world yeah the world has seen a lot of things so you know 1915 the war department actually declared it a national historical monument so that's cool it ain't going anywhere right we should go spend the night there and then we can decide for ourselves we'll we'll rank it we should go to all these places and be like a a score of 1 to 10 sh how [ __ ] up was this place exactly because because what they say on on their website is that you can go during the day for free you can pay for an overnight package that ranges from six hours to totally overnight and you have to make a reservation that's it and like I said you're right on the Delaware River right outside of the Philadelphia Airport like how cool all right I'm penciling this on our list we're going to go there spend the night definitely doing overnight we we've got to get we need ask the faceless man why he's faceless why are you faceless why does that woman keeps screaming what's going on what to your face yes maybe not with a Ouija board or maybe with one if we're feeling you know Reckless right if we've smoked some of that good weed if we want to [ __ ] around and find out then we want right we usually do want to [ __ ] around and find out that's our problem I I know when it comes to playing it safe or going the route that could have consequences consequences every time every time every time that's right so I that's my story about Fort Mifflin and like I said I think it sounds like a really cool place to actually go visit and we should definitely put that on our bucket list but as far as spookiness I would definitely give it a 10 out of 10 other than the part where if you put United States instead of hookline and sinker absolutely I agree I agree it sounds very scary and it definitely makes me want to I want to get a ghost hunting kit together you know like I said before I'm kind of looking at how to put together a spear box and all that but you know I really want a nice little kit it's something with an EVP recorder you know the the Spirit Box thing maybe those flashlights that you can unscrew just a little bit and sit down and be like that was creepy is that your Spirit Box I guess it was no it was the Google that went off for some reason I thought you if you if you were gonna say no that came off a your end I was just gonna stop right now it creep me right the [ __ ] out if anybody out there has suggestions for Lea's ghost hunting equipment to-do list get us by email the stone wiches @gmail.com Lea needs ideas yeah what's your essential ghost hunting tool so that the flashlights right that you unscrew just a little bit and you sit down and be like if anyone is here touch the flashlight and turn it on and then they touch it and it turns on and then it blinks off and you ask them questions and they can blink the light on or off have you ever seen that yeah like the yes no thing I love that I love those my problem is is I'm always the one that goes well why don't we just get a Ouija board instead well yes Ouija boards are fun but these are fun too so I love the light thing and I love the I so I need a travel Ouija board I need a good flashlight I need a Spirit Box I need an EVP recorder um yeah so tell me what else I need you know what you need you need those um thermal goggles goggles can't I just get like a thermal reader does it have to be goggles I look terrible goggles it doesn't have to be goggles but they're just so much cooler but like the so I could look kind of futuristic I guess the thermal reader where you can see the the heat different the hot and cold patches and stuff you know what I'm saying oh yeah absolutely because I think you know not that I'm any professional here don't call me Zack baggin by any stretch but I think that those seem to be like the that's definitive in my opinion that's the goto I see a lot of people like to do this thing now the Spirit Box thing where where you get this scanner and you have somebody in headphones and and so they can't hear the people outside and then the people outside are asking questions and then the people hooked up to the Spirit Box only repeat what they hear come out of the Spirit Box so they can't hear you asking questions they can they can only say what the Spirit Box says and I love that too that's a lot of fun oh my God I'm gonna have to try that with you right we need that for our trip it's going to be fun all right so let me hit some more of this tropical Cherry o i just i o every time I hear it it's sweet it tastes so good you know me I'm a sucker for something that looks pretty and tastes as good as it looks it just tastes so good and so sweet I mean I I know it's only like a 22% THC but that's a really good one you know that is what most people I think would consider high and it's just a nice mellow Feelgood smoke I love it one [Music] sec so my story this evening takes us to Montana and I had a lot of fun with this one because it seems like yet again I'm drawn into like a haunted location you know it seems like a lot of these places aren't just caused Maybe by one act it almost seems like some of them something in the area seems off you know what I'm saying is that why you were asking me if my story had Stones I think so yeah because this particular House was built completely out of uh Sandstone that was native to the area and it kind of made me wonder if that has something to do with why it's been so haunted basically from the minute it was built so let me back up all right so this is the house is the McGill house and it's known as the creepiest most haunted spot uh oh I kept saying Montana didn't I in North Dakota is that where it's at yeah it's really in North Dakota my other one is in Montana so so Dakota Dakota this house is in North Dakota so it's it's the McGill house and it's the creepiest most haunted spot in North Dakota now it's also known by the lion house and it's called The Lion house because at one time there were two large lion statues that kind of guarded the front door on the front porch I love a good lion statue right who doesn't that's kind of fantastic the whole house is pretty gorgeous it's I wouldn't say it is the most ornate house but it's very large and and very pretty um and it was built by a gentleman named Alexander Dickinson or it was built in Dickinson by a name oh my God I should not have smoked so much [ __ ] weed the lion House was built in Dickinson North Dakota in 1895 by a man called AC mcgil fry Alexander mcgil Fray he can I just point out to you that we you're going right back to a story in the late 1800s what's with the late 1800s and ghost it's a trend it's a trend it does seem to be maybe we were you know all the building we say sometimes Renovations and everything kind of stir up ghosts maybe all the expansion and all the building kind of stirred up the native ghosts of the land I don't know they had to because you know the more episodes we do the more I'm finding this is an active time period it really is it does seem to be a very ghosty time period you're exactly right so this house right it was built in 1895 and it was built three floors high and it was built completely of native Sandstone from the area from the basement to the attic the third floor and it was very grand for the time and it sat on two full City Lots so right in the middle of Dickinson and very large house very large hug this was a very huge house okay very big house very imposing and Alexander and his wife moved in before it was completed unfortunately shortly after moving in his wife of just a few years passed away in the house it always happens don't move into the house before it's built or the wife will die it always happens it does seem like a bad movie so she passed away and they had her wake and funeral in the house and then just a few short years later Alexander himself aged just 48 also passed away in the house some Say by suicide because he was despondent over his first wife's loss so he passes away and they have his funeral and wake in the house as well and the house is still not completed what was with people having funerals and wakes in their houses in that time period are you asking for trouble so creepy well I guess until that one guy out on the west coast that I talked about in a recent episode that hopefully future me will stick in right here he started like the first you know with the the first he started the first funeral home so at that time maybe there there weren't funeral homes I guess it was common for people to have like a wake in your home yeah but I'm just thinking that's making some potential energy stick maybe that's another reason why places were so haunted in this time period because these OTS were having funerals in the house I don't know so um local Legends said that for the house that the house changed hands often for years after that with no one ever really staying there for long and no one completing the renovations on the house and then a few years later a family moved in that seemed to kind of stick it was a a man and his wife and their two children and they started work on the house and things seemed fine until one day they weren't fine anymore but husband snapped I couldn't find why but all the Legends say that the man came home from work one day went upstairs to the bedroom and this sounds awfully familiar to my house but he got home early from work got a gun went upstairs to the bedroom and killed his wife oh wow barricaded all the doors and the windows with the furniture in the house took his two children into the basement and killed his two children what an ass and then went up to the attic and hung himself and they did they have no no no reason to know why they don't know why no I couldn't find any reason why I could find some variations on the legend some that said he hung himself from a Banister in the stairwell and some that he hung himself in the attic and some that he hung himself in the staes which was in the Northwest portion of the of the property and it's now converted into a garage let ask that why is that so why is that the one detail that's so varying is there some relevance to the location of where he died I'm not sure but um people do report that they can see one of the hauntings that people see is if you stand in the alleyway uh there are pictures and people have reported seeing a man hanging from the rafters in the windows so you can see his ghost there so oh the relevance is that I guess if if people are seeing him in the house and and two of the Legends say that he hung himself somewhere in the house I don't know I guess it just goes to show that sometimes things change a little bit I don't know if there's any particular reason why it changed yeah but because people see his ghost in the house I'm more inclined to believe that he did it there other than the children it sounds identical to the legend in my town about the house that I grew up in there's doesn't seem to be any cheating in this story very interesting though the similarities right it just kind of follows a lot of similar local type Legends I wonder if there's always like a ghost house in a town that maybe has a similar sorted type past right right so the legend says that this happened and that for a few years after that the house remained empty and then changed hands quickly again so Town's people after the murder suicide in the house say that no one could walk past it even if you didn't know what had happened there without feeling a sense of for boing like a a heavy sick ominous feeling they could feel all the shittiness that happened absolutely buyers came and went and then it it was turned into apartments for a short period of time and there are reports from some residents who say they heard that it was haunted and they never saw anything but there's also some residents who say they couldn't stay there for very long because they kept seeing a shadow man walk down the hallways that wouldn't be there on closer inspection oh one former tenant says that she lived there as a child and one time they used a Ouija board in one of the rooms and after that the Poltergeist type activity of things being moved and doors slamming got worse and worse until they eventually had to move out see I think that in any situation there is a type of people maybe not type of people is the right way to say it a group of people that you're going to put in any haunted situation and they're not going to feel a damn thing that doesn't necessarily negate that Paranormal Activity though right exactly and maybe they were living in a portion of the house that wasn't as haunted and maybe some of these people were because some of the hauntings that people describe is that particularly in in some of the upstairs rooms you can hear a woman you can hear first her voice and it starts it sounds like she's pleading or coaxing someone and she starts to talk faster and faster and you can't hear what she's saying but the sound is more and more desperate and more and more pleading until she just starts sobbing and then there's nothing well that's kind of unsettling just saying right but if you weren't in one of those rooms maybe you would never have heard that or experienced that you know maybe in the Next Room over you just never get that scary ghost woman like some of these hotels that you've done like the Stephen King Hotel you know a lot of that was in one room if you weren't in that one room you might not catch anything another former resident claims that um or not a resident I'm sorry she was a woman who stayed uh with a resident as a child she would often spend the night with her friend or cousins there I'm not sure which one but she said that she would very often spend the night there and it was difficult for her because she kept seeing a man walk into the room and then he'd be gone you know she'd ask who the man was and of course no one would know what she was talking about but she and her cousin would report seeing children playing in one of the rooms and they they looked like they were talking seriously together but you couldn't hear any sound that they were making and then when you would get closer to them they'd stop and disappear oh other people report faces of children in the windows even when there was no children living in that particular apartment or even when the house was vacant there's pictures and reports of people seeing faces of children in the windows they also report hearing children sobbing in the basement that's where you said that the father ended their lives correct that's right and and people report that the the feeling of fear and oppressive like almost like an ominous bad like something bad is about to happen type feeling is very very heavy in the basement and you can often hear children crying so it sounds like this house is just fully absorbed that particular point in time and is just picking up all the the death and sadness it seems like it now on the opposite side after it was Apartments again it stayed empty for a little while and it was purchased by a woman named Becky Brunk she says she intended to turn it into a bed and breakfast and spent decades renovating it and then got married and she and her husband were renovating it to live in she never spent one night in the house why she says it's because the renovations were never completed she owned the house for about two decades so is she what did she stir up did you find out what she stirred up you know it's not about Renovations she says she's the one who has gifted the lion statues and she put them out front in an attempt to change the house from being the haunted house to being the lion house because she claims to never have felt any type of Haunting or Spirit there except a couple times when she was there alone renovating and the feelings of oppressive sadness and oddness would get so much that she'd have to leave but oh that's not anything she'd say but she never spent one single night in that house interesting and she claims that she sold it eventually because the trespassing and the vandalism got to be too much honey live in the [ __ ] house and that probably would have stopped why didn't she live there what peer from wanting to live there and she owned it like not too long ago I believe till 2013 don't quote me on that but it wasn't too very long ago and I haven't been able to find out who owns it now but I have seen that it's still vacant and people will try to do like they'll walk around outside or up on the porch and I even saw one um amateur investigator called uncommon phenomena uhuh they went there and did an inv investigation and did some EVP recordings outside the house what they get she said is there anything you want to say and the EVP came back as he hit me she said why are you here and you can hear come back I live here oh [ __ ] then she says are you still in the house and the EVP sort of sounded like yes or yeah maybe it wasn't very clear but it almost sounded like yes then it got a little weird she says is anyone else in the house other than the family that was killed there and the EVP comes back how old are you I think you're going to let me in okay now I'm getting a little creeped out what's that supposed to mean I don't know she had a few more some were more clear some not very clear at all but those were very very creepy and some other amateur investigators I haven't found anyone you know well known that has been there but several local and other amateur investigators have been there and done some kind of outside investigations and they all get various EVP recordings similar to the ones I mentioned there's photos of ghost children like a full-blown what looks like a child standing on the porch oh wow along with photos of children in the windows and the photo and um a man in the upstairs window I couldn't tell if he was hanging or just a male figure but it did look very very clearly like a male figure in what's supposed to be an empty house right supposedly the police will check it just to make sure no vandals or anyone has gone through and they will occasionally get reports of like lights or sounds but they've never seen that anyone is there or has broken in when they go to check it however local Legend says that when the police get there to do their random checks all the doors and windows are barricaded with what little furniture and items are left in the rooms and so they kind of clear them out and go room to room make sure that all the doors and windows are locked nobody could have gotten in and they put everything back and leave and then the next time they go to do a random check on the house all the doors and windows are barricaded but everything's locked and no one could have gotten in oh so things are still moving even though there's no one there and I guess at one point I believe when Becky Brunk owned it it was turned into an actual haunted house experience for like Halloween for a little while but from what I could find they only did it once because I guess the vibe was just too creepy and too real for like the actors as well as the visitors it was just a little too on the nose I guess H and so at least that's the rumor that I heard but it hasn't happened again I have no idea who owns it now but it's still empty everyone still says it has like a dark cloud of negative energy around it and it's still [ __ ] haunted as hell so it's just vacant it's just vacant and no one seems to be able to live in it for very long they don't even do ghost tours I'm I'm as shocked as you are we should try to find out if it's who owns it we should buy it sh let's go live in North Dakota do people live in North Dakota yeah and it's cold oh well I don't like cold well you can live in it in North Dakota and I will come visit you and I will help in the Summertime with the tours but yeah I mean it it's just I think that that's just saturated land that's one of those that I think that they could tear that house down and probably that same Paranormal Activity will happen at that location because those folks don't probably realize they're dead yeah and I I wonder if it's the stone like everything I could find about the house is that it was built of like this native sandstone and so they put all this Stone there that's basically like a Sandstone is native that far north I guess I don't know what that means I am no geologist but uh you know you put that there and then maybe it was just bad luck with the first couple of deaths and that just kind of set its fate maybe or maybe it was something already in the land I don't know what do what do you guys think what do our listeners think anybody from North Dakota have you ever heard of the McGill R house the lion house what town is it what town is it again what Town North Dakota it's in Dickinson North Dakota interesting let us know folks if you have ever been to this house heard of this house know stories of
