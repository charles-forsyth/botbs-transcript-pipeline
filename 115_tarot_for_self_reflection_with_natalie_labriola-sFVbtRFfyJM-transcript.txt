welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode we have a special guest Natalie labriola Natalie is an artist astrologer and Tarot reader in Los Angeles California her book tarot Timeless secrets of the ancient mirror came out in the u.s.a. this past March and it is a small But Mighty introduction to the Fool's journey of the major Arcana and I'm shell in wow this is you know you even had a line in the book this is a dense informative pocketbook and you aren't kidding so welcome Natalie and please tell us a little bit about yourself and how did you get into tarot and astrology so much for having me I'm really happy to be here with you guys you know I found my way to Tara and astrology because I found myself in a season of life where I was searching for a different way of living and  the tarot kind of stumble I kind of stumbled upon the tarot accidentally I I was at like a museum gift shop I was at The Cloisters Museum in New York museum of medieval art and they had this terror attack on display this medieval Tarot deck and I was just very compelled by the imagery and so I purchased a deck in the gift shop and I just a thought you know this will be kind of like a fun souvenir of my trip or I didn't really have a lot of expectation around what it could do or what the tarot really was so it was just so that was like my first encounter with the tarot and that was when I was in my late twenties the beginning of my Saturn return I have a question ready for that I had a little sneak peek into that because I have read some of the things you've written online you do have a website I think was it a sub stack essay possibly but you meant  that you had found tarot during your your Saturn return your 29 return and for our listeners that don't know what that is that happens roughly when you're about 28 or 29 when Saturn returns to the same position that it was in when you were born and what that does is a ushers in a period of change and self-reflection all the things they've learned all the lessons that you had in your life up to then kind of coming to you and a lot of things happen so I was very intrigued by the fact that you found tarot at your 29 return so I didn't mean to interrupt but I just found that part of a kind of fascinating I know it didn't I mean in retrospect of course it makes sense but at the time it didn't feel you know if it was a hard season and it's funny to talk about it now because like I said in retrospect it sort of makes sense or it feels linear it feels coherent but at the time it felt like just a period of I think several years where I was just searching for answers in  what's my health I was that kind of. Where I had to become more focused on my physical health that was also during my Saturn return and I found out I haven't primary immune deficiency which basically just meant that I was getting sick all the time and that I you know couldn't find a doctor to help me figure out what was going on for many years and so I felt like I was just in this limbo space for several years where I kind of had to rethink the work I was doing which was you know out going to a job you know 5 days a week out in the world and couldn't really do that in a way that felt sustainable to me at that. And I kind of got burnt out on what I had been doing for the past which was focusing on my art and trying to be like an artist and sort of like the art world and and quotes and so just a lot of things kind of came to a halt  and I didn't really know what I was doing or what was it felt like I had to let go of everything in my life or anything in my life that I kind of previously thought to find me and just kind of surrender to this. Of not knowing and I found that the tarot and astrology I tried a lot of different things I mean in addition to like the health stuff that I mentioned it also went on this kind of emotional search spiritual Surge and tried a bunch of different modalities like I learned how to read the akashic records and shamanic journeying and an apprenticeship with Mimi Jung who teaches shamanic journeying and tried a bunch of different things and it just felt like tarot and astrology where the tools that really clicked for me and so terrible in particular was really helpful for just reflecting back  me where I was in that moment and helping me to get in touch with myself in a deeper way you know even though it felt like this kind of long and uncomfortable process which you know doesn't have a beginning and an end it's like feel like what tarot has helped me to be more comfortable with is that feeling of not knowing effort and just asking better questions I like being able to stay with the questions in a different way and trusting my own intuition and in a deeper way so in those ways like tarot helps me to kind of come home to myself in a new way and to just be with the uncertainty of life that is you know I know I've always always being on your own. Journey exactly so I didn't ever think when I found the Terrell  I would end up loving it and wanting to write about it and read about it and study it but and in fact I really like resisted it for a long time because I really was clinging to this idea that like I needed to be an artist in the way that I thought that I needed to be and I needed to and I was there was a lot of what kind of force and so I came here sort of Kicking and Screaming but I am happy to be where I am now I guess but remember what the heck was that you saw in the museum yeah yeah it was Luigi scapini medieval tarot it's I don't know if it's a super common duct but it seems like you have I have kind of sore I have breached I've reached over the 200 Mark of tarot Decks that I own  impressive it sounds like an impressive it's more like obsessive impressive works too I'm sure you can kind of relate to I only use probably out of the 200-plus decks I had I probably only use two or three of them and it's almost like I like to collect the art of them each one universe exactly exactly do you have a favorite deck I have to ask I love that deck it has a special place in my heart for sure and I love that it's inspired by connect to meet evil ducks and those are probably even though I don't use them in readings I just love the art like the visconti-sforza deck is one of my my favorite decks of all time in terms of contemporary decks I really like the Pagan otherworlds deck and I just use the right or wait when I'm doing  thanks it's just you know it's it's kind of basic but it's just what kind of speaks to me the most I think the most clearly and reading it's amazing how well Pixies art comes through Pamela Colman Smith that are just so many people so easily now yeah she really created a map for so many people to follow and speaking of a map when I first read the title of your book time with secrets of the ancient mirror in my first thought was like I'm intrigued about this mere idea where we holding a mirror up to I really like how you bring the tarot internal this is all about working with yourself so a lot of people love to use tarot to read the future or read someone else's future and I love that too that's wonderful but I very much love it for internal reflection for journaling with it for seeing my own patterns for working on the things that I need to work with  and in the introduction when you first start talking about the Fool's journey and you talk about how tarot mirrors your own inner wisdom I just I love that in this is a beautiful map to help you work through the cars and we talked a lot about journaling cards and pulling cars and just looking at what draws you and attracts you and what do you feel about it and how does it make you thinking and really riding through that and the term map was really great I like how you said that that was a good way to put it thank you for that I love the tarot for self-reflection cuz I think it's such a insightful mirror it really you know is such a precise tool for that kind of work and you know I think that you know because the inner and the outer I think our souls are connected in some way I think the tarot can speak to both right cuz there isn't such a hard division so I think that it's a tricky thing because  often I think people here tarot and they think fortune-telling they think being a scam artist or whatever and it's it's not that it can't do that I think that a lot of ways modern no tarot readers maybe try to stay away from that myself included because because of all of the negative baggage that comes with the idea of you know trying to predict someone's future and but I do think that the idea of fate or destiny is more mysterious and we can really understand that you're working with a into something that doesn't it's not like a linear it's ancient and it's also futuristic it's like it's not connected to a linear idea of time and so  in that way it can be till I got in our world our outer World our future are past or present so yeah so I'm I guess maybe I didn't get to explore that as much as I would have liked to in the book just cuz it's so it really had to be you know we don't want to paint ourselves into a corner and say that we're trying to predict someone's future but we also want to leave room for the fact that this is the mysterious force that we tap into and and it has you know reflected future events with Clarity or so many people's I think it's just finding it a way to talk about it that doesn't freak people out or did it freak ourselves out because yeah I mean I mean sometimes it freaks me out when I get scary accurate it's a nerve in my father's really really good and I was definitely  spooked because there's so many synchronicities here we just recently did a meditation ritual we presented at a conference in Maryland and it was the Fool's journey and we we walked a Fibonacci spiral because we talked about how the Fool's journey is not a straight line it's a spiral and you even say that in this book in the instruction almost word-for-word some of the things that the concept that we explored in this in this ritual were that that we are all on this. Any that is a spiral it's not a straight line life is not very often made up of straight talk you can be at multiple different parts on the spiral at one time and other people are on there with you past present future of yourself of them and we're kind of all in this beautiful spiral dance and then I I love how you talked about that in here you said this is not a linear a cent to Greatness but rather a spiraling past holness  almost said those exact words and so I can I love that idea of the full path as the spiral of the Spiral of Life next stop is far as synchronicities so during our Fool's Journey ritual you know I'm a big fan of takeaways I've convinced Layla Layla and crafts for all of the ritual participants she crafted a bunch of different fool cards and the idea and I could exchange it at the end so you know she created a couple of designs on her own but a couple of designs she had chosen off the internet is part of cards that we gave away so we're in the public domain some beautiful cards but I just resonated with tell her the full cards that you chose and how that relates to her book of course  Rider Waite Smith because he's got to love fixing the one card I didn't use was the visconti-sforza although I thought that was beautiful I did use the lefou card from Oswald worth stuck and and also from the polsky deck and on your page of the fool you had almost every single full card there we had used the road in the rest of them out there so I just thought it was kind of cancer is other day it was very cool to open up to the first page with a fool it was beautiful coincidence or friends have been very deep into tarot for decades.  Like I said I have more deaths than any one person really should have and no shame I will buy more but one thing I never got deep into is the aspect of tarot as it relates to the Kabbalah tree of life and that was the very first thing I see when I open up the book so can you just talk a minute about how that relates to Tarot  yeah so to try and be succinct about it because vast subject but to try and be succinct I would say that the tarot emerged from the 15th century Italy right so it has we sort of know its Origins but we don't know there isn't a lot of writing about what the purpose of the major Arcana was or how do the original artist if there was one envisioned it but it does happen to map onto these other systems of thought of you know there's the 12 signs of the zodiac with the ten planets and so that creates a system of 22 which Maps nicely on to the major Arcana and then the Kabbalah has also  there are twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet so there's a resonance with that system and terms of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the major Arcana it's just another lens through which you can look at the tarot and maybe find another layer of meaning I don't necessarily think that any of these things baked into the original major Arcana or the Terra but they're just sort of layered into the book as an offer as an offering of like this is another layer you can add to it if you want to if it brings meaning to you or if that's a system that you're already familiar with then maybe you can connect to that in a different way but it was presented kind of has just like a list of almost correspondences for that reason so that someone kind of wanted to go deeper already knew about it they could connect to it but yeah there wasn't a lot of information  in the book about I guess for that reason is because it would be a thought it could be about it right so it's just kind of like a little to say you are other books about this are there other ways to like learn about this more but it's definitely a fascinating Rabbit Hole to explore and to wonder about and to find connections between but I do feel kind of has its own unique Essence that doesn't match perfectly on to any other system necessarily I understand you are also interested in Appleton Pac magic with symbology and protection symbols and so that I'm not surprised that finding interest in the tree of life and in different symbols of interesting to you but in the book I love that you have like right at the top you have different symbols that are associated with each card and when you talk about  major Arcana cards you packing so there's the symbols right of the top you talk about the numbers you talk about the different correspondences and different things it's like a quick dense guide of information where you might not necessarily go deep into each piece but they're all there they're all right there for your brain to catch onto so you know when I'm journaling and I pulled the emperor having this book right here you know after I get my first initial Impressions and my ideas as I'm you know meditating or working with that card I can pull this book out you know this might give me a whole other Rabbit Hole to go down as I'm studying that card because you have so much information here that you pull out and make it easy to see that's why I love the very last page which is a whole page of Correspondence and mostly gone too and they're they're fascinating how you can layer them on top of different things and to go back to Pamela Colman Smith art just all the different things that she put in there  whether it was from whatever system that she took it from her whoever's information she got it from she layered it all in there they were symbols and there's numbers and things repeated you know the Fool's Journey you see different symbols repeated over and over again and you bring a lot of that here in the end you bring attention to it so I'll do it again it's not a big book it doesn't necessarily in depth but it's right hand tastic reference book when you want to have a guy that might give you more information I told Layla before we started recording that this is like the perfect looked like throw in your backpack you know you might not necessarily bring the big 70 degrees of wisdom but they don't fit in your backpack spreads I also very much enjoy that you included a different spread to help you work with each card more can you talk to us about different spreads and then are there any that you really like to use  yeah I I just started I came up with them based off of questions that I find myself asking not only for myself but for when I do readings for other people as well so I just tried to kind of  think about what are what are the questions that Tara was very good at answering the kinds of questions that Tara was good at answering and what are you do 22 ways to kind of pull those apart and make them into bigger spreads and so I don't think there's anything that the tarot can't address but I do think that there's ways of crafting questions that help you to get better answers and help you to get help you to get what really is the most helpful in terms of actionable guidance for an honest reflection so I tried to just kind of keep that in mind as I was coming up with the spreads as what are what are questions that I asked all the time for myself or other people and how can they be your broadly applied to anyone who might come to this book and want to try to spread for them self  so in terms of spreads that I that I like to use for myself took a question I really tend to craft my questions around whatever is bringing me to my deck to begin with but I think generally the tarot is good for highlighting what is like a challenge what what am I not seeing what is a blind spot you know I feel like it's really helpful for that because that is speaking to you know it's inherently you're asking but what am I not seeing when I was outside of my conscious awareness and so bringing that into a tarot reading I find to be always helpful what is this project missing what is missing from this dynamic between me and this other person or what is what is needed here that I can't see I can't grasp  or questions like you know where should I focus my attention when in regards to this project her just kind of using the tarot to help me or other tap into what is hard to access consciously and using that information to give us some more well-rounded view of a reality because  I feel like that's that's one way that Terrell can be really practical I love the blind spot question I'm going to use that the next time I grab my texts that's fantastic it all you're not always in the mood to hear it but when you are you cannot pray for our listeners who a lot of them love Tarot they're going to pick up this book what would you say they should flip to First where should they start it's not to be so obvious but I would say start with the introduction it's only the beginning just because I feel like that is the one place in the book where you kind of get the zoomed out bigger picture perspective of what is Tara why should we engage with it what can it do for us  what what is a way to approach this tool that can set you up to not be fearful of it if that's a concern or two to just kind of slightly help to orient you to the mindset of openness and receptivity and kind of surrendering control a little bit or surrendering your desire around  what you want to hear or those I think getting in kind of the right headspace is important when whenever possible if possible it's not always possible but you know so I think having that initial mindset kind of is helpful and so I think the introduction might might be good for that so I always ask this of Terrell people because I am very conflicted and I do flip flop so you talk on each page about the reversal meaning I know that when you're writing books you have to kinda comprehensive cover all the bases are real thoughts on reversals when you do a reading for you or clients do you utilize the reversal meanings or do you just kind of read the cards  honestly I don't reversals but I do feel conflicted about it all so it's not an easy yeah it's a good question because it is something that I still wrestle wet for the first few years I definitely read the reversals and yeah cuz all the books tell you you have to and then you think what if it came out reverse that that is different than a bright like a course there should be some different interpretation so when I decided to stop reading reversals I just don't let my cards come out reverse like I just shuffle them all up right and then the way that I choose a card is just kind of hand over hand and so they don't they're not even allowed to  I do read reversals I ended it for that reason because I do feel that if it's reversed it there's a reason and so I do I can see where the confliction comes in but it's interesting when I read professionally I would always reset my cards between clients and I would take them I would cleanse them and I would put them all up right I would then have the client Shuffle the cards while they thought about their question I can't think of one okay maybe one person in all the years I red cards did not reverse cards everybody somehow and they're shufflers shuffle cards every single time and so in my mind if they reversed it that meant it had meeting but you know if you're reading for yourself I don't necessarily know like when I'm journaling I don't know I do I do I do I do write down that it's reversed okay nevermind I do always reversal  and I don't think there's a right or wrong way I'll know just each card does have a range of meanings that include the sort of reversed mean it in a percent round it yeah that's how I look at it is it depends on what cards are either side to side or above or below you know what is around it and that's kind of where I get the is it an upright or is it a reversal meeting whether it's upright a reverse physically you know you kind of have to see the whole picture and not just the one card card contains all of its meanings in it no matter how its position I think it's what you were saying and if you do read reversals that might be a way to clue you in to how to interpret it it's just I don't know I think for me I just got they just became too like to the gave me anxiety and I just  I just wanted to cut out that element from the reading so I tried it and then I just ended up kind of sticking with it and it feels like it's working for me right now but I may go back and read reversals at some point I just yeah I just wanted to have them or I wanted to have a more streamlined approach I think and so that helped her through my night but I do flip flop back and forth about that do you shuffle them in a way that reversals could come out yes a lot of AI Shuffle and if I did it Layla's way I can see we're okay if you get a reverse so that means something but with the way I shuffle 50% of the deck is bound to be Rivers. Yeah yeah yeah yeah  Shuffle in a chaotic way  Brown on the floor and all around the better I communicate with a doctor better relationship that we have the more they'll speak to me no matter what position there is no matter how they come out of the deck they have a story to tell and if I'm in tune with it it doesn't matter how it comes out of the doctor tell you what it's going to tell you so the better I know exact the more like that I tend to read absolute but definitely this book like we said we're not joking this is a great little handbook to have tossed it in your backpack keep it with your tarot Journal this is really going to give you some insight if you know about the full star any or this is your first time you've heard about the Fool's Journey this is going to give you some amazing information it's great for self-reflection it's great for Magical working it's a wonderful tool to know the full story and  book will give you a lot of inside so five rooms up absolutely I really appreciate it thank you thank you thank you Natalie for joining us thanks for having me thank you so much dear Natalie labriola author of terrible time with secrets of the Ancient Mariner for joining shell and I are back on the broomstick we had an amazing time talking about one of shells and my favorite topics are out and of course thank you to all of our listeners for joining us on this conversation as well please like subscribe give us some reviews if you start it really helps the show up and help the other listings to find it we will see you in next week for another episode of back on the broomstick until then be wise to be Wicked and as always you magical people keep it with g
