pointy little hats up on the wall and sit back relax with a little bit of cannabis maybe some tea a good book or two and sometimes surprises from listeners today with lots of books and Oracle decks and beautiful things in front of me I'm Leila and I'm shell and I'm just sitting here having a drink having a smoke and loving what we've got today for folks but but we got to start before we start our salarium we have to start we received a gift today on our Solarium we would like to say a huge thank you to cat from force of nature Creations cat is a listener and she contacted us on our Facebook actually about a previous Solarium we had been talking about Devin Hunter's book Hort of culture don't even get me started on my plants and if you need an update go to the Facebook discussion group that's right back on the broomstick podcast discussion group on Facebook there's pictures and updates there but she had sent us some pictures of her plants which I enthused over and at the the same time she also had sent pictures of these crafts that she did these cute earrings now I'm a huge fan of spilop PODS I think octopie and Squids Shell's making a face I think they're amazing they're so smart they're so cool really neat creatures but anyway she had these squid earrings which I thought were adorable and said so and she offered to send us some which is super sweet and actually they're super super cute and I love them we wore them not too long ago in New York City and we have pictures we'll post up on all the socials so thank you so much she wrote us this cute little letter and everything it was just really fun I've never met her but yet I have a nickname for her I'm just calling her our Alaskan cat a that's so sweet she's our Alaskan cat so she is force of nature creations and we'll put links and information on where you can find some cute little earrings of your own she's got all sorts of stuff not just spilop pods they're super cute though they are cute so if you'd like to be part of a SOI if you want to send us something we do have a link in the show notes and that'll give you information on how to send letters trinkets your crafts whatever you'd like and we will showcase it on a future Solarium we'll even take your haunted Ouija boards we will we will you know they never did send that to me I wonder what happened I know and I was actually bummed out because I am so around and find out that I just wanted to around and find out with it if you're wondering what we're talking about in our previous podcast called the stoned Witches Hour we were once written by a fan who had purchased I believe at a yard sale like a thrift store or something or something they'd gotten a secondhand Ouija board and there was all sorts of crazy things that started happening once they got this Ouija board and they wanted to send it to us we never heard from them again there was a little back and forth on how they could ship it to us everything was set and then nothing nothing so if you're out there they literally ghosted us oh boo that's bad so if you're out there in Corporal form not ghost form we're still willing to take that Ouija board off your hands because I want to play with it that's right any any what are you smoking oh my goodness I have gone to a new dispensary up in New York state oh my God that's so funny cuz I started going to a different one too really nice okay you go first I got myself some Girl Scout cookies which is a a good solid cultivar today I'm with it I'm smoking an herbal blend that I got online from a company called herbal spirits and it's called floating Egyptian o what's in it it's very pretty oh that is pretty it looks like an it looks like a loose incense actually it really does it looks kind of like poery or some type of loose incense the ingredients are Mullen skull cap blue Lily wild Daga Damiana and Rose you always have that damn Mullen I do a lot of their Blends do have Mullen it's an excellent base herb for smoking it has a a very pleasant taste it's not harsh it's very full-bodied a lot like if you were to smoke cannabis itself it has a similar feel in your mouth and your throat I've actually been using Mullen a little bit more in tea yes kind of gives it that earthy base and you know not too shabby it's not it's excellent in a tea and it's just as good for you and you're not inhaling anything in your LS if you don't want to forget to smoke it that's the funny part I literally forget that I have this big container of Mullen and I forget to smoke it because I'm just used to smoking my weed straight yep and I I do like the herbs quite a bit on the what' you say weed on the Rocks there you go straight yep no I like mine on the herbs I guess but yeah so that's what I'm smoking today how about you sh what' you get at your new dispensary so I got this called apples and bananas and oh wait hold on Shell's rule like 742 does it taste like apples and bananas no but oh no they broke the rule Thou shalt not ever name a strain of cannabis after something it doesn't tast it don't taste like it you know you're you're only going to make out with that when it comes to Citrus yeah yeah that's true that's true you're only gonna make out with that when it comes to Citrus but this is actually 39% THC and it lives up to its reputation PA now something's going to be 39% THC how crystally is it like how white how many tricomes are on the outside of those snugs and is it is it infused with something have they put a distillate on it or is that just naturally 39% it's kind of white looking and I think that they've coated it okay now normally if you ask they should disclose that but yeah 30 yeah it's okay 39% THD that's pretty awesome does it does it taste good yeah get you up not going to lie this is not a smoke before work weed there you go that's a weekend weed right there this is a weekend weed yeah this is a weekend weed um but for the daytime because that is a weekend weed for the day time I have what is called permanent marker that's a good I got to do today you know I I I did have the apples and bananas uh before we started recording just cuz I wanted to be in Solaria mode but but it's going to be the permanent marker that's what I do for you know I got to clean I've got to go grocery shopping I've got to do you know it's that kind of weed so I'm kind of bouncing between two depending on the time of day nice now just as important of a question what you drinking I can't lie to you people today today I am drinking Mexican Coke there I said it oh fun right in the glass bottles glass bottle Mexican Coke real sugar I was going to say with the real sugar yeah I can't help it that's where we're at today I'm sorry I'm not drinking tea but that's okay Coke it's the real thing some days you just need that extra hit of caffeine right isn't that what the commercials used to say Coke it's the real thing I think they did I think they did but this week I've been drinking a lot of iced tea because it's hotter than hell here so it's not a hot tea week oh no I'm I'm holding up right now my Mason Jar full of iced tea my my black tea with lemonade in it with lots and lots of ice because it's that kind of day oh you made your own half and half I did make my own half and half I was starting to buy like um Arizona Iced Tea what's that the Arnold Palmer Arnold Palmer but there's so much high fructose corn syrup in that like does anybody I think pure leaf might make a tea that doesn't have it but holy cow that's that's a lot as I sit here drinking my Mexican Coke but well that's real sugar that's different but yeah no um you can actually and I find I like making it better because there's certain lemonades that I like because some lemonades are just very bitter and some are more sweet and you can kind of combined your favorite lemonade with your favorite iced tea to get that perfect half and half y That's My favorite way especially in the summer time you know me and tea and lemon I like lemon in my tea but today we're going to talk about some books Decks that we got and I want to kind of start with the decks because I was pleasantly surprised okay so I'm going to make a confession these all of these books and Tarot Decks that were well Oracle Decks that we're going over today they were sent from Red wheel wiser thank you Aon love them very very much actually and I asked for all of these shell had no input and didn't know what we were getting today and red wheel wiser works with a lot of different companies but they themselves don't make a lot of strictly tarot decks these are Oracle decks and I don't know if you've heard before but shell is not a fan I got these knowing full well that might be a little difficult to please shell with them I try to be objective though I I try not to infuse my lack of love for oracles and in in my in my reviews of these products so I I tried to go into it with an open mind so we're going to start with the weird sisters spelled wyr D it's by Casey zabala you know and the first thing I thought of when I saw the weird sisters was I thought of the Terry pratchet novel The Weird sisters one of the dis World Series course you know kind of similar concept you know the the witches the fates this is a deck of spells and rituals could we even call that an oracle deck she does use it as Oracle she even has in the book she has different spreads where you can do actual Oracle divination but I like these cards more all right let's talk about what they look like first before we get into how we feel about them well I just I just want to real quick read a part uh just a part of the description on the back um because that kind of gives you an idea of what kind of cards these are it is a 60 card Oracle deck devoted to working with the ancient deities who dwell at the roots of the world tree and set the order of the cosmos through their spinning weaving and cycling of nature so that kind of gives you like the mindset of of of what her vision for this deck was yes the norns the the weird sisters are the the triple goddess like the fates like the what is it uh clo at tropo and lisus I don't remember these sisters names but the three Fates right they spin the thread they weave the thread and they cut the thread of your life of your fate and you can kind of see that symbolism represented in the cards like each card has these black squiggles that go through it yeah yeah and I think that kind of represents that thread of Fate I looked through the book to see if she ever talked about what that was because sometimes those squiggles can be a little jarring not going to lie I think they might be threads of Fate can we just talk for a minute what the hell is going on with with every deck coming out right now being gilded I don't know I actually kind of hate it okay Hate's kind of a strong word I don't really hate the gilding it's just it looks beautiful for a minute that's all I I don't really hate it I feel like every deck I've gotten lately whether it be Oracle or tarot every damn thing's gilded all the sudden it kind of looks pretty I think it looks pretty but I use my decks I shuffle them I want to riffle through them I want to you know overhand shuffle them spread them out on a table you don't know pain until you've gotten a paper cut from a gilded card oh plus depending on the deck it doesn't take very long for it to start to wear off and Flake off and then it doesn't look so pretty it's not good for longterm use yeah it's not good for long-term shuffling using and handling now this particular deck once we get into it I would actually probably use it more for spells as opposed to shuffling it and and using it as an oracle I probably would grab one card at a time or a grouping of cards specific cards to pull out and have on an altar or to use for meditation or for a journaling prompt the reason is because the cards themselves are very simple and because of that Simplicity it can really let your subconscious go when you're trying to use them for a journaling prompt plus they're kind of easy to handle but I think shapewise would you say these are like I don't know what a typical Oracle deck sizes but I would say these are kind of Oracle deck size I was going to say typical oral Oracle deck size they're they're kind of that fat rectangle is if that's a good description yeah but I kind of like the basic artwork it's nothing it almost looks like a lot of this could have just been handdrawn it's like this basic great cute awesome artwork and I like that about this it's not it's not very commercially artistic is that even word yeah and what I like about that is it feels very easy to pull these cards and have it get into your subconscious there's a card for each one of the Fates you know the the spinner the Weaver and the cutter there's a spell for everything really and and you know there's also almost like it breaks down not necessarily into suits per se but you know the candle for XYZ and then you know you got the sigils for XYZ the wands for XYZ the athm so I kind of like that I I like the artwork on here because it's very simple but I'm confused by the black lines I'm not going to lie I feel like I'm missing something I feel like there's a code in here these black lines are some code that I'm not picking up is how it comes across to me yeah sometimes it can be distracting I I do feel that it's probably the threads of Fate they're a little bit sigil like you know they're entwined in all of it they're wrapped through all of it in different ways so each picture has these squiggles you can do with those what you will it can be a little bit jarring sometimes on the cards but it can also give you an opportunity to work with sigils or work with other magic to follow that thread with your finger with your eyes it gives you another way to look at and get into the cards and I like the Simplicity of it too because I I feel like it can be very easy to meditate with these cards this is one of those this is one of those decks where where simple is more effective visually I think I absolutely agree yeah the Simplicity of the of the artwork makes it way more effective I like this I don't know if I would use it as an oracle deck but this could actually be a good like spell deck yeah I think this would be a great spell deck a great meditation deck really good for journaling um pulling a card a day and just doing intuitive journaling with it I love this card I I don't know if you can see it on my screen it's the uh spell for courage it's a sun with a trus scallion in the center of it I love the card I like the spell for justice it has the Beehive and the infinity symbol oh yeah that one the book is pretty well written as well it's a small book and a small box but you know it gives you ideas spell ingredients to use with each one so because of the gilding and because of how easily I think these cards could kind of get into your subconscious to allow your intuition and your imagination to kind of run wild I also would not use these as as technically an oracle deck I think I would pull these cards intentionally and choose them intentionally yeah like for spell work and for meditation or like you said you know pick a set of them and have them on the altar or something like that exactly so for that reason the gilding is okay because as long as it's for decoration and not for a heavy use deck I don't mind it so much you know if you're going to put this deck into heavy rotation you might want to be a little more careful you know for example when I used to read professionally if I was at a Tarot party or a Tarot event I could read 20 30 50 people and if you're shuffling each time just in one day that's a lot of shuffling you're going to lose your gilding before the afternoons out and then they don't look so cute and you don't want to have them in front of a client so I don't know I I swear everything is like that right now but yeah I liked it I liked it it took me a second to get the hang of these squiggly black lines once it clicked I think this is a solid deck and excellent use for meditation now the next wonderful treasure we got from Red wheel wiser we got the Beloved dead an oracle for divining ancestral wisdom this is by Carrie Paris and Tina Hart now here's the surprising thing about this thing I kind of love it and I I hate I hate oracles and and and we've all known this I kind of love this beloved dead I got the vibe from it exactly what it says an oracle for divining ancestral wisdom and when you pick up this deck you feel like based on maybe it's the oldtime pictures I don't know but you feel like you are working with ancestors now let me start with the damn thing is gilded but here is what I love about the gilding of this particular deck now if you notice the other deck was gilded in silver this deck is gilded in gold and it Glitters so it's almost like glittery gold gilding and I love that it goes very well with the antique this whole deck is giving antique antique Vibes yeah it looks old timey that sepia tone pictures and so the gold gilding goes along with it very nicely it fits it well yeah it does it does suit it one of the things that struck me about this was I don't love collage decks they're not my favorite but I did also like shell I really really enjoyed the look of these old timey photograph kind of idea and as I was reading the book uh Carrie Paris who's one of the the authors of this deck found in a in a notebook this old picture this old sepia tone photograph of an older couple and an adopted child and all the emotion in it really struck her and she needed to find out more about this picture and so that was kind of her inspiration for this deck you know she really felt the spirits of those people come through that picture and you can very much feel that in this deck I can tell that as I use this deck more and more it feels like you'll be able to connect with the Beloved dead it does feel like it could be an oracle that'll allow your ancestors or the spirits around you to really speak it does it really does and this one card just strikes me the name of the card is Evermore and it is a couple on their wedding day and this picture was probably taken in 1905 okay it strikes me as reaching out to your ancestors it's just got that ancestor look that ancestor Vibe and this other card play I can't get over this it is a guy who's got to be probably in his 40s or 50s riding a rocking horse I love it but again I've noticed that the more I play with these cards and the more I kind of touch them and and shuffle them around I almost feel like I can hear that gilding cracking that's the disappointment it does look very pretty but this deck feels like it's going to get heavy use and I like how Paris and Hart have split this up almost into suits kind of it's like they're trying to cross a Tarot deck and an Oracle deck a little bit yeah there's a 10 card cards that are active love cards and those are like action cards and then there's 69 cards that are the Beloved dead and they're like different aspects driver haunted Hospitality peace that kind of thing but there's also two cards there's the spirit Throne card and there's the Ouija card which I loved both of those cards I almost feel like they're like spinning the wheel this card and you don't know what you're going to get you know what I mean so the spirit Throne card is an invitation you put that card down on purpose and invite the dead to come speak to you invite your ancestors to come that's actually the first card in the deck is that card then the last card in the deck is the Ouija card I love this now this is a wild card there is no meaning for this card in the book basically when this card shows up the idea is that there is a spirit there nearby waiting to speak to you or maybe there's another question you need to ask there's a lot of different things that it could mean it's a wild card now I'm a huge fan of adding extra Cards into decks the deck that I read professionally with for way too long was the L tarot and it has an extra card it's the who are you really card and when that would show up it can very much influence a reading and kind of change the whole flavor of a reading so I'm a huge fan of having these Wild Card type things in a Tero deck or a divination now is everybody sitting down here you're going to need to sit down for this one folks folks normally when we get Oracle decks I try to give an objective opinion but usually in the end Lea and I both know that mine will probably be going into the listener giveaway pile and it's just a thing it's a me thing no disrespect but I actually I'm super glad that you got this deck because like you said you didn't ask me for any input you know how I am I actually want keep this deck and work with this deck I love this so for all you Oracle deck haters like me the Beloved dead is going to suck you in and it's not that I hate them and and that's a strong word because I do have three or four maybe five Oracle decks unlike my couple hundred tarot decks but this is one that I I want to keep and use even I'm shocked if you are a fan of spiritualism of the mid 1800s the early 1900s if Nostalgia is your thing you will probably love these cards yeah this is for you I also love the way that Hart and Paris put this deck together because it feels like a very easy way to speak to Spirit a very very easy way for them to give you messages particularly if you attune this deck to you and they go into that in the book different ways to attune it but I think the more that it's used and the more you use it to speak to your higher self to speak to your guides to speak to your ancestors it's just going to get that much more accurate and they give you some really great spreads in the book the book is done really well and I agree with you I think this is a deck that almost you could tailor to your ancestors almost like if you had a deck and you went up to your grandma grandpa and we're like all right so we're going to use this deck as our telephone you know yeah I can see that in this deck using this as a telephone to my loved ones that have passed and kind of making it that telephone for my ancestors yeah beloved dead I actually love it and I know that none of us expected it myself included but I love this I do recommend 10 out of 10 ding ding ding winner I knew I'd get at least one of them that you would like so your goals for this is to get me meditating Journal and using Oracle decks absolutely and we're getting there all right so the next thing we have is a book we have three tarot books and the first one is a reprint actually this is magical tarot your essential guide to reading the cards by Madam pamita and it has a forward by Matt Ain author of psychic witch now this book actually came out I believe was in 2018 or 2019 yeah this is this was really good when it came out initially they just reprinted it with um the forward and who doesn't love something by Matt Ain Matt's a great guy very good witch isn't he doing something like the psychic tarot I think he has a book coming out soon or something like that he's been very busy getting a lot of stuff out love everything he puts out but he's got a it's like psychic tarot or something something those lines this book freaking solid this is a good book and the one thing I liked about this book is whether you had just picked up your very first Tarot deck or if you're like me and just picked up your 214th Tarot deck there's value in this book and also I am always a fan of supporting the Ukrainian cause and Madame patima pamita I say that wrong Madame pamita is a Ukrainian American um so yeah love it yeah she has Baba yaga's book of Witchcraft and I cannot wait to get my hands on that I love Baba Yaga so do our beloved Bome makers The Hags over at three Moon brooms but yeah this book Madame Pam just nailed it it's solid like you said if you're a beginner and you pick up this book it is going to help you learn the cards inside and out but even if you know the cards this is still a good book to kind of circle back to some some Concepts and thoughts that you may have forgot or maybe you didn't know those specific things this is just good whether you're seasoned or brand new she lists out each card and with each card she has something called your adventure with that particular card and she has a whole little write up of the card and it's easy to read it's interesting it's solid information and then each card she has the keys to understanding that card which are little phrases that help you the keys to the yeah I like that she calls it the keys to the treasure chest right exactly even Matt Ain himself the psychic witch himself says that there were things in this book that he had not thought of before with tarot so it just really has a lot of solid good information and good exercises I have one problem with this book and it's the same problem that I have with a lot of tarot okay what I am in the camp that wands is air and swords are fire well yeah in this book she says wands are fire swords are air and that I cannot get behind I've tried I've tried and I I just don't see it there is no connection for me that way I am a in agreeance with you on this and generally when I just see that in books like this it's almost like my mind over the years has almost just been trained to flip it yep for the people that do it that way it seems to work just fine for them I'm not going to argue the way we do it works for us exactly which is fine but yeah no I I I don't think that jumped out at me as much because I'm just used to whenever I see that my mind just automatically flip it without thought well Lara Tempest Zach agrees with us so I'm going to say we have it right but yeah that was the only problem I had with it and like you said I just kind of ignore that part of it and move on because for me swords are fire you forge Steel in fire trees they breathe just like we do they grow in the air they reach to the sky wands are air can't change my mind anyway but I love this book really solid I'm happy to have this on my shelf very good book like I said it's good for no matter what stage you are in in Tarot practice absolutely and especially now that I'm mostly read tarot for myself I'm mostly doing my daily card pulls this is really nice to pull out and look at because when I'm looking at these daily polls I'm thinking more about what jumps out at me what connections am I making not necessarily what is the literal historical definition of this card and so using someone else deck can really help you get out of a rut can help you get into your own intuition can really help you determine how you personally feel about that card and the images that are there you know so grabbing a book like magical tarot and seeing how she interprets these cards which they're pretty standard writer weight Smith interpretations I would say yeah oh yeah yeah you can just see as someone's different angle on a tried and true interpretation it's it's nice to get that different perspective so I I really enjoyed her view of the card what I like about that is you know I might have a particular view about a certain card but then I read a new person's definition and I might pick up a a tidbit or two of their perspective of that card because it was something that never dawned on me before yeah you might see something in a new angle right right right and that's why that's another reason why short tangent here folks that's another reason why I love all different tarot decks and why I'm an obsessed Tarot because different images for a card can provoke different thoughts for that meaning we all know what the Three of Swords means but maybe the artwork in this one particular deck is going to add some Dimension to that meaning you know what I mean absolutely that's why I like different decks Phyllis kurat is the witch's wisdom tarot is still one of my absolute favorites because it's a reimagining of the suits of the meanings of the cards it's a little more modern you know Pamela Coleman Smith that did the artwork for the RWS Decks that we know that was what in the early 1900s and shits basically stayed the same she did that all herself like the old um the old regular suits cards basically had no pictures you know she's the one that decided to put the pictures there and granted she did that with a lot of symbolism and forth thought and history that was 1800s symbolism and forethought and you know right right love the reimagining I love witches and people who are coming out with these new decks with their perspective and adding so many new layers and new things to it but it's still nice to have a grounding in the solid accepted meanings you know there's something to be said for archetypal images that get into our collective subconscious you know and these cards have been around for a minute they are in our witchy subconsciousness right right right you know something to work off of a frame to go from now speaking of someone solid I am going to Quick bounce to this next book I was so flipping happy that you got this and the reason why is I love tresa read this is a Tarot guide book the cards you're dealt how to deal when life gets real by Teresa Reed this is the this is the book for all those folks who are scared when the cards give you the tower card pull out this book this is also the book for someone who doesn't know what to say when the tower comes down for a client or for someone that they're reading their best friend their parent their sibling as a reader if you don't know what to say to them in that situation this is definitely the book for you I could have used this book a couple years ago I had a lot of losses in my life and this is a a guide book on when you're having a tough time if you have lost people in your life if you are grieving this is a book that will help walk you through that with tarot you know life is not always butterflies and roses and goes bad right now we are living in the Tower time shit's going bad people are scared and so this book is perfect for right now it really gives you tools on what to say to yourself what to say to someone who's come to you for a reading that's having a difficult time and that was see I think that was kind of the perspective I I kind of took this book from and really liked was you've been in that situation with me before you know you don't want to tell someone the shitty side of what they're reading says you know especially if it's a friend or someone you know you don't want to be like you know hey so there's a storm coming your way and there's no umbrella that's gonna protect you you know I mean it gives you an idea of sometimes how to soften the blow with your tarot readings I was given a piece of advice years ago when I first started reading professionally someone is sitting across from me and has given me something in energy exchange for this reading they deserve the truth they deserve and are asking for exactly what the cards are saying that's easier to say than it is always to do 100% 100% it is very difficult when you're looking at the cards and you're seeing infidelity you're seeing loss you're seeing grief it can be very very difficult to say that you got someone sitting two feet away that you got to look in the eye and tell all that to exactly this this book is is perfect for dealing with that type of reading that type of situation so I kind of took it from more of the professional reading perspective she has information in here for how to help someone who's grieving not just but practical things on how to help them when they're grieving you know this book was definitely an interesting read from start to finish she also goes over the cards themselves and talks about how they may relate to difficult times how it might mean something difficult you know how to deal with the nine of Swords what does that mean right just really good if you are a professional reader if you read for anyone other than yourself or even if you want a deeper understanding of how to be nicer to yourself or you know how to read difficult things for yourself this is a great book and of course you know she gives you different spreads different tarot rituals different exercises I'm always a fan of tarot exercises um and if you are a journal person like Leila there are Journal prompts in there too there are but this is a solid book for how to deal with tarot when it's not all sunshine and Roses because Tarot is not all sunshine and Roses yeah especially if you're reading for the public you are going to run into I mean everybody's dealing with something difficult it's not all gonna be when is my true love coming it's going to be why did my dad die right and and that is what this book Rock Solid 10 out of 10 for me I love it and again Teresa Reed is Fabulous Five brooms up absolutely yeah yeah so that one totally recommend now we are going to get to probably the hardest book the meest book yeah this one's called tarot for the hard work an archetypal journey to confront racism and Inspire Collective healing and it's by Maria Menace and all I can say is wow wow W this is a good book but I'm not gonna lie it's a difficult book there's work to be done it's not something that you're just going to read cover to cover you know I gota you I had to talk to you about this book before we recorded and I'm going to be honest with our listeners right up front I almost felt like I don't want to say I was being personally attacked by this book but kind of and to give you a backstory of why I felt that way I was I was I was raised in a very typical for the Times atmosphere um unfortunately racism was was very deep um in my family history and the area I am from was a kind of a a more heavily racist area so honestly through no fault of mine or the author I felt like this book was attacking me when we talked about it I was like and that's exactly why we need this book because it it's heavy you cannot just read this book straight from cover together it is a workbook it is definitely a workbook each chapter is walking through the tarot going through this archetypal journey to confront those parts of ourselves the the racism that we might not even know is there right my ex stepfather was also highly racist highly misogynistic not a great person and sometimes I still hear his voice in my head and I have to fight against that reaction because I know how he would react it's not how I want to react or even how personally I would think but the Impressions from my childhood are still in there the things that my ex- stepfather would say are still in my head even when I'm not realizing it yeah when you're raised around that and that's all you hear all the time it doesn't necessarily reflect like you said it's not how you want to feel but that that man's voice just keeps coming in your head with those responses yeah and and so this book really helps you to identify and work through that and I love Tarot like you said any workshop with tarot I'm there you're there all over it all over it really helps this is definitely some deep hard Dark Shadow work book but so good valuable necessary fulfilling they don't call it tarot for the hard work because it's sunshine and butterflies here right exactly exactly all of the different exercises and things that you can go through in this they work but it's working to make a better Collective make you a better person and make you a better person in the community each chapter is broken up into it goes through the major Arcana just like you know your typical Fool's Journey right and each one starts with a quote and then there's embodied keywords and it tells you how to find inspiration here and how you know how it might look in your life you know what I like about this is the little sections after each card and building a toolkit you know what I don't like about books like this you know I don't you know I don't like to write in books I feel like I love it this book makes me want to write in it and that feels so wrong to me even simple things like that sometimes you have to break out of those old habits to learn new things so maybe if you're not the dam book right in the book you know break that rule if but yeah I mean the building a toolkit part was one of my favorites because there's things in here like for the devil C they talk about combating police brutality and it gives you questions to go look you know maybe these are things like we were saying maybe these are things you never thought of before you know with the previous book um Madame pamas it gave us ideas that we hadn't thought of a different perspective and so these questions for the devil are like what is last year's racial breakdown of people killed by police and especially in places where I lived like Rochester New York their racism is rampant some of the historical racism there redlining is very deep and goes back really far and has caused so many problems you know this can really help you take a look at your area and see what things are like there but yeah this is a shadow book it is not a book that you're going to read cover to cover it is a book that's going to take time it's a book that I had to kind of put down because I had to do a little bit of it and then I had to put it down and reflect and journal a little bit and and work through some of the ideas and some of the information that was presented in this book there's a lot of thinking that goes along with this you know yeah this this book is intense and it involves you to do some soul searching and some thinking this isn't a book to just teach you how to read tarot this is a powerful workbook to help you heal things in yourself to help you you know show up better in the world yeah be a better Global citizen but I think that Maria Menace um knocked it out of the park with this book but again go into it knowing it's heavy go into it knowing that it is a workbook that it requires you to sit you know to actually do the work get your hands dirty it's well worth it I think it's well crafted well thought out I really liked the correspondences that they went through with each of the cards right good stuff I think all three of these books were fabulous all fabulous I I am delighted with my surprise I knew you what it was all a surprise to me and I was delighted with it folks may find my weird sisters Oracle in a future listener giveaway but the Beloved dead in these three books knock it out of the park for me so you win I like an oracle deck you win fine honestly I wasn't sure if you were gonna like either of them so the fact that I got a 50/50 shot here I will take it I'll absolutely take it I'll tell you I I was thinking you were going to bat zero okay I was like oh God Lea got Oracle deck here we go but those pictures they they scream ancestral work and I love them they really do there's something about those old photographs you can't help but look at that sepia toned old photographs of people and just feel connected to your ancestors feel connected to Spirit and feel connected to the past they seemed more powerful sometimes than modern photography more I don't know like more energy coming off of them not sure yeah and the Teresa Reed book I just I love that perspective persective of sometimes you get cards and you got to deal with situations yeah sometimes life is going to deal you that crappy hand and there's nothing else to do but get through it yeah so I I really like that and and times are difficult right now so I think we all you know we need to connect with our ancestors get with our subconscious with the weird sisters and do the hard work I think so I would like to give a shout out and an extra special thank you to Red wheel wiser for this month's
