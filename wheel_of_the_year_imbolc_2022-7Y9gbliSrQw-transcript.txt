hey it's 4 20 a.m on february 1st hi and welcome to a special wheel of the year in bulk edition of the stoned witch's hour with shell and layla from february 1st to sundown on the second is imbulk here in the northern hemisphere and lunasa in the southern hemisphere it books a gaelic traditional festival celebrating the midpoint of winter when the very first hints of spring and rebirth are observed we honor the goddess at this time in her maiden form as breed the goddess of poetry healing and crafts the themes of this time of year are fertility new beginnings clearing away the old and the light strengthening over the dark let's get into it let's get into it so imbolc i look at inbulk is it marks the beginning of spring and above it's all the snow-covered land and then below it's like the goddess like starting to like emerge from the dirt and starting to poke through a little bit of the smell oh like persephone is starting to like come up and start the second half of the year it reminded me as if a person were a seed breaking through like that green that whole green tara the whole potential the that's what i love about this season because it is spring to me it is spring even though it's technically not spring yet especially in the northeast it definitely doesn't feel like spring yet but it is that potential is there that like you said that person is a seed those that fertile ground that could be anything fertility doesn't necessarily have to mean baby it could be this it could be a thought it could be a thought it could be an idea it could be a plan it could be a goal like beautiful yes you can plant the seeds to get a new job or you can plant the seeds to have a baby like whatever literally or figuratively right right um also an interesting factoid with us northeastern folk like i'm telling you you don't even know we got dumped on like 30 inches of snow the other day but you know this is actually in bulk is the beginning of the agricultural year um because not that i'm a great planter i swear i can only keep kids and cats alive you know this is where people will start like putting the seeds kind of going inside before it is time for them to take them outside and then transplant them into the ground so this is actually um the beginning of the agricultural season which i don't know not in the northeast but it can the agricultural season goes from imbulk to samhain not where i live and you know i always talk about the tick of the the wheel of the year and this tick of the wheel of the year is is halfway and and i think sometimes people forget that in the beginning of february we are actually halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox so like that's how i kind of make living in the northeast not feel so bad because i follow those ticks and this tick is telling me i am halfway to spring it's like when you're half like when you're running it's like i'm halfway to the finish line we're halfway there but a spiritual aspect of this you know we talk about you know different symbolism and and different different ways people celebrate but you know as far as like a spiritual aspect this is kind of a time where you can like let go of your past and kind of look ahead you know i know that the end of the year beginning of the year is that samhain threshold but some people like me i know that the beginning and the end of the year in my religion is solemn but i know in the calendar it's january but like somehow i function on a for me the beginning of the year is when i know things are getting warmer and brighter almost like that death phase of the year is over right we're starting to come out of that things are starting to come up out of the ground the whole punxsutawney fill the whole groundhog's day you know things are emerging from the dark and coming up to the light this time of year you know you kind of shed that darkness and leave it behind living in the northeast i feel like there's never an end to winter so it's kind of like the light at the end of the tunnel oh i love that oh i love that it really is it's the beginning of the end of winter it's not done yet right it's not done yet and to kind of take it a a little step deeper you know as it kind of is the next notch on the wheel of the year ticking it also as far as the triple goddess goes it's kind of that turning point from where that crone then comes back again is the maiden let's see the goddess breed right is she it's her day mostly you see her a lot candle mass is this the one where she has the the crown of candles candles right which can i just say for just a moment like wow how daring are you to wear a crown of candles like seriously my head would catch on fire right it gives you'd have to be some kind of uh you have to kind of like that thing a little bit you know a little bit of hot candle wax on your cheekbones maybe i would just move my eyeballs you wear one of those visor hats you're going to wear a crown of candles burning candles you're going to need like one of those visor hats that people wear for like golf or something right right and as much as i love the candle crown love it my hair would hold a blazing glory but i love the candle crown something is you know obviously how the celts celebrated in bulk however long ago is vastly different from 2022 but you know some of the some of the easier ways to celebrate in bulk nowadays light a candle in each room or your house or you know if you're not able to light one candle in one room no one is going to judge you um and do it after sunset with that thought of bringing the sun back that rebirth yeah another way to represent the growing light and to do a room by room cleansing is with cannabis instead of a candle or incense it works the same way spell wise grab your preferred smoking apparatus a bong bowl pre-roll whatever you have take a nice sativa like a lemon haze or whatever your favorite is and as you go around room to room inhale the cannabis smoke and picture drawing in good energy picture it positive green healing energy and picture that coming into you and your home and then as you exhale you know inhale the good exhale the bad just picture all the negative all the bad energy flowing out of you and out of the house and you can go and do that in every room you know one puff three puffs whatever feels good to you you know do that with intention in each space and as you smoke each inhale and each exhale is part of that spell as long as you do it with intention you know hold those images in your mind of drawing in all the good all the health and the healing and the blessings that you are looking for in this coming season and then exhale all the negative anything that's against you or anything that no longer works for you anything that you no longer should hold on to you know exhale that out and let it go just let it go and do that in each room and then when you're done with your bowl and you've gotten each room through you know thank that herb and and maybe take those ashes and bury them outside or put them in the earth somewhere safe just kind of return that to the earth and complete that circle of the little ritual that you've done you know ritual can be found in all sorts of spaces and smoking cannabis for me definitely has every element of a magic spell or ritual and so when done with intention it can be very powerful gives you that warmth this coming summer's coming the wheel is turning kind of vibe exactly you know it kind of spellcraft and ritual is all about symbolism it's all about symbolically representing something and so by going room to room and lighting a candle there or a joint maybe even um setting an intention for the spring or thinking thoughts of of new things you want to rebirth or bring into your life that symbolism of lighting a light and thinking a positive thought that's the symbolism of the sun like you said getting stronger and bringing that light into your life and so just like anything it doesn't have to be a big ritual it can be something as simple as going room to room and lighting a candle or lighting a bunch of your favorite candles while you're cooking dinner or while you're taking a bath this is a personal thing and this is not in any book and you know no law or nothing but if you are into chakras in chakra cleansing every holiday and this is especially a good one when we're talking about clearing yourself eight times a year every holiday easy to remember a nice chakra cleansing is is a good way to kinda no matter what the holiday is celebrate the holiday by kind of doing your own personal chakra cleansing and realignment and i just like to kind of think of each holiday almost as like a calendar marker oh it's in bulk let me clear them and do a cleansing do a reassessment i like that at yule i had done the same thing you know hey it's you will you know kind of put things back in some sort of balance i really like as a simple bath something to help kind of cleanse and realign chakras is get myself a nice bath with some epsom salts in it also into that bath i'll put a stone for each chakra you know and along the side of the bath maybe a candle in each color and you know you get in that bath with intention make sure that you do it with a purpose you know and light each candle as you visualize that chakra and you visualize that color and and just kind of realigning and cleansing and and that's we're taking something very big and distilling it down into very very simple steps and i get that but if you want to learn more in depth you could certainly look it up but that's that's definitely a very simple way and i love that you use the wheel of the year to remind yourself to do that because it's an excellent time and it's an excellent way to remember to you know to take time to cleanse yourself and that's a super easy chakra bath well you know we get caught up in the day today we get caught up in work and parenting and and just life in general and you forget some of those simple things that really kind of keep your head on straight keep you in order and high magic is great and high ritual is great but you know if you're in the middle of classes or taking care of kids or your job or your relationship or whatever sometimes you don't have time for that sometimes you don't have the mental capacity or the the spoons for that and sometimes all you have time for is a bath that's right sometimes all you have time frozen bath and to throw a few crystals in light a couple candles and that might be all you get to do so you have to make sure your intention's there and you know that's that's i think what makes this path so wonderful for me is sometimes i just gotta do this [ __ ] on the fly you know i don't have the time or the energy sometimes i don't have the energy you know kids work that drains yeah [Laughter] it's all too easy to let things for ourselves slip aside you know especially in anything a lot of people tend to we'll do things for other people much more quickly than we'll do them for ourselves so again the the wheel of the year the holidays in bulk in particular is a great time to remind yourself to take care of yourself go a little slower you know and just remember spring is coming and you know be good to yourself take care of yourself right right inbulk is a great time to clear out the old and make space for something new spring cleaning is an excellent outer representation of inner cleansing work and inner clearing that you might be trying to do as you're cleaning your house you can envision all the things that don't serve you that are inside your head inside your heart cleaning them out cleaning out old relationships old arguments old resentments you know old feelings anything that no longer serves you anything that's holding you back anything that's keeping you from being the you that you want to be now's the time to clear all of that out and what you find when you clear out that space is now you've got all this open space for new things to come in new light fresh scents you know in a literal sense when you're cleaning that's what you see but but in a mystical sense what you've made space for is new beginnings new hope a new relationship a new job something something new to begin in your life new feelings about yourself new new sense of self a new strength it's difficult to do that sometimes when you're your brain is surrounded by the clutter of things that that no longer work that aren't healthy or don't bring you joy or meaning so another good thing to do this time of year simple rituals simple spells that you can do besides house cleaning is light your favorite incense vanilla rosemary even mint this time of year is fabulous and just let that kind of permeate your house and bring that fresh sense in you know decorate your altar and in light colors pastel shades your whites and yellows your favorite shades of spring lilac i wear crystals like amethyst which is the february birthstone where um clear quartz for clarity and fresh starts or citrine to celebrate the strengthening sun and to bring that joyous light into your life and into your heart you know i kind of i don't necessarily follow traditional crystal meanings all the time you know when you when you've got two kids and you're living your life sometimes you gotta be that witch on the fly and kind of do what's good in the moment and not what a book says so sometimes they go by color you know like this is the time of year where i'm going to carry i'm going to carry around you know an adventuring a rose quartz a clear quartz maybe a cat's eye or you know i sometimes it's more in color you know the the pink the clear the white the light green the yellow things that make me feel like this time of year yeah now buying the daffodils and the tulips and you know having fresh plants growing in your house and having the the lighter colored stones although after our big snowstorm up here uh in the northeast i think i'm ditching the white stone for now i've had enough weight in my life you're done with the snow don't blame me one bit now we just gotta see if that old punxsutawney phil sees his shadow that's right that's coming up really soon like tomorrow tomorrow so yeah so i guess we shall see spring is coming well it's definitely coming whether that's uh that old rodent what the hell is he again groundhog he's a groundhog you know whether that groundhog sees it or not it's definitely coming now you know we joke that you have said spring cleaning more times than jesus but did jesus really say spring cleaning jesus says thou shalt clean your kitchen but the reason behind it the reason that this is kind of that clean out time is because this is the time for new beginnings and you got to make room for new beginnings you can't have fresh perspective you can't have a new beginning like you got to make room for that it's like a hoarder you can't bring in more [ __ ] if you still got too much [ __ ] that is so so true so true where's that relationship going to go i mean if you are still keeping all this spiritual clutter all this mental clutter that you just can't let go of get rid of [ __ ] how you bringing in good how you bringing in change and you can't i mean not unless you do the work of clearing space first whether you have an elaborate sabbath ritual or with a covenant or a community of friends or if you celebrate by yourself simply with a lit candle going room to room or just a few minutes of solo meditation if you can make space for yourself make time for yourself take a moment to reflect on letting go of what doesn't serve you and what you no longer have need for you know sometime between february 1st and 2nd make a little space for yourself you know if you can do a little spring cleaning clean off an altar refresh it you know bring in some new herbs or some new crystals and do something for yourself make that space so that things can grow for you in this next turning of the wheel of the year but for all of our listeners we do want to say that we do wish you a very happy in bulk um we hope you are able to celebrate in whatever way fits fits your need and in fits your time and space and we do really really hope that you are able to set the intentions and the goals that you hope to reach so again happy in bulk to everyone i love that so much happy in bulk to all of our listeners thank you so much for joining this journey with us and happy birthday leila and happy
