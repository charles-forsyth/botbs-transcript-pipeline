it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi and welcome to an especially spooky Salem Massachusetts episode of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends living on opposite coast of the USA share spooky true creepy Tales from their half of the country this week for episode 38 we continue our tour of Salem Massachusetts with a visit to the Salem witchboard Museum and we talk about all things Ouija board with my fingers lightly on the planet I'm Lea and I'm hi I'm eating nerd gummy clusters and I'm shell yeah starting early on that Halloween candy I see oh my God I don't really like nerd clusters so I don't really want any your shit's good like they make candy for adults nowadays I swear McDonald's Happy Meals for adults candy for adults I mean cover in dark chocolate and I'm pretty much there I'm not really like the fruity candy kind of girl but dark chocolate hell yes I gota well so today today we've smoked a lot of weed so much of this end game so much of some Marathon OG and bakio gelato that I have brought and went to one of the coolest places yet the Salem wishboard Museum honestly I purposefully this is again and I know I said this about House of Seven Gables but this is another place that I purposefully did not go to because I wanted to wait until you came and I'm so glad you waited what an amazing funky cool place first so awesome first of all let me just say the owner of the witchboard museum John Kik like he rocks so nice and so accommodating and so [ __ ] knowledgeable well and and the thing is if if you're not looking for it you might miss it so let's just point out here yes local Salem resident please please tell people how to get into this very hard to find it's it is really well-labeled so you're not going to have too hard of a time but it is kind of hidden but it's interesting and it and it seems very appropriate so you're walking down Essex Street and there's these cute Harry Potter stores the WAN store which by the way love the Harry Potter w super cute love it and then there's like the Harry Potter I don't know I call it the Harry Potter gift store I'm sure it's got a better name than that so you walk in this Harry Potter gift store and in the back all of a sudden behind the cash register is the entrance for the Salem witchboard Museum and you're like huh that's kind of weird so so you pay the nice lady at the register what was it to get in admission price is $20 and it is well worth it totally worth that I would absolutely pay double by the way and still go you go in the back of the Harry Potter store boom there it is and when you walk in John was waiting like right there and he was like ready to chat which of course we were ready to chat I must say first and foremost probably like the most welcoming place we went into like this I was so thrilled that we were there and we were so thrilled to be there and it was like a chat Fest from the get-go it's it's a very large room and a half basically and it is covered floor to ceiling in spirit boards talking boards Ouija boards and if you are lucky enough to be there when the proprietor owner and historian John Kik is there he loves to talk about them knows so much about all of these boards and he will happily talk your ear off about every single one the guy is just so knowledgeable like every single one has a story whether it be the story how he got it the story of who made it the story of who used it it's like everyone has a unique thing and he knows every last detail and it was so much fun and he has fun stories on how he found these boards or or going to get them but let's take a moment and uh listen to our earlier selves right after we left the Salem witchboard Museum earlier today so today we went to the witchboard museum in Salem what you think I was I I loved it I loved it from the first second I walked in it was covered wall to wall floor to ceiling with witch boards talking boards Ouija boards pieces of History Spirit boards and John was so knowledgeable so friendly and had so much to say about everything in that room I don't even know who was more excited to be there him excited that we were there or us excited to be there we were like little kids right from the first second I was practically bouncing in my shoes and you know guys I'm going to post so many Instagram photos of these these Spirit boards that we saw he has a one of the original boards that was what do you say it was created out of a coffin they took coffin wood and made it that's right they used wood from a coffin to make in it was made outside of Rochester New York for the fox sisters he said they were spiritualists who did knocking and they knocked for each letter of the alphabet so a would be one B would be two like a morse code exactly well no Morse code's different well but a similar concept right but like a much longer harder to do Morse code that's annoying I'm glad they created witch boards exactly so if you know things could take a long ass time to knock out well Ouija board is not no short stint either so the knocking would have been like hours long seanes to say someone's name yeah yeah yeah yeah so this place was amazing um the other thing that I thought was cool is he has three times what he has in there now and he rotates it out uh basically three times a year um what do you say he had he has a movie theme a music theme um and I can't remember what the other theme was but it was really good um so he actually has way more than what he displays at any one given moment so you can go there and see different displays at different times of year and another thing I found fascinating was that he got into them because of his grandmother he saw that his grandmother used to use a Ouija board and she would use it by herself and get information that way and she he was never allowed to be in the same room with her when she would do the Ouija boards he would have to go somewhere else and so he said he would often kind of like watch while she would do it when she peing around the doorway corner like peeking through the corner of the keyhole to see what was going on and that kind of started his fascination with the with the talking board which I find funny because isn't like the whole like unspoken rule don't use it alone and this guy gets into it because his grandmother used it alone he says he a lot of what he says he prefaces with your belief he feels very strongly that the board itself doesn't have any hard and fast rules it's your belief what you put into it so for him using it alone is no big deal right right although I don't from what I think you said said I didn't ask him today but from what you said he doesn't use them at all I don't believe so I believe uh I heard um cuz if you haven't also checked out the personal interview uh with this lovely man you can find that on Salem the podcast um I believe on on that interview he had said he actually does not use them I so would every day I'd use one every day I'd get to work without the board so many cool ones there and we'll definitely go over our informal interview you with John and talk a little bit more later about our impressions in the different boards and some of the history because some of them have amazing history some from different TV shows he has 666 boards from Glenn Danzig all of them signed on the back Isn't that cool how cool is that boards from um doesn't he have a board from um The Exorcist no stranger things he has a stranger things board and he says that the stranger things board is actually supposed to be his most haunted board and that someone sent it with a letter saying like basically do not ever let this get back into my possession keep it do whatever I don't want it and he says people that walk in there are drawn directly to that board and feel that there's a lot of haunt right there that there's a lot of energy in that board even though it's kind of new ironically enough I didn't feel it I kind of felt more attracted to this particular board that I thought was super cool never seen anything like it it was a weed IG board and Braille I like I I felt drawn to that one as well that one felt like it had a lot of energ and it looked like it was like carved out of wood and very cool very very cool definitely interesting so many different kinds including a weed Ouija board oh my God that was so awesome it was called the weed J get it get it weed J and it had puff puff pass on it and of course the fan leaves and actually the planchet was a leaf with a little in the center of it very cool um but yeah he just he had um some that were um Asian themed he had uh some from the witchboard movie there was a witchboard movie themed one he had some really good paraphernalia books posters history anything that had to do with and you know what this was I thought very cool he had back in like the 20s and 30s and 40s they made greeting cards with little children playing with Ouija boards um also he had a figurine I can the only thing I can equate it to is remember precious moments in the 80s it was like a precious moment figurine of these two little children playing with a spirit board I got a picture don't worry I'll post it we'll post lots of pictures and speaking of weed and Ouija boards right now we're passing a bowl back and forth oh my God we're passing a bow we're not even talking about what we're separately smoking we're passing we're smoking the same thing we're smoking some Marathon OG and we're smoking some Bako gelato and some of Shell's end game we're kind of doing the salad thing I like salads we've always done salads we just keep packing bowls you pack one I pack one and we're back and forth and I think we've been smoking for 48 hours straight I'm pretty sure Perfect all right I'm going to spark up a bong here of your lovely end game this [ __ ] is so sticky you know honestly this is so funny this [ __ ] is so sticky that it has clogged my grinder and I'm having a hard time getting the top of my grinder to spin and grind because I have to actually clean it there are worse problems to have there are worse problems to have but I actually have to clean my grinder with the cleaning solution because this shit's been so sticky that yeah just having a hard time twisting the old grinder I can tell why it's super sticky and I love it it tastes fabulous so we both had such a positive impression going in there both of the place and the proprietor John kak one thing I didn't realize and and this actually is going to make me go back here shortly is I didn't realize that he literally has three times the content and that every so often every couple of months he rotates the content 100% so I actually going to go back in a couple of months just to see his whole next wave of inventory and there's so much to see there one of my favorites was the very first talking board that's known in the United States that was rumored to have been made for the fox sisters who were based in Rochester New York and and possibly started the entire spiritualist movement in the United States back in the early um to mid 1800s but kind of take it back a step Ouija boards talking boards witch boards some people say they're the same thing kind of different kind of the same but one of the first talking boards so to say uh mentioned was found in China in 1100 ad so these things weren't necessarily invented by Parker Brothers they actually weren't at all invented by Parker Brothers like you said the original talking board goes back thousand years yeah it was something like the Song Dynasty and I believe they call it um they called it the Fuji and I know that sounds silly but I'm dead ass I believe it was called the Fuji from the Song Dynasty and it was kind of a like the the modern day planette but it had a pencil or a pen or a writing Implement in it and the automatic writing that you would see talked about during the spiritualist times used this automatic writing thing basically it was a a device that held a pencil for you and you would lightly touch your f fingers on it and close your eyes and the spirits uh or energies would talk through You by making it write out words while you weren't even looking basically like like a modernday planet with a pencil minus the board so kind of what happened was there was this whole spiritualist movement because at the time in the 1800s a lot of people were dying there was sickness there was war and so in the the mid 19th century in Europe there's this whole spiritualist craze where people are trying to contact dead and they're they're coming up with all these different ways to do it and that's when kind of mediumship became popular and it came to the US in about 1848 the these two Girls Katherine and Margaretta Maggie and Kate Fox were born in Upstate New York and their house was rumored to be haunted and all sorts of wrappings and spirit noises were happening and the girls discovered they could communicate with these spirits and it was supposedly the spirit of a traveling salesman who had died had been buried in their Cellar and they could communicate with these Spirits through some sort of wrapping and they they developed a way to talk to them by saying one rap means yes and two means no and then later they expanded that to be letters of the alphabet like one for a two for B and as you can imagine this would get pretty unwieldy you know how long would it would take to spell out a sentence that way you know in in the time uh when when they were using that the earlier 1800s it was actually considered a serious form of spirit communication a serious device but from about 1890 on it was really more considered kind of like a parlor game right yeah earlier the spiritualist like the fox sisters are using um these boards basically it was shorthand they went from these wrappings that could take a very long time to using this board that had letters all the letters the alphabet and numbers on it and then they would use the planet this other type of of spirit device to point out the letters and point out the numbers and it could have any other symbols uh John Kik the curator of the Salem witchboard Museum mentioned that the other symbols really aren't important in his research he's found that the only importance are the letters and the numbers the other symbols vary depending on the maker of the board and what they wanted but I thought it was cute we saw a board that inste of having a sun and a moon it had a witch and a cat which was super cute yeah but I actually I don't know why but I've thought for years that those symbols actually meant something so I was kind of surprised to find out that they in fact do not yeah I was as well I thought every symbol on the board had to be some important historical meaning but no it's just it can be pot leaves it could be naked people it could be you know whatever you want it to be whatever symbols matter to you John me mentioned a few times that he doesn't really believe in the magic of these things he just really enjoys them for what they are but he knows people very much do place a lot of belief in them and he says that in his opinion he's found that people who make their own or come up with their own symbols to put on it find more power in that and that it works better for them and we'll get to that later yeah we kind of will but so on July 1st 1890 a man by the name of el Bond actually took a talking board a spirit board a witch board and patent it what he did was uh he he and a group of folks used that Ouija board and asked it what it wanted to be called and that's where the name Ouija board came from this board said that's what it wanted its name to be um and he patented that so I heard an interesting story about that time that they got the patent when they brought this board to the patent Pat office to patent it the patent officer said well that's a lot of claims for what it does I'm not going to give you the patent unless you can prove it and so they sat down with this Ouija board and I believe it was um Elijah Bond's sister-in-law who put her hands on the planchet and the patent officer said what's my name and it spelled out his name supposedly they didn't know it however one of the people with them was a patent person so he probably would have known it I mean it's probably information they had but supposed paid somebody but in front of the patent officer the Ouija board spelled out his last name which was supposedly unbeknownst to any of the members in the party and so they actually used the fact that they proved it worked in front of the patent officer as part of their selling points and so I did hear a couple different stories about how the name came to be yeah I heard that they basically asked the board and the said that's what it wanted to be called yep and then it it came up and it said Ouija and that that was Egyptian for good luck another Legend kind of expanded on that Helen Peters who was the sister of Elijah Bond and she was supposedly a spiritualist at the patent office supposedly is where they asked it what the name was and it spelled out Ouija but she was also wearing a locket uh with the name uh weeda which is just a d instead of a j which was a PO po person at that time supposedly I don't know never heard that and William fold uh who was part of this group well he was the one that Elijah Bond sold it to um he sold the rights of the Ouija board to William fold and he says that Ouija was actually a combination of French and German for yes and so that's why they named it that I don't know there's a lot of different rumors as to where the name came from and I don't know if any of them probably un probably unless you are those two people Elijah and a sister there'll be no way to know for sure during our visit John Kik mentioned that he picked up his friend merch to go by he heard about a very rare Ouija board in Florida and so he says he went and grabbed his friend merch and they just drove 21 hours straight through to go buy this Ouija board before anyone else could get it and I didn't know at the time who merch was but I found out that merch is actually Ouija historian Robert merch who's like a professional Ouija researcher and he's been studying Ouija boards since 1994 and he says based on his research that it was Helen Peters supposedly that like you said was they were sitting around and she was using the Ouija board and they asked it what it wanted to be called and it and the name Ouija was spelled out and that it meant good luck and um so she does say that she was wearing a locket that said weda which was a women's rights activist at the time that Peters admired so I don't know a lot of weird stuff I gotta say though having gone to this place and and just seeing the scope of what he's got and what he knows first of all to know that there's somebody out there who knows more than this guy is mindblowing but I mean there there's a lot more history to to Ouija boards talking boards witch boards whatever you want to call them than Parker Brothers and I think that's the fascinating part like who knew they made a a board specifically for the loveboat right who knew that and he's got most of them I think you know what I thought was super cool and I know that you and I talked about this well while I was taking probably hundreds of pictures of these which I will post on our Instagram check us out the stoned Witches Hour on Instagram there was one I loved that instead of having it had the yes and no but instead of having the alphabet it had the major Arcana of the Tarot deck yeah loved that that was pretty interesting yeah that's mixing like a a talking board and a Tarot deck into one big beautiful concoction and I loved it I loved it there was the Electric Board that I guess there was only a few made of it's called the electric mystifying Oracle and it it was made in 1933 and it's a metal board most boards at that time according to John sold for about $150 this one was $5 which was a lot of money during that time and unfortunately World War II happened and so not a lot of people bought it and they kind of scrapped it so this particular board there's only a few of them available and when this one came up for sale he says within 2 hours he'd rented a car picked up his friend merch from Boston and drove 21 hours down to Florida to get it because there's only a few of them left and he doesn't have the planet for it so if anybody has the planet for this electric mystifying Oracle from 1933 go see John kak at the Salem witchboard Museum he would love it give the guy the plet man just give the guy the planet right you know I think that one of the things that really kind of struck me was it doesn't matter necessarily what it's made out of or what it looks like you know this doesn't have to be some $50 piece you went and bought at some fancy old store a talking board is a talking board is a talking board and you can make one out of cardboard and Sharpie markers if that's what it takes yeah you can literally make them out of anything and you can use your own symbol your own symbology whatever is important to you or whatever like the person who used the tarot cards I also saw some that had little phrases written around the board in addition to the letters you know if that's what's going to work fastest for you to get in touch with your subconscious with the spirit world or whatever that's the way to do it and I liked that he had some that were kind of like related to like he had a a I don't know if it was Barbie person say but it was like that Barbie hot pink and kind of like marketed towards like pre-teen girls you know kind of like how tarot decks you can have different artwork he has a lot that just have different artwork one that you and I both really liked uh was one that was in Braille yes very had a lot of interesting energy from it and I don't know if it's because it was right next to or right underneath what John kak called the most haunted Ouija board that he has or if it just had its own energy but it was very fun uh someone came in and asked him what the most haunted board was that he had and he brought us over to a corner that had a very new very plain cardboard stranger things Ouija board yeah and next to it on the wall was a framed letter and apparently this Museum gets mailed on a regular basis boards that people have found boards that are cursed boards that have all sorts of haunted issues or just interesting backstories and he displays them I guess he's known he's well known at the post office and they don't allow him to open anything up at the post office he's because they know what's inside there he's told he can't open them there now I have I I I have a picture of this letter and I want to read this because I mean it's not funny it it's really not funny but it's funny so they wrote this package does not have a return address if it gets lost along the way please send it to the talking board historical society and then it says at the bottom and it gives the address of that and at the bottom it says trust me you don't want it I don't know if that's egging me on but um I'm the one who's the [ __ ] around and find out so it probably is egging me on but I'm actually looking at a picture of this board right now which I will post to our Instagram you know it's kind of a cute board it's got like the Christmas lights and I am a glutton for punishment glutton for punishment i' use it yeah right but I mean just we are a collector of cool mystical things so for us this place was like heaven it really was being able to just look over every single one of these and somehow uh William fold who Bond sold the Ouija board business to he was a Mason he was part of the Masonic Society aren't they all right in this Museum they have the um the marble slab that was at the foot of his grave grave like the footer from his grave and it's has his name and the Masonic symbol there's just so many different unique and interesting things here I could have spent well over an hour just looking at everything and talking to him and Lea we spent well over an hour and I still want to go back I still did not see everything he talks about there's more haunted boards there some that are covered in caution tape and locked in a in a case uh that he got with a letter from someone who had found these boards when they moved into the house and as soon as they Unearthed them bad things started happening in the home the husband lost his job the children starting having nightmares things started moving around the house and so she kind of sealed them all up wrapped them up stuck them in a box full of salt and then mailed them to the Salem witchboard Museum and apparently he gets things like that all the time and he's well known at a lot of flea markets and across the country if something interesting comes up people usually call him first because he's a well-known collector and he's willing to fly out he even said he's willing to fly out to California with less than 48 hours notice just to get um some interesting boards well I think it's funny when he talks about the the the post office workers here in Salem you know he runs down to the post office they hand him a box that's leaking salt and then they say get out before everybody's just like all right you know leave with your [ __ ] you know yep if that was Upstate New York they'd be calling like the bomb squad or something they're like here here's your your ritual salt leaking box off Sage demons demons no like like this guy bang up job on the museum totally worth um totally worth going to and again kind of like the Salem Black Hat Society it's something that someone in Salem saw a need for right and okay so it's a little commercial big deal the money goes towards helping him continue to run this amazing place that he again is more than happy to talk about and give all of his knowledge on which you know we kind of needed for our adventures later that night you know some more interesting facts about the Ouija board you had mentioned that it was kind of like a just a common parlor game and even um Norman Rockwell the artist Norman Rockwell who famous for his depictions of 20th century domestic life in America he has a painting of a man and a woman using a Ouija board in their living room and it was that common it used to be like and like if you if you're at the witchboard Museum newspaper ads um magazine uh uh ads it was very common very very common in 1892 there were two factories in Baltimore two in New York two in Chicago one in London they were selling over 2,000 Ouija boards a week it outsold Monopoly wow wow yeah every time anything bad happens in the world Ouija board s uh sales surge shocker even to this day possibly I know during um the Great Depression and you know World War I skyrocketed in 1944 over a period of five months a department store in New York City sold 50,000 boards I think it's because people have that they want to make that connection with the loved one who died at War it kind of becomes more serious when people become more desperate yeah exactly when people aren't as desperate then it goes back to being a parlor Game Y in the in the late 60s you've got Vietnam you've got the race riots going on in uh Detroit Minneapolis uh uh you've got the summer of love thing going on during that time over two million boards sold wow yeah wow it's wild yeah so it's just there's so much and we also learned about the mysterious death of William fold uh in 1927 he was trying to install a flag pole or something on like the the original Baltimore Ouija board Factory the original Baltimore Ouija board Factory and he fell down and he broke some ribs and apparently his assistant like threw him in a car and drove him quickly to the hospital and unfortunately it was that drive where one of his broken ribs punctured his heart and he he died from it and on his deathbed according to um John Kik William fold said don't sell Ouija so I don't know they did though they ended up selling it what 1970 in the early 70s they sold it to Parker Brothers yeah yeah and have made Millions off of it to this day yep you go to Target you can buy a Ouija board that's true and and before 19 73 it was just a regular family parlor game people had one and it was just a fun common thing to use people used it by themselves they used it with their friends you know they used it to try and contact their loved ones people even used it to write poetry and books well starting in the 70s and 80s you started to see more books and movies kind of flooding the market warning of the Ouija board's dangers and kind of played upon you know back then movies like The Exorcist and things of that nature were coming out and well that's exactly it it was one movie in particular that that made everybody kind of changed their minds on the Ouija board and so it went from being a fun parlor game where maybe you could contact your dead relatives to one movie happened and then this dangerous evil spirit wielding death board or some [ __ ] 1973 The Exorcist came out and portrayed the Ouija board as as a means to communicate with the devil and and demons and that's when everything changed and that's when it became bad to use by yourself and a and a means for Satan to come in and I mean because that was also kind of about the time where it seemed to be some widespread fear that devil worshippers were yeah exactly in North America which they were not it's the very beginnings of the satanic Panic yeah yeah and so kind of Ouija boards Spirit boards talking boards witch boards started getting a [ __ ] ass reput and name in the 80s and some of those movies in in books weren't helping it because like for example you will look up any there's two movies right now Ouija and Ouija to they're kind of that horror everybody dies your soul gets ripped out [ __ ] and it's they're playing on that fear at this point and not giving necessarily accurate information in regards to I mean can you summon the devil I'm not here to say yes or no but I mean they're just they're praying on fear to make movies which exactly which has undercut the actual value of a talking board and I think there's a lot of value to it I mean the fox sisters kind of got famous for you know communicating with spirits and and people really enjoyed using this board to to try and contact you know loved ones that had gone on and like a lot of divination tools there's good and bad and there's there's times where things come out of it that you're like wow that absolutely blew my mind I have no idea how that got that information or where that came from and there's other times where you're like this is fake as [ __ ] [ __ ] right right and it just kind of goes it swings both ends of that Spectrum but I do find a lot of value in you know we know that there's the whole idomoo response a lot of what people do with the Ouija board is is your subconscious you put your fingers on that planet along with other people and someone's subconscious can take over it without anyone knowing or even feeling like they're moving it that maybe the combined subconscious of everyone kind of TAPS into that or maybe there's a spirit or someone outside of our knowledge or or an energy outside of our knowledge that's moving that around we don't know but I do know that there was a study done on uh Ouija by um some researchers at the University of British Columbia their visual cognition layout a researcher Dr Ron Renn professor of psychology and computer science psychology postdoctoral researcher Helena gawu and Dr Sydney Fels who's a professor of electrical and computer engineering smoke a little more right they decided to see what exactly happens when people sit down and use a a Ouija board so they conducted a study basically they had people sit down in front of a Ouija board and there was mechanical hands that would do the Ouija board with them they were told that the mechanical hands were being controlled by a person in another room and what it really what it really was is the mechanical hands were just exaggerating their own motions it was mirroring their their motions any motions they made with their hands those hands would replicate just a little bit bigger so it was all them moving the planchet and what they found was that when people were asked a series of questions on their own they were right about 50% of the time getting these questions when they were asked to use the Ouija board to answer these questions they were right about 65% of the time oh so somehow some way whether it's their subconscious or some other entity or energy giving them information these researchers in 2014 found that people were more right 15% which is significant they were significantly more right than random chance using the Ouija board oh wow pretty wild right yeah and it carried through even if they used the Ouija board so they'd sit down two people across from each other they'd put their fingers on the planet and they'd be blindfolded the other person would then get up and leave without the first person knowing that they were gone oh so they would think there was another person using the Ouija board with them and again when they were asked these questions they were right 65% of the time and they often would complain that they felt like the other person was moving the planet when there was no one else touching it but them that's very cool that's very cool so I think I think that there's been some movies that have kind of swung back around uh what was it the conjuring I believe that are kind of bringing back that interest good B indiff I think personally there is there is value to talking boards and and spirit boards witch boards Ouija boards but I want to just take a quick second and talk about what do you feel about some of the common superstitions around Ouija boards like you can't use it alone or you always have to say goodbye like like how do you feel about some of those things do you do you think they're legitimate or just kind of wacky um some I don't that's a good question I guess you'd have to give me a specific one how about how about um using it alone do you think that it is like opening the gates of hell if you use it alone or would you totally be like yeah [ __ ] it I'm gonna use it by myself let's do this I think that you could use it alone but I'm going to going to put a lot of caveats in that iide assault Circle sure I think a Ouija board I think a Ouija board is like most tools of divination it's a fabulous tool for you to get in touch with yourself your Spirit guides your ancestors your subconscious you know your higher self I think it is a a fabulous way to do that and so doing that by yourself can be very therapeutic can be very healing a lot of us do this work by ourselves so I think using a Ouija board by yourself is okay in that type of situation would I take a Ouija board into a well-known highly haunted highly active situation and throw that [ __ ] down and start using it no no I would not but in my home in a place where I do meditation where I do ancestor work where I do inner self work yes yes I would use it alone there because that's a my intention there is to get in touch with with what I guess it comes back to intention like most things if my intention is to get in touch with my higher self and I'm in a protected space and a good face then yes I would use that board that way but again if I put myself into a very dangerous situation would I use it then no I totally agree what about saying goodbye I I kind of buy into the saying goodbye thing just like you know you don't kick someone out of your house and just you know boot to the ass and slam the door you're kind of all right see you later gots to go what do you think about the goodbye thing I think about it as the slamming the door boots to the ass you got to go I don't necessarily think I have to like make the planet go to goodbye but I do feel that I have to close it way yeah I have to say this circle's closed this channel is closed you know basically you know I don't care where the [ __ ] you go but you can't stay here right right but some people have this if the plit doesn't go to goodby you've opened up God knows what and there's there's power in ritual and there's power in belief and if that's something that you have heard over and over and over again then that's that's a powerful thing and and so I feel that if I'm in a space with someone who feels that's the best way to say goodbye that's fine as long as we say goodbye and close that door I'm good with it any superstitions other ones that you've heard of that you follow by or thinker silliness let's see I've heard the don't use it alone I've heard the you know don't use it on Friday the 13th but you know that's just silly don't use it during a full moon also just silly wouldn't that be the best time to use it uh let's see I've heard that um now we've talked about objects holding on to energies how do you feel about secondhand Ouija board or Spirit boards that were given to you or or Spirit boards that have been said to have bad energy would you use one of those and if so absolutely same as same as it use Tarot deck um a hand-me-down Tarot deck um same concept you cleanse that [ __ ] good to go let's rock yeah um I I do maybe I I over believe but I do believe that nothing a little cleansing can't take care of I agree I agree you know if you so yeah I would use a secondhand board just like I would take a secondhand Tarot deck but yeah after I cleansed it and stuff I'd totally rock it I'd be good with that how do you feel and have you ever had a planchet move on its own I have this was I was still living uh with my mother I was probably 15 16 I had just got this Ouija board for Christmas I had convinced my mother finally that that's what I wanted for Christmas my cousins were at my house and we had you remember pop-up campers we had a popup camper in our backyard and I took my cousins and my younger sister out into this pop-up camper and we had it on the table and we had been playing with it and fooling around with it you know who's the true love of my life you know stuff you do when you're 15 yeah of course Everyone likes to ask that question of a Ouija board and uh I remember we were getting ready to pack stuff up and my mom was yelling because my sister was kind of young and she wanted her in the house and the plant ship moved all the way across the board and my my younger cousin was crying and they kept blaming me and telling my aunt and my mother that I was doing it to scare them and it wasn't me creepy wasn't me wow but I wasn't freaked out no not as much as you'd think I'd be being like 15 I was just kind of like huh well that's weird and I ain't taking the blame for that it didn't face me though I wasn't like appalled or taken a back or shocked or scared I was just like huh well at that time you kind of already knew that there was more to the world than than you can see with a naked eye you know there's layers and things beyond our experience and belief sometimes the world is our onion and I'm also curious shell if there's anything that you always do is there something you do every single time you use a Ouija board like what is your goto cleanse it and seal it cleanse it when you start cleanse it again and seal it when you're done don't be dumb cleanse it and seal it sound like very witchy terms to me so could you tell us what you mean by cleanse when you talk about cleansing the board like with some Sage you know kind of just Sage it over before I start and kind of sage it over when I'm done and kind of give my vibe that we're done here when I'm take an incense a sage Sage is a good one Pine is another good one pretty much any incense that you really like the scent of or that you feel is a protective cleansing scent and Shell's pretty much saying light your incense and let it Let the Smoke roll over the board and and think of it as washing away any negative energy on that board and just infusing it with good intentions and safe space but I also think the most important part is at the end where you you you definitely intend this to be done yes whether whether you go whether you buy into the you have to have your planet go across goodby or not regardless of that your intention at least has to be we're done here goodbye I absolutely agree I definitely think that you should come up with either the like you said the plan check going across goodbye or some sort of saying something you say every single time is a is a good a good reminder for yourself it's a good way to ground yourself and definitely a good way to remind any energies you've been working with that you're done time to go home you're out well I have a really funny story I want to tell you oh I love stories go for it I'm gonna hit this bowl while you tell me why don't you pass that weed over and I'll pack it so before I I moved to Massachusetts I would frequently go back and forth between between New York and Massachusetts and one weekend I had left my daughter home for the weekend and and off I go to spend the weekend in Salem now bear in mind my daughter was like 25 years old not talking like some infantile here TW I I leave my 25-year-old assuming she's responsible child home alone for the weekend it was like Saturday night and you know I'm going to be coming home the next day any anyway so it's like Saturday night and it's like 11:30 12:00 and here I am in Salem for the weekend and my phone starts ringing off the hook and I'm like what is going on it's my daughter oh she is on the other end crying like the crocodile blubbering we're all gonna die here freak out and I'm like what's wrong what's wrong you know what this kid does I've kind of lived such a witchy life that I just assumed my children knew certain rules which which come to find out she did don't touch mommy's witchy stuff especially if I'm not oh no oh no this is starting to sound like The Sorcerer's Apprentice or Lord or one of how one of those bad movie starts seriously so I have I happen to have possession of a Ouija board that was like from the 1940s and it's kind of a uh it's got some attachments to it so you know I don't use it very often and my kids know you know do not touch this stuff I have it up like on the top shelf of my closet um I have clothes on top of it in the closet like it's obviously something do not touch of mommies right so I go away for the weekend and and my daughter has her friends over couple friends I know these kids no harm no foul and they decide for whatever reason to kind of to convince my daughter that it's okay to get one of my Ouija boards out of the closet oh no oh no so then my daughter starts to tell them how I have this really old one and well guess what the friends want to use of course you got to brag on the really cool witchy stuff that mom's got yeah so and then this is worse than getting into your parents liquor when we were kids I think seriously to use my daughter's word she was peer pressured into using the old Ouija board Pagan pressured so then then she goes on to tell me listen to this you're just going to laugh the more this goes on so then she tells her friends well I know that we should light candles because that'll make it safe they like oh no she knows just enough to be dangerous is what you're telling me they light three candles okay all right better than none she's like well I thought maybe I should have lit four but I wasn't sure so I just lit three so they go about their they're playing with the Ouija board while apparently the candles start exploding and the Ouija board falls off the table kids are screaming and she's calling me thinking that she's let some demon in my house can I not leave a 25-year-old kid home alone for the weekend without bringing demons to my house Ser not in today's day and age because everyone and their sister knows how to summon a ghost there are so many different stories you know here I am I'm I'm on the phone at like 11:30 12:00 at night I'm supposed to be away for the weekend telling my kid how to like smudge the house and I'm like you know what sometimes you just have to clean up your own messes I'll be home tomorrow figure it out you figured out how to get into this Poltergeist mess it you can figure out how to seal things and get out of it it was like such a Practical Magic Moment I was like the ants who just walked away and was like deal with it I will be home I'll be home tomorrow will figure it out till then she's like I'm scared I don't know what to tell you I'm 300 miles away you spilled the candle wax on your own honey you clean it up so then I get there and she's like Mom I knew better I knew I shouldn't have done this but I was pure pressured I'm like you will never touch and all of her friends that were there that night we'll never we'll never ever touch your Ouija board Seer again I'm like yeah now you know [ __ ] around and find out that's exactly right took me two days to cleanse my house that's I knew a little bit of that story I hadn't heard the whole thing I I feel like I came home to a whole bunch of spil milk you know like I had a mess to clean up when I got home and I was annoyed she said can you handle I'm like I can handle this but I'm annoyed annoyed Practical Magic ants so then so then you know fast forward you know my my daughter has her own house and I had stored a couple things in her house so I go and get a couple of of my storage totes I had there and she goes mom you have to take this tote and I go why and she goes because I opened it up and it has your Ouija boards and I can't have them in my house that's bad right take them right then and there I just it don't blame her stuff yeah don't touch my stuff and she's already established a link with them so I'm not surprised she wanted them as far away from her as possible and as we know from John kak at the the witchboard Museum he gets sent boards like that pretty regularly if it was up to my daughter she would have mailed my whole collection to him oh oh that would have deserved some sort of punishment right there Lord she would have been cleaning your house for free for the next decade right right but you know you're right it's just it's it's curiosity but sometimes just enough can get you in trouble and and that's the thing with Ouija boards it's not that that talking boards or witch boards or or what whatever you you want to call them they aren't evil or bad but don't be stupid either exactly there's still a tool of divination much like tarot cards or automatic writing or anything like that if you use some sort of tool and you have an expectation that that this key is going to this tool is going to unlock something for you it's going to unlock something for you and so if your expectation if you're setting up the situation thinking you're going to channel Spirits from the other side you're opening up that channel to depending on how good you are at setting up that intention and using that type of magic and that energy and some of us are very good at it naturally I I describe it like baseball everybody can play baseball some of us are like amazing Pros right off the bat without any practice and some of us have to work at it it's the same thing with magic some people can Channel a lot without even realizing it so if you set up that intention you could be setting yourself up for a lot of scary situations a lot of chaos yeah chaos is a good way to put it now if you've listened to our past podcast or if you want to listen to us talk about times when we have used Ouija boards you can listen to episode number 26 Leela's haunted house Revisited and missing Daniel Robinson where I talk about a time when shell and I used a Ouija board together and didn't think we'd summoned anything and I think we actually summon something pretty big isn't that always the way it is now we've talked a little bit before about your impressions of that day but you know let's get into that a little bit more deeply because we have used that Ouija board in a couple different places not just at my dad's house we've also used it at a couple different cemeteries haunted cemeteries that we've done ghost hunting at together before you know anything from those times stand out to you you know actually my first I I I I have a question for you real quick do you still have have the Ouija board that we used at your dad's house yes I do no [ __ ] yep I do that Ouija board and I've talked about it before that one's uh 1973 I think it's like one year younger than the one that you have Parker Brothers or what have it's right over here but it was from my grandmother my grandmother was very much into uh she liked the occult and not really the occult she liked spiritualism my grandmother likes spiritualism she gave me my first deck of tarot cards and she gave me that Ouija board and and she lived in a haunted house so she was very much into that kind of thing and she wi Le witch I don't know it's surprising too because she's a devout Christian oh so yeah for another podcast different podcast to get back to your question to Circle back and part of the reason I asked that is I wonder if continued use has any effect on Effectiveness like for example is the board I got when I was 14 that I still have is that board the same or more effective quote unquote than say if I went over to Target and got one in right now and opened it fresh out of the package I personally think that the more you use something the more it's resonated agree 100% that's kind of why I like getting new boards and using them and then keeping them for a long time so that you kind of build that I don't know spookiness so sometime I think that what we should do is get together and uh do a session with all of our old boards oo how fun would that be I can't wait to tell people what we may have done at Gallows Hill or may not have done we don't even listen to our own advice no no we don't we probably are the worst followers of our own advice but uh you know you can't say we're not fun that's the thing you know good ideas aren't always smart ideas but they always end up being fun ideas and if you really want to know what the hell we're talking about you're gonna have to wait till the next episode because we we we we [ __ ] around and found out and and you're gonna love it in the meantime if you want a little extra Ouija board information check out episode 26 of the stoned Witches Hour you can also check check out episode 23 of the podcast we all po down here it's a podcast where we were special guests and we talk about the movie Veronica which is a movie about a young teenage girl who uses a Ouija board to try and contact her father and then a poltergeist kind of breaks out in her apartment and this is actually based on a true story and there is an actual police report talking about the p tergeist activity that was caused by this Ouija board and this young girl so you can check episode 23 of We All pod down here shelle and I are guests on that you can also check out episode 13 of the stoned Witches Hour the one with Tom and I have a story a personal story in there of a time at my grandmother's house uh before I met you shelle when I used a Ouija board if you remember that and with my friend and there was some sort of ghostly presence in the stairwell but you can check that out in episode 13 but what's funny and and I laugh because you know how my family is very non witchy yeah as witchy as they are they say they're not right isn't that the way so so that one Ouija board I got that's from whatever it was like 1947 or 1945 that actually belonged to my grandparents and I obtained it when my grandmother passed away and they were kind you know so my grandma dies and like oh give the Ouija board to her it's totally everything which I was thrilled by the way um and didn't tell anybody how exciting that was to have one that old because that was actually when um when the boards were being made in Salem so it's one of the older kind of hardier boards it's more thicker it's not not not like almost like cardboard it's like that thick board yeah I think there was a period of time where they went from actually using very thin wood to using some type of like almost cardboard particle board my grandparents had it more as a this is what you do when your friends come over parlor game kind of thing and then you know my mother and my aunt and uncle did it more as a parlor SL teenage fun thing it makes sense that was the generation where it was built like that it didn't change until 1973 with you know the Exorcist and then fast forward to my grandmother passing away and I obtain this board and I think it is the coolest thing my daughter not so much but I do I love that if any of you out there of any of our listeners and you are growing all the time it's kind of fun actually so hi all around the world to our listeners hi everybody if any of you have a Ouija board a talking board a spirit board of any

we had a really good time and we were kind of motivated our next episode we're g to take a trip up to Gallows Hill so what do we decide to do so we were inspired at the Ouija board Museum the board Museum to go ahead and continue our our Salem episodes up to Gallows hill with a homemade wit board we make our own witch boards man so the Moon is almost full and we decide we need to go to one of the most haunted places in Salem I love it now we did find the place where people were actually hung and we went to the place where people are rumored to be hung and we [ __ ] around and find out we definitely [ __ ] around and find out you know we tried to be a little careful maybe we were a little too careful actually I think we were over cautious I think I I I think that we might have been a
