have you ever heard the phrase sh no should I have what's that mean I'm frightened I feel like it's Voodoo Le means let the good times roll and it's a saying that's very popular in New Orleans particularly around marra if I can spit that out you're all good Let the Good Times Roll we're going to have to talk in a few minutes about beads and boobies because I need to figure that out too I know every all of our listeners want to hear about beads and boobies just as much as ghosts who doesn't love beads and boobies right it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 57 of the stoned which is our if you're looking for a podcast with ghostly stories evildoers from history and mysteries from Beyond the Grave mixed with some witchy Good Vibes and a metric ton of super chronic hydroponic Crystal coated ganja then you're in the right place with the spookiest Cemetery stories and the stickiest of buds I'm Leila I'm shell and I'm impressed with that intro you I wish you all could see Shell's impressed face because I'm super impressed with that right now well this is my super high face so maybe that's how I got through that tongue twister of an intro you know I don't I don't mean to jump right in but I am so excited today to talk about weed I'm excited for the whole episode today not only about the weed we're smoking but Orleans everything yes Le sayto let the good times roll so let's get rolling with this episode what the [ __ ] are you smoking speaking of rolling so I went to a different store I was in a p cheated on Happy Valley well yeah I had some problems I had some problems this week that involved for of you listeners from the New England area my issues this week involved the Massachusetts State Police in the RMV what shell are you a fugitive from the law um I I was was apparently because we're not going to slam Geico we love Geico we love their little Geico than their little Geico commercial but they didn't tell the RMV about my insurance change and I had to have some conversations with the state troopers oh no that got me off course and I didn't make it to Happy Valley that day I ended up at a different store and I saw something that I've never seen before this almost like sounds like Dorothy in cannabis Valley or something right you know the the house falls on the witch hey and I open up to a different store some of these stores have like this is gonna sound funny but like a 50% off bin I love me a good sale a 50% off bin I would be right there so you know I'm gonna still get some regular good old goodie goodies but I'm also eyeing that 50% offin well yeah the 50% off bin gives you the extra cheddar to get the goodie goodies right so this little bad boy actually folks this is Instagram worthy so this will be going up in a day or so I got me a whoa oh wow it's a pre-roll but this thing is an eighth I wish you could see me right now shell in her video is holding up a joint that is bigger than her freaking head no this isn't a joint it's a cone pre-roll and it's very very large I wouldn't even call this a joint I'd call this like a cigar that's big they sell it in a cigar tube that looks like a wake and bake of Epic Proportions to me well the funnier part is so I almost called it the breed you want to know the breed of my weed it is it's called Sunday driver oh I've heard of that I am going to have to go on a Sunday drive just to smoke this whole damn thing question is it spelled Sunday s u n d AE because that's how I've seen it most often Sunday driver let's see here give me a second to read the fine print here oh I didn't even know this yeah like a sunde like a ice cream cone n a e yep that's what I've noticed most times that particular cultivar is spelled like a Sunday like an ice cream sunday even though the phrase is Sunday driver you know it says Sunday driver and then it's got H in parentheses bat 3.5 grams so it's a Sunday driver bat because you know the thing is as big as a baseball bat nice nice it is a 1 18 cone pre-roll that is beautiful you know you know what's even more beautiful what's that I'm gonna be smoking it by myself wow sh but I will say this is definitely a party role well I'd say that's a you and me and and a one night of good conversation role but the thing is is that it was $25 so essentially not bad essentially you're getting an eighth for $25 and you know I'm down with that I am too I got two other really good things as well I got another 50% off this was 30 for an eigh but in a regular container um this snow dog interesting I have never heard of snow dog before but here's one I haven't opened this one yet I am I'm going to be partaking in this one later today this was the you know how you know you get out of the 50% off bin and then you get you get a a tin of good so this was my tin of good it's called 413 raspberry bino okay also never heard of that but with raspberry it's spelled with Z's so it's r a z z b r r y so that's pretty typical of a of a cult ofar name well I want to know what you're smoking and then I know last episode we talked about about talking about this and we're going to talk about this so I want to hear what you're smoking and then I want to talk a little briefly about reading labels oh yes yes I am some smoking some gelato 42 o you love your gelato what's 42 is that the meaning of life 42 is the meaning of life the universe and everything as told in the hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy so gelato 42 is the gelato that is the be all and end all I'm guessing it's pretty good it's not as fabulous as some other cultivars of gelato that I've had before I believe there are other numbers of gelato so there's like a gelato 31 a gelato 45 so this must just be you know the number 42 of this particular cultivar that someone it reminds me of that weed I got that was numbered that I had to vote on yeah exactly it's more than likely something like the the grandpa cookies that you voted on that's what it was Grandpa cookies yep so this particular is anywhere between 17 to 27% THC that's quite a range it is quite a range and again that's really going to depend on the genetics of what you get and just because it's called gelato 42 here doesn't mean that it's going to be exactly the same as the gelato 42 that you get somewhere else we're still in the wild west of cultivars right now which is why shell is going to talk about we're going to talk about the labeling because the the Cannabis I'm smoking right now has no labeling it's Tech teally not Black Market but more like gray Market weed it's a little bit on the side you know it's from another grower it's someone that I I know and trust well so it's not illegal but I guess we technically can't anyway we're not going there but anyway so this is was from someone else so I doesn't have all the testing that something that you would get from a dispensary will have so even though the name might be gelato 42 I don't know what exactly what I'm getting in this particular butd until it's been tested and labeled like what shell has right there but is it a good is it a good smoke though it is it's very tasty it has some light purpley like most gelato cultivars will have there'll be some purple in that coloration um and I believe that's from its parentage some of that indicia heavy parentage but it also has a very sweet taste and it's a very upad high I feel it first in my eyes and then I start to feel very Smiley very chatty so it it's one of my favorite cultivars for that reason it's usually very tasty no matter what variet iety of gelato I get and regardless of whether it's a lower end THC or higher the different Tarpin and blend that I get with it gives me a nice consistently good Buzz every time so far today I've been smoking the snow dog that was the one I got I love that name that's that's such a creative name I can't say that I'm blown away I mean weed is weed as weed as weed I'm not going to deny anything sure this one's not particularly impressive am not blown away like almost to the point where I don't even want to discuss it I'm so underwhelm underwhelmed but I mean it's weed you know you're getting a buzz you're getting okay but I can't say this is like oh my God let me spend 20 minutes talking about snow dog because that ain't gonna happen but yeah that's like Shell's worst thing she's like yeah I don't want to talk about it anymore it's just not even that great it's just weird I just want people to know at least I'm honest but like honestly the stuff I had from a friend of a friend of a friend last week was probably the same as this starbot snow dog gotcha but I want to get into some of these labels for a second because this can be confusing like for someone like Lea she knows all this [ __ ] and she just oh let me read a label okay I know what that means and then you get shell who's like I don't [ __ ] know just give me something good this GNA give me hi there you go all right what have we got here we're goingon to start with this snow dog just because it's got bigger print and I can read it first of all you got people smoking weed we're Stoners okay so you're gonna put this in micro print who is reading this the elf with the big magnifying glass like who I think they just count on people to not read it to be honest I really think they do so first of all thca when someone says what's my THC content okay is that is that the a because I got another that says it has a triangle in a nine and then a dash THC what's the difference which one's the THC okay they're both the THC different forms of THC so THC doesn't start out exactly as THC so thca is the acid form it's tetrah hydroc canab acid and so that's basically the precursor of THC when you get most buds or any type of product that's made from it like your butter or your shatter or your diamonds what have you usually that is something that has come from a plant that has been dried and cured or has been processed in some way and that process usually involves a little bit of heat drying a plant or using heat creates a process called decarbox and what that does is it takes one carbon molecule away from the THC and it turns that from the thca and turns that into THC the THC can is what can get you high that's the actual psychoactive part of the plant the thca does not react in your body the same way Delta 9 is like the most abundant form of THC it's another type of of tetra hydr canabidol Delta 9 is the most abundant form of it in the plant there's also Delta 8 and Delta 10 which are other forms and that's why you'll see that triangle the triangle stands for Delta and sometimes you'll see the okay sometimes you'll see the number on the inside of that triangle to mean like Delta 9 Delta 8 Delta 10 and that'll tell you what those different types of cannabis so Delta 9 again if you eat it you can feel high and if you smoke it you will also feel high so it's the more activated form of THC as opposed to THC a which is not yet activated what activates thca heat actually so if you dry a plant a little bit of heat action happens there as you dry and cure a plant and that activates some of the acids which then are fully acted when you light your bowl I gota if you eat a dried flour you'll get a little bit High because only a little bit of that thca has been activated into a Delta 9 THC so with this one with this snow dog it says thca 24.0 4 Delta 9 THC is 1.7 so if I were to eat this I'd really probably only be getting the 1.7 that's correct because that's the only activated currently portion of that cannabis most likely from the drying process once you hit a lighter to it or put it it through a heat press or if you decarb it what's commonly called decarbing by breaking it up and putting it on like a tray and putting it into a very low oven or microwave or then I'll get that 24% that's correct then that low heat will activate the acid and turn that thca into your Delta 9 THC and then it's activated and your body can process it either by eating it or smoking it the thing also is is that different brands different stores everybody labels things different in a different way because this snow dog this is by Burk Shear Roots signature um probably a weed store out in the birk shears that make their own but they've got cbda CBD CBN CBG t a TC they've got Camen okay lonol I can't even tell you all the stuff on here and I don't know what any of this means okay let's break some of that down this is going to be a much longer episode if we break all of it down it's going to be super long but anything with the E the lonol the camp that you mentioned at the end campine terpinolene lolu garol those are all what's called tpin those are what give the flavor and some of the active effects to the cannabis plant the uh CBG and the CBN and the CBD those are all other active compounds of the plant the CBD everyone has kind of heard of because you can have that quote unquote legally it comes from the hemp plant it's separate from THC it's yet another active compound in the cannabis plant that's good for you it's very highly anti-inflammatory so it it helps a great deal with any pain that's associated with inflammation and so people will take that specifically for headaches for Stress and Anxiety which can cause inflammation in the body for aches and pains I take it when I have fibroid inflammation it's absolutely amazing for pain reduction so sometimes people will want more of that in their cannabis because they're smoking for different reasons the same thing it with the tpin not only will they give a different flavor like you might want to look for ones that well this has something in it called lemon lemon so the you would want to look for things that have lemoning because you really like that lemon flavor of like the Super Lemon Haze it's very high in lemon lenol is good for people who need anti-inflammatory and sleep I believe but different tpin can have different effects as well as different flavors the same thing goes for the other ingredients if you want something that's for more for pain management and you really don't want to get very high you can actually get a higher THC content cannabis as long as it has an equally High CBD ratio because the C BDS will counteract the high effect of the THC so even if you have a very high THC cannabis if it has also a high CBD you won't feel as high but you will still get the therapeutic effects of the THC and the CBDs in that plant now let me ask you this is this T is that the thca and the tc9 combined kind of basically what that is it just means T T AC which is total active cannaboids so that means the the full amount of of the the total total total of t total total total everything that's going to give you some type of psychoactive THC response in whatever form it's in they're going to add that up under Tac if you're going to dumb this down to Shell terms basically when I'm looking at a label all I really need to care about is Tac no [Laughter] no shell does want Tac but you also want to look at CBDs if you're going to be using it for back pain you want a higher CBD if you're just smoking it to be couch locked look for lower CBD and higher THC if you want some of those good flavors you're going to want to look for the lemones for that nice up flavor if you like the pine taste you're going to look for the pining uh linol is more of the lavender you know the floral tastes right and there's tons of them we can't go over all of them here but if you can look and find what the different flavors and effects are that you like and then you can start to go for them um I got one more question about labels and then we can we can go back to our ghost stories I got this container right Coast Revolution from insa on their label they stick to the TAC THC the CBD stuff but down at the bottom total Turin so for this raspberry budino they've got total tpin 2.21 what does that mean to me because I know you talk about Tarpin all the time Tarpin again are the lenol and the the lemon and the the pining that we were just talking about those are more flavors but they also contribute in some way to the Entourage effect of all these different things all these different chemicals in the plant work together to help benefit you in a myriad different ways and so not only do these different tping give you flavor and taste they also give you benefits like we were saying some of them will give you a little bit more of an up high and some of them will give you a little bit more of a a mellow relaxed or sleepy high so if you're looking for cannabis to work for depression or to work for pain or Crohn's disease whatever you're using it for there's a different Entourage of ingredients that's going to be best for you and you'll need to probably do a lot of Internet research or talk to your bud tender talk to your doctor hopefully they're knowledgeable but there is a whole Entourage of effects and so the tarpine content will just mean how flavorful it is and which Tarpin will will give you different effects and different flavors can you just talk real quick about the inconsistencies of labeling in your opinion on that because I got three different products here with three different types of labels that give three different types of information like is there any consist y coming down the pike or are we just winging not yet not yet right now we are still at the mercy of the Wild Wild West and that is true everywhere from old legalization States like California to new ones relatively like Massachusetts New York and everything in between unfortunately every single testing facility will have different things they test for there is no regulation right now basically they just need to know THC content and CBD I'd have to look that up so anything else is really just at the the discretion of the grower and whether their particular lab that does their testing provides it I think it is important we should start to get to know what these are because you and I used to rely on the name of something to know it's parentage but I don't know what the [ __ ] a snow dog is I don't know what that means but if you come if you come at me with White Widow you're speaking my language right but nowadays with everybody and their brother and sister backyard growing right it could be called a white widow and it might have no genetic relationship at all to White widows that we what we know is White Widow yeah exactly regulation has its pros and cons and I do think some testing is good because it is good to know what's going to work for you if if you're trying to smoke it for some type of issue and also shell like we've talked in the past you've smoked very low THC cannabis that gave you an amazing kick you in the face high and you've smoked high THC cannabis was kind of meh exactly and the the reason is because of the other chemicals that are in that bud that have an Entourage effect with the THC content and so you'll get different effects and so you might want to look for that and for that reason I like the testing but until we get some type of Regulation and some type of uniformity you're just going to kind of have to guess so pretty much at the moment I just want to know the THC content that's going to get me high some CBD content to make my back feel better and the rest I don't know what it means so I don't care for now if you're lucky ask your butt tender hey what's going to get me the most high or what's gonna make me forget that my back hurts like a [ __ ] well hopefully they can help you yeah no actually they're they're pretty good around here about that most bug tenders are are relatively knowledgeable and you know they'll hey what are you looking for today what can we do for you and I'll be like look my back hurts and I got some [ __ ] to do but I want to be high and I want to be able to do my [ __ ] and not have my back hurt but I need to function and they'll like oh we got something for you and I'm like all right yep talk to your butt tender talk to somebody else who smoked it listen to us we've talked about a lot of different things well I appreciate you kind of disseminating some of this stuff for me because I don't I just look at it and I'm like H I don't know sure anytime you know I love to talk about weed for all of our listeners out there if you've got label questions email us at The ston Witches Hour gmail.com and I probably don't know the answer Lea M direct them all to attention Leila and I will happily help you out if you want Shell's opinion we'll get that too but it'll be more whether don't smoke that [ __ ] or yeah smoke that [ __ ] yeah man okay I have actually before we get too much further I do have one more order of business I just can't believe there's pre-roll that pre-roll is amazing so while you spark up that pre-roll I'm going to bring up some bad news about our podcast so we've had a couple people email us and one listener in particular now she gave us her full name and I'm not going to say it I'm just going to say what she signed off with she should know who she is so Sparkles witch emailed us and she not only has a story but a criticism oh you know it happens and it's so okay and I don't even know what you're going to say and I'm just going to say it's okay it's okay it's okay it is we can't be right all the time it happens this time thankfully it wasn't me haha I was gonna say it was me wasn't it so Sparkles witch wrote in and said I was listening to your most recent episode and I was so excited that you covered one of my favorite haunts Ashmore Estates and then she goes on to say I am sorry but I did want to correct Ashmore Estates is actually about 3 hours south of Chicago so I guess we said it was an hour well you know I look at Maps so much that I feel like when I look at a map that an inch is like a half hour and I looked at the map and it looked like it was only like an inch I know shell you're just terrible do you feel suitably chassen I'm sorry my geography has been off a little bit she says it is about an hour from champ pain however so maybe we got confused there I don't know where that is either I don't either but you know what Sparkle witch I think you should invite us out to your house and hang out with you so you can show us how far away it is oh that would be awesome she loves our podcast she loves learning about Cryptids my queen crypted and she also Ador orbs so she loves us both I'm sure and she's a fellow witch who enjoys all things paranormal and cannabis so she's our people she is our people and she is going to end up being our our our geography person because obviously I'm not good at it now I'm going to tell you quickly her story from Ashmore Estates because she had a spooky experience oh my God so she has a story from where we did a story she does you know read this read this read this I got to hear this excited okay she says she had an experience one night while driving past there she says she was on her way back to Charleston and she thought she saw someone looking through a window on the top floor of Ashmore state I hope she slammed on the brakes right then and there she says her spookiest experience however was she went on an overnight flashlight tour there with a group of friends jealous jealous now she says it was one of the coldest nights of the year on a full moon and they agreed they were going to be 100% sober no smoking no drinking or anything and no one was to talk about what they experienced until the very end I like that we should do that sometimes we should no one speak a word until we're done oh I like that she said that um as soon as she stepped on the property she could feel the energy in the place that's kind of like that witchiness about her where she just knows that she's in some Spooktacular location exactly sensitiv seem to be drawn to Witchcraft and we can definitely feel when a place has some type of energy going on right and she felt it there for sure kudos to her for feeling it and keeping on going right so that goes to your question as to whether the haunts and the energy is still there because this sounds like it was fairly recent and it sounds like yeah no I want to go I'm jealous yeah so she says they all crammed into the entrance where the staircases are and she was kind of tucked back into a corner while the guide told the story of the building and she had done a bunch of research so she was only kind of half paying attention and looking up and down the hallways she says she was snacking on some Smarties which totally sounds like you we'd be on a tour somewhere and shelle would be pulling food out of her jacket out of places you don't even know she's got want some M&M's exactly so just like you she's snacking on some Smarties when she saw several shadow figures oo staring out from the corners of the lower level again not surprised that she's sensitive to that kind of thing right right now she looked up the stairs and she said the whole stairs in the Upper Floor were covered she said lots more shadow people and she says she didn't know how to describe it but she felt curious energy from the spirits I feel like the way she's starting to describe it I'm visualizing some like crowded Hall full of ghosts right it seems like that hey anybody here we can talk to hey what's up welcome to the party now again it seems almost like a party haunt much like the the ghost at the cemetery in Salem that you talked about and the ghost at the Union Cemetery more Curious right and wanting to interact rather than scary the Curious ghosts she says she even felt them tug on her jacket more than once and no one was close enough to her to do that and everyone was enthralled with the guide so it was not one of her friends but she kept feeling someone tug on her jacket one of her friends then turned to her and asked if she had tugged on the friend's jacket so sparkle one of sparkles witch's friend said hey did you tug on my jacket remember when I talked about the Ashmore states there are children ghosts there because they took in children that were orphans and such and weren't they on the lower floors yep so they actually were probably encountering some of these children ghosts she continued to see shadow people and when the owner spoke she said she saw a very tall shadow figure with a top hat like a big top hat looming behind the owner and she said the owner himself was a very tall man so the shadow itself had to be at least 6' 7 to 6'8 tall damn he said her hand started to tremble a bit as she could feel the rage coming off of this Shadow she said uh once the owner left the building the shadow left too and she didn't see it again so they started the tour at the lower level and she kind of tailed behind eating her candy shell and she kept hearing giggles and a and small shadows out of the corner of her eye and she kept feeling tugs on her clothing she's dropped some Smarties for The Ghost and caught up to the group hell yeah give an offering and she believes that the ghost that was kind of giggling and playing with her was Elva and some of her other friends had experiences with her then as well oh the little girl that got burned exactly so you were exactly right when you said you felt that it was the children's Spirits that's what she felt as well and she said they did the tour wasn't very long so they didn't get to explore very much she did have another experience near the boiler room she was going to follow the rest of the group down but again she was the very last one to go down and right before she went down even though she was the last one in the group she felt a hand on her right shoulder and Heard a Voice say I wouldn't go down there if I were you I got the chills from that when you're a witch and a ghost says that you turn your ass around okay let your you let your friends go and you're like yeah no I gotta go see you the one time I was going up the staircase in my father's house and I reached the corner where that man had hung and I Heard a Voice say yes I immediately said nope and turned around and went right back out of the house because that's what you do okay did Sparkle witch listen to the ghost or did she keep going no Sparkle Witch is smart she's our people she she got going didn't she she said okay I'm staying here and did not go down a few minutes later one of her friends from the group uh screamed oh hell no I just saw a face and ran back to where Sparkle witch was standing pale and spooked [ __ ] around and find out she heard that same voice say told you the rest of the tour she says she felt like she was being watched most likely because we were yeah so she ends her lovely email by saying so you both definitely should do an overnight stay if you're in the area please do not hesitate to reach out if you would like a central Illinois witch to join you I'd love to go back with a few actual fellow witches and if you need good food stay recommendations reach out we love a good Hostess and she's going to point us in the direction of the best local snackies shell does she know you snack I love s so much does she know us or what now sparkit okay just on a on a personal level between you and me Lea and I if we can get our asses out to Illinois the three of us bring some friends because we're going we are so going down orb photos EVPs Shadow People all of it we're doing it all we're we might even bring a Ouija board and [ __ ] around and find out I I I just would need to find enough time off of my day job to get my ass to Illinois but if I can if I can pull that off Lea and I are down for that please send your donations to our patreon that does not yet exist yeah we need to start like a patreon send Lila and shell on ghost hunts you know there's a lot of places in Illinois I feel like that whole freaking State's haunted yeah we're scared of that whole state so I would love to go visit but we're scared of you guys I'm in Massachusetts now we were both in New York they're pretty haunted places I ain't scared of New York and Massachusetts frightened of Illinois Illinois yeah who thought so far that's my most scary State I'd have to say it definitely is the top scary States but this week we're celebrating it was just Fat Tuesday Marty gr is in full swing down in Louisiana and especially in New Orleans it is and you know I I love the parades I love watching the people on their porches throw the bead okay in the boobies not going to lie who doesn't love all of it it's like a celebration of life it's one last wild fling before everybody gets locked down for Lent I like that locked down for Lent well kind of kind of seems like that from all the Christians I know just to kind of Dive Right In here because you know this is probably gonna be one of those longer episodes folks yeah how could we pick a place we couldn't even both pick a place the whole whole City's haunted the whole place is haunted like every single inch of that city has got Vibe like some tour guides have said everything is built on bodies the whole place is a swamp land and they buried people everywhere and when they needed to use land that was dry enough to build on sometimes it was Cemetery Land he says my house has got bodies underneath it the Walmart has bodies underneath it this street has bodies underneath it you know the whole place is just haunted from top to bottom and I don't think that really the general population realized that until after Hurricane Katrina when some of that Devastation happened and those those bodies resurfaced that's true but I think the biggest thing people don't realize about New Orleans is exactly what you said it is literally built on bodies and how many times have we talked about Place Association mhm exactly something happens in that land or something happened to those people and that energy stays there so I got this place this is another place that I think would be so cool to visit I looked into the Sultan's Palace oh I think part of the reason was it sounded very Royal to me the Sultan's Palace so much does in in New Orleans I love it it's so extravagant in so many ways and you know this might sound like one of the many hot spots in New Orleans I wouldn't say it is so now but in the in the 19th century it kind kind of was a hot spot not necessarily a club or a bar per se but it was home to a Turk who traveled the world and spent a whole lot of his life partying like a rock star AR sounds like fun yeah like this guy it was normal for him to have all night parties and this was you know long before New Orleans was kind of considered one of the best party cities in the world um but this guy would have like these allnight shind digs and just literally party like The Rock sorry well somebody has to be like the first partyer of the Party City right but there was some problems there as you can imagine oh no they say that out of all of the haunted places in The Big Easy I love that they call New Orleans The Big Easy and and we'll have to we'll have to touch on why that is in a few minutes but they say out of all the haunted places in The Big Easy this just might be one of the most haunted of them all the most haunted you say you know it's like world famous roast beef in Massachusetts you're all world famous here people does it I think we we ascertained last episode that does it have a gates to hell it does not oh no bad okay strike one does it have a crypted or a demon no oh no strike two oh goodness shell what does it have to be the claim to the most haunted it meets neither of our criteria mass murder okay that helps so the Sultan's Palace was originally known as the gardette LA Pratt house I hope I'm saying that right I have no clue I speak zero French and it was owned by a wealthy businessman named Jean Baptist lapr who was of Creo descent so his business had fallen on hard times and he had to sell the home um in order to keep his personal finances in order that's sad he ended up selling to a mysterious traveler again love mysterious Travelers I myself aspire to be a mysterious traveler exactly so he ended up selling it to a mysterious traveler who had come over from Turkey in search of living the good life in the USA don't we all and this guy's name was suan I love that it was Suliman who claimed to be a prince from a Turkish royal family well back then I'd claimed to be a [ __ ] princess why not who's going to tell me no but the real deal was is that yes he was a prince from a Turkish royal family but he was the brother of a sultan who had banished him from the kingdom and and stripped any official title that would tie him to the royal family so he was a prince but his family was like Deuces you're not going to say you're a prince because you're pissing us off because of the Civil War raging at the time and the bad economy because you got to figure this is mid 1800s so the Civil Wars raging economy's crap so Mr leet was at the point of desperation where he pretty much just had to sell it to anybody who would make an offer because he was that desperate so leatt ended up selling the home to suan lepra ended up leaving town Suleman was settled in and ready to bring his party to the town cuz this was in an area called the French Quarter um I'm sure everybody's heard of the French Quarter in New Orleans but that this this home this place um was in that French Quarter area so this guy just all of a sudden wanted to bring these parties and he started having like servants come in he really kind of created a royal life so to say in there okay so like recreated that lavish Royal lifestyle right and because you know even though he was basically told you can't say that you're the prince and turkey but we'll give you a bunch of money and send you off so he loaded loaded he had many artifacts and treasures that were worth a fortune and because he was so rich he was able to Captivate the attention of the locals who are you know who wanted to know this mysterious party guy living inside the home that once belonged to a struggling businessman so okay those who were listen to this I need to do this those who were allowed to set foot on the steps were only allowed to leave gifts and other riches for Suliman himself wow set up for like people to just leave you offerings how do you how do you get that gig and check this out this is another thing so the house is situated at 7 716 dolphin um and that's where the parties were ongoing from the outs side you could smell the scent of opium filling the air and there were daily deliveries of gold on the doorstep and that was totally Common Place wow like it sounds like you had like an opium Dem going on in there well you think maybe on a night like every other at the Sultan's Palace because that's what they called it he had another one of us parties and the weather outside was pretty bad there was a nasty storm battering the city so a lot of the folks in New Orleans were you know trying to be inside making the best of it there was a local man they partied all night long had a great night the following morning a local man was passing through the French quter and he noticed now there was nothing no one because of the storm again everybody was kind of staying inside in the city there wasn't a lot of traffic out on that traffic it's not like they had cars but like you know there wasn't a lot of hustle and bustle going on outside everybody was in for the the night so nobody really noticed anything weird so following morning local man passing through the French Quarter area noticed a trail of blood coming from the Sultan's Palace oh no that do not bode well he notified the police so the police go to the Sultan's Palace all of the revelers from the party were dead no many of them were slashed to death by what appeared to be bladed weapons oh wow nasty hey this is giving me Manson Vibes the so-called Sultan was nowhere to be found uhoh suspect number one no Legend says that the sultan might have been kidnapped and buried somewhere alive oh no that's terrible why did he make a bad business deal or something well you got to figure you know the guy has been opium right yeah I mean a drug lord ultimately good point good point so no suspect no Witnesses come forward a lot of conspiracy theories now you got to remember in New Orleans you know right on the water there were some conspiracies that pirates had landed discovered the Sultan's Palace and plundered it suppose that's also possible pirate activity was pretty high took all the riches out of the house yep and basically they took all of the riches and gold and you know leave no Witnesses other rumors say that suliman's brother the real sultan may have enlisted soldiers to assassinate him for being such a disappointment to his family damn so there is the thought that maybe someone was sent from Turkey to kill him but yeah that party came to an abrupt and bloody end on a wild and stormy night suliman's body never found never found never found I suppose he could have killed everyone in some sort of Rampage and then just took off right right because you know again like we talked about in many other stories you could just appear who the hell is going to know yeah he changed his name and moved Two Towns over now as you can imagine over the years because it's probably been what 150 years 175 years the home's undergone some Renovations and changes in own ownership but it has long been recorded hauntings being a regular occurrence there I bet mysterious mass murder yeah see but that's the weird thing like there's so many theories and they just don't know this is like a cross haunting and like True Crime actually it really seems it yeah they see sightings of man dressed in Middle Eastern garments appearing on the walls so that kind of makes it seem like they're seeing the ghost of the of the the Suliman being in the Middle Eastern garments um they hear Phantom noises like screaming and shrieking on some occasions people have heard sounds that sound like body parts hitting the floor oh damn oh that sounds awful local resid St report hearing Chimes going off and smelling different incenses that might have been burning because as you can imagine if this guy was was um a Turkish Prince they were very deep into incense aromatic things well yeah and if there's smoking opium like you and I both know smoke a lot of pot burn a lot of incense right smoke a lot of opium burn a lot of incense maybe they've seen a man with dark colored hair peering out the windows is it as he's looking towards the French Quarter area only to disappear later they actually now it is private condos I want to buy a condo in this place it has gone back and forth between being a private residence um at one point it was like a boarding not really a hotel of sorts but more like a boarding house at one point it was owned by the New Orleans Academy of Art most residents recall um seeing the sight of a dark figure moving around when people frantically turn lights on the dark figure disappears they cannot find you know it's not like there's someone there doing it this place is uh not open to the public for ghost hunting by the way bumer you'd probably have to know someone that lived there yeah private private condos so this isn't a place that that you can show up but basically it's like people will go to go to bed at night and they'll fall asleep to what sounds like partying and they'll be woken up to screaming and like these thumps like I said like body like body parts hit in the ground that's not funny in my mind all I'm thinking remember you know the the Turkish back then the the the Turks sometimes would have those big long kind of like half moon shaped swords yeah like a scimitar that's what it's called all I can think of is someone just going through this party hacking people with one of those and like an arm hits the floor a leg hits the floor someone's head gets chopped off and hits the floor yeah because that's what that's what a lot of the the sounds that people are hearing are is is again like like body parts thumping on the ground yeah there has been some residents that have awoke in the middle of the night and they say that their nostrils are just filled with a scent of blood um but they have not had bloody noses there's no blood on their pillows they're not bleeding from anywhere but they just got this overwhelming smell of blood oh that's terrible that's nasty way to wake up I think it's a place I want to live we'll just burn a lot of incense but they do think that the sultan is still there roaming the Halls some people say that they think when he's looking out the window that he's actually looking for his Killers ooh maybe maybe well he wouldn't be the first person who was killed away from a place that they loved that haunts the place where they lived not where they died right but I also heard one little rumor that stated that there was a possibility that all of the bodies were buried in the basement they didn't have anywhere else to put them maybe sulaman was just chopped up into so many small parts that they just didn't know he was there mixed in with the other ones but my curiosity is the blood dripping down the street was somebody's body dragged out did one of the killers get hurt and blood is they flood like where' this Blood smear come from somebody walked away from that Massacre I imagine that the person who did it or people who did it would be so covered in blood I mean if you're hacking off body parts you're going to be pretty bloody although I'm thinking 1800s and you've pissed off some Turkish royalty they could have needed to like chop off his head and like the only way the brother in Turkey would have believed that They carried out their mission was bring me my brother's head well that would certainly leave a trail of blood down I think that's probably the most plausible I think you know what I'm saying his head kind of thing I think you HD that theory on the head no pun intended so the Sultan's Palace it's it's got a bloody history but unfortunately do not go there private residence no go no go but if you do live there email us at the stoned Witches Hour gmail.com and tell us of your experiences we'd love to hear them so I I think it's a very cool location not a lot of present day stories due to the fact that it's private residence I don't know actually if I'd want to go to this one because it sounds like those are gross ghost stories you know that sounds terrifying and disgusting it yeah it it's definitely Mass murdery yeah no this one I'm staying home you can go if we find someone who lives there this one sounds too gross for me it's a little too much Manson ask I don't like it I think the turnoff for me on this particular one actually is I don't want to wake up to the smell of blood what the hell no the sound of body parts hitting the floor what does that even sound like how would you even know that that's what you were hearing why would you who sits there you know what that sounds like body parts hit in the ground okay what's your frame of reference just saying than you exactly we need to know we would really no actually I don't want to know never mind on second thought I don't want to know how they knew that this is I think a prevalent thing with all of the some of the ghosty stuff down in New Orleans it was a Party City it was on the water so there was there was Maritime trade in the potential for pirates the potential you mean literal Pirates my favorite Jean laat even uh has a bar there so yeah literal Pirates I mean the place was hopping there was a lot going on and the cemetery that I'm talking about today is St Louis Cemetery number one which is the oldest Cemetery in New Orleans in Louisiana I believe what what what does that date back to out of curiosity was established by Spanish Royal Decree on August 14th 1789 and it's the oldest cemetery that can be visited oh wow no wait the oldest cemetery that can be visited does that mean there's an older one that can't be visited I think that's referring to the possibility of older familial plots oh okay I gotcha but the St Louis cemetery is at 425 Basin Street and it is closed to the public families are allowed to go there and they have special passes in order to get in at any time if you have family buried there is that just because it's so old and they want to keep it kind of preserved for yeah when I was there um I think it was 2014 when I I was there prior to 2015 when they closed the cemetery and you could just walk through and and look at it but as of 2015 they closed it to regular visitors you can only go in if you pay for an approved tour oh wow I mean that's not a bad thing the tour guides there are usually fantastic they have a wealth of information so this cemetery is beautiful it has the raw Iron Gate I don't know if you're familiar with the way they bury people in Louisiana no basically most people are familiar with you know you you dig a whole six feet down and you put your coffin in right right well Louisiana is all swamp land when they tried to bury coffins in the swamp they'd rise right back up to the surface that's creepy yeah they tried things like putting stones on top of them drilling holes in the coffin but as soon as the water level would rise they'd come right back up out of the ground what they would basically do is they would build up some of the more sturdy swamp land with brick tons and tons of brick and stone and seashells I guess and then on top of that they built mums big tall Square sometimes most times big tall Square little Cemetery buildings that they would put a person's coffin in usually there was room for one to three of them depending on how wealthy your family was after one or two years they would take the coffin out transfer the remains into a bag that would then go back into the Crypt at the back and they would destroy the coffin and that way there was room for the next family member who passed away to get into the Crypt that's kind of creepy just saying yeah and so these CPS can hold uh this Cemetery holds well over a 100,000 bodies because holy [ __ ] how big is this it's not very big it's not very big at all are they just like stacked on top of each other they are stacked up on top of each other and again it's big enough it's like a little Crypt a little tiny building that's big enough for a casket to go into or big enough for three caskets to go into stacked on top of each other think of like a piz piz oven oh God so if there wasn't room like if the year or two years had not passed and they couldn't take the body out and then reenter it in a bag they had these like waiting ovens in the wall bag wait wait wait in a bag yes they take the coffin with the body out after the two years is up transfer the remains to a bag and then that bag is put back into the Crypt without the coffin without the coffin and the coffin is then destroyed I was going to say what you passing that on you reusing that I don't think so what a waste so they're kind of falling apart most of them are brick and then they're covered over in Limestone and a lot of the older ones again this is an over 300y old liones come off not on all of them this is still a modern-day Cemetery people are still buried here so you'll see them in various states of disrepair but like this one here you can see is fresh and has nice Limestone on it but some of them are crumbling into disrepair there's beautiful statues and not only is this Cemetery home to ghosts and some famous residents of New Orleans it's also home to the Future grave of a very famous person I love this person this has been my celebrity crush since I was a teenager so do tell this cemetery is home to the Future grave of none other than Nicholas Cage who absolutely loves New Orleans cuz who buys themselves a crypt long before their death other than Nicholas Cage his is actually a pyramid it's a big white pyramid in the middle of this cemetery and it's so weird it's the only pyramid one there the rest of them are more rectangular or Square shaped and it's definitely well-kept up and I believe in the early 2000s he was making a visit to check on his pyramid future Crypt and it was covered in lipstick kisses and he didn't like the way that it looked and so he had them install this plaque on the front of it under the um I forget what it is in Latin but it it translates to from all to one and underneath that there's a little plaque put for people to kiss specifically so it keeps his pyramid looking nice so you can still buy a plot here but you can't visit or he got a plot before it closed to the public can you just still get buried here you can still get buried there it does cost quite a bit and I don't know if there's any open plots or if you would have to buy space in someone's Crypt who would sell it to you I'm not exactly sure how that would work but I do know that there are still families who as recently as last year have had people buried there wow wow some of the more famous residents like I said the future resident is Nicholas Cage but currently the most famous resident in my opinion there is Marie Lavo the voodoo queen of New Orleans we love Voodoo she has a crypt there along with her family uh her husband and her children now if you go on a tour you will go to see one of two Marie lvo Graves one of two you only got one body well there's some controversy over whether she was actually buried in her family crypt she was so there really is just one official grave but I guess some unscrupulous tour guides when the line to go see Marie lao's grave would get too long would randomly pick just this one other grave and tell people that that was Marie lao's grave now something that people like to do on Marie Lavo grave is they go to her because she was well known for granting wishes and doing spells and doing gory bags for people in the community they think that even after death she'll still continue to help people out and so what they do is they go to her grave and they Mark three X's or three crosses on the grave and ask her for a wish Legend says you mark the three X's touch the grave and then yell your wish and turn around three times and Marie Lavo will grant you your wish and if she does you have to return back to her grave within a year Circle your ex's and leave her an offering or she'll take it back wow I'd actually I I I'd feel compelled to do that I'd be afraid not to you would be right to be afraid not to because in her time she was a very well-known hoodoo root worker practitioner she was born somewhere around 1801 nobody knows for sure records weren't very well-kept at that time and because she was a mixed race woman records were even less easy to come by right now her mother was a mixed race woman who had been born a slave but her father was a a wealthy mixed race son of a land owner and a slave who was like a banker he traded properties and I don't believe that her parents ever married but she was known to be very beautiful and her younger life was pretty uneventful she had a first marriage he disappeared and later she married a wealthy Frenchman and that's about when her Legend started she kind of started out as a hairdresser this actually helped her rise to power because she would do the hair of all the Servants of the wealthy people and also the hair of some of the wealthy ladies in the area and so she heard all the gossip she knew everything that was going on in New Orleans whether you were super rich or super poor Marie laau knew and she was also known for being very kind she was actually a Catholic and practiced the Catholic faith uh which in that area does very much get incorporated into Voodoo and hudo practices and so she did very strongly believe in the Catholic practices of giving to the poor helping the sick and she did that quite a bit and one of the things she would do is uh people would come to her for spells they'd come to her for her to you know hex someone or to practice this voodoo magic for their benefit and because of this she grew to be extremely wealthy now rumor has it one of the most famous I don't know if hex one of the most famous rituals that she did uh at one time there was a gentleman whose son had kind of gotten involved in a in a mess with the law believe he killed someone now this wealthy gentleman wanted his son to get off on all of the charges and he was desperate enough that he went to Marie Lavo for help and asked her to use her voodoo magic to help his son get found innocent of these charges very often voodoo magic requires that you that you do something that causes pain and doing that pain having that suffering will bring the spirits to you and show them that you mean business that you can handle this and that they should Grant your request and she did this by using something called guinea peppers and they would get very very hot Guinea peppers and I believe they even heated them up in the fire to make them burning red hot and she would then put them in her mouth and hold these burning hot peppers in her mouth while she recited prayers and asked the spirits and the ancestors to intervene on the behalf of this gentleman the reason she did this is because he said if she could get his son acquitted of these charges he'd give her a house oh wow so she endured this for several days and at the end of this time of pleading with the ancestors she took those Guinea peppers and brought them to the judge who was providing over the case and she placed them in his Courthouse under his seat so these powerful Peppers that have been you know covered in the magic she put them under his seat and at the very next hearing the son was acquitted and she of course got her house nice some people say that it's very likely when she went to the judge's house she went there and she said hey I've talked to all the servants in your house and your wife I I know you're yeah I know what you get up to let this boy go or I talk oh and give me money right so that's entirely possible she wielded I like the pepper story better it's entirely likely that it was a combination of both she was a very powerful Priestess and a very powerful woman in her own right it she had property she had money she was feared throughout town uh she was beautiful she not only had money and property she had secrets and she had the secrets exactly and she had hoodo on her side you know I know I know we've already talked about our weed portion here um but as you tell your story and you're you're puffing off your little bong that thing is gorgeous it's beautiful by the way very cute I love it it's got a nice little spiral cooling action I like the color thank you very cute but anyway continue on so Marie Lavo is one of the people at the cemetery you can go to her grave one of the reasons it's closed is because people do vandalize her grave putting the AES her specifically her specifically but you will find these three AES all over including the possible second grave or probably false second grave of Marie Lavo is covered in the ex's and different offerings left there different sayings and multiple times they have had to take her actual Crypt and cover it over or repaint it or relim it and some [ __ ] have even gone so far as to use keys or knives to gouge A's into the tomb and I'm pretty darn sure that's going to get you some bad karma oh [ __ ] bad mojo is coming your way more than likely because she is well known for granting these wishes her power extends even after death and if you have the chance to go to her shop her original shop in New Orleans you can feel that energy there it's definitely still open it is still open there's places like that all over these old places in New Orleans every inch of that place is covered in history and ghosts and Paranormal Activity now when you were in New Orleans did you just kind of feel that Vibe everywhere yes in some places more than others including the burlesque dancer ghost I saw at a strip club but that's in a previous episode but yeah you can definitely feel it everywhere including at this Cemetery people do often see ghosts here some people say that they will see the distinctive figure of Marie laau walking around in her dress with her distinctive red turban on her hand I believe it some people say that she scratches them and I wonder why because she was known to be very kind and very nice in her lifetime probably those are the people that were trying to desecrate her grave T very well could be now there's a couple other Spirits there of people that are buried there one of them is a gentleman named Henry viges he was a sailor kind of wealthy and he had a vault uh a plot of land in this Cemetery which you know people have had for Generations one time when he was leaving to go on a sailing Voyage he had a fear a premonition that he wasn't going to make it back so he took all of his paperwork including all of his titles of property and everything and he handed them over to either a trusted friend or his landlord the stories differ maybe his landlord was a trusted friend possibly and so he gave all this paperwork over to this trusted friend and said hold on to this for me in case I don't come back and then he went off to see and didn't come back well he did make it back oh he came back only to find out that that trusted friend had sold all of his property and refused to make good on it so Henry viges died a popper and was buried in an unmarked Popper's grave in the same Cemetery where his family has a plot so people say that they will see him walking around the cemetery he's very tall and he has distinctive blue eyes dressed in a white shirt so he he looks like a gorgeous sailor with blue eyes walking around the cemetery but he'll often ask people if they trying to find his family's plot they he will he'll come up to people and ask if they know CS to the vig's plot because he's still trying to find his way back there there's another ghost that's also a very solid Apparition and this one is called alons and they're not sure how he died but he he also appears very much alive to people who have seen him he approaches people he'll shake their hand and ask for help getting home and no matter what they say he starts crying and then disappears and people say that they think he might be something may have happened with this other family that has plots there called the pad family because if he's near that Vault and people go close to the Vault he tells them to stay away from it that it's dangerous before disappearing but that's the only clue to his identity but nobody knows anything about that family or that plot no there's no many people have seen him and described the same situation and that he's afraid of the pinea family but no other information has been able to be found about him so when this really originally started anybody from any class could be buried there whether you rich or poor or or black or white or whatever yes there's family plot there's there's cemetery plots all over New Orleans and again because they had to be buried in such a unique fashion people would keep these CPS in their family and just everyone would be buried there uh so it's very common for people to have kept these Crips and and yeah anybody could have one just like in a cemetery in say Upstate New York you know you could just go and buy if you could buy one you could have one but I guess there was also like poppers plots there at one time as well although the land is worth a little too much for something like that now just ask Nick Cage I know we talked about this in a previous episode but I just wanna I want to remind people that a good fun Nick Cage fact is that at one point for like three or four years I believe it was he owned the Lori mansion that is very true and like other people who have owned the Lori mansion He didn't own it for long but we talk about that in our Lori Mansion episode yes indeed we do now one other interesting fact about Marie Lavo of which there are hundreds and we're not going to get into in this episode but she used to walk around town she was a very commanding figure she had lots of wealth lots of power and everyone loved her but one of the interesting things is she would walk around town with a snake draped around her neck and its name was Lebon zombie that's a little twisted how fun is how fun is that though did you ever find any stories about her that that were more related to her Voodoo and Magic by chance oh Lots I mean there's tons I know I know I know we're on the ghost story portion but since we were talking about her I didn't know if there was any fun facts about her witchy side there is so much uh she did not grow up learning Voodoo or hoodoo she was actually trained by a gentleman known as the voodoo King of New Orleans called Dr John and Dr John Dr John now he was quite the character himself and again we don't have time to get into all of it but he is the one who taught Marie Lavo her root workking her whoo magic and he was also well known for his Greer bags and a Greer bag is basically a magical bag that you put different items in in order to affect change in order to cast a spell very often you'll find what in modern day we just call a spell bag a spell bag yes if you are not a practitioner of the voodoo you know belief system then it's not a GRE gree bag for you but usually For Love or luck or you know to punish your enemies to move whatever spell or Charm you want to put into that creeky bag but she was well known for her charms and well known for her magic working really really really well even though some people say that she was just a good Catholic and she had a lot of Secrets you cannot deny how powerful her magic was her fortunetelling she was well known throughout the city and the state for her tarot reading for her magic potions again if if you came to her and asked her to intervene with the ancestors and with the spirits on your behalf it worked it just worked every single time she was that powerful it just was it was one of those it's like going to the doctor you go to the doctor you get it fixed it just is you go to her you get your Voodoo done it just is yep now there's a lot of stories because people you know Christians and you know your average Karen white lady who didn't like that this woman of color had all of this power and had all of this money and was practicing black magic you know people got kind of riled up about that and so there's a lot of stories about those are the same people that would go to her for their fertility rituals and to make sure that their man either loved them or was not cheating on them so like okay Hypocrites continue exactly and then you know [ __ ] at their friends over tea so yeah give me a love spell and then I'm gonna persecute you yeah exactly although most things point to that she was raised Catholic uh it's possible that through her maternal grandmother she was raised with a mix of Catholicism and Voodoo but that's so common in that area it's kind of kind of hard to tell but wherever she got it from you know she definitely had the power she had a lot of followers and they would go to um Congo Square she lived on St an with her husband and Congo square is just a short walk from her house and because people of color were not allowed to you know whether you were black Creo matat mixed race whatever they did not allow those people into white churches so she would hold services at Congo schol and those were sometimes people would say those were um they called them orgies but it very well could have just been Catholic mixed with Voodoo services that outside people didn't understand or exaggerated what they were seeing kind of like how they language wise and tradition wise they kind of merg that French Creole they kind of merged Catholicism and Voodoo it sounds like right and if she's there doing a um you know a hoodoo ritual where where she's Conjuring the Great Serpent spirit and she's holding her snake up you know and and she's being filled with Loa and wearing like all her Voodoo regalia I could see how that would look a little weird to a Catholic yeah Catholic might think that was a little outside of their experience definitely just a little just a little so but she she led a lot of those different rights she led a lot of seasonal right she was definitely a priestess of her people aside other stuff exactly exactly now she did have a daughter who was also named Marie laau and who some people say looked exactly like her and now did she do the same things is there some crossover that maybe some stories are about the mom and or the daughter that maybe are really about two different people you nailed that perfectly yes so because her daughter looked so much like her some people thought they were the same person and so this kind of perpetuated some of the stories that she was kind of an evil soul sucking witch because she stayed Young and Beautiful forever you know cuz here's Marie Lavo looks 20 years old and she should be 60 you know so that kind of perpetuated that but her daughter also followed in her Voodoo footsteps and also performed rituals and made GRE gree bags for people now it's rumored that her daughter was not as powerful and also was not as benevolent she much like your story of the sultan she was known for throwing a elaborate orgy like drug parties at her house and she did eventually get in trouble for those so her being around did kind of perpetuate some of the stories because she was a little bit um she was less kind to people she was less good at the magic and she was more known for the wild partying so the fact that her daughter had the same name and looked just like her kind of perpetuated some of the negative stereotypes that are associated with her well and that's why I'm wondering if maybe some of the more negative stories could be a cross between her and her daughter where they're really about two people and not just one very likely I think I think a big Hefty dose of it is Prejudice and misunderstanding you know they didn't know what these rituals were so you see a half naked woman with a snake dancing around a fire they don't get it and so to that whatever you don't understand is evil so I think it's a kind of a combination of both a a slightly wild daughter who has your name in face and also just the prejudices of the time but yeah Great Character very interesting and the energy in that Cemetery even around the fake Marie laau grave so many people have put their wishes and their energy and made those marks and brought their offerings to that she now shows up at that one too it's a load Stone as well there is energy in that grave there's no way that for hundreds of years people putting all that type of energy into some Marie laau is not there but people themselves had have made that Shrine powerful or maybe they were drawn to that particular Crypt because it already had some type of energy there who knows who's buried there that might be granting these wishes it's definitely an interesting spot so I would check out all of it the whole cemetery is gorgeous but like you said you have to go through a paid tour at this point to be able to visit it you do you have to go through a tour unless you happen to be a family member who has a plot there but you know they're not that expensive and the tour guides are you know they're typically really good and they have a lot of information and background facts you do get to walk around and take pictures and video you don't get to walk around freely but you get a great guide and I I don't think that's a bad trade-off now one question I just want to ask that I'm sure maybe at least one of our listeners is asking one of our five listeners you called this the the cemetery number one yes are you implying that there's a St Louis Cemetery number two I'm not implying I'm outright stating so there's one that's called number one and one that's called number two oh there's more than that they couldn't come up with like better names right yeah there's Cemetery number one Cemetery number two like Cemetery number two see that's in the French Quarter that one was established in 1823 two is on one Clayborn Avenue so yeah there's quite a few of them there's a lot of cemeteries in the area and there's different notable people buried in all of them so you can go on different tours that'll hit all of them if you want to or you can just check out one or two well I think the first thing I want to check out if I ever make my way there is is her original store yes I highly recommend it have you been there when you went there did you go there yes yeah it's fantastic the energy am I want to spend a lot of money there yes yes you will bring your money but it's a great place for sure and there's a lot of them there's a lot of them along Bourbon Street it's fantastic so it sounds like she was just quite the interesting character aside from being buried in the cemetery she was the voodoo queen of New Orleans and proved it time and time again in many different ways do people feel her anywhere other than the cemetery like at her store or at her former home um or is it really just the cemetery I did not look into her former home I know they see her at the cemetery and they do often see her at her shop or walking on the streets she again beautiful woman dress and a red turban is what people most usually describe seeing uh when they see an apparition of her but walking near her shop in the cemetery are the ones that I found mostly but I imagine that there's more other places as well one of these years I want to go to Marty gr I think it would just be super cool to just feel you've been there so you felt that Vibe I have not had the opportunity to feel that L's Vibe and I want to I was not there during marra but I was in New Orleans and it it's a wonderful time I recommend going not during Marty gr it's I was goingon to say I would imagine the vibe is like that probably even more so not during V Marty Gro yeah I'm I'm not a people or a crowd person so that type of party Vibe while a lot of fun would Tire me out pretty quickly so I much more enjoy exploring when it's less people yeah and and it's New Orleans so it's not quiet it's just not packed with people but I just think it's very Nifty and I would definitely like to experience that like it sounds like with every step you take there's like a ghost around every corner in that joint and I would feel like don't you feel like you're just like walking on people's Graves everywhere you go very much so you feel the weight of history there in a like I would have some go Factor just walking around the place definitely feels very haunted the history is there it's it's beautiful there's so much to see and feel like I said I went to a strip club and saw a ghost so you can pretty much go anywhere and see a spirit of some type I would just like to just roam the streets after dark and just see who's crawling around on the streets being all ghosty we should go we would have so much fun sh we would and and you know I'm sure I could find beads even if it isn't during Marty gr oh yeah definitely can they're everywhere so send your money to the non-existent send Lea and shell on a ghostly USA tour but you know we don't have patreon so
