it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 67 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends from way back get together to tell each other the creepiest true paranormal Tales they can find from across the USA all while smoking the stickiest stoniest sweetest cannabis they can find getting higher than the Black Hills in the bad lands of South Dakota I'm Lea and smoking the danky Dank up in New England I'm shell is danky dank a word or did I just make that up I don't know I'm pretty sure you just made that up pretty sure that's a shell ISM for sure that is that is but speaking of danky dank I uh have this really good stuff and I don't know what it's called I don't know the THC but I love it does that count for anything oh that does count so you're smoking some really good noname stuff today we're call we're gonna call this mystery weed all you need to know is that you put it in your pipe and smoke it that's all you need to know I'm taking it back to like the 1990s where you just buy a bag and what you get is what you get and you don't [ __ ] and you don't complain and you just smoke that [ __ ] and you be happy well you know if I could pay the prices I was paying in the 90s for some of that then I would do it so you got a bag of no-name weed but it's is it good I mean oh yeah oh yeah was it any cheaper than your normal stuff um the same as what I've been getting lately you know what though I'm having a problem with this particular stuff once you grind it it's like poof dry I've seen that a lot a lot lately I've actually seen on some of the different boards that I'm on people posting pictures of these dry little compact hard nugs next to their big large not so compact homegrown nugs and wondering what's going on here what is going on going miss miss horticulturist what's going on here because it seems like it gets really dry but in the same respect it is sticky as a mofo I had ground some up and put it in like this tiny little baggie it all like conformed into like one big chunk and I felt like I was breaking pieces off of it like very sticky yet very dry weird I know I can't explain it yeah we've talked before about two of the things I suspect are going on one of them is a growth hormone that can be used sometimes and it does tend to make the buds a lot denser and a lot harder and the other thing I think is more going on is I'm pretty sure it's stale weed from other states damn it yeah no wonder it was cheap more than like more than like especially if it's really dense and really dry but sticky even though it's dry it was probably once fantastic pot and now it's just stale still a good smoke yeah regulations will help but I am currently smoking let me guess gelato something or other yes gelonade too oh from your hot box from the hot box yes yes it is and I'm also smoking this blue Zushi blue Zushi what's that BL Zushi I don't know what's it smell like Fruity um yeah I don't know what that smell is it's not the best smell it's a little bit like gasoline and it's a little bit like it's gassy it's a little fruity but maybe if that fruit was like a little off I'm not sure it's it's definitely good it leans towards gassy and fruity but there's a hint of something maybe rotten fruit I'm not sure how to describe it but delicious flavor when smoked very fruity I really like it it's very Stony do those hormones like add any taste or flavor they do not okay okay they can make it harsher if you find yourself coughing more often than you think you should that might be one sign there's a couple different ways you can tell but the the denseness is one way it's they're usually super dense they'll be harsher make you cough a little bit more and I can't remember what else that's because you smoked too much weed that's cuz I smoked too much weed you smoked too much gelato and and Jack I know gelonade 2 I know has a decent THC but let's see what blue Zushi is because I've never heard of that I got it because I've never heard of it before I do that sometimes too I'll just buy something just because I'm like hey I've never heard of that and that sounds neat according to Leafly it's a hybrid made by crossing Skittles and Kush mins see now I've had a lot of the GMO Skittles and that's been pretty good but I've never had Skittles and Kush mins mixed but I've also had I've had Kush mins and that's been really good my guess is it's probably going to be pretty good yeah it's definitely good and I would say it has this slightly sweet gasoline but it tastes very sweet and very fruity I do like the taste of the blue Skittles it's very good neither of us are are smoking anything Rockstar fabulous tonight so I want to just kind of shift a little gears here quick and I want to do a grow update with you so we haven't checked in on your growing statuses lately where you at what's what you got what what's in what phase I have a lot of different cultivars going on right now I have about five different cultivars and I have some autof flowers which are Gorilla Glue number four oh I love Gorilla Glue that's really a good one it really is those are all autof flowers and I am going to start do some of those outdoors and some of those indoors and then the rest are all different types of gelato and blueberry strains and those are all photo period plants I've got a bunch of clones and and those going I have several going to different family members to be outdoor plants however my garden is not as big I had planned on doing many many many more plants but due to all the different [ __ ] that's been happening Mercury retrograde some deaths in the family unfortunately um my my plans have not reached the dreams that I wanted them to be so but it's going good it's going pretty good excellent I can't wait and let's just point out all hail Mercury going Direct thank all the gods I am so glad so glad it could not have happened soon enough was this a bad one or was it just me it was a really really bad one and I am prised that we made it through both of us had our share of [ __ ] so it's G pretty good it's not anywhere near as big as I wanted it to be or in as good a shape as I wanted it to be to be honest having a grow takes a lot of work and a lot of time and especially now that I'm doing photo period again and taking clones that's just exponentially more work and to be honest I'm not getting as much help as I kind of need and there's only 24 hours in a day seriously I've definitely bit off more than I can chew and I lost a couple plants because I'm not paying attention and I'm a little scattered and I'm stretched a little too thin right now so the garden's going okay but this whole going outside and kind of expanding to help some of the family I went a little too fast too soon and then I I hit too many roadblocks you know life and Mercury retrograde happen well and also where you're currently located isn't the best weather friendly local either no it is not I have not been growing enough to cover how much we smoke and I'm starting to get a little upset with how much we're spending on weed so I'm hoping that I welcome to what the rest of us in the world are dealing with here right like if you want to smoke good stuff that shit's pricey that's pricey and and smoking the11 to $150 ounces is great but you know it's going to be dry or it's not going to be good it's not going to have the punch that other weed is going to have so I miss my homegrown top shelf really good [ __ ] and so it's hard it's hard being pulled in a lot of different directions go back to basics two buckets at a time right that's not going to cover it shell it's six plants at a time you know I'm I'm pushing that limit and I need those six plants to be monsters really so I want to read an email that we got because I think this is I love listener emails these things are always so great this one's really funny too okay so this one comes from Karen and Karen says I'm St Louis born currently live in Arkansas and I recently got caught up on a bunch of your episodes and wanted to chime in on some things regarding the Zombie Road in Wildwood I grew up 30 minutes from there and had never heard of anything about it Wildwood is a very ritzy white suburb of St Louis so the next time I visit I anticipate being apprehended by the cops secondly in Arkansas at least a Wampus cat is a slang term for an unwashed lady flower wait wait wait wait oh oh oh I got you okay got that okay okay she says you're welcome appreciate that is hilarious now I'm gonna I'm gonna say that to somebody you know I'm gonna and I'm gonna say it in the context of this email that's Shell's new insult be like oh you Wampus cat you damn wus cat I'm gonna go Rel listen

you get how you feeling and she says finally and most importantly I've got a topic for you to to cover I thought about sending in my personal experience but so many people have had experiences here and the history is so creepy and absurd you might think about featuring it she says that topic is the Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs Arkansas although I did this actually the Crescent Hotel episode is episode 22 it's called melon head Cryptids and the snake oil salesman serial killer wow episode 22 I feel like that was a thousand years ago episode 22 very long long time ago yeah it was about that guy that con man who pretended to be a doctor and was saying he could cure people of cancer and he was really like murdering them by giving them his weird concoction she says in fact a few years ago the current owners were trying to pour a new parking lot or something and accidentally dug up a bunch of preserved human remains and the University of Arkansas archaeology Department took over the Dig which is pretty cool she said it was also a school for young ladies at some point and is currently a hotel you can stay at and she said it has a crescent move Motif which is Witchy and pretty and they have the best Sunday brunch in the Ozarks I promise it's been featured in a bunch of TV shows and it is still claiming Souls she says some dude fell off a balcony to his death just a few years ago unfortunately with our current politics Arkansas isn't a great place to be but Eureka Springs is the most unique place I've ever been and the Crescent is its Jewel y'all should visit anyway I love the show keep doing what you're doing thank you so much for emailing us Karen I hope you get to to check out our episode on the Crescent Hotel it was definitely a creepy creepy place and I'd also just

if it's work appropriate especially not this episode actually it makes me want to look up more Wampa cat Ino I am literally when we are done here going to finish smoking this bag and I'm going to go listen to that episode it's going to be hilarious all right so I'm sorry Britney happy birthday then shell she's got a message for you uh oh shell I don't know if you've ever heard of a crypted called the Kappa it is Japanese folklore I highly recommend it for the show it is hilarious and interesting to say the least the Kappa is interested in the human shirikodama which is said to hold the soul also there is a ranch in Utah called Skinwalker Ranch which we've heard of we're totally going to cover that Britney absolutely she says the History Channel is doing a show on it it has everything UFOs Cryptids you name it I'm obsessed I would love to hear y'all's opinions of Skinwalker Ranch have a wonderful evening Britney then this is the funny part she says PS and here's where I have a little bit of a problem Britney I have to say we do not have an accent I've been told Time and Time Again Britney has the accent we don't right I love Shell's on my side she doesn't even know what Britney's saying and we're we're in this together I love it right besties man besties so but Britney says PS I've never heard anyone pronounce Elementary documentary or Oregon the way y'all do gets me every time you know that's so funny Britney you're not the only one I'm not saying I agree with you but you're not the only one because at work in my mundane work day-to-day life pay the bills job they pick on me because I say Elementary I'm like that's how it's spelled how else do you say it it's it's Elementary I don't know what what wait a minute no you've heard this before there is a specific person at work I will not say her name U but she giggles at me all the time because I say element AR I don't know I'm saying it right that's how you say it right I think so I thought so all right Britney you're gonna Britney's gonna have to send us a voice message because I need to know how it's Elementary what am I doing wrong here I have been told my whole life I have no accent zero accent I have like the the TV accent I guess which is to say no accent right typical American boring but Britney says I say element Ary documentary and Oregon wrong so I am so curious I love it do we have an accent that we're how the hell do you say Oregon wrong I don't know you know what I think it is you know what I think it is you know how there's people who like remember Sherlock Holmes Elementary my dear Watson they sell Elementary my dear wson and we say Elementary El Elementary I think it's Elementary element so British to me I feel like I have to raise my P elementary yeah is that how I don't know so Britney please send us a little voice recording of how we're supposed to say Elementary document in Oregon but you know what I'm used to it try being a New Yorker moving to to Salem Massachusetts everybody thinks I have the accent I'm like I do not y'all have the accent I love hearing your love talk because of the the Boston Massachusetts accent is phenomenal it it's it's kind of funny I got to admit but yeah I I definitely am the minority accent wise in in my current location in Massachusetts but I don't have an accent it's everybody else that's what I'm saying too so please if if you think we're saying words funny or with an accent please email us and tell us what you think you know we're always interested I love having an accent thank you I'm so glad I have an accent I can say it now Tre My de Watson I'm not boring I have a cool accent or maybe I just say words wrong I'm not sure or maybe we're just High who knows maybe we're just High that could be it future Leela here mystery solved apparently the pronunciations of Elementary documentary and even words like sedimentary are unique to Upstate New York and in some cases the Northeast region of the United States but mostly these pronunciations are unique to Upstate New York so if you ever were curious about whether shell and I were actually from that area here's the proof future Lea out I do want to let Britney know in the time we've been talking I looked up Kappa I am down okay if you've got a crypted that favors cucumbers and loves to engage in Suma wrestling I am down I am gonna be looking this thing up and doing some research because now I'm hooked a crypted that likes cucumbers and Suma wrestling how can I not be hooked on this and don't forget episode 54 Lea's birthday W oh God I'm I'm so changing that episode title or maybe I'll just leave it for the comedic effect but hey unwashed lady flowers as a birthday present there've been worse there've been worse things so with that visual in all of our heads what have you got for me today as far as ghoulish stories shell well I came across this place the reason it kind of piqu my interest is because it actually reminded me of a of an old mansion um from the town I'm from this is not from the town I'm from but it just looks like one the Roberson mansion that we talked about in a previous episode actually that's exactly the one it looks like this is interesting here's a question for you how does an 1840s brick Fortress mansion in Southwest Virginia get linked to the classic and tragic southern rock band what classic southern rock band I'm glad you asked because it's one we all love oh Leonard skinnard oh love Leonard skinnard what's your name Sweet Home Alabama how can you go WR yeah as you are aware obviously some of the members of Leonard skinnard met a tragic fate in that 1977 plane crash um what it kill like their singer and and somebody else in the band I believe yeah it was the original lead singer so anywh who back to the mansion back in the 1840s it was called the Major Graham mansion and it's in we County I'm probably saying this wrong if you are in Virginia and I'm saying this wrong I apologize and like I said built in the 1840s and it's kind of like that I don't know how to describe it like a solid Brick Mansion basically they actually described it as an imposing brick Fortress built in stages so apparently the first stage started in 1840 and the guy major David Graham that the house was built for um he was a confederate army officer so just that alone should give you an idea the vibe this place has got so you got a Confederate officer and as we know some of those Confederate soldiers and and some of the Union and Confederate soldiers don't realize the war is over yeah I've heard that a lot with battle sites so I mean just that alone you can just imagine that this place is already crawling probably literally with soldiers yeah so to kind of get the coming together of the Leonard skinnard story with this Mansion you know kind of fast forwarding like I said that was in the 1800s but fast forwarding to 1988 there was a owner JC what was his name JC Weaver he was a Florida businessman he had bought 4,000 acres and part of the property included this Mansion what he did was he kind of had he didn't want the house necessarily he was looking for the 4,000 Acres I didn't find out if he wanted it for agricultural purposes or what but he wanted the land more so than this particular Mansion this just happened to be a part of it okay so it kind of went like dormant for decades people started like kids neighborhood kids people passer by started seeing reporting seeing shadows around the property no one had lived in the house in a significant amount of time they were seeing faces in the windows people talked about Claire and they called her a little girl ghost who was believed to have been an orphan that the Graham Family cared for um back in you know the Civil War days so they would see this child Through the Windows they would see different men and women's faces Through the Windows yet no one lived here I wonder what kind of triggered it to start happening you know have you ever been inside a house that's been abandoned for a long time yeah my Earthly folk yeah and it has that kind of eerie feeling like it's not abandoned yeah okay I think the ghosts took over okay so anyway this guy has it he loved the spooky house and even though he didn't live in it what he would do he would entertain his friends so he turned it into a party house essentially kind of like a party house basically he played guitar and piano and he absolutely like Leonard skinnard was like his Heroes musically so he'd throw these parties in the mansion and he'd be singing and playing the guitar and piano and and he'd be like blaring out not just Leonard skinnard music but you know all types of music including Leonard skinnard now this is a piece that I kind of found interesting because I would have thought that people like us would have heard of something like this we used to go to a lot of music festivals and I'm just surprised we haven't heard of this so in 200 7 he launched at this 4,000 acre property he launched what was called Graham Fest you ever heard that I gr Fest it was kind of like folky but it featured performances by himself um as well as the Rowan Oak Symphony Orchestra oh wow so it was kind of the gamut of the Rowan Oak Symphony Orchestra all the way down to local yal folk musicians kind of like the Rooney Fest basically yeah so he like I said he started this in 2007 in 2009 when he did the Graham Fest Weaver hired a Leonard skinnard tribute band called The Long Island Street survivors they basically that was the name of that was a tie in to Leonard SK the original Leonard skinnard you know obviously he's doing this Festival he has this tribute band he does feature more than just this tribute band talk about a guy who can pull together a festival he was able to include two members of the original Leonard skinnard band really yeah that's impressive he has he's got this like guy on the microphone was backup singer JoJo Billingsley who incidentally had a foreshadowing dream of the plane crash in 77 oh wow so she had had a dream that the crash was going to happen and as the backup singer she ended up not getting on the plane because of the dream because of the dream so here she is alive oh [ __ ] very Final Destination esque I know right also at the Graham Fest that year they had on the drums Artemis pile the only Leonard skinnard band member to uh physically climb out of the wreckage and seek help after the plane crashed damn the girl who had the prophetic dream and said I ain't get my ass on that plane and the guy who drug his Burning Body out of the plane to try to save himself are the two band members who show up at this gr Fest so the guy loves Leonard skinnard ghosty House tribute band with two original members that and you know if this girl is having prophetic dreams that's got to tell you something already absolutely both Billingsley and pile were walking the grounds outside the major gr Mansion they were walking along they were slashing through the swamps just kind of hanging out all of the sudden they hear the final notes of Sweet Home Alabama and Freebird just kind of fade off how I don't know how ask the ghosty with the mosty that was the very last time the two of them were ever physically together ever again because Billingsley died of cancer the following June oh wow damn that's some [ __ ] luck but imagine like all of a sudden out of nowhere you hear the final notes of Sweet Home Alabama and Freebird W and it was the last time they were together that's wild that's really [ __ ] wild so he stops having the Graham Fest it was over after that so that 2009 show was it after that they decided to turn it into like what we'd call today a modern haunt in the fall of 2010 they did the first annual haunted house Premiere they did it every October they did props skulls spider snakes you know the whole haunted house thing they had a room you know house is haunted the neighborhood and town folks people say they see a little girl in the damn window to the point where they know her name okay right you got little Clara looking out the window so now you're GNA do a family fun haunted house and you're GNA have one of the rooms called Clara's room of course they are they're gonna take advantage of the legend but that's gonna stir [ __ ] up yeah so then they used to do tricks where they would try to test the alleged Spirit of Clara to see if she would roll a ball back and forth all I can think of is poking the bear yeah right that's like a big time poking the bear they ended up at some point in 2012 bringing in some Ghost Hunters I was not able to find out if these were Pro proo like we've talked about or more kind of like your everyday mom and pop Ghost Hunters but anyway they brought in some Ghost Hunters that also were kind of clairvoyant they were able to record strange messages like the typical my favorite ghost message of all time get out that's like a classic it's a staple but here's another another interesting one they got several times on their recordings a Ghost spirit saying I don't play that tune really yeah wow that's different though and that's really related to yeah but you got to figure if that house was full of music for most of its existence there's got to be a ghost in there that thinks they're still playing music they also got voices that said what's your name and another one said what's your song request interesting here's the thing though what's your name was the biggest hit single from Leonard skinnard album Street survivors which was the name of the tribute band and the last album by the the original Leonard skinned folks just saying who just saying mind blown but wait Weaver said in 2019 that when he would play the piano in the house alone there were Spirits in there that would hum along with him oh no no that's too creepy I wouldn't be able to do that would you play the piano again if something hummed along with you I wouldn't make a habit of it like one time and I might even run a little bit but like I'm not just G like all right gonna go hang out in the Mansion gonna go chill with Clara for a bit we're gonna sing some tunes that's a lot of musical people there that's interesting but I do want to also point out your most favorite thing on the whole planet orbs they have pictures in Clara's bedroom that um are covered in orbs yes yes yes what they did just to kind of rule out a camera or dust or a bad shot or bad lighting they had five people in five different spots in the room kind of like almost like in a circle think of like a witch's Circle everybody has a camera and they're all pointing it at the same thing and everybody's getting photographs that are like not just one two three like we're talking 20 30 40 in one shot I am so excited I this little girl's room is like freaking orb Haven it could be the little girl it could be the Civil War thing it could be people who partied there over the years who knows that's the thing with orbs that really gets me and that's why I love them and they're so mysterious even though I know a lot of them are lens flares or dust or insects I know that that's what the majority of orbs is but the ones that intrigue me are the ones that are in this little girls room why that room why not all the rooms of the house you know why the Civil War battle sites why not every single open field so that's what really really intrigues me about orbs and those are the stories I I'm so curious about and can't let go of I want to go to this room and take pictures can we go shell can we go oh I would totally go and it's actually not that far away oh but you know houses that were built during the Civil War unfortunately did have uh separate slave quarters these folks in that period of time and there was a uh investigation by the Virginia Paranormal Society in 2007 they had some very distinct voices in the slave quarters they were able to pick up when they asked you know how like investigators will be like what's your name ghosty mosty and they actually got a response that in the slave quarters that said Connor oh wow when they were in Clara's room and they asked Clara Clara can you throw us the ball they distinctly recorded a no no oh [ __ ] when EVPs respond I get chills every time that freaks me out they went into an upstairs bedroom that was called the bride's bedroom and they asked if there was they asked if there was a lady in the room and a female voice was recorded yes is there any history on why it's called the bride's room no not that I saw damn I wonder if there's like a lady in white story in here along with the orbs there's a damn lady in white story everywhere everywhere then they were in another room called the Confederate room they were trying to move a table and they recorded a voice saying don't touch that table these are intelligent very relevant interactive ghosts these aren't recordings they're responding they're they're being asked specific questions and they're getting responses specific answers now the Ghost Hunters team they had Ghost Hunters there you know the TV show that we love on sci-fi Ghost Hunters was quoted as saying they can't say who or what is haunting the Mansion there was reports of a 7 foot tall Phantom on the road outside the Mansion Ghost Hunters believes it was an optical illusion but there are people that are like absolutely not I saw it I don't care what they say this is real I am not crazy so I I don't know what to think about that that's a tough one you know if they're thinking that it's it's not you know what they saw wasn't relevant but other people are saying they have seen it and experienced it that's hard right so there were people that were very adamant that Ghost Hunters was was kind of dissing their ghosty stories we don't catch everything you know you and I don't catch everything they're Ghost Hunters is human too maybe they just happen to miss that one well and also we've also over the times have noticed that sometimes they're more receptive to talk to certain people and not to certain people and maybe to a ghost talking to a ghost hunter is like us having to talk to like a lawyer or like getting called into the boss's office you know you're like oh I don't want to do that no but if you're like hey you want to talk to Laya hell yeah or hey do you want to go in your boss's office that's a hard no exactly you know it could be a case of that but basically they claim that the Grand Mansion will scare you this is where you get me in the [ __ ] around and find out attitude people say that they've had folks pass out because they're so scared of the ghosty activity there or because the energy is so potent it just kind of overload some people's system right they say they couldn't get through the haunted house because the spirit was attacking them I'm not saying they're wrong I'm not discounting anyone's experience but wow it was attacking them I mean we have seen some of these Paranormal Investigator groups go into places and come out with scratches they can't explain or bruises or marks on them so maybe that's what they're referring to you know sometimes people get their hair pulled or their clothes pulled right but for $20 you yourself can go to wife County Virginia and go through the Grand Mansion and see all the Orbee orbs that your heart can take for 20 bucks I would go check it out which is what they're counting on but you know if people are legit getting orb photos in that room I would like to see it but I think that you know honestly I think they're trying to make too much of the Leonard skinnard tie in I think that okay the owner liked Leonard skinnard he'd play Leonard skinnard music the two people were there everybody liked Leonard skinnard back then everybody likes if if you don't know Freebird who are you just because the two surviving folks were there for the last gram Fest like I don't know if that's got any relevance but I think they're playing off that you know kind of like I'm not saying Amityville wasn't a little weird but I don't think what happened happened right kind of the same thing I'm not saying there isn't music being played there but I don't think that Leonard skard is tied to this house yeah no it's definitely interesting with all the the music that happens and people that make music comments but don't make a mountain out of a mole hill just to make a buck yeah and and the what's your name that's a common question question that people ask ghost say that people say that to ghost what's it's one of they were they were asking specific questions and getting specific answers so yes but what I'm saying is that might not necessarily be a reference to the song that's all yeah oh yeah yeah I get what you're saying I get what you're saying yeah yeah so it's just a little they were just able to kind of yeah that's yeah on First on first hearing it that sounds like oh wow what a great connection but then I thought about it and I was like well that's what they all say are you finding meaning where there's none yeah ghosts ghosts all say that I mean that's the first thing an investigator will ask what's your name what's your age how did you die you know where were you born what's your birthday but what's your name is a common thing so I don't know I think that's just a little too ephemeral of a connection I am sure this place is haunted I am sure Clara is there and people are looking out the windows but I don't think that has a damn thing to do with Leonard skinnard I actually think honestly I would guess that probably a lot of them have more Civil War ties it sounds like it especially when you get orbs involved a lot of them do seem to be around a lot of those Civil War sites for sure yeah I mean Gettysburg it's just one big orb right the whole place just an orb yeah everybody gets orbs there so I I think it's interesting I think it sounds like a cool place I just think they're milking the Leonard skard tie in but otherwise I think it's Spooktacular totally worth the 20 bucks I want to pay the 20 bucks if you're going to threaten me with a good time of passing out Bring it on I just don't totally buy into Leonard skinnard tyin that's all okay okay as someone who has presented some stories with sketchy aspects I respect that I think I agree with you I think the Leonard skinnard is more for attention maybe right that's kind of how I feel but I do think it's probably legitimately haunted absolutely but I just think they're milk in that tie in I think you might be right but I want to go I'll pay the 20 bucks I want me some good orb fot anybody who is near we County Virginia if you have been to this house I need to know if you passed out I need to know if you passed out at this place email us the stone Witches Hour gmail.com or if you want to pass out there and kind of let us know how it goes that's cool too or if you're passed out there and think we say some words funny email us and we will say Elementary documentary in Oregon all day long for your amusement so I want to go on Google and hear how they tell me to pronounce Oregon this is gonna is it organ organ I don't know is that what they say but that's organ is like an organ in your body like your heart is an organ Oregon is a state I don't know [ __ ] we're screwed the indoctrination runs so deep I think I'm saying them the right way I'm so confused the weed makes it sound right there you go the weed makes it all sound right so before before I get into my stories and I'm sure you can guess I've given you a huge hint where we're going I want to say that we started this podcast just so that you and I who had moved to opposite sides of the country we started out we met in New York you moved to Salem Massachusetts I moved to Southern California and now all over the place and we were separated and I missed you and I wanted an excuse to get together and I'm like hey this was how we started hanging out from 3,000 miles away exactly just like we used to we get together we talk about wild paranormal [ __ ] we do fun witchy stuff and we would smoke mass quantities of cannabis enough to kill a rhino thus the stoned Witches Hour was born but the podcast has started being heard all over the world which still blows my mind love you guys okay fess up Spill the Beans who who out of the nifty50 United States who is not listening just one state can you believe this whole world most of the USA one freaking State we have

your little Spotify and your Apple music and get these people going we're fun maybe I should just say that no one lives in South Dakota because some episode not too long ago we were talking about Missouri we say that about every state you know we travel through we're like oh we're going to such and such State we're like oh nobody lives in such and such State and I said that on air about Missouri and that episode got so many listeners from from Missouri I feel sorry I apologize you're a jerk I am a jerk I'm an [ __ ] I know people live in Missouri I'm so sorry I happen to know I I know a person who lives in Missouri actually so I know there's at least one obviously that person is fake no one lives in Missouri shell so maybe I should just say that no one lives in South Dakota because then they'll all start listening and then our listenership from South Dakota will go through the roof if the past is any history so hi Missouri I love you guys and uh hopefully High South Dakota here's what we need to do we're going to give a shout out to Montana Wyoming North Dakota Nebraska Iowa and Minnesota you know why why because those are all the states that surround South Dakota and now they feel left out now South Dakota feels real left out don't you over there in South Dakota South Dakota take that it's because of out Rushmore I know it is that it they're all looking at us disapprovingly with that Stony glare because they're like they're smoking the devil's lettuce and it's way better than what we had good point good point yeah well good old Washington there could have rolled up the Constitution smoked that oh that's that's blasphemous that feels Blasphemous I shouldn't say that that sounds so bad all right so to cover up my blasphemy before the FBI contacts me I'm going to talk about a place in South Dakota to try and entice some listeners from there how about this I'm gonna put this out there if we get a listener from South Dakota I'll do a tarot reading for him oh hey do you live in South Dakota can you prove it email us at the stoned Witches Hour I'll do a T reading for you shelle's got a Tarot rating for you damn that's how much I want a listener from every state we'll party we will celebrate I will I don't know what's what's the best weed in South Dakota we'll have to look it up is that legal is it legal in South Dakota it's illegal recreational Cannabis is illegal and the voters want it that way okay now we know why we have no listeners andu no we know why wow that's not nice possession of more than two o is a class six felony oh my are you [ __ ] me since 2020 the voters of South Dakota have passed measure 26 which approved medical cannabis medical is legal in South Dakota but but prohibited for recreational wow last November the idea of recreational weed came up again in South Dakota and they voted it down damn and they're like not too far from Colorado so it is medically legal so that's a start but it is it is illegal recreationally all right South dakotans we get it we understand we're not happy about it but we get it but I'm going to talk about your haunted State anyways because it's haunted that's very haunted they are home to the haunted Black Hills in the bad lands that's where the bad lands are either all are part of them right no [ __ ] we're going to Deadwood South Dakota you ever heard of that shell that already sounds like there's some stuff going on there yeah Deadwood a lot of people might have heard from I believe there's a TV show called Deadwood there is yeah Loosely based on some history but it's very famous in the USFA because a lot of famous cowboys in Infamous Outlaws either died in Deadwood or passed through Deadwood can you name any Cowboys shell the marbor man John Wayne John Wayne I mean like a real in real life Cowboy um Billy the Kid there's one for you me John Wayne close enough I'm sure he's been in Deadwood he played a cowboy on TV there you go it works so a lot of cowboys Deadwood became a town when gold was discovered in the southern Black Hills in 1874 so that it was during the Great Gold Rush of America and a lot of miners came to the Black Hills in 1876 and they came to this spot it was a big Gulch and it had a creek with gold in it and it was filled with dead trees where the name came from Deadwood oh so this was one of those big huge Gold Rush towns then exactly okay basically the population grew up literally over night as soon as gold was discovered in the water it went from not very many people not very many Colonial people there because actually the place had been granted to the Lakota people in 1868 through the treaty of fort laramy and the treaty guaranteed ownership of the Black Hills to the Lakota people and the Black Hills are sacred to the Lakota and so there was a lot of disputes all these people came in wanting this gold on land that had been promised to the Lakota and of course all these arguments reached the Supreme Court and very obviously the Lota did not win so despite that uh by about 1877 there were 12,000 people living in Deadwood with up to about 255,000 people at its height so gold as you know when it would attract minors into an area it also attracted everybody else it brought their families so there were shops and of course there's a lot of single guys so there were bars and saloons and BR that well that was that was all you could do back then you were either drinking or prostituting for lack of a more vulgar word yeah especially for women there weren't a lot of ways for women to make money and there weren't a lot of ways for women to be safe in that time lawlessness was rif I mean there was a reason why you know the whole cowboy Trope with the gunfights at noon and and back then women weren't even allowed to really own property no women pretty much were property at that time so one of the few ways they could make money was by being a prostitute or by owning a brothel Deadwood was home to quite a few brothel uh including women named Madam mustache and dirty M just call me dirty M right I'll be Madam mustache Madame Dora Duan was actually the wealthiest brothel owner in Deadwood and she was very popular with several of the uh famous cowboys I'm about to mention Deadwood is famous because mostly of Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane okay I know I've heard of Calamity Jane right these are famous cowboy and cowgirls in the late 1870s while Bill Hickok was a gambler as well as all sorts of other things and he was in Deadwood when he died he was in a hotel and he was playing poker and he got a hand which is to this day as a poker player I knew exactly what they were talking about when they said he had What's called the dead man's hand I don't even know what that is not that I'm a huge poker player a dead man's hand in poker is Aces over eight it's two pair Aces and eights specifically Black Aces and black eights which is the exact hand that it's rumored that Wild Bill Hickok had when he was gunned to death by a lesser poker player who thought he was cheating oh [ __ ] yeah so that was the original dead man's hand so Calamity Jane also worked with Wild Bill hiup and was known to have a huge crush on him and followed him everywhere he went he did not return her affections they never do but they are buried side by side in Mount Mariah Cemetery in Deadwood which was her wish actually so the her brothers Wyatt and Morgan her also visited Deadwood okay I've heard of Wyatt her yep they left uh for Dodge City but they were known to come through Deadwood and also Doc Holiday another well-known Cowboy also was known to frequent Deadwood but this place is also known to be haunted as [ __ ] the whole town you can go visit historic Deadwood and see a lot of these places some of which still operate as hotels some are uh restaurants now and I believe one of them is a museum so in this famous cowboy town are the Fairmont the Adams House the bulock hotel and Mount marah Cemetery and all of them are super haunted so we're we'll start with the Fairmont which was was in the 1800s it was a brothel and a saloon so uh it was a saloon and it was found out that um while it was a saloon there was a man named Henry and his girlfriend who was a prostitute had died of syphilis yeah yeah that was kind of a thing back then yeah and he killed himself because of it he was so distraught and people will hear from him I believe that psychics often hear from him in particular and he's known as the grumpy man he's still very angry about the death of his girlfriend that sucks yeah this place unfortunately has been the site of quite a few different I guess a lot of people have romantic difficulties maybe because it was a brothel I don't know but a woman named Maggie killed herself by jumping out of a window there after her boyfriend broke up with her and her ghost is often seen wandering the Halls looking for him there's also a um in 1907 a girl who worked upstairs when it was just a hotel her name was Margaret Broadwater and she jumped out of third floor window and she had gotten pregnant uh and she wasn't married so which was not a good thing back then also that same year a man came in whose girlfriend worked there and he shot a man who was a client of the girlfriend so I guess she was a prostitute so he went in and shot the client shot his girlfriend and then while he was escaping accidentally shot himself and bled to death death on the sidewalk dumbass and all three of their ghosts are still there I hope his ghost walks around kicking itself in the ass right the place is crawling with orbs and people will often catch photographs of orbs particularly in the hallways and there's also a little boy that people will take pictures of but I'm not sure where he came from but he shows up in photographs as well so another place in town where people see ghosts is called the historic Adams house and the Adams House was built in 1892 and it was owned by a gentleman named We Adams who was one of the founders of Deadwood and it was reported to be one of the finest homes in Deadwood and west of Omaha so we Adams purchased the home and arrived in Deadwood in 1877 and he tried gold mining but he wasn't really good at it so then he and his brother went into business at a grocery store which honestly if I was going to move to some place like this that's what I would do like I wouldn't try gold mining that' be too hard and too difficult I think I would start up a shop selling things to gold miners that's what they did they made a fortune running a grocery store unfortunately tragedy after tragedy struck Mr Adams as soon as he made it rich at his grocery stores his wife Alice was diagnosed with cancer she went to California to be with their daughter Helen who was pregnant and about to have a baby she got there but unfortunately the cancer was further along than she realized realized and she passed away shortly after getting to her daughter's house oh the stress of her mother passing away caused Helen to go into premature labor and she died the baby only lived for a few hours and then the baby also died all three of them in less than 48 hours he had lost his wife his daughter and his granddaughter that's a [ __ ] day the [ __ ] wow it was just a couple years later he met a woman named Mary mastovich visich a lot of people thought this was a little bit of a was kind of like a what they call a May December romance because he was 73 and she was only 29 at the time gotcha and then I guess within a few years of getting married he died of a stroke inside the house and shortly afterwards his wife left saying she couldn't stay there because the house was haunted she kept hearing him walking around upstairs and so she literally locked the house up and did not come back or touch it for 50 years 50 50 oh my God it just kind of was just dormant she just left it locked up and she refused to step foot in it saying it was haunted when she would come back to town she'd stay in a hotel nearby she would not stay in the house oh weird did she say it was her husband yes she said it was definitely him if that were me and my husband died and was Haunting me wouldn't you stay and be like Oh Let's Stay Together 29 years old married a 73-year-old very wealthy wi okay I don't know I'm not saying it wasn't a love match but no probably wasn't a love match oh so Mary sold the house and it was turned into a museum and a bed and breakfast and it was kept exactly as it was everything from sheep music being on the piano to medic being in the cabinets like someone just like got up put their shoes on and walked out the door and literally never came back yep so it was like a perfect perfectly preserved Time Capsule into a life from half a century before wow as soon as it was purchased and opened up people talked about hearing someone walking around upstairs hearing voices in other rooms when no one else was in the home and smelling the distinctive smell of cigar smoke as if someone had just been smoking in the room even though obviously no one smokes in there in one of the rooms there's a rocking chair that will rock on its own there's a story from one of the people like one of the dosant that runs the museum apparently there was a couple doing a tour of the house and they asked him how he got the rocking chair to rock and of course he wanted them to explain what they were talking about and they went upstairs to the room and the rocking chair was still rocking back and forth and he explained to them that there's no trick that it wasn't anything they did and everyone kind of got freaked out so he looked at the rocking chair and he said stop it and it abruptly stopped as if someone had reached out and grabbed it they listen apparently they do but I thought that was a little freaky there are other paranormal events there there's lots of moved objects people will continuously you know put something down and it's moved somewhere else furniture will move in particular that rocking chair is sometimes found in other areas and will rock on its own black kills paranormal investigations has been there they were contacted by the executive director because staff were experiencing a lot of paranormal activities so they wanted them to come in and kind of see what was going on and she says that when they would come in during the day after the staff would leave at night they'd shut everything down but when they'd come in every morning all the lights in the whole place would be on even though no one had been in there everything would be switched on I'd be pissed you know if ghosts want to play around fine you want to move [ __ ] fine do not mess with my electric bill that [ __ ] costs money sometimes the um the manager and other staff will report seeing the shadow of someone walking back and forth in the windows of the upstairs floor even when the place is empty probably the woman we'll just call her a lady in white so people hear footsteps continuously up and downstairs and around the upstairs so this Black Hills paranormal investigation was there and while they were downstairs they heard voices coming from upstairs so they moved their investigation upstairs and then they heard the conversation continuing downstairs so they checked with their they checked with their crew outside to see if there were people maybe standing outside the house having a conversation but there was no one there so it was almost as if the activity moved when they did kind of like oh you've invaded our private conversation I guess we'll move exactly and they have EVPs there where one of their investigators is walking up the stairs and he stops because he thinks he can hear someone walking up behind him and you can distinctly hear three steps being taken when he's not moving and there's no one else there oh at one time they were in the library and they heard what sounded like whistling so one of their investigators kind of jokingly whistled and it whistled back very clearly and much closer oh see that would be like I'd be like what right they also have some um an EVP where they're in one of the rooms called the smoking room and while they're talking you can clearly hear a small child's voice um talking over top of them asking who they are now can you go there now is this like open to the public it is it's a museum and you can go there and I do believe occasionally they have ghost hunts there as well probably like during Halloween or whatever yeah exactly one of the other places is called the Bullock Hotel this was built by a gentleman named Seth Bullock and he wanted to go to Deadwood to open up a hard Square store again that's where the money is is selling stuff to the people looking for gold but he ended up becoming the sheriff and he was a US Marshal there for a while during his stay there there was a Cera outbreak and a lot of people in town got very very ill and so he opened his house up to allow people to bring their children there to try and nurse them to health and unfortunately a lot of children died yes so I gu we can kind of guess what kind of ghosties are there exactly that's sad yeah that the house is filled with small children ghosts it was also a hotel after he passed away and a young man hung himself in room 211 and unfortunately that poor soul can still be seen in that room from time to time so room 211 is one of the more haunted ones they also say that Seth Bullock himself still roams around the building and he's kind of a prankster he's more the type of ghost that likes to rearrange Furniture until someone tells him to stop it like you said he listens he does like to rearrange furniture and also one time apparently he helped a lost little boy so one of the more popular stories is that there was a family staying at the bulock hotel not too long ago like in the mid 1900s they'd lost their young son and they got the the hotel staff involved trying to find him and they searched the hotel from from top to bottom finally defeated went back to their room to try and see if they could call someone or get more help they go back to their room and the little boy's just sitting on the bed and he's just playing with some toys happy and contented wait is the little boy real or a ghost real he was he was their real son and he went missing when they went back to the room he was just sitting there on the bed just playing with toys and perfectly content so they asked him what happened and he said that he left the room to go get a soda and had gotten lost and a nice man found him and helped him find his room and they were like really what nice man you know he kind of described a guy but it wasn't until the next morning when they went to check out he said that's the man and he pointed to a portrait behind the desk of Seth Bullock oh no [ __ ] no [ __ ] well I've always thought that that kids can see things that adults have kind of shut the door too oh absolutely now the cemetery is also haunted it's called Mount Mariah Cemetery it almost sounds like the whole damn Town's haunted it pretty much is this cemetery is divided into multiple sections so you've got the The Potters field where there's all like a bunch of unknown Graves there's also a mass grave that is from when a lumber mill burned down while people in the houses nearby were sleeping it was late at night so when the lumber mill burned down it it unfortunately killed a bunch of people in their sleep and so there's also a mass grave of people that were caught in that fire there's also a section for all the children that died during that chalera and scarlet fever outbreak another section where Civil War and Indian War veterans are buried and again the famous Graves of Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane are there as well but the question is is is the spirits of them there some people say Calamity Jane is there and they often feel like someone is watching them as they walk through the cemetery it's a very common feeling there's orbs everywhere in the cemetery but mostly it's the children that are there a common occurrence is to hear children laughing and to hear rustling as if someone's kind of running up to you but you know obviously nobody's there people will see spirits walking around particularly of small children at night walking through or people dressed in older period clothing that you know aren't there when they try to catch up to them and also the gates are known to open and close on their own I feel like a lot of these places it seems there's some with Victorian women especially in the Victorian dresses and ghosties are two-thirds of the world's ghosties from the Victorian era I think maybe those are the ones that we notice as being out of place maybe ghosts that are dressed like us we don't notice because they just look like a regular person you know just because someone walks down a street and around a corner you wouldn't automatically assume that's a ghost but if someone's dressed in an outfit that's out of date and goes around the corner you might be curious enough to follow them and then when you see they've disappeared into thin a that's when you might start to question but if they're just dressed like you and me who's going to know damn it I'm in Salem man now every time I go to work I'm gonna be looking like is that person real are they a ghost are they real are they a ghost and the way people dress in costume you're around here I'm not going to know who's dressing in Period clothing or who is actually from the 1600s here I don't know how you go to work today in mundane clothing if I lived in Salem I would go to work in the most outrageous outfits I would dress as my witchiest badass self every [ __ ] day I don't know how you don't do that well you know there are some days where I go to work looking a little more in place than others do you have like a regular mundane office job so I guess you can't really let your witch flag fly but funny side note you know we're doing this this big uh redesign and they're like well you know we want to make sure we're being respectful of the Witch Community hey sh what do you think and I'm laughing I'm like yep resident office switch here let's just let's just talk can I just say that warms my little Pagan heart I love that that they they want to be respectful to the local pagans and of course that they reached out to my bestie shell because you're the witch when you work in a in a radius near the Bewitched statue there's got to be some level of respect going on I just love that you're that witch I know right well so that's pretty much My Story haunted Deadwood in South
