it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 44 of the stoned Witches Hour on tonight's podcast I'm going to be talking about a haunted mine in Nevada where 35 Souls lost their lives and can still be heard in torment today and shell will be talking about a creepy crypted the do demon I love Cryptids I love Cryptids I do too so representing all things creepy on the west coast I'm Lea and here on the East Coast getting high and chatting Cryptids I'm shell well hey Shell how are you on this dark November evening I don't like it getting dark at like 4:30 can I just put that out there like is that natural I don't think so now here's my first question to you for the evening what's that sh what is real time in the universe is it right now or is it when we're in the March through now time like which part of daylight savings time is Real Time and which one is fake and made up by the government I'm confused there is no time it's all made up it is a construct of your imagination [Laughter] I don't know I think we should split the difference just go half an hour you know should have just Fallen back half an hour and then right just 30 minutes and then leave it there like don't touch that [ __ ] ever again just leave it I have this friend in England and I'll be like you know oh yeah daylight savings time you know no we're not as far apart and he's like you Americans are still doing that [ __ ] right I'm like yeah we still use inches too don't judge us you know how at this time of year speaking of it being dark you tend to go through things not like a spring cleaning of sorts but kind of like a like a fall cleaning like you just you you go through some stuff maybe it's because you're starting to get out holiday decorations and you got to just like dig through [ __ ] maybe or do you mean like curl up in my blankets and like a big cocoon and not want to ever get out no I mean going through stuff Oh you mean going through physical stuff you don't mean going through some stuff within you you mean like actual oh well okay maybe not necessarily cleaning but like you're going through stuff like you're trying to get out your holiday ornaments I'm getting all metaphysical over here and you just mean boxes I'm just talking boxes man getting I'm getting to a metaphysical end though oh okay well Dr shell I have a lot to unpack once you get there let me know so I'm getting there you know I'm going through boxes and I'm trying to get some stuff gathered because you know T the season to be over dramatic on decorations oh as you always are how many how many trees do you usually have in your home I think the most trees I've had up in my house in one year was 12 oh that's even more than I thought I think I eight or nine fully decorated and you know how I am I got more ornaments than a damn ornament store you know I would have thought that Halloween and sin was your holiday but no really Christmas and ual it really is shockingly so we won't even get into the fact that I have a box of missing ornaments today and I'm trying not to focus on that because I'm probably just high and have misplaced it I know you've got them organized and cataloged you know exactly what is missing I do but I'm thinking you know what it's not like I threw them away like they got to be somewhere yeah I'm just trying to think and I even I even said to my sweet love I was like you know I think I just smoke way too much weed to remember where they are right now and some time into this but I came across something witchy that I I had had packed away and didn't have my hands on and found I have something witchy I want to talk about too that you going through physical boxes reminded me of so go what's your thing so you know how I've always had like these hysterical like Book of Shadows yes I found and I had wanted to start a new one because you know every so often every few years every decade you end up starting a new one because the one you had is full yeah so I was like oh I really wanted I I was looking to start a new one but I had gotten one is a gift and had it packed away like empty and I was like Chris perfect untouched and you found it but I also found and and and you've got to see this and I know you'll remember these from back in the day now this first one you're going to laugh this is dated I [ __ ] you not like 1996 no way remember my first book of shadows when I put the stickers goodness look at that look at this that looks like my first book of shadows oh my goodness but then I found the second one nice I like how the stickers have upgraded from just the triple Moon you have like moon phases going on right right I had something with these like hard cover leather books I guess I love I love me a good Journal don't get me wrong give me a journal I am a happy happy woman I think you'll remember this old Book of Shadows based on the stickers because you know for some reason I had the sticker fetish on all of them remember this one where I put the stickers on it that said Church activity oh how funny yes I do and that was the only way to customize it there was no no Zazzle back then there was no printify had to do that's right so so so I had the one with church activity which I just still to this day giggle my fool head off of on but then with all of those my old ones and I mean that's actually pretty cool though because it's pushing 30 years every 10 years I had a new book of shadows and I found them all today that's a wonderful Treasure Trove of knowledge to have right there oh my God I'm digging through that [ __ ] like I'm going to spend now until it's warm again how fun and I know you were one of those people that didn't just take straight notes you doodled in the margins and you had little pictures and but I also was very meticulous I just random opened up to a couple Pages last night and I was Finding like our our big when we would do our big group rituals I think I found like llamas 1996 I've actually been looking for it there's a few things um as you know I'm kind of bouncing around and uh there's a few things that I can't find and one of them is a box that includes all of my old books of Shadows and I've been looking for Dorian valiente's charge of the goddess and I know it starts whenever you need anything once a month and best when the moon is full and eight times more in the year you shall meet in some safe place to celebrate my spirit who I'm queen of all women sing Feast dance make music and love all in my presence for mine is the glory of the spirit mine is the glory in the see that's where I mess up and I can't find it anywhere I know let there be let there be let there be let there be honor Beauty and love strength and wisdom honor and humility something something within you and you who know me notice that your seeking and yearning will Avail you not unless you know the mystery if that which you seek you find not within yourself you shall never find it without for mine for mine is the beauty of the earth and the Dark Moon Among the Stars and the glory of the spirit and mine is the Ecstasy of the spirit on I don't know I can't remember it all we used to say it from memory so many times in circle doing ritual calling down the goddess and I I can't remember it and I can't find the I can't find that particular version anywhere online and I know we had them written in our books of Shadows I I was just going to say I'm like looking right here if you give me a few days to go I'll give you a few days you find it page like like I mean I just open up this is so funny because I just open up to this and um this is one of those uh tarot things we did dated April 20 oh wow oh wow yeah we used to do presentations and Tarot events and all sorts of different things but what I ended up finding was this is the new one beautiful I love one of those that it's one of those leather with the latch and it has the the handmade paper that's gorgeous so this will be Book of Shadows number four I love Etsy for things like that that's St well you live in Salem so you go to Etsy you could just go to some cool shop so it's got like this really cute like of just design engra Lea in the back stunning leather book on the front it's actually like a tree with dual face like a person and yeah it's like a God and a goddess in the tree it's it's absolutely gorgeous I love it I love it so that was my big find when I was looking for decorations today nice score and you know there is something very nice about finding old books of Shadows which maybe you look you want to find yours and me just happening upon mine maybe that's a sign that you're going to find yours real quick all mine all of mine just like appeared out of nowhere when I was looking for Christmas decorations I don't know what happened to it we haven't been able to find it yet they're probably with my Christmas ornaments right now probably hopefully we will all find them but speaking of Christmas ornaments I have been kind of getting into a craft lately um hold on one sec pause for pipe smoking right oh just hold on while I take this hit so I've been getting into doing witch balls I love them I always pick that up kind of this time of year it's very similar to your jar bottles yeah yeah but I take a glass or a plastic it looks like a a round ornament Christmas ornament you can get those that are just clear and undecorated so to say exactly you can buy them in bulk they're usually not that expensive and then I just like to take herbs and stones and anything that I might sometimes I'll write a little spell on a piece of parchment or ribbons anything that you would use in a spell or a ritual you can even get one of those writer weight mini super mini Tarot deck and put tarot cards in them absolutely miniature dry mushrooms little miniature anything if it goes along with the spell or the intention it'll go in the witch ball and then you that's right and they look beautiful and then I'd like to decorate the cap outside with like twine and you know maybe some dried flowers or some crystals and just seal the spell in there you could even use colored ribbon depending on color intention is as well or you could also in in the same fashion of color um seal it with wax exactly now my husband who is also a witch he has used this he has taken a he likes witch balls um yes he handles witch balls very well but so he take took this witch ball and he took this really nice nug that we grew and he put it in the witch ball and he hung it over our Altar and so whenever we were doing ritual and spell workor all that good intention kind of went into the idea was it would go into that witch ball and then after you know a month of kind of doing that we took it out and smoked it in ritual space in intentional space was it dried out though no because this was a bud that we were already curing that was at the last stage of cure so we put it in there and you can these jars do seal up pretty well so if it's sealed in a glass switch ball it's not really going to dry up too much you know in a couple weeks or even in a month it's still going to be perfectly good to smoke that's very cool and and I aren't they fun because like you said it's very much the same as my witch jars my witch bottles exactly just a shape of a container right it's just in a different shape fun to make they really are do all kinds of different things I love them so much for that and I love the balls because this time of year I do like to decorate a Ule tree and I love that shape of ornament they look really good and they also look beautiful suspended in front of a window if you have several of them in your kitchen I like to make them as a housewarming present to do a a house blessing and you would put all your different herbs and stones and items in the ball for the house blessing personalized to the person that you're giving it to and then you can kind of gift them that and if they hang it especially in their kitchen or a place where people will gather or in the center of their home that can kind of to bring that energy and protect that house bring that blessing energy into them so you can use them for all sorts of different things what I've kind of been into the last week or two and I I do this generally every year I this is my ramp up time for it really I love the jars I love the bottles same concept with your balls yeah I dig simmer pots this time of year dig dig dig okay so this do you have any good simmer recipes oh my God not like I have it written down but let me tell you what I did the other day and you are just going to want to die being from upstate New York we know what legit hardcore badass apple cider is they don't necessarily have that here it's more kind of like grocery store apple cider so I had this idea I didn't feel guilty using it because it was that watered down Filip pot you know a spaghetti pan it's probably gotten a off name but I call it a spaghetti pan but you know like a SPH pan yeah I know what you're talking about kind of that bigger type pot dump a whole gallon of the grocery store watered down apple cider in that pot and then two oranges slice them up two apples slice them up um what else did I put in there I think I put in a pine cone you know sometimes I just pick [ __ ] out of the yard it has no Rhyme or Reason yeah hey that always works there something that's from your garden or or from your yard it's definitely more connected to you but there was also like two or three sprigs of pine in there and then some cinnamon sticks put that [ __ ] on like a simmer oh my God oh my God that is so perfect and you can do this you can turn this into a spell like I didn't drink it I just like cooked it it's just something that's meant to be simmered on your stove to kind of scent your house it's kind of like a a liquid cooking popery I kind of think of it as like a I don't know there's no better thing I can think of than a negative energy diffuser oh I love that and it's it kind of permeates your whole house when you do something like that and you can again turn it into a spell if you if you're standing in front of your cauldron or your spaghetti pot on the stove you know and you have all your ingredients there you can pour in your um apple juice and uh in the past other times I've put cranberries and stuff in there I just didn't have them handy this time around yeah and and apples apple juice is great for a spell this time of year because it is a symbol of Life Death and wisdom and rebirth and if again if you cut it kind of lengthwise you'll get that magical star so it can also be protection so you kind of put that in there and you start stirring it clockwise and picture your intention picture the intention as as this scent permeates your house it's also going to permeate your house with positive energy and you kind of breathe in that intention and breathe in that positivity as Aroma is filling your house with beautiful yummy goodness yeah and oranges and lemons are perfect to put in there this time of year because they represent the Sun and life and vitality they're also you know Wonderful to remind you to bring in happiness that that Citrus is a great happiness infuser for the house as well and pine cones are symbols of Resurrection enlightenment let's see what is Pine itself it's usually to me I like Pine a lot for cleansing and purification um I was just like I said thinking more of that like getting that that negativity to kind of break up and disperse yeah it is very much a positivity thing and cinnamon as well is also a very positive herb it's like love and spirituality good luck and protection and cranberries too that like bright red of cranberry if you want to put some of those in there as well happiness in the home and that's right bringing in abundance and that bright red energy that life energy into your home and if you put all of those in there and and think of of what they kind of represent to you and magically then just kind of let it simmer on low for a while oh my gosh your house is going to smell absolutely but you know on the tail end of that so you're done end of the night simmer pot's over you're going to bed you got to handle your pot yeah get it handle your pot so so what I've done in the past carefully strain out things so like I'll strain out the pieces of oranges you can't do it with the Apple because it kind of starts turning apples Saucy consistency but take out the oranges and then put them on paper towels and let them dry for a few days so they get basically like hard and dried out and then I've actually used those either bits and pieces of those in incense recipes or in um decorate decorative like a wreath with like a dried out orange piece in it generally nothing too intense on a reuse if I'm using it in like an incense thing it's more for smell than magical purpose because it is a reuse but I you know you want to try to reuse some of them and they do look kind of cute dried out I also like to take it and same thing I'll strain it if I have any cinnamon sticks I'll usually take those out but I like to use mine in spells where I'm going to put something outside as an offering you know I can kind of put that outside return it to the Earth you know as as a an offering in a later spell you know something like you said dry it out and who doesn't love dried orange slices this time of year take some orange slices some cinnamon sticks and you've got yourself a beautiful Ule ornament for your man or your tree exactly you know you can make cute things out of simple dried fruits and stuff holy crap I just really realized the day after this episode airs is Thanksgiving in the United States it is the United States Thanksgiving I this year is flying flying past it's going to be Ule before we know it which is probably why we can't stop talking about it right now but probably because I get all my decorations out and I start decorating the day after Thanksgiving when you put up as many trees as I do you got to get that [ __ ] moving after you're done eating turkey so you are prepared you've got everything ready to go this is like your you Olympics yeah decorations out go go go I have to eat all of my Thanksgiving dinner and I have to be thankful for everything so that I have the energy to wake up on Black Friday and start decorating like a m yeah go girl most people look at Black Friday for shopping me decorating no I try to avoid everything on Black Friday I just kind of hibernate in my house and don't do anything exactly decorate see that's right well no actually I'll probably be working on this podcast or working in my garden right now I'm smoking on some crappy homegrown oh my God I have some kush mins and it's like 29.2% and it's so great and I just want to cackle about it right now mine is fine it gets me high but it tastes like crap because I've been traveling too much and neglecting my garden and I happened to schedule a trip the same time I was curing some weed and it dried out too much so I'm I'm smoking some overdried Gorilla Glue and it's getting me high really high and it tastes okay uh it's not something I would give to guest though I'll smoke it as Penance but I'm not sharing that [ __ ] with anyone it's too crappy I'm probably gonna end up turning it into butter well I've got some pretty good stuff and I don't mean to brag but it's delicious and it gets you really high and it's a good smoke not gonna lie I am jealous of you and of our listener who wrote into US Darlene from Florida who wrote us about her pineapple upside down cake which has got a 27 to 29.6% that is a good strain by the way right that is a cultivar I would absolutely love to be smoking right now so oh so jealous you can't have any of my homegrown darling it's too bad but if I make brownies out of it girl you're welcome to some and we'll smoke your pineapple upside down cake and we'll eat my brownies sound like a deal yeah yeah that sounds like a great night but Darlene thank you so much for fiding in and I'm so jelly of your weed right now hi darling thanks for listening yeah Darlene and your bestie in Florida thanks for listening we love you guys so yeah I'm going to pack another bowl of my craft I got a story for you listen to Shell's story yes what are you gonna tell me tonight okay something about a crypted you said I did now ah the queen of cryp Cryptids is back I don't know what my fascination with Cryptids is you know I I I had to get I just had the Halloween hangover from hell this year I don't even know what that was about so it took me a couple of weeks to get back into my groove but I came across now this story is again out of Massachusetts I can't even get away from this place but I came across this crypted and I was so intrigued so I want to talk about the do demon now the thing that gets me about this is there was actually only ever three sightings over two days and that's it kind of like the pumpkin had crypted in Riverside correct and so basically over like about a 25 25 and a half hour period there were three sightings [ __ ] yeah and three people from totally different background you know basically meaning that it's not like it was three friends who made up the same story you know what I mean right so this happened um it's it's been like 45 years and there hasn't been a sighting since but because this is so close to home for me right now like I almost want to go dig through the woods because I'm intrigued you should hopefully it's not raining for you and hopefully the locals have heard of it everybody has apparently heard of it as the thing oh good yeah no one had heard of that that pumpkin had en crypted in Riverside I was so sad so like I said it's been about 45 years this happened on April 21st and April 22nd of 1977 so this this creature that has become known as the do demon like they even like literally consider it one of Massachusetts great Mysteries really and they also call it one of the world's great crypted cases wow so just three sightings over basically like one day and it's one of the world's great crypted sightings what the [ __ ] happened apparently that made quite the impression it did it did so it's described first I'll get into the description it's kind of described as a small gangly hairless creature with large glowing eyes that sounds terrible now I saw a couple of pictures of it and the only thing I could maybe equate it to was a combination of a gray a gray alien an octopus and a human oh yeah that sounds really terrible e there was act and and this was actually a cryptozoologist looked into this as well and I'll get to that in a minute but I'm G to start out with what what the three separate sightings are and you said these were three people who were not affiliated with each other all saw the same thing correct in the same time period within about 25 and a half hours of each other correct wow oh [ __ ] okay so we're gonna start out with a man named Bill Bartlet Bill Bartlett was 17 years old at the time and was driving with his two friends um at about 10:30 p.m. okay and he spotted a strange creature in his headlights he said he said something ahead he saw something ahead on a stone wall and he wasn't sure if it was a cat or a dog his headlights were hitting the things and the eye hitting you know straight onto the thing and the eyes were glowing like just like like you know how like when a deer jumps out yeah I was just gonna say when a deer jumps out and the eyes are kind of glowing yeah like you can usually see the eyes glowing on the side of the road before that [ __ ] jumps in front of your car if you're lucky right but he said that as he got closer and got a good look at the thing and it turned towards him and he saw these hand likee things grasping onto a Rock what they were like it's going to throw rock at him no they were like they were kind of like hands but like section cup hands e like tentacle suction cup hands that's why I said kind of like a cross between a a gray a gray head in an octopus in a human that is so gross so suction cup hands like a like an octopus kind of thing yeah and he basically he said it appeared to be walking on on all fours and had strange feet and hands with like long digits but the digits kind of had like suction things ew yeah I mean I I I like seop pods don't get me wrong but I don't want to see one walking around in the headlights of my car he said it had two large round glowing glassy lidless eyes Shin shining like two orange Marbles and he said the head was shaped like a marble and was the same size as the rest of the body and he noticed the body was like peach colored and describe the skin like shark skin and kind of like sandpaper how long did he look at this creature he had an awful lot of details and can I say that sounds extra terrible it sounded like he only really had maybe about a 20 to 30 second look and he got shark skin same size head is body orange head Peach body tentacles Su maybe he smokes less weed than us I don't know okay good point okay Carry On so basically what he did was the minute he got home he literally went down and Drew exactly what he saw because apparently he was blessed with a photographic memory and artistic ability okay you should have led with that lead with that oh sorry so he went home and Drew exactly what he saw and actually um when you Google the do demon his sketch is what has become the famous image of the do demon oh yeah photographic memory ability to draw that's awesome he could put down lots of detail but you creepy to have to remember that in full detail for the rest of your life though how how creepy is that you know how there's some God-fearing folk in this world God bless them bless their wrot on his original sketch on the back of it he wrote I bill bartl swear on a stack of Bibles that I saw this creature wow like an authentication basically like an authentication yeah yeah so that was that was Bill Bartlett so now we're gonna move on to John Baxter a man named John Baxter or a kid named John Baxter now what I say Bill Bartlett was like around 10:30 p.m. yeah later that night about 2 hours after Bartlett's sighting like around maybe midnight or so 15y old John Baxter was walking home from his girlfriend's house now granted want you know Bartlett was 17 and bter was 15 but they were not affiliated with each other you know one was out in a car one was walking home from his girlfriend's house well 15 and 17 is you know that's pretty grown up that they're they're they're not they're not affiliated necessarily yeah and they're not like 10-year-olds who are going to be hysterical they're right you know these are kids that you know they grew up in this area they know what's what you know they're not gonna I mean okay it's possible that their age could play into it but they're also not little kids either right so this kid John baers walking home from his girlfriend's house and his recollection was up in front of him he saw a thing the shadowy figure walking upright like a little human um he noted that it had a large head he knew a friend in the neighborhood had a head that was bigger than normal so he thought it was his friend so he started yelling out hey MJ is that you but it wasn't how horrible why would you even say that there's a kid in the neighborhood with a big head that's horri because he thought it was his bigheaded friend MJ obviously but so him and the creature were about 15 to 20 feet apart and he basically you know he's he still think it was MJ when he was 15 ft apart initially and then the creature turned around and he got a glimpse of his face and then the creature all of a sudden took off and ran into the Gully up a little slope and leaned against a tree all he ever reported was that the creature stood upright against the tree and that it had the same shape and a big head he also describe the spidery like fingers did he say what the face looked like he he said the eyes were glowing faintly but not with any color now he also even though he had really no artistic ability that was noted he did also make a drawing of what he saw and it looked exactly what Bartlett Drew oh wow so they corroborated each other stories even though they didn't know each other correct [ __ ] creepy so then we have um a girl now this was exactly 24 hours later so basically the next night there was a a a girl named Abby brabham I might not be saying her last name right but Abby brabham okay 24 hours later she was a 15-year-old girl she was in a car with her boyfriend boy people start dating young down and over sorry so she's in a car with her boyfriend and she presumably saw the same creature that the boys saw the night before um so what her story was is Abby saw something in the headlights the creature was on all fours crossing the road it kind of looked to her like it was kind of like a monkey or a human but was hairless and kind of beige or tannish beige with no nose no ears or tail okay but monkeys and octopuses don't look alike yeah but you're talking about a 15-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy I'm telling you what I see drawings okay because she did say it looked like it had no nose no ears or or a tail um she did also describe it with orange glowing eyes oh wow and then ever since then April 21st April 22nd 1977 nothing so then really correct so then there's this you know there's there's this person Lauren Coleman who is a noted main native and crypto zoologist kind of about 30 years after so you figure this was about 10 years ago or so about 30 years later kind of got a little intrigued because you know cryptozoologist spooked around so Lauren Coleman went and actually spoke to the teens and actually was able to get some good information they were both cool so they were interviewed like shortly after they saw it by a crypto a crypto that's a hard word to say cryptologist so that's pretty awesome that they were interviewed by a crypto zoologist like shortly after it happened to kind of like get the details down within a week that's great now what they what Lauren concluded was that all three teens were not able they basically were not in Social Circles or what have you to to have made up the story collectively all three sightings seemed verifiable all three sightings happened over a two night period and were within a two mile radius and near water some of authorities pass the creature off as like a fowl or a moose calf but no such animal has been spotted so like a bird or a moose calf with suction cup fingers now keep in mind any such animals that were that young would have been out of season at that time of year just saying that's weird and also would do you see moose walking upright like a human I'm just saying I'm their eyes glowing yeah right well it depends you know like like well the topedm or whatever yeah that's true the light does kind of reflect off their eyes yeah so because the sightings happened during like a school vacation week people investigated how well the teens knew each other and and it ended up that they really didn't they had not contaminated each other um according to Coleman and Coleman felt as a cryptozoologist that the sightings were genuine and interesting that they occurred near water which is exactly where the Riverside pumpkin headed crypted was cited as well right and you know because these creatures kind of need needed that water right the strange coincidence was if you take a map and put a ruler on the map the points where the sighting happened almost line up in a direct line over like a mile long almost like like it was traveling or that was its territory like it was like maybe like walk in the waterline you know what I mean mhm like that was you know it was kind of traveling up the river that way the thing is I'm just sad that no one has seen it since me too I wonder why why not so what was it like they don't know you know almost immediately people are trying to say you know oh it was a moose it was a foul but again you know how many times first of all you going to see a baby moose and Southern Mass like legit and on all fours but you figure the time bulbous head that's like the same size as its body that doesn't sound like some type of bird or a moose and not to mention you know okay there are a lot of horses and stuff in that area but no one reported any animals missing some people tried to say that what the teens saw was nothing more than like a fox or a dog um but they insist it was definitely uh bigger than that they don't think it was extraterrestrial because again like I said it kind of had the head and the eyes you could kind of say maybe like the grayhead aliens um but they definitely did not think it was something extra tral they think it was an animal no even the cryptozoologist the crypto zoologist okay they definit sounds alien to me they definitely think it was an animal it was actually featured in the 2013 book Monsters of Massachusetts oh wow mysterious creatures in the Bay State but Coleman pointed out that the do demon does not fit the known pattern of a ghost or a fair or a UFO KN it is a true Enigma they actually considered an an an anomaly because there were credible people that saw it over those two days in 1977 I wonder if it was just passing through you know it was headed somewhere else and just happened to be there for a couple days and got cited you know and and that could be because you figure that is where that's located not that it's necessarily it right on the ocean but it's very close to the ocean where things could come Inland and let's just face it people we don't know what's in that water still and and I kind of want to wrap this up by pointing out that for the record the do demon is not the first strange sighting in this small town um stories have circulated for centuries about buried treasure about Pirates so it's a town with like a like a history it's there's also yeah there's also of a legend of a devil on Horseback being seen in the 1800s no [ __ ] I and I'm going to see if I can dig up some information on that I came across that when I was looking into this and I was like oh I want to look into that yeah we need more info on that one right but so this town a lot of stories keep creeping up because of this town and around this town and near this town it kind of goes back to my original theme that I think Massachusetts is just creepy just because it's like old yeah super old I do think that because the oce is so close there is the possibility that something could have evolved to be able to move on land that was maybe once an ocean-like creature oh maybe it was an ocean creature and it just kind of popped out for a day or two and was like no [ __ ] this too many people here and went back in the water and that's why no one has seen it again like a mermaid like a mermaid like a mermaid oh but not cute though if it's a merman I'm going to be so disappointed yeah but you know how they talk about how there can be um maybe over in the specific some of those underwater Al Nations oh yeah like the the Atlantis Nations way over there sure maybe it's a grey head from Atlanta over in the Pacific and it swam over to Massachusetts the cryptozoologist and they're the professional said not alien correct correct I really want to know what it takes to be a cryptozoologist because I so think that would be right up my alley yeah I totally think it you'd be you'd be amazing at that the crypto Queen [ __ ] yeah I just can't believe how many cryptodes are around here so they're like everywhere I was thinking about maybe when the weather gets better in the spring I want to go down to Dover and see if I can find me a demon you should go demon hunting hopefully you won't get rained out like I did I just want to know yeah me too [ __ ] I want to know maybe on like the 48th anniversary oh yeah I went on the anniversary and found nothing you maybe you go on the anniversary and you'll get something cool maybe I'll see a Krypton maybe you will I didn't see [ __ ] except for a couple rundown businesses and people who thought I was weird but you know Cryptids are that's the whole I think thing with them they're elusive you're not you're not gonna see them all day every day I mean Jesus look at big foot and honestly until I started doing this I hadn't heard of too many Cryptids I mean I'd heard of Bigfoot Sasquatch you know I'd heard of Nessie I'd heard of a couple of the uh East Coast ones like isn't there one in um in of the great lak Jersey Devil the Jersey Devil I'd kind of heard of May chupacabra stuff like that I'd heard of a little B you didn't realize how many there really are no I had no freaking idea they're everywhere remember the pucka I'd rather not thank you hey at least the Dober demon doesn't try to enchant you to death that's very true oh my god this is my first crypted who didn't try to kill people holy [ __ ] that's great that is great I like that I like the do demon is friendly non- murdery Cryptids are good they call this one a demon and the damn thing is friendly I don't even get it where' the demon part come from just because it looked weird that's like preist yeah know I think I think that's why it's so rude like you said it didn't even hurt anybody it didn't kill anyone didn't Mesmerize anyone didn't enchant anyone but a pucka G sounds like something you can cuddle up to and that's G to kill you yeah right that little [ __ ] So speaking of things that I don't like I am talking about a haunted mind today oh wow so un likee you very cramp I hate that [ __ ] very claustrophobic like I'm staying mostly out of the mind so you know we don't have to go into it too much so so to avoid that I'll be staying out of the Mind mostly and talking about the hauntings that are seen above ground both at the entrance to the mine and also at the Gold Hill hotel that is next door to the mine and is said to be built above the mine proper where a terrible tragedy occurred and the hotel and the mine are both haunted I'm going to take us to the state of Nevada ooh and to a town called Gold Hill where the Yellow Jacket mine was found and get this on top of a huge quartz deposit oh how awesome would that be to go to and do a ritual on oh spooky spooky I think people have but okay so this mine the Yellow Jacket mine the claim was put in on May 1st in 1859 and it was staked on a large cropping of quartz but the what they were actually after was Far Below in the form of silver and gold underneath this quartz deposit deep in the Hills oh [ __ ] that's like a Triple Decker like go get the quartz and the gold and the silver jackpot exactly and they started digging deep into this hill they drilled a Min shaft way down in and then tunnels down into the hill and they framed these tunnels out with Big Timber logs to make it somewhat safe but back in the 1800s working in a mine none of it safe none of it was safe it was so hot in the mines that these men would very often strip down to nothing but their pants and they would be shirtless no h heart helmets no gloves no boots they would often be carrying lanterns that oil lanterns that were just a fire Lantern and I don't know I don't know if you know but there was very often pockets of gas in these mines and didn't they take canaries with them yes the old saying Canary in the coal mine they would actually take canaries in cages down into the mines because small birds like that are very susceptible to changes in oxygen and if there was like a hazardous gas that would come through the bird would die pretty quickly hence would have a warning that they needed to get away so a canary and a coal mine is an early warning or something that kind of gives something away that was their safety measure was a canary this yellow jacket mine was built near the town of Gold Hill and much like a lot of mining Towns at the time it became a huge Boom Town within months of Nevada becoming a territory in 1861 Gold Hill went from a teeny tiny Frontier Town to a booming Mining City the population doubled from 638 to 1,297 practically overnight a lot of those places did like there was like popup mine towns exactly and because this mine was up the hill they did have some shacks and buildings built near it um that were small bunk houses for the men to stay in where they could kind of change clothes and or stay overnight depending on what shift they worked and a lot of times they had to change because remember I mentioned it was so hot in the mindes they'd usually down to just their shorts or their pants yeah well this is Nevada in the mountains and there's snow in the winter time and so they would be super hot sweaty covered in dirt and grime from their like 12-hour shift and they'd come up to freezing cold temperatures and so they'd go into these little shacks and they'd kind of change and warm up and sometimes they St exactly clean up uh but because of the temperature shifts a lot of them got pneumonia or would get very very sick and a lot of them would get sick because of the conditions in the mine they would use their bare hands or crude tools to get this silver and gold or out of the mine so a lot of the men had health problems and there were a lot of accidents as you might suspect then unfortunately the worst accident in Nevada's mining history happened on the morning of April 7th 1869 deep in the bowels of this mine around the 800t level it's said and this is just speculation that one of those oil lanterns accidentally was knocked over oh yeah and it caught fire to the Timbers that they used to frame the tunnels and to some of the gases that were in the mine thankfully it happened during a shift change but unfortunately the fire just ripped through these mine shafts and the old wooden Timbers and it the Timbers kind of smoldered and collapsed and poisonous gas filled these mine shafts and was kind of racing through Behind These miners that were trying to get out oh firefighters tried to get in to save some of the miners but the fire was burning so hot and the smoke and the fumes were so poisonous and deadly that they couldn't even get in 35 miners were killed and it's possible that there was a handful of others that weren't recorded being in the mines but 35 known people died and 11 bodies were never recovered oh wow they had to seal off several levels of the mine and they couldn't even go back to work for about 3 weeks it took them that long to take out as many bodies as they could and Shore up and protect the mine as best they could I honestly thought that only coal mines burned that hot nope they say that some of them burned so hot that they continued burning for years wow and this was a silver and a gold mine those mines ran for a couple more years but in 1876 it started losing money and they drilled so far down I believe it was 380 ft and they hit water that was 170° holy [ __ ] yeah that water quickly overtook everything and kind of flooded the mines they had to cease their deep Mining and by the end of the year they had to kind of shut it down a few years later they were able to resume after they found some better pumps and kind of get in there but again they would they encountered super hot water and eventually they kind of shut it off and just left it underwater ever since once they went back to work they had trouble because some of the miners would hear the cries of the miners that had been trapped there when the accident happened oh they would go to work and then they quickly come back pale as ghost shaking and saying that they could hear screaming from miners trapped in tunnels that were sealed off and there's no way anyone could still be alive in there they say that to this day you can see orbs around the entrance to the mines you can't go in the mines because they've been filled in and again they're kind of full of water you can hear um you can see orbs blue and white or thing my favorite thing right around the entrance and there are some shafts that aren't full of water and they are they're closed to the public but a few people have been able to go down there and they all have the same reports of being able to hear the miners working and kind of like the low talk of men just kind of General talking and they'll hear banging and sounds of rock on rock or or hammers hitting rock so they can't get the water out I don't know if they can and I don't know if you know I didn't kind of look into that maybe they got all the gold and silver out and it wasn't really profitable anymore to do that so I don't know I don't know about that part but I do know they got over $10 million worth of gold and silver or between 1868 and 1888 some that's a lot of money back then maybe they figured that was kind of enough so you can't go there but do they do like tours of the area you can actually go there and the houses that I mentioned the little bunk houses that were you can't go down in the tunnels no but you can go to the tunnel entrances you can see the mine shafts you can see all the equipment that they had there and you can actually stay in the bunk houses that were right there that these men stayed in right before they went down to their Doom in this m shaft and there's several little cabins they've converted into an Airbnb and it's rumored that cabin 19 is the most haunted and one of the caretakers said that people will regularly go there and do seances and try to contact the dead and they're they're often quite successful I believe there's a few miners that are very chatty and they're known to inhabit cabin 19 today you can rent some of the one room cabins uh particularly cabin 18 and 19 you have to ask for them specifically and the rumor is that they aren't listed with the other cabins that you can rent through the Airbnb because of their proximity to the Yellow Jacket mine I've heard it said that many people have tried to spend the night there and make it through without getting spooked and that no one has yet made it an entire night without some sort of Paranormal Activity happening particularly in Cabin 19 the reason cabin 19 has so much Paranormal Activity is because it's directly it's right near the mine entrance and is believed that some of the bodies and some of the people that were pulled up out of the mine were brought into cabin 19 and that many of them died there oh [ __ ] they say that everyone that stays there hears Whispers and will eventually start hearing creepy voices saying maab things and just kind of talking and whispering and moaning throughout the night and if that's not enough to Spook you the doors will open and shut and slam the windows will open and shut objects will be tossed across the room people say um I believe there was even a paranormal investigation that happened in Cabin 19 and one of the camera women had her camera physically well ghostly lifted up out of her hands thrown across the room and she had scratch marks down her back and no one was near her oh [ __ ] there have been quite a few disturbing EVPs captured inside that cabin um there's a lot of anger there they say that there's um people feel like they were murdered they feel like they were left to die and there's an extreme um sense of anger and frustration cabin 19 has been reported by multiple psychics and paranormal investigators to have as many as six specific entities all miners that passed away in that tragedy well there that that quartz has still got to be right under that and and that's got to kind of trap some of that there yeah a lot of people do feel that because the the high magnetic energy that's in that area with all that quartz they feel that all 11 of those souls are still there and that the the recording the imprint of that day is what people who go to the m shafts can hear you can hear them and talk just kind of going over and over and over again yep that rumbling of the the mind the elevator going down the shaft the men working and talking and then the screams and Agony of them like that day on repeat forever forever and ever exactly it just kind of goes over and over so there are some stories that people have mentioned a gentleman named Daniel bharp said in the 1970s I was in Nevada with my family my parents brother sister and I went for a drive on a clear sunny day we decided to stop to have lunch inside the remains of the Yellow Jacket mine which was supposedly abandoned as we were having lunch we heard the distinct sound of machinery and tools being used inside the mine and even though the mine was not in operation we could hear them clearly it was the craziest most bizarre thing we have ever heard but um there's a YouTuber her name is Wonder hussy Wonder hussy adventures and she goes around around the USA and she explores all sorts of different abandoned and interesting places uh she says join me as I explore abandoned buildings mines ghost towns and roadside Oddities in the desert around Las Vegas and Beyond has she been there she has been there I watched her video and now she is a skeptic but she did think that it was very creepy and very odd and she kind of heard a lot of interesting things as she wed around she has an episode about it I'll link it I'm not I don't remember what episode number it was but I'll link it in the show notes and you can see her and and look at at the different places you can wander around at the Yellow Jacket mine you know people do say that they see full body apparitions of miners walking around some that are kind of the playback type ghost and some that they're able to talk to through Ouija boards and psychics that have been there do feel that they're able to to talk to them interesting most people feel that like a heaviness in the air when they go there a lot of people when they're in these cabins will feel someone put their hand on their shoulder several people are awakened at Night by someone like startling them AIT I don't like the touching like like if you're gonna if you're gonna scare me or if you're gonna just be a ghosty ghost be a ghosty ghost but don't touch me yeah yeah that's come right up to me and be like but like don't touch me so I'm talking today about two distinct places both the Yellow Jacket mine and the gold Gold Hill hotel which is right nearby the Gold Hill Hotel was purchased in 1958 by Fred Doro and it was kind of in disrepair at that time and he renovated the entire thing added a bar it was then purchased in 1986 by Carol and Bill Fain who renovated it all over again at they added a dining room um eight more modern hotel rooms upstairs a kitchen and they also added a wooden structure that wraps around the Hotel the current Gold Hill Hotel is a beautiful combination of the original brick and stone structure as well as the various wooden and other res Renovations that have made throughout the year it Blends very very beautifully it's decorated in a period style and the whole thing is kind of done that way the original building does have historic rooms including the two most haunted rooms room number four and room number five so of those five historic rooms they've all been kept true their original design room four and five both have Verandas that go off of them and room five or I believe room four has a very large claw foot tub which is super nice it looks beautiful they say that because this hotel sits on top of the site like deep underground there are the tunnels to the mines and that's where quite a few of the miners died and were buried those 11 miners that never made it out they say that one of the miners named William haunts room number five and people will say that upon walking into room number five you can smell a distinct odor of um cigar smoke like tobacco a heavy tobacco scent even though no one is smoking in that room they'll also wake up to find William sitting on the end of their bed and they can either see the full Apparition of the minor sitting there staring off into the distance or they'll just see a depression on the end of the bed as if someone is sitting there now room number four is haunted not by a minor but by a prostitute that was there and committed suicide supposedly when it was a brothel and her room is room number four and it's called Rosy's room and there's quite a few Tales of people smelling roses particularly when they go into her room and also that she will laugh and talk they can hear a young woman talking and she does like to move guess things around and she particularly likes to play hide and seek with objects so if you're staying in room number four and you you know put your watch down or your phone down and then you turn around and it's gone she likes to have people kind of look around the room to try and find their things again and then it'll be it'll turn up in a different area of the room usually someplace you've already checked multiple times and never the same place where you left it someone else mentioned that they stayed in Rosie's room and they got to smell her rose water perfume and they said as they walked by Williams room they could smell the cigar smell so it's pretty common for people to smell these smells but one story in particular I thought was really interesting and this is someone that didn't know of the hauntings when they stayed there they more stayed for the um the historic aspect of it because it's kind of a cool looking place so this person is named Richard senet and he said he stayed in the room with the huge claw foot tub which again is Rosie's room and he says as my wife slept I filled the tub and relaxed in the hot water it was then the I smelled it now mark my words when I say that it was a powerful SM powerful strong smell almost a stench smelling overwhelming of roses it was as if someone had dumped a bottle of cheap perfume on the floor intrigued I got out of the bath and began to smell everything in the bathroom close up I smelled the Soaps and shampoos but there was nothing there that had a fragrance remotely like Ros I even took a whiff of the windows and doors thinking that some trickster might be having a bit of fun with me by squirting some perfume in the room there was nothing finally just when I was convinced I had encountered the ghost it was gone the smell was no longer there not one whiff of roses the aroma leaving almost as quickly as it had come I know that's not normal so he says that that powerful smell that kind of permeated the whole room was just suddenly gone as if it had never been so he gets back in the bath thinking that that's weird and that maybe he had imagined the whole thing but almost almost as soon as he' started relaxing in the tub again the stench of roses just rolled through the whole room all over again this time he got out and searched not just the bathroom but the bedroom and the scent was just gone so the next day while talking about it he learned that other people had similar type experiences in that room he believes to this day that the hotel is haunted and he'll never forget it I've also seen some investigators that were there that feel that it wasn't an accident because they got some EVPs that referenced murder oh and a lot of murder was going on back in those days because people were trying to rob miners that's right and one of the theories is that it was possibly a rival Miner who was jealous of the silver that they were taking out of there right and that he's the one that actually set the methane fire that caused all the death not knowing that it would flood it thinking he'd kill everybody and then go mine it himself exactly and it just unfortunately caused a ripple effect in so many problems including a lot of people not wanting to go there because of the hauntings that started right after the tragedy so basically probably greed created this haunting would be my gu I think so well that and location I mean there's there's scalding hot water there's some sort of like hell likee hot water underneath like Yellow Stone with underwater exactly you've got the quartz on top and then all this gold and silver molten hot liquid that seems like a recipe to me for a place that's going to be Rife with hauntings I mean don't do anything bad there because it's like your soul will be trapped forever and then again when you're talking about like Nevada in that time frame you don't know if there was some Indian burial ground ritual space Native American tribal areas like you could run into a lot of that in that area as well well how often do they look at these places that were sacred to some type of people the Kelts or you know people in whatever country they find this plot of land that was sacred and then find underneath it is a hot spring or is some type of quartz or some other mineral or or some type of geographical anomaly that would not have been apparent to the eye but they knew it was sacred that happens over and over again all over the world and also there could be lay lines there and other things going on as far as like absolutely landwise yeah but but it's definitely haunted as [ __ ] and it's kind of super scary how clearly people hear and see these miners in their last days and and that just sounds there was a lot of miners that died in the 1800s all across the country well the the safety practices were zero they had none which is whyha was created yeah that's right exactly so yeah that's our stories for this evening shelle we've had a couple requests to kind of maybe do a ask me anything episode so I'm going to ask our
