welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and today for this Halloween hangover episode we'll be talking about which is New Year divinations charm casting for the dark half of the Year hello folks shell here and I'm really excited for this episode because here in Salem we are recovering from what is called Halloween hangover and as you all know which is New Year except for our lovely friends down under for you folks I hope the beginning of your summer is freaking fabulous and all good things for flourishing and growth and prosperity for your summer ahead but for us Northern Hemisphere folks it's really the depths of the dark time it is the witches New Year to me the start of that magical year you know I do follow the the calendar New Year um January first the big ball drop thing but this is really kind of that magical New Year's start you you know kind of like in work you know my fiscal New Year's in July my witches New Year's in October the calendar New Year's in January you know so this is kind of the time to reflect on where have I been and what is to come we just turned the clocks back here in North America and I hate it I really I'll be honest with you I love the fall back it's the spring forward I hate really you like it when it gets darker early at night no what it is is I like sleep and I like that extra hour that's really what it breaks down to really what it breaks down to I love the extra hour of sleep but that does not make up for the 6 months of dark at 5:00 p.m I hate that dude seriously like you don't even understand today I was out and it was getting dark at like 4:30 like 4:30 it is not my favorite the the one day of one hour extra sleep while wonderful and I do very much enjoy that does not make up for so dark I hate it so much you know I I have to interject something real quick here and I I know I'm getting off topic but I saw this Facebook post today and it was by it was it was posted by someone in our Pagan sphere and it was about how like the Romans and the Kelts created daylight savings time and it was hysterical but like the the reality is why are we doing this people like why are we doing this aren't we one of the few countries left that does this maybe I think so I know there's even some states in the US that don't do it um it's kind of ridiculous and I really wish we'd stop it it messes with my insides it messes with everybody but here's the thing though it kind of it's almost like that physical reminder that we are like I forget who doesn't that the dark time actually really starts in June who's thinking of the dark time come mid August right but this is like that physical reminder that like we're going deep for the next few months you know we're staying in we're hermitting looking ahead and that kind of brings us to tonight in in this topic is looking ahead to this next year to come this is the time of year especially now that I live in a place where it's very dark and very cold and very difficult to get out to happy lands I'm trying to look forward to working with the rhythm of the land uh being inside being indoors doing more crafty things uh doing more journaling I'm going to start that year of the dark goddess at Ule so definitely going within is is part of the whole theme of the season right and also with the theme of the season is divination and I think doing a a six Monon like a halfe divination one at sa and one at belain is a really great idea to give you a little bit of a glimpse at what your you know your next turn of the wheel is going to be from this major holiday to the next one whatever your favorite type of divination will be it it's just a nice thing to do to give you a set point to tell you where you're at right now with whatever the situation that you've been working on this year is this is where you're at right now this is how far you've come since you set that intention maybe a belain maybe at January 1st but this is where you're at right now now you have the rest of the dark half of the year to get yourself to where you wanted to be doing a divination right now is a great way to see where you're at and what you need to do to get where you want to go now you had to go ahead and give me a new freaking hobby of course so now I'm collecting charms you know it's funny because I think every single witch has and you all know you have it somewhere on a desk or a dresser or on a bookshelf you have a collection of little statues or trinkets or coins or little bones cute sticks that you found nice little Stones Some that were given to you some that you found you know you might have a little drawer but you all have one we're looking at you we are looking at you sh looked at her little collection and was like a I made myself a charm casting kit didn't I you know what you know what I did I just took all the  I had and put it in a bag and was like voila CH there it is but I have actually consciously started you know I I've purchased a couple things when we went and did our Workshop series at the Central New York Pagan Pride day I picked up acorns which by the way in case you didn't notice I threw some in your charm bag too you know just things I've picked up along the way and of added to it but damn what is with witches like in shiny things we all do we all do it seems like things you can put things in and shiny things it's hard to resist I love containers and shiny things and you know honestly with my divination lately I found you know you and I are both tarot Buffs uh you collect tarot I love to read tarot it's just in our blood I guess but lately I've been finding that I really like my charm casting set to give Clarity sometimes to my tarot readings I'll find that I'll pull some cards and then I'll grab some charms from my bag that kind of give more meaning and more depth to the reading now you know I just want to talk about you just said depth and meaning I want to talk a little bit about meanings of these charms because you know you go on the old Google and you know people are quick to accept other people's um correspondences definitions symbolisms whatever the hell you want to call it and you know the thing I think that I'm starting to dig about the charms is that it is so like you are not going to get a more individualized divination system than this like it doesn't get more individualized in this like you can pick which I've done hundreds of tarot decks and it's still not you know you might pick a deck that that the art calls to you or you know certain cards speak to your soul but are you going to really have that connection with 78 cards probably not but this charm thing and and how I'm starting to get addicted to this quick is these are all things that for whatever reason I have some sort of connection with and what I get out of that symbol and that charm isn't necessarily going to be the same to you and you know before we started recording we don't necess it's not like we go through each other's charm bags or anything I had asked you about a few in and did we have a couple in common and we found a charm that we had in common um a seashell and without telling you what I have written down as my definition I asked you what your definition is so just for the sake of the people tell me when you cast a sea shell for example what does that seashell mean to you so we both have a spiral sea shell and mine means goddess and inner goddess it also means divine wisdom it can also sometimes mean communication you know like when you hold a shell up to your ear and you can hear like the ocean in it so sometimes it can mean communication with your subconscious or with what your higher guides have to say to you o I like that now I uh for my shell I look at it as uh cleansing and messages and I think where I pull that from is you know shells are in the ocean and the ocean I look at as like a carrier of messages I think of like a message in a bottle and the ocean I look as a cleanser so to me I look at it as cleansing and messages so we both have a shell with absolutely different types of meanings yeah and and for me looking at this shell it's the spiral it's the Fibonacci spiral and that to me is feminine it's feminine wisdom it's that deep inner knowledge I mean they look a little bit like a vulva and so that also says to me feminine and goddess and deep wisdom and because they're in the water water has to do with your subconscious with emotions and so that's where a lot of those ties come to me but you you hit on a very good point for that is that that's what is so beautiful about a charm set is that you will call upon some things that are Universal um but you'll also very much call upon your own deep personal meanings to these you know this shell I have similar to your one with a hole in it it feels smooth you know sometimes shells are are are rough and you can feel the ridges this is very smooth you can tell it's it's had its time in the water you know the water has just lapped over it enough times to take those grooves out it's cleansed it like that and as the water has traveled over it and then travels around the world it can send those messages send that communication and so I guess that's where my meaning comes from but neither one of us are right or wrong we're both we're both right because that's how it resonates when you throw it and that's how it resonates when I throw it it's very similar to the idea of Tea Leaf reading uh when you're when you're doing tassio mancy and you're looking at the way that the leaves are sitting in the bottom of the cup they form pictures and while there are are some Universal meanings to images I mean if you see a car almost everyone will think travel or something similar to that effect but it could mean you're getting a car it could mean that someone's moving away from you and that's going to depend on the reader and your own intuition so some things will be relatively Universal But A lot's going to really depend on the reader and the querent to be honest you know and I I equate it also to the strength card in the Tarot deck you know strength is strength the strength and and we all get that concept but I love kitty cats I love all felines if I could have a lion and a tiger baby in my house I would I swear I would so to me when I see that lion card I'm looking at strength in a a good positive way whereas someone who is deathly afraid of cats and Feline creatures they might look at strength as having to persevere through the storm you know get through a very horrible you know get through a bad situation because we just have different views of that symbolism but that doesn't negate either of us before we started recording you showed me your list you know all your charms written out and you've written down next to each one of them what they each mean and I I love that yes journaling I hate that you just have to point that out all the time I like to say I like to say I write things down and you just have to put a word on it call it whatever you want but I got you there but I I think that that's important because again you know what means something to me might mean something different to you you know like for example um I have a domino in my set and the reason I have that Domino is because my grandparents that was like one of their pastimes with playing dominoes so to me that reminds me of like you know that family and togetherness whereas a domino could mean a million things to a million other people but I I like the concept of writing it down because it almost infuses the power behind it you know what I'm saying yeah definitely reinforces it for you for sure almost like it goes from being just a domino to being a magical Domino of divination yeah and once you write it down it gives it more power because now you've reinforced what it means and I also recommend that when you do a reading write down the pattern like if you if you do some type of underlay it like say you do a past present future reading where you designate part of the table in front of you as past present future or put some type of mat that has different sections on it when you throw your charms to help give even more meaning to where they fall write down what your pattern is write down where they fall and write down what your charms meant in that reading just like you would with tarot just like with you're practicing with tarot because you might find that that Domino means something slightly different if your Domino keeps coming up as chance and not family you know you might need to kind of respect the fact that that Domino wants to chance instead you know so writing your readings and keeping track of the meanings and how they change over time is important as well honestly right now I'm still at the grab bag stage I pull one like I I'm still at the grab bag stage I'm getting it I'm working on it I have some weird charms and I think that's also a good reason to write down the definitions because like I'll give you a couple examples I have three coins in here one coin has John F Kennedy on it one coin has Queen Elizabeth on it and one coin has King Charles on it shout out to my British folks it's funny I have three coins too so tell me about yours and then I'll tell you about my three coins so my JFK coin that that reminds me of false dreams it it's just it's what I think of I don't know I you know the whole Camelot fell so the JFK coin I look at is kind of faal dreams you know kind of coming to the reality and and working around the reality of things my Queen Elizabeth coin you know kind of that old order and tradition following tradition you know you do it because you were told to do it my King Charles coin New Order and updating tradition nothing wrong with tradition but you know it is 2024 so you know I don't know what the hell other people would have those three coins mean but to me to me shall me those three coins mean those things to me and so if I'm doing a reading and I pull out JFK I'm going to be like I got some because camelot's crumbling you know what I'm saying I do so I think it's kind of cool that I also have three coins and I'm going to show you because mine are weird coins so this one is a dime but if you can see does it have a bullet hole in it it looks like it was shot sort of this dime was actually caught inside a washing machine and I fixed the washing machine and pulled this dime out and it had gotten caught and worn down so much that like the edges are worn off it's smooth the face part of the coin is smooth this coin means two different things when it shows up in a reading it can mean perseverance and it can also mean like the ghost in the machine that causes problems that you're not aware of like underlying problems that you that you might not see such Tower vibes from that coin I guess so in the form of like Enlightenment Maybe cuz I found the source of the problem but this is more like the pee underneath all of the mattresses for the princess you know the the problem that you can feel but you can't quite see I think that's interesting that we both have a coin that could be a problem coin right I also have this coin here is a pressed Penny and it's a pressed Penny from the Philadelphia Zoo nice I got this when I went down to the university to do a presentation about witchcraft um back in the early 2000s and so I got this when we went to visit the zoo afterwards and this Penny actually is flat on one side and has a tiger on the other and this can mean following your dreams if the tiger comes up but if it's the flat side up then it can be things that prevent you from following your dreams like like a slippery slope like things that you might slip on less roadblocks and more slippery things like more things that might Veer you off schedule or might take you away from what you're doing and my last coin is this big one and it's got like a a soldier on one side oh that's super cool isn't that neat it's oversized and on the other it almost looks like a mapole that's your more expressive side that's the joy of new beginnings it's Liberation it it's expression and being yourself and the joy that that can bring the side with the soldier represents responsibility following the rules falling in line you're like straight laced in the military and strict or it's dancing around the belaine maple necky dancing right so these coins don't really have anything to do with money it has more to do with what they look like where I got them like you said your own personal stories are attached you know honestly the thing I have um in my in my charm bag that is for you know Luck Good Fortune Prosperity doll dollas uh let's get shell out of her day job is actually a green stone um so my coins are in there for anything Prosperity Financial related um I actually have a green stone in there for that but you know sometimes you get weird keepsakes from friends that end up in your charm bag and I just for the sake of this being the sake of I have to mention this particular charm I have when I was still located in New York state and at my day job I had a coworker that was like this guy literally went to church twice a week um very very very strict Roman Catholic wonderful man and we always had this agree to disagree relationship like he totally respected me I totally respected him there was even a time where where my children's grandmother uh had my son do a religious thing and I went to my co-workers Church to watch my son do this and hung out with my cooworker when he retired he decided to give away everything at his death desk instead of him getting gifts he wanted to gift us with his desk and is a funny haha at the time at the time it was a funny haha being the only witch he knew he gave me his pocket Rosary that he kept in his desk it's a little round pocket rosary and I took it actually to be honest with you he's also the one who gave me the JFK coin and he gave me this pocket Rosary is kind of a a joke between us about our religious differences because he knew that I am a Sentimental fool and that I would keep it and cherish it because it was his which I did um unfortunately a year or two later he passed away and this little pocket Rosary even though it kind of is not anything I believe in it stays in my charm bag partially as a reminder of him but I kind of get those that strict organization fall in line Soldier that is what I what I take from this particular thing when it comes up like almost like that Catholic way Doctrine you know that that fall in line Soldier yeah don't ask questions just do what I say do what you're told but as weird as it would be for me of all people to have something like that in my charm bag the sentimental value behind it is something that would mean nothing to anybody else but means everything to me you know what I mean yeah my grandmother who passed when she was 100 one of the things I got when she passed was her Order of the Eastern Star pendant I love that and I am not into the Order of the Eastern Star I you know that's Masonic very Christian but this is in my charm bag and you know it has meaning that has nothing to do with the order of the easn star Christians or Masons because again it's it's personal and this is the time of year to try new divination sets to do a divination on yourself to kind of lay out some tarot cards grab your charms and do a little introspection you know kind of do a little bit of of Shadow work and kind of get into yourself a little bit you know this is where it can get fun too is is you mentioned earlier the the combining um charms and Tarot you know for example I have a Santa key it's it's a little key with a Santa head on it and I kind of look at that as like a like a family uh you know generosity joyfulness kind of symbol and I did do a reading right before sa and I was looking at charms and that charm kept popping out to me and yes sa is what it is but there can be some joy in that Veil thinning some joy in that new year some generosity and and you know Goodwill and all of that and you know here in Salem sometimes at that time of year Goodwill is just not yelling at tourists and you know sometimes I I noticed that the charms and by doing that my point is is that it can almost like you said make that like next level of depth in your reading yeah taking it to the next level it sounds like you've been using it a lot have you been using your charm set pretty regularly I have like I said just just as like one puls like like grab bag you know stick your hand in a bag feel around what P do you grab kind of thing haven't I I I'm struggling with the spread thing because I don't necessarily like any of the spread formats I've come across yet yeah have you tried um have you tried doing one that's cut into quadrants for quarters like north east south and west yeah but then I was just like well what does this all mean to me like so good I throw a domino in the west what is this you know what I mean right the pattern has to make sense to you a lot like a Tarot um a Tarot spread what you use to cast on has to make sense like are you just doing a pull or are you actually casting them on a table and Counting meaning by where they fall on the table and how they fall in relationship to each other you know I never thought of it that way just kind of tossing it out because you know I can I can have my own sense of North southeast west without having to you know laid out on a cloth but just kind of toss and out see what lands where exactly like that and that's kind of what I've been doing a lot lately is laying out a Tarot spread and then toss some charms on top of that just to give more meaning and Clarity sometimes you know I love Tarot spreads you know I love making up new tarot spreads laying out a Tarot spread and using that is my quote unquote cloth um what charms land on what cards what charms don't land on any card yeah me personally I would take it as because I still have a small set I mean probably 15 20 charms um you know me that will grow exponentially but I would personally take that as if I threw my bag on my spread if a charm didn't land on a card it was irrelevant and needs to go back in the bag you know like how you Shuffle the cards and not all of them get laid out that's really close to how I do it I usually you know lay my cards out and then I'll reach into my charm bag and usually just grab a small handful or just a couple and drop them onto the the reading and I do count the ones that don't land on cards their meaning adds to the position of the card so say the charm Falls next to a card that's in the obstacles position of your reading maybe the crocodile I have this crocodile pin that comes up and uh it means problems that aren't as big as you think they are so maybe that'll come up in the obstacles so I'll know that the obstacles are really all in my own head you know so it that's how it'll add to that meaning whether it's on the card or near the card its placement in that tarot spread will kind of help to clarify the meaning of the cards here's the problem my sweet brain has with mixing the charms and the tarot somewhere in my brain I feel like because there's 78 cards I need 78 charms I was waiting for you say because you have 227 tarot decks you need 227 different sets of arms we're not there yet let's just don't push me over the edge woman but like because and that was part of the reason that I thought that it would be beneficial to write down my personal definitions because like you said you know you you start collecting a bunch of stuff and maybe you have two things that kind of have that same meaning for you and then dare I say meditate um maybe you need to meditate on which one you really should be using yeah yeah or maybe like what happened to me is you know I collect things because I like them or they look cool or I'm drawn to them in some way but as I start reading with them I'm like well you know that cool piece of seal glass doesn't really add anything to any of the readings it shows up in so I like it but I'm going to take it out of my set for now that's so funny that's so funny because today today I was like you know what I should put a piece of seal glass that Lea gave me into my charm bag and then I was like you know but what would it really mean and then I didn't do it funny that I had a piece of seag glass in and it never meant anything it never really worked I thought it would mean something like persevering through like the water making it softer or something but it never it never worked out that way it didn't stick what did work though is I have this piece of um ceramic that I found while I was on Lake onio piece of nicotine gum does it it's about the size of like a chicklet like a chicklet piece of gum right but it's it's ceramic and it's very smooth because it was in Lake Ontario for you know the gods know how long but it's black on one side and white on the other so this is my yes no piece so not seal glass but it's technically like beach ceramic close enough now I I remember when when I first started collecting which wasn't too long ago as you recall things just started falling into my path yeah little charms were falling into my path and I think one thing that I wanted to to definitely point out is a charm can be a necklace pendant that's not on a necklace they can be actual charms that you buy at the store right but two I wanted to point out at my day job which remember folks we're all we're all praying to the gods to get shell out of her day job so I'm at my day job and I go outside to smoke a cigarette don't judge me and I look down on the ground because you know here you know in it's been a crazy crazy month in Salem like 1.2 million visitors I looked down and there was an earring on the ground and it caught my eye so I pick it up it was a little green witch hat with gold stars on it that's so cute so I took the earring piece off of it and put it in my charm bag and it kind of reminds me of that you know I have a pentacle in my bag that has that more spiritual meaning and but this is that more fun magical side is is what it means to me and that was actually supposed to be an earring and then around the same time I went to work one day and I had a wonderful coworker very religious in her own right gave me a keychain pendant and it says Be Strong be brave be Fearless you are never alone and I was like that's a damn good message for my charm bag so I took it off the keychain and put that in my charm bag so it doesn't have to be like a key or a coin or you know it could be a pendant or or like the witch hat an earring or like this is a this is an old cup from like a monopoly set or something like that a PE cup looks like a symbol yeah well I do have one of those as well this is an antique thimble look at this little basket that the thimble came in oh my God was that made by fairies I love the basket better than the thimble symbolizes craftsmanship but it's a basket with a top that has a thimble inside it it's an antique it's very cool but there's a couple different stages of collecting charms that I think most you find first of all when you first decide to collect charms you're going to a discover that you already have a set somewhere right and then B you're gonna be obsessive about it then you're G to start seeing them everywhere all of a sudden charms that need to go in your charm kit are going to show up everywhere I need a charm here's the thing right now I I'm hell bat on finding a charm which I have not found yet like I need a charm of an owl I'm trying to find a charm of an owl oh yes yeah you will you'll find an owl I'm sure this owl keeps hanging out at my house it's so weird and there's a reason for it so now I want a damn owl charm yeah so you probably need one I do it becomes very addictive a cheaper addiction than tarot I'll put that out there I mean I suppose you could get very expensive charms but that's kind of the cool thing is I mean I have some old bones in mind but I also have sticks oh see I can't do bones yuck yuck yuck yeah that's okay you don't need to do bones in a charm set they do not have to be bones but we've already determined that they do have to have meaning to you and you should write those meanings down another thing that you could do some do some don't is to cleanse your charms when you get them sh do you do any type of cleansing or charging of your charms okay so here's the situation on that you know like I said some of these things like the the little green witch like I literally found that on the ground on the streets of Salem it was an earring which means it was actually like in someone's ear gaining all their energy hell yeah hell yeah I cleansed it but there are certain things that I've purposefully intentionally not and I will I will get to that in a second and why I have this consecration recipe oil recipe that I want to share with y'all for a second here spritzer bottle spray it on stuff voila quick and easy frankincense myrrh cinnamon cassia oil and olive oil as a base if you don't like those scents try Sandalwood Cur orange pachuli again with olive oil base sometimes I'll rub it sometimes I'll spray it depends on my mood or what it is but a couple of things that I will not kind of exercise the demons from you know is things like one thing is a hematite ring that I wore for several years but I am the person who wore it it was me it's my ju guu in that right I'm okay with that like I said before when I mentioned the pocket Rosary um from my friend that passed away I don't want to cleanse that because I don't want to cleanse his energy from that and then again with my Domino um I don't want to cleanse the energy from that because that has my grandparents energy oozed into it and and so you know what it is and why I have it and how I obtained it will dictate if I do or don't most of the time yes but again there are particular things that for specific reasons no I will not yep 100% agree I have cleansed some things for the same reasons and I have not cleansed things for the exact same reasons uh I do my cleansing a little bit differently do you remember when we got those little wooden bowls when you were up here that one time right we got those cute little bowls I love those I mean I have a ton of different types of bowls and things but these are perfect these particular ones um were actually carved out of olive wood and they're beautiful and I love them and they're not very big they're about hand size so they're a good size to put just a couple charms in and what I like to do to cleanse new charms is I will put some sea salt in the bottom of that or if I really think it needs to be cleansed I'll put some of my black salt in there but most of the time I just put salt in the bottom and then I'll either throw in maybe a little bit of Rosemary or maybe I'll put cinnamon in it instead but some type of cleansing herb as well U maybe if I've got some garden sage or something whatever I have on hand that says cleansing to me I'll toss in with the salt and then I'll put the charms in there and I'll just let them stay in that like overnight or for several days or whatever with the intention of cleansing that energy if I'm worried about the metal or the stone or whatever I'm putting in there might interact with the salt I do have some sand from a couple different places that are important to me that I also use as a base for cleansing spells and for things like money bowls and stuff like that so if you're worried about the salt you can always use sand or something else see now in the past I would have probably done a smoke cleanse um created my own inscense for the purpose and then done a smoke cleanse but for some reason I'm just into oils right now yeah exactly there's so many different ways I think we've we've mentioned an airway you can do a smoke cleanse you can do a candle cleanse you can a fire way you can pass it over a candle the Waterway with shells oils or now you finally have a way to use up all that Moon water you've got sitting around your house use that to cleanse your charms and trinkets that you put in your charm bag right depending on what you're using or what your charm is you may or may not want to put oil on it so that might dictate how you do it yeah mine is more of an earthy way with the herbs and with the wooden bowl and the salt so maybe you want to do all of them maybe you just want to pick one honestly sometimes mine's mood dependent what am I what am I in the mood to do exactly or what I have on hand might depend on what's left in my kitchen right now how I do it right right so the next thing is cleansing some not cleansing others I do like to charge my items or not exactly charge but I do like to kind of carry them around and kind of charge them with a purpose you know so that they know they're part of a divination set you know hold it think about its meaning write it down work with it that kind of thing um I kind of have this because I keep them in a little bag I initially I I've done it a couple of different times because you know always add into it kind of like meditated over the bag itself instead of individual pieces and kind of I almost want to say remind the pieces what I've intended them for does that make sense that fits in really well with one of the next points I wanted to make which is that sometimes instead of doing a reading I'll grab my charms and my charm journal and then I'll just do a random pull and kind of a check-in like does the charm still resonate with the meaning that I have written down does it still feel the same way to me does it still hold the same resonance as it did before kind of like a Vibe check with the charms does it still feel like this meaning that I wrote exactly and kind of go through and realign the energy of it you can also readjust if you need to to a new meaning and that's also a good way to add new pieces to your set as well it's like bringing someone in it's like bringing someone into the friend group you know you have to you almost have to like initiate them into the friend group and then they're one of the guys yeah and you want to get that energy those atoms in alignment with what you're doing right with your intention we're all here for divination folks yeah that's what we're here for kind of wake them up you can even some people like to talk to their items particularly if it's crystals or some or Metals something like that they you might want to let them know that they're there for divination kind of like how I talk to my tarot cards exactly how you talk to your tarot cards it it it's kind of like um my conversation with the fool the other night I feel like I'm the fool again great place to be actually that is an interesting place to be especially this time of year you know I mean kind of going in and and doing that introspection and doing those readings for yourself seeing where you're at and seeing where you want to go this is the perfect time of year to you know sit down with yourself and take a look and use whatever form of divination you like to do that now I have one more thing I'd like us to do before we wrap up for today you have your charm set close by correct I do yep right here okay so I want you to how ever you do it I don't care how you do it I'm a blind picker um I want you to pick out three charms for me and I am going to go into my charm set and I am going to blindly pick out three charms for you and then we're going to talk about that for a second that sounds very fun all right give me two seconds to put everything back in the bag okay so I have my charms in my pretty purple charm bag I got them in my green velvet bag are you using it Ipsy bag no I wish it was an Ipsy bag it's but it's just a nice pretty purple bag all right you tell me when and I will grab three charms as soon as you say stop okay wait are you getting them all at the same time or you going to pull one then pull another then pull another I'll pull one and then another and then another okay I'm doing it at the same time Ready Set pull charm one oh okay all right ready set Paul charm to interesting okay all right last one ready set pull charm three interesting okay so what did you pull for my first charm Acorn hat when we went and and it's so funny because I mentioned this earlier when we went to um Central New York pag and pride day remember I was picking up acorns on the ground my Acorn and its little hat it was perfect when I got it but the Hat fell off and I picked the hat for you the acorn hat I love the backstory so what does the Pagan Pride day Acorn hat mean in my opinion and we all have different opinions um I have growth and planning ahead o okay okay and I think I get I think I get the planning ahead because I think of like a squirrel filling his cheeks for the winter okay I like that what was your first charm for me okay so the first thing that you got was a piece of chalk I thought that was a cigarette for a second right no not in this charm set but it is a piece of chalk and chalk has been associated with magic and magicians and ritual for a very long time you know people use chalk to write the chalk circles around themselves to make a magical protective Circle or to write runes or sigils but it's very often associated with magic work so in my charm set it stands for either the ability to write your own future or a need for protection and in this particular reading I think it stands out for a little bit of both definitely need to be protected secure your base and then start writing charms for the future okay the second charm I pulled for you was my beautiful skeleton key is is a is a follower of hiate the first thing that comes to me is hiate and Crossroads but also opening doors and I don't know where the hell I get this from but like solving Mysteries solving solving something that that you've been that you've been trying to go for I don't want to say puzzle ain't the right word but solving a mystery solving a puzzle getting something solved but again my initial is is hkat and those Crossroads but that's just you know how I am what I got for you was the big coin the belain coin I got the the mapole for you thank God you got the mapole side because I'm so sick of being serious what I think that this means is that there is a a time of rry coming up for you because the serious face is underneath that is your base you have a solid base of strength of um being regimented you know of being orderly I guess and so because you have done such a good job taking care of the responsible side you are going to be able to reap the benefits of the Happy Spring the the joyous friendships and being out in the sun you know everything that Mayday that Bel you know this fertile happy joyous time of life so what this really says to me is this dark time is going to be taking care of the business part of it like taking care of what you have to and then by May things are going to be looking up things are going to be more joyous and and easier life will be easier then as long as you take care of what you need to now the hidden things the responsible things I'm on board for that hell yeah what's the third charm bring us okay so the third charm I picked for you is actually a little pearl bead oh I love pearls I have a bunch of feelings about pearls that I've written down long awaited dreams coming and I think the reason I think that is because of how long it takes for a pearl to become a pearl you know it's like a diamond it takes like for freaking ever so it's like that patience taking the time to gain that wisdom you know what I mean yes and like you said about your shell I I feel the same with a pearl resilience you know it's it's in this little shell and it's trying to make its way through the ocean but there's there's definitely that transformation that resilience but for me again like I said I I I have written down in my book things like that long awaited dream you know the patience paying off you know you waited long enough and now is your time I love that yes okay I I accept that so what's my third charm man your third charm is the peeter teacup oh I love tea isn't that great and this typically means self-care it's having that warm cup of tea at night it can mean divination I love it so it changes a little bit depending on who it is and so for you this means not just taking time to take care of yourself but being in a good space physically and mentally to take care of yourself being in a good magical space like this is sipping magical tea and then eating your tea leaves afterwards and I'm feeling very good and confident and happy with it like how you feel when you have a good cup of tea you know but I also take it as taking the time away from the the hubub of life to have that cup of tea to do that work yes to do that self-care to do that magical work both of those things physical mental take care of yourself so all of these here are telling me you know the three of them together tells me that you need to kind of draw out some space for yourself take time for yourself and then actually go within for rewards in May around belain that things are really going to start to look up for you after you do this magical Shadow internal work you know after you draw those boundaries May is really going to be your blossoming time really because that's when I turn the big fiveo BL I think with yours you know with with the Little Acorn hat um and the key and the Pearl it's kind of that sense of unlock in potential like your potential has always been on the brink your potential has been on the brink since the day I met you 30 freaking years ago it's not a good thing but it's it's unlocking it and and almost coming to term coming to terms with who you really are shedding off that shell like the Pearl sheds the shell and becomes This Magnificent thing that is very highly coveted it's almost like you need to unlock the door to remind yourself that especially me you are highly coveted in my eyes and I think sometimes you need to to highly covet yourself how damn good point but why you got to call me out like that I think that's where the acorn comes in you need to wear the hat I call it an acorn hat you need to wear that hat of your potential I prefer to call it a crown thank you okay you need to wear the acorn crown of your potential that's right my Acorn crown of potential absolutely and you need to sip the tea of surrender and selfcare well right now I'm sipping New York State apple cider that's almost as good I think it is it is all right well with that
