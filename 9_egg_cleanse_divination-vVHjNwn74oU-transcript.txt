join us as we get back on the broomstick I'm your co-host shell I'm your co-host Lea before we get into our main topic of egg cleanses and different ways that you can cleanse your energy shell we were just talking about how you were thinking about doing one of those online programs where you can purchase land in Scotland or in England and become a lady right so which is it going to be when I did my ancestry DNA it came up like 62% English and Welsh and I got no business buing land in Scotland with that DNA history Robert the Bruce is one of my direct ancestors so Scotland all the way I gotta so

of my DNA pattern um comes from England and Wales so yeah I want to buy a plat of land and be an English lady but we will be bring peace to their lands yeah or we'll just try to gobble up everybody in between us and have one big Kingdom that's right we'll just turn it into a big Pagan witchy cannabis loving happy Fest Kingdom queendom it'll be a queendom that's right we'll either have to be dual Queens oh no no no I want you be the queen are you sure I would like to be your mysterious royal advisor o you'd be like you'd be like Morgan Le you'd be like that's right I'll be the dark and shadowy

be beautiful as the Dawn and beneficent and glorious to everyone they will love us and fear us this is why we're great this probably why no one gives us power because we go straight to World Domination absolutely but it would be a fun world even though itation it would be a fun world you know we'd have drum circles every night bonfires drum circles lots of cannabis woohoo naked hot tubbing oo it you know it's getting to be hot tub season it is and let me just tell you pagans of the world please naked hot tub responsibly make sure your cracks are clean make shower first please [ __ ] shower first if I see one more dirty Pagan try to clean his nasty toenails in a hot tub I'll vomit on I am so icked out sometimes so icked out I usually avoid the hot tubs around Festival time the place where I like to get a seasonal it's nice when it's quiet and clean because icky I'm sorry icky that's just a disrespect thing in my opinion because I understand as one of these happy free hippie Pagan folk that you know you're at a festival I get it you might go a weekend or a week without a shower whatever I ain't judging yeah be a dirty Pagan we don't care most of these places next to their hot tubs they have like a rinse off station of sorts you might not want to call it a full-on shower but like something where you can kind of cleanse yourself physically before getting in do it use it nobody wants your dirty crusty crack getting in that thing and then here's the worst part those are the ones that are always like hey baby right the stinky ones the ones that are pulling up their callous toenails and gouging out the gods knows what from underneath them while they're trying to come on to you in the hot tub ew or stuff is bubbling off of their lower regions that ising off in the water bubbling to the surface everyone else is like slowly or in some cases not so slowly getting the [ __ ] out of the tub yes please wash yourselves cleanliness is Next to Godliness and and you know what that that is definitely the case but let me tell you one thing about about communal hot tubs you see the greatest tattoos the greatest tattoos and I I I got to just quick recall a time where we also saw the greatest piercings a nice gentleman probably in his mid to Upper 70s fully covered Head To Toe with colorful bright colored hummingbirds yes the hummingbird guy with all the flowers I was waiting for an opening to be like do you mean the hummingbird guy yeah like the hummingbird guy and it wasn't so much that he was in his mid to late 70s and covered head to toe and brightly covered hummingbirds gorgeous tattoos and amazing piercings the best part was the Jacob's Ladder yeah yeah I had never seen one of those personally i' I've seen a few um Prince Alberts couple others but never a fall Jacob's Ladder before impressive never a full Jacob ladder on a man of his age and stature yeah nipples pierced everything pierced all I had to say to that man was Bravo bravoo fly your freak flag get in this hot tub and let's talk about these hummingbird tattoos wonderful guy well spoken intelligent great to talk to seemed very comfortable in his own beautifully decorated skin and I aspire to that level of confidence that was a good communal experience love Pagan events for that type of blending of people the heathen soup yeah that's exactly what it is is Heathen soup Sometimes good sometimes bad but always interesting we're both kind of looking around and getting back into things how are you doing with like your daily practices or or daily witchy stuff sh you know actually I am still uh we talked about this the last episode I am still engulfing myself in Catching and rewatching and watching for the first time um some of the work shops and seminars from witcon so I am still kind of immersed in that you know that is bringing up a lot of points to me making me want to reconnect with certain practices I am very much immersing myself still in this like I said last last episode about a hundred workshops to get through they're about an hour hour and 15 minutes each and I work a full-time job so as you can imagine I'm not done yet yeah it's not like a summer time festival or something where you can take a week off and then go to all the workshops but it is nice that you can do it at your own pace does it still have now you seem to have the glow and what I'm talking about is after a festival or a really good class or witchy Workshop you feel the magic I just watched a workshop before we started recording today so yeah that's got to be it you're feeling that reconnection feeling really witchy and Pagan and wanting to do things is that that kind of energy yeah absolutely you know reading a book or getting online and and reading some information or watching a Tik Tock or what have you you know that can kind of Jar things within you but when you are in a workshop or in a seminar and granted because I'm I'm I'm watching these now recorded I can't interact via chat there's still that air of connection right you're not getting that off a damn Wiki how okay right right and me personally I'm not getting that off Tik Tok I am very entertained by the stuff on Tik Tok but I'm not feeling some sort of level of connection whereas you're feeling it during these seminars and workshops yes I love that you mentioned Tik Tok because part of the focus of this episode is going to be on spiritual cleanses and particular one of the popular things on Tik Tok egg cleanses and this is a very very old practice this is something that you and I are familiar with from decades ago this is not an uncommon thing it's just kind of blown up on what people are calling witch talk it's turned into the quote unquote popular thing at the moment like how tarot made their made its thing way around and everybody and their brother was doing tarot because it was cool then everybody was doing Ouija boards because they were cool now everybody's doing egg cleanses because they're cool some of the Reddit boards I'm on are so fed up I think with the inundation of help me read this egg cleanse that they pretty much have like standard answers and even I went on there and I was like hey I I want to talk about some egg cleanses I'm about to do and they're like no right I'm like I'm about to do my first one and I just want to know do you have you had any good experiences bad experiences any tips or tricks and they're like no just go here for your divination and I'm like I didn't ask I don't want a divination I just want to talk about what you think and they were like no go here for divinations and I'm like all right okay no problem you've been burned I feel that it's kind of like think of Stairway to Heaven on the radio people are just so sick of hearing it they're over it no one wants to hear it whereas it is still hugely popular in places like Tik Tok it is a very simple and easy spell and it's actually a really really good one I highly recommend it cleansing your aura cleansing your energy magically cleansing yourself in your space is something that people very often do before they do a ritual or a spell and it's something that you should incorporate into your daily or routine practice as just a a regular good magic IAL habit I kind of look at this you have two options here you can just do a typical egg cleanse you don't necessarily have to do the Divination piece yes the Divination piece in my opinion is more like a part two I'm so glad you mentioned that because they can be separated right they can be two completely different things or you can roll it all into one happy ball of cleansing and divination I think it's important to point out that they they are absolutely Ely two different activities you often see them listed as kind of one especially now the Divination part everyone one wants to know is my ex coming back do I have an evil eye on me has someone hexed me it's very popular right now does he love me right but let what are we talking about when we talk about and we'll start with an egg cleanse and then we'll get into a more talking about Aura and magical cleanses but specifically what is an egg cleanse I kind of look at it as like you know how we've talked in the past about you can take a a cleansing shower where you're Imagining the shower hitting over you in the water just cleansing all that negativity away yes exactly I kind of look at the egg as a similar thing now I laugh because I try to cleanse my egg first with salt and lemon but then you know I was doing I I I did an egg cleanse the other day for because we were doing this episode and I'm laughing because I got too much lemon on the egg when I was cleansing it then after I cleanse my egg with my salt and lemon then I kind of roll it over over myself my whole face smelled like lemon I didn't wait for maybe you needed a little extra cleansing or protection on your face I know right I'm dripping lemon down my face here laughing my ass off I'm just glad you didn't get any in your eyes thankfully no but you know I just kind of look at it as a sucking all of the yeah exactly if there's any ook it's going to suck it off we've talked about sympathetic magic before like for like things and eggs are seen as alike it's a life it is life it it is a new beginnings it is absolute newness people in ancient Greece used to do ritual cleansings with eggs it's popular in appal and folk magic and what's currently popular now is more the Mexican version limpia Deo again it's because these eggs repres present new life and beginnings and so they're seen as very potent and magical the shell is seen as kind of porous so it can suck those energies in and the Egg itself is soft and spongy so it can kind of hold absorb it exactly absorb and hold the negative energy which then stays inside the shell until you crack it that's the like shell said that's the second part of the spell the first part is using this egg to pull in all the negative energy off you and I've seen it done two ways the current popular way way that you'll see all over the place is lightly circling the egg or wiping the egg either on your body lightly or in just above your body in your energetic field in your magic field all over your body from head to toe while you're doing that envisioning it absorbing the negative energy that you might have then you can either just dispose of the egg or if you want to do the Divination part crack it into a jar of water which of course is what we did now they say at that point you're not supposed to look at it directly from the top and the reasoning for that is because the glass will help Shield you from the negative energy that the egg has absorbed if you look directly down at the egg that negative energy can then come and reinfect your aura so you're supposed to look at the egg from the side and then there's different ways to interpret the patterns so how did yours turn out now I was actually kind of surprised because I guess sometimes when you do this you have this expectation of it's yanking all this negativity away from you and reality my egg was a little less negative than I thought it didn't have a lot to pull um a little stringy there was a couple strings going right down the center to the bottom but I didn't have a crazy egg I started out the same way cleansing the egg I used salt and lemon juice and running water cleansed the egg meditated with it ran it all through my energy and had it suck up everything cracked it in the glass and they say You're supposed to wait like what like 10 minutes something like that yeah something like that so I waited about the 10 minutes and all I saw was the entire inside of the class was coated with little teeny tiny bubbles and there was a couple strings but nothing much from what I understand the little teeny tiny bubbles mean actually good energy oh let me see if I can find it small bubbles in the water show that any negativity has been removed and so mine was like kind of full of it when you showed me yours and it looked very similar to mine I actually wasn't surprised at all because how often shell do you do some type of cleansing I try you know I try to do it frequently especially recently because it's habit forming and it's a good way to get back in the groove and get back on the broomstick it's to get yourself into these patterns again that has been something I've been trying to do and you know I I do work a day job a 9o5 and let me tell you there is definitely the need to be cleansing yourself a negative energy from full-time work as magical people that's what we do you know you do a meditation and you ground you cleanse our daily showers sometimes become quick cleansing spells or ritual I think that's what it is I think it's I I utilize my shower way too much for for cleansing rituals as well as you know there's nothing wrong with being clean folks refer to our hot tub hot tub story here I just have kind of trained myself to be habitual cleansed you know I mean there's nothing wrong with that there's absolutely nothing wrong with that no that actually that's a great practice and it's part of being a responsible magical person you should regularly cleanse those things you should regularly go through the magical and energetic attachments that you have and sever the ones that no longer serve you sever the ones that are no longer healthy we should be doing regular magical cleansing I kind of put that on my personal hygiene list my daily personal hygiene you know you you get up you take a shower you brush your teeth you cleans your [ __ ] and off you go that's right I mean I I just I've kind of just worked that into my quote unquote personal hygiene routine just as much as I cleanse my body I cleanse my soul as best I can exactly and it should become a habit so some of the things that that shell mentioned are simple this egg cleansing super simple if you like that and that resonates with you that's a cleansing that you can do very easily maybe once a month or something like that it's a very strong cleansing but there's other ones that you can do daily like the shower cleansing spell that we've talked about before which can be as simple as imagine the water from your shower washing all the negativity evil eye what have you down the drain now let me ask you this what is your opinion I've seen stuff where people have said that if your uh water has an odor or if your Yol is like you know how sometimes you can have blood in the yolk or the yolk is a little discolored I've seen places where people have said that is kind of a sign that you have like negative Spirits or extreme negative energy attached to you what is your opinion on that or did you just get a shitty egg to do an egg cleanse with you know if you are doing these cleansings I do think that that can be a sign that you have some negative energy I wouldn't take it too far I would do a second one you know because if you have that much negative energy you would benefit from a second cleanse anyways and then I would incorporate cleanses regularly into my routine and kind of try to to Divine where that comes from I do remember seeing something like an egg cleanse uh back in the early 90s I went to I don't know I don't believe it was at Lilydale but I remember the person was associated with lyale I don't remember his name I was at kind of an event where he was talking about this and he had people in the audience I wasn't one of them have eggs and he just had them hold eggs and he had them hold these eggs the entire time and then after he was done talking about cleansing and read people's auras and things like that he had them come up and crack the eggs into glasses and then he would do a reading on them much like a tarot reading or any type of other divination that you would do and he would go through and he would read them from top to bottom just by looking at what was going on in the egg in their glass and it he said it was from their hands as they put their energy and then as it heated up from the energy in their hands and as you as a raiki practitioner know that's someplace you can concentrate energy right right right and so that was a way that a divination could be done so I do believe that you will get Clues as to what might be going on to you maybe there's an illness maybe you're going through some stress you know maybe someone is sending evil energy your way and so I think doing a second egg cleanse would give you a little bit more insight you can always back up any of that with a good sitdown meditation session as well and pull some cards the first thing I would do if if my egg cleanse had shown anything other than I was cleansed and protected I would pull cards first thing grab my trusty Tarot deck and slam down some cards immediately to get more clarity because I'm not an egg reader I mean I had kind of an idea and I could kind of get a general I could read an egg but I had to kind of look online to see what the meanings meant whereas cards speak to me so that that would give me much more detail than maybe doing another egg cleanse and you know tarot I I I kind of do the same thing tarot is like my back up wait I need a clear message here you know because I do that with the te Leaf reading you know if I'm confused or if something looks arai in a teaf reading I am pulling those cards right pulling those cards it's like speaking a second language I I only speak very little egg cleanse you know I I can enough to get by but I am fluent in Tarot so I can have a better conversation with spirit and with whatever is going on that way I love that analogy that's so perfect oh thanks that is so perfect but you know just just to kind of touch on some of the other things I looked up some of the different symbols um because again we're exactly the same as you are I am I am fluent in Tarot speak and I am using a translator here on the exactly exactly yeah but if you get like what looks like cob webs in your water where kind of like the Yol is like webbing through the water they do say that that can be an indication that the evil eye has been placed on you I've always been skeptical of this evil eye thing but it is becoming more mainstream and more popular again you see a lot of evil eye jewelry you just you're just seeing it a lot in pop culture right now I think that there's a lot of hoopla about that I do believe in the evil eye but I also believe that there's a lot of hoopla around that right now it's always a good idea to keep yourself protected gave the evil eye to somebody the other day who cut out in front of me in traffic like when I'm giving you the stink eye watch out but that doesn't mean you need to do an egg cleanse that just means don't cut in front of me again and travel people really are looking they're looking to reconnect I think that's why paganism and Witchcraft in particular are so popular because they exploded again yeah we do want to find a way to get rid of this negative energy to reconnect with the Earth and with natural things I I think people are crying out for that we don't have control of the societal negativity but we do have control of this and we want to try to everybody's trying to take those reins they're trying to grab the reins and get it under control so to kind of circle back one of the interpretations is if you're seeing like cob web looking things it is that you may have had the evil eye placed on you another one is um they they describe it as needles or spikes they say that that can be indicative that there are people around you with bad 10 now mine I was going back um because I did mine a few days ago and I actually I took pictures of it and I I'm going back and looking at the pictures and I do have what kind of looks like initially I have one Spike I actually would have called it like a little tornado in the middle of mine how about you show me your pictures and I'll see what I see after you tell me this you show me yours and I'll show you mine we'll see if we can see stuff in each other's okay we'll try to interpret things let's see because they say when you have these little spikes that that means there's someone around you with bad intent but then my final picture there's nothing there there's nothing I went from one Spike to multiple spikes to nothing my egg changed so that's an interesting point as well is that my egg actually changed now you're supposed to wait for the 10 minutes and then do it let me be honest with you I didn't really have a timer and I am not 100% sure if picture one was with was after 10 minutes or before 10 minutes but the last picture where it was totally clear would have been well after 10 minutes okay so here's what I would interpret from your three pictures that you showed me if I was going to go by my intuition and my pigeon speak of egg cleanse knowledge what this means to me is the first one actually I see as a good thing that's a one it doesn't look like a spike to me that's a solid pillar straight from top to bottom doesn't it look like a little tornado it does and I think that's energy it's definitely a cord that goes from the egg to the top of the glass and it symbolizes to me new Energy new things New Beginnings there's a lot connecting to the Mother Ship reconnecting to the sky reconnecting to the goddess and also reconnecting to your own Center of power the next one does show more spiky things and this shows more that there's stress and out side things and it's all at the top to me that means cerebral there's there's a lot of maybe work stress or monetary stress but not physical stress but definitely challenges mental challenges but then it goes to clear uh at the very last one and to me that means you have a very clear energy you are definitely doing a great job keeping yourself clear and grounded I don't see anyone actually attacking you I see Zero attacks against you because they would be stupid anyway but [ __ ] around and find out but no one is thankfully I see none of that it just looks perfectly clear and beautiful and other than some stress that's from outside you this looks great it was actually a fun little experiment because I have seen people do egg cleanses in the past that was something some folks we knew would do but I personally myself have never done one yeah me either it was interesting I liked it but I didn't feel and maybe it's because mine was sole at the end I didn't feel I could get any divinatory insight from it and I was kind of bummed because you know I always try to take things right to divination from the get-go now let me ask you this because I read because again I don't speak too terribly much egg divination but I had read online and maybe I'm wrong that if you have a lot of bubbles that meant that a lot of negativity was absorbed into the egg is that not the case I saw that the bubbles meant that you were protected so I don't know maybe it means that you protected because it absorbed all the negative energy here's here's something that I I found online bubbles mean that negative energy was absorbed into the egg bubbles within the water or the egg whites means that your cleansing ritual was a success it could also mean it could also mean that you've been experiencing gas or indigestion usually due to stress if you are seeing large bubbles or balloons in the water it means the egg absorbed a lot of negative energy this is a sign that you need to do a second cleansing ritual to fully rid yourself of negative energy but yours kind of looks more like soda Fizz they're Tiny Bubbles they're little teeny tiny yeah they're definitely not large ones so that just kind of makes me think that there maybe was a little bit of negative energy but this fully did the job cool you do have some webbing in there now what does the web mean again the webbing was supposed to mean that you may have had the evil eye placed upon you and then kind of the that spiky is the people around you could potentially have evil intent oh so you see a person with evil intent and evil eye and negative energy that was removed you know this is why I I I don't like doing divination a whole lot for people I'm terribly close to because I feel like I know too much it is easier to do readings for strangers there may be circumstances going on right now that you just need to get your [ __ ] cleared off of you know stress whether it be money stress personal stress I gotcha okay okay cool well thank you so tiny tiny bubbles means negativity has been cleansed from you sucked right out so sucked right out and successful it even said that if you have a lot of those tiny bubbles that you absolutely had a successful cleanse so I look at this as a win for you yay I'll take a win anywhere I can get it now one of the things I read was that one of the very common places that this uh has been seen or culturally available is an appal and folk magic is that anything that you ever remember or anyone in your family using eggs in any way for healing or divination no no this was actually um new to me back in the late '90s I had heard a little bit about it I had known someone who did it a few times but then that was kind of it it was never something that was outstanding and you know just out there just something I had heard of I knew it existed I knew people did it that was about the extent of it this was nothing that anyone in my family ever practiced I feel it was more about symbols and superstitions than divination I gocha my memory is pretty much the same as yours it was something that was used for cleansing mostly occasionally for divinations but it wasn't super common it was just one of many different ways to do that and now it just seems to kind of have exploded in popularity you know it worked when I did mine I did feel like a little bit of a weight had been lifted off so that makes sense with what you saw in the in the egg reading itself could that have been because of the whole meditation and ritual that I did maybe you know at the end of doing that reading I sprinkled my salt and chili flakes on the top of it and then disposed of it with running water and I did feel lighter I did feel a little bit cleansed so there you know there's definitely something to that much like any other type of cleansing that you do but again you know I think that combining this with other things I'm kind of big on combining so again you know I would if if I were going to do a a formal divination you know this was kind of a hey let me see how this turns out but if I was trying to do some formal cleansing or formal divination I would be casting a circle and then I would probably in conjunction with it be using my tarot as well personally I think an egg cleanse will probably be part of a cyclical thing particularly in the spring I can see myself doing egg cleanses maybe once every few weeks as part of my regular cleanse but probably not regularly nowadays the price of eggs can warrant that right it's pretty expensive divination right there freaking Aro deck it's cheaper than a dozen eggs now being able to dispose of these is pretty simple traditionally people say you can flush it down a toilet put it down a drain putting it down running water is fine you can give it to if you have an animal that eats eggs you can give it to them but don't eat it yourself right you can throw it in the garbage people say that is acceptable that doesn't resonate well with me so the running water worked of course some people say at a Crossroads or bury it and as you know shell and I are not huge fans of burying things but an egg or eggshells is fine but yeah running water is the easiest can go right down your drain in a Crossroads that can be difficult you know hey neighbor I just had to come down the street and dump my egg on the corner I mean we're not that mainstream yet no not quite not quite pretty soon they're going to have like designated areas at like every cross roads they'll be like the witch patch where everybody can go and environmentally safely dispose of their spell products whatever ritual leftovers that need to be composted magically back into the land can go with a nice witch plot coming to a Crossroads near you they need to have two options they need to have like a mulch pit where you can let it just naturally go and they need to have an incinerator because sometimes that [ __ ] just needs to burn right maybe one of every element you can can just leave things there in the air you can incinerate it you can toss it in this little Pond here or you can bury it in the earth to be reclaimed we could just do a little of everything at your local neighborhood witch plot at the crossroads but I think for me personally I'm not going to be doing an egg cleanse every month because you know first of all the price of eggs currently but I do think that this is a a fun thing to maybe like you said do this could be something that that could be worked into Maybe yearly oara rituals do do an egg exactly no pun intended you know do an egg cleans every ostara that would be a great way to maybe either open or close an ostara ritual I definitely may do that because I did I did find Value in it it's just not something I would probably be doing on a weekly or monthly basis and I did feel a little lighter afterwards and you know who doesn't want that we all need a little bit less stress in our lives and if doing a meditation and and egg cleanse can help you get a little bit of Zen a little bit of peace in your life then you should incorporate it you know whatever these daily rituals in particular like shell and I are trying to get back on the broomstick so we're trying to find these little things that work for us that we can come back to again and again as touchstones everyone you find might not work for you and that's okay keep trying I wouldn't say that Leila and I are jumping on the weekly egg cleanse bandwagon but we definitely think this is great to incorporate at least into some rituals but we're going to we're going to seek out some other stuff and see see what's out there see what options are out there because I'm finding that that there's so many people out there that are coming up with ideas that are just fabulous that I never would have thought of so I I think that maybe checking out some of these and just you know try it once what's it going to hurt if you haven't done an egg cleanse try it once what's it going to hurt worst case scenario you absorb a shitload of negative energy out of your aura himself right be a little lighter who doesn't want that and if you have something that you would like us to try or if you've heard of a spell or a ritual or anything that you want us to look into email us at back onthe broomstick gmail.com or check out our Instagram back onth broomstick except ritual baths do not talk to us about ritual baths unless you are going to install a claw foot tub CL foot bath exactly if you're not supplying the claw foot bathtub I want to hear about the damn ritual bath oh they're so gorgeous the ones in the woods it's got to be cold as hell I mean a claw foot tub in the middle of a gorgeous green Mossy Woods looks beautiful probably very cold I just I just want to point out it's funny that we talk about this at this moment because um you know I had said I was catching up on some of the workshops and seminars I missed from wion the one I am currently involved in is called Voodoo spiritual baths for luck success and abundance o I want in on that and all I keep thinking about through this Workshop is that damn claw foot bathtub in the forest filled with flowers that I want to be in heated just just make it heated if I can wave my magic wand and heat the bath water I'm so there well I figure if they can get Plumbing to get water into these claw foots in the middle of nowhere in the woods it's obviously that plumbing includes hot water so we want to thank you for joining us today for this episode of back on the broomstick and chatting with us on our egg Clans expenditures join us next time stay witchy we'll see you next Friday at back on the broomstick
