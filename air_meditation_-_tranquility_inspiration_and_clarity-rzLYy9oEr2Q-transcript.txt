welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a back on the broomstick meditation series I'm Layla and this is the air meditation companion episode 2 Elemental series number 127 are energy more than inspiration incense and intuition will be working with the breath and your breath is very powerful not just magically but physically as well and the meditation that were presenting here will focus on your breath and breathing as a way to raise the energies associated with are like Tranquility inspiration and Clarity of communication as well as to help calm the body and 2D stress in this meditation I used two different breathing techniques not just because of a connection of breath with elemental are energy but because for some people meditation can sometimes field trip especially when our minds are racing or spiraling thru to do list old conversations random worries the crap we said six years ago one of the best  Phase 2 study and to calm that wandering mind is by giving it a job focusing on your breath gives your brain something to do it's like oh I'm breathing I'm counting now and just like that there's no room for those intrusive thoughts to take over breathing also works as a relaxation tool because your body has incredible system called the autonomic nervous system and it includes two part one that kicks into gear when you're in danger or stress called your sympathetic nervous system new fight or flight and one that soothes and restores you and that one's called your parasympathetic nervous and by slowing our breath especially when we make it deeper and more intentional we send a signal to the body that says you are safe now it's okay to let your guard down and relax. Make sure parasympathetic system respond by activating the rest and digest mode of your body it releases chemicals to help you rest and relax it's your body's way of react  to being at home being safe and being in a relaxing environment so are brothels are most accessible connections the energy of air of tranquility and inspiration and we just a few intentional inhales and exhales we can calm the chaos invite Clarity and anchor ourselves in our body and in the present moment meditation we're going to work with two different breathing techniques the first one is called a physiological stye or sometimes the parasympathetic sky and it's basically a double inhale and then a full exhale inhale twice through the nose first like 3/4 of the way and then one short quick inhalation to finish filling your lungs then you exhale slowly through your mouth kind of like a deep sigh and Studies have shown that this type of breathing is one of the most effective breathing exercises to reduce stress and to elevate your mood now the second breathing technique in the meditation is what I like to call Mantra breathing  it's another type of breathing that activates your parasympathetic nervous system in this one you're exhalation is about twice as long as your inhalation and I like to pair that with a short manttra be here now by Rome. One of my favorites and we use that in this particular meditation so for your inhalation you'll save be here for about a count of two and then say now as you exhale for about a count of four don't stress the numbers in the counting too much just try and let your body naturally breathe out about twice as long as you breathing so inhale be here and then exhale now on a long time and always remember to listen to your body if it any point you feel lightheaded or dizzy just returned to a natural breast stay with the meditation but just breathe normally and pay attention to your breath as we work through the rest of the meditation breathwork should feel comfortable and should make you feel energized and uplifted not overwhelmed not stressed out just follow a rhythm that feels  and study for you so find a quiet space where you can sit or lie comfortably preferably one where you can feel the air move maybe by a window at fan or if you're lucky outside under the Open Sky you could light a white or yellow candle if you'd like burn some incense have something scented nearby that you really like a little bit of music something gentle in the background but if it's distracting you don't need anything like that the important part is to open your senses to the air around you all right once you found that spot let's begin  settle into your spot and when you're ready if you feel comfortable doing so close your eyes  let your breath come just as it is there's no need to change anything yet simply Begin by noticing your breathing  as you pray make sure or pretend that your mind is a clear blue sky with clouds of thought Drifting by  any thoughts that come just let them be let them pass  there's no need to follow them no need to worry about them just observe them and let the wind carry them away  attention to your breathing  inhale through your nose let that inhale fry fill your belly  exhale slowly through your mouth and noticed your breath as it passes your tongue and your lips  you're the sound your breath makes in the world maybe it's quiet and small or loud and takes up space or somewhere in between  if notice and pray and listen to my voice  your breath is a powerful Ally and intimate connection to the energies of are of thought and communication we breathe most of the time without thinking about it a powerful process that happens beyond our awareness but if we pay attention if we connect to our breathing and work with the air we can unlock a powerful way to call my body and open our mind now attention again to your breath  are you then gently through your nose until your lungs are just about full egg one quick sip of air to fully fill your lungs exhale slowly through your mouth long smooth soft like a freeze signs are the trees Raven slowly and then breathing quick to fill your lungs  exhale slowly through parted lips letting it go  one more time inhale to your lungs are almost full and then one last Quick breath to fill them and exhale slowly let it all melt out in the longest slowest breath yeah  now breathe normally  as you breathe normally you may feel your body soften relax and lower your shoulders  relax and soften your jaw your breath becomes your connection to peace to tranquility  now picture or pretend that you are standing in an open field at dawn the sky above you is painted with pale blue and silver light and the air is just beginning to stay cool and crisp during the scent of newness and possibility you feel that Grace your skin dental and invigorating  let us imagine winds swirl around you now let it lift your thoughts like leaves on a Braves carrying away the noise the static the stories but no longer serve  soon we will begin a mantra I sure in hell while saying be here and exhale completely Mustang now be here a mantra carried on the Wind he here  as you inhale imagine you're breathing in Clarity like cool clean are sweeping through the halls of your mind each year  would each exhale the fog lift your thoughts settle perhaps a sense of openness begins to unfold  continue to chant continue with your Mantra breathe and short exhale long be here now  be here now  ideas gently awaken Words May begin to line up ready to be spoken when the time is right he here breathing and chanting with intention at your own natural pace  be here now  you are riding the current of thought and spirit and breath with each inhale continue to call in Tranquility inspiration Clarity and with each exhale you continue to release what no longer serves  now when you are ready take one deep grounding breath  carefully  continue to breathe normally at the edges of your awareness begin to return slowly kindly gently bring your awareness the space around you to serve as supporting you the air that wraps itself around you like a familiar Shaw the scents and sounds of Life carried on fries  there is no rush but presents return like a whisper not a command  wiggle your fingers your toes  scratch your body  notice the air against your skin the rhythm of your natural breath steady calm all of magic and life  but the energy of air stay with you let it live in your lungs in your voice and in your thoughts  when you are ready open your eyes and let every breath your reminder you are here awake you are inspired now  take your time and slowly come to awareness stand up and stretch if you have some water or some tea something to eat something to help you come back to your body to hear and now and whenever you need or want to connect the energy of air to the magic of inspiration of clarity and Tranquility just remember your breath breathe in breathe out now be here now I hope this meditation helps you find Clarity inspiration and maybe helps you find a moment to catch your breath will
