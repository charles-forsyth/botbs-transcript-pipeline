don't know the words you're like the fun entertaining one and Lila's the one that does all the heart work Lea's fun and entertaining well yeah but as as your son I am legally obligated to give you more props all right oh I do do hard work it's Lea and I both work very hard she's just more editing savvy than I am yeah yeah L's great you know like I had said Gavin is now in in Connecticut and Connecticut is almost see I feel like Massachusetts is like somehow the spookiest place all of a sudden but Connecticut is a close second yeah we're GNA talk a little bit today about some stories Gavin has from Connecticut we're going to talk about some stories from our hometown in Upstate New York and some shared stories that Gavin and I have experienced together so Gavin I'm actually going to let you start Lea always has me start and I'm always like why do I have to start Ila's always the one who makes me start so we're gonna we're gonna kick off with Gavin's story now nice tell us first of all tell us where what what what roughly City and town if you happen to know that in Connecticut where you were and then tell us the location where you were before you get started so I've grown up in Upstate New York like you and I'm your mother well yeah but you don't live there anymore but about a but about a year after she moved to where she is I moved to it's a town called talin Connecticut is very very small it reminds me of Upstate New York folks very wooded very little very country well I told you this the area we lived in Upstate New York is actually larger than the entire state of Connecticut most things are we love you Connecticut listeners yeah it's so tiny but it's such I love living there it's such a great time over there all right tell us your story okay so this is the Daniel Benton Homestead from talin New York Talen Connecticut silly sorry I'm in New York I've grown up in New York for over 20 years it is hard to break that habit say in New York well this Connecticut home was uh in the Benton family from the time Daniel Benton built it in 1720 till about 1930 so it was in their family from what 1720 to 1930 yeah so about 200 years wow in uh 1970 it was opened as a museum where they teach about 18th century life as well as telling the story of the first three generations of Ben and this is kind of where that story originates is from the third generation of Benton specifically now I'd like to point out that you've actually taken me here when I went and visited you and we actually went and and went to this house for folks that aren't aware of like what some of these 1700s homesteads looked like these are small people wouldn't you say Gavin it might be only like maybe 30 feet long by maybe 15 20 feet wide yeah I'd say that's about right I mean these are small houses so for that something like that to stay generational for 200 years you're definitely talking about small cramped quarters this isn't like any big luxurious mansion by any stretch one of those what do they call them not twig houses board houses slab houses I don't know Leila would know Lea we need you e were there just like thin long pieces of wood that are kind of like the outside I don't know how to explain it well 1700 houses people New England Google New England houses and what they looked like in the 1700s and you'll totally get what I'm saying okay continue gav and what's really cool too is this house has a lot of the original stuff still in it even though it's been in this family for over 200 years is pretty much untouched but said probably the light system that was built into the house pretty much everything else is the same as it was so like Lea and I've talked about multiple times you're going to get that residual energy that residual Vibe yeah definitely okay keep going the bentons were a family of military men and a Prett well off family in tand Daniel's Sons fought in the French and Indian War and then when the the time came Daniel's grandsons fought in the Revolutionary War one of Daniel's grandsons Elijah dated a girl by the name of jamaa barrows and his family did not prove of their relationship see jamaa was a daughter of a cabinet maker and because she wasn't Rich they didn't like her you know what I'd let you make I I'd let you be with a cabinet maker I'd be totally okay if you were with a cabinet Maker's child yeah you think that they have lovely Furniture but apparently mixing of the classes was really not something that was approved of it was frowned upon back there it was very frowned upon you had to stay with your class back then yeah definitely nonetheless Elijah promised to return from war to reunite with her once he got back and Elijah and his two brothers went and fought in the Battle of Long Island it was one of the first major battles of the Revolutionary War but unfortunately the British went on and won that battle captured the Benton siblings and put them on a British prison ships unlike today uh because King George proclam the colonist as traitors so being treated as prisoners of War they were actually treated as prisoners in general and essentially instead of treating them like you're supposed to with captured enemy soldiers basically this King neglected them to death on these ships no food barely any space pretty much either died of small poox or died of neglect really King George did that yeah gez and I'm such a fan of the English Monarchy that's pretty shitty though and the the crazy thing too is usually for treason which is what these colonists would have uh been charged with they would have just been hung and killed but because the British were losing public favor in the colonies they decided to basically Hide Away these soldiers and kill them on these ships essentially you know I'd rather have been hung you know if you're just gonna kill me get that [ __ ] over with and be done with it don't torture my ass and make me although I just I am a little chunky so you know I could probably last a while I'm not saying anything but anyway ironically enough while the bentons were in prison on these ships the Bon Homestead was actually used to hold captured English and German soldiers who are being transported to Boston oh so that's the first sign of some bad juju because I mean again folks this is a a relatively if I were to put it in terms today max four people living there comfortably Max so if if they use that as like a transitional medical place people obviously would have died there would be my I guess because I can't imagine that revolutionary medicine was topnotch no it wasn't so so I would imagine that kind of is g to lay the foundation for some bad [ __ ] might come up again but we could safe to say that we know for sure the bad [ __ ] started happen during the Revolutionary War correct well I talk about this later because it was in the family for so long some stuff could have happened during that time but because they probably didn't want to share it it hasn't been shared why we share our creepy experiences gab here we are today well we're not the most reserved people in the world mom folks this is a family affair you know I my I I've tortured my both of my children their whole lives you know I'm I'm that Mom that's screaming out the car window on the way home from bass uh baseball practice look at the Moon kids and I'm also the first one that says hey kids you want to go look for ghosts it's okay Mommy will protect you you know I I am that parent and you know you grow up fine you're fine you're good I didn't traumatize you too much did I not too much and you know ghost surreal and you don't freak out right you're good right yeah yeah pretty well off you know I mean it's it's but but we'll get to it in a minute guys um when we get to our our experience gav and I had together together you're going to be like whoa ho ho ho because this is a good one I don't know how you know Leila always says I'm the one who comes up with the crazy adventure ideas I didn't even have to come up with this one this was like me and my kids just doing our DU and stuff happens so yeah continue Gavin Daniel Benton House so unfortunately both of Elijah's brothers did die on these ships and Elijah himself contracted small poox before he was released due to a prisoner exchange and was sent home so when jamaa found out that Elijah was alive she asked the family if she could take care of him in quarantine with them as well and the rest of the family wow that sounds like current times Deja Vu yeah and speaking of current times studies say that Co is supposed to kill about5 to 1% of people who catch it this is small poox and it killed about 15% of people who got it yeah yeah so imagine they're small but they're pxy so despite being taken care of jamaa who is Contracting the disease while she was taking care of him Elijah dies just weeks after uh he returned home around uh January 21st of 1777 and uh after he died jamaa contracted smallpox and died a month later with practically no care because she was the only one to take care of him they didn't have no kids no that's why I had kids take care of me when I'm old right gav yeah but he had to go war and then he once he got back he had small pox there was no time to raise children true true I would make a comment if Lila had said that but folks you know how I make these offand sometimes vulgar comments but it's my boy I can't do it okay continue on you act like I haven't listened to almost every single episode of your podcast that's why we love you Gavin see folks you ever G to do a podcast get at least one of your kids to listen okay keep going Daniel Bon house because jamaa and Elijah were not married even though they weren't married the bons allowed jamaa to be buried on the property however because they weren't married they couldn't be buried side by side she was buried about 40t away from the man she loved essentially that's shitty and that's a bummer yeah yeah but I mean I don't know what's worse not having her be buried on the property or having her being buried on the property but far away from it like I don't know which one's worse well unfortunately there was a lot of various types of discrimination going on in that time period and this is just another example of that exactly but uh like I said before because this home was in this family's possession for so long we don't quite know how many paranormal things have happened there but once this uh house was starting to be rent out to people this is where we get the start to some crazy stories you know I love crazy stories so give us a year where give us a starting point of of [ __ ] getting real uh so this was after this was in between the Bon selling this house and it becoming a museum so it would be roughly 30s 40s or 50s this one doesn't really have a date the next one was in the 80s you're talking n you're talking 1900s correct yes yes okay so more more towards current time than the story happened I got you I got you I understand keep going so one night when the house of rented to a couple the couple were laying in bed and the woman saw a man standing at the foot of their bed honestly that has happened to me and you know yeah that's crazy [ __ ] that's when you cover yourself in the blanket well as I've stated in previous episodes that is um having having a a ghost appear at the end of my bed as a a 10-year-old kid is why I cannot sleep as a mid to late 40y old with my feet uncovered I could sleep totally uncovered except for my feet well the blanket didn't help this woman he supposedly walked up and put his hand over her mouth wait wa back the trolley up boy so present is day we'll call it the 80s or so obviously not the 16 or 1700s so you know within the last 40 or years someone was there renting this house and a ghost covered her mouth yeah I would [ __ ] myself and you know me well enough to know I I'd stay but I'd [ __ ] myself I wouldn't leave but [ __ ] holy Christ okay keep going he supposedly uh disappeared once she pushed him away and uh as you could probably Guess The Twist of the story her husband was sleeping right next to her so this man that's always the way that is always the way yeah so this man was not her husband because her husband was sleeping right next to her been there done that got freaked out so this next story of uh some spooky happenings at this house happened in the uh 80s okay A Woman by the name of Stephanie had a College assignment and basically had to stay the night to do some research like related to the ghost stuff or just related to the Daniel mton house in general yeah I I would assume it'd be more of a how like the daily life of uh someone from that time gotcha gotcha so like how they heated kept themselves warm stuff like that Cooking With The Cauldron Cooking With The Cauldron the whole time she uh reported Ed feeling like suffocated and had like weight on her when she was in the house mostly uh when she went upstairs that's your sign that you are not wanted there okay just putting that out there yeah uh she heard men's voices coming from the basement and uh her friend was not a man who was with her that night so it was probably the voices of those like you said the residual captured soldiers from the British and the Germans right did did did they ever report um hearing any of these Apparition voices speaking German I don't know if she knew enough German to identify it and you know what I mean you can you can identify you know I don't know German but if someone was speaking a language that wasn't English I could say well I don't know if it was German but it surely wasn't English yeah yeah she she uh knew it wasn't English but she heard men's voices okay okay again again I I I would stay is I'm freaking out and the most notable moment from her night was uh when she saw a figure she described it as the figure was looking at her from the doorway so she was like in the middle of a room and she saw a figure in the doorway looking straight at her man or woman or couldn't she tell I believe she described it as a woman so that was probably jamaa yeah yeah and multiple people have reported seeing womanly figure some say I believe this was in another one of the episodes here where we like a dress some people say it's a wedding dress some people say it's like a colonial dress but I believe you said like that white flowy dress yeah type look that that that white ghosty dress look yeah and staff and even visitors have reported same thing is Stephanie heavy and suffocating feeling mostly of sadness and grief around the house and especially near jima's grave and even sounds of a woman weeping have been heard and again a lot of people have seen a figure of a woman wearing a dress now how how far away is the the familial Cemetery from the actual structure of the house I don't know exactly how far but it's on property so I mean it's you know I'm not asking for feet like 20 feet away but like it's out in your yard kind of thing yeah it wasn't like down the road okay okay oh Jesus so they have a cemetery in their freaking yard no wonder there's [ __ ] there the hell like who does that like like oh let me just like bury aunt Susie in the freaking backyard next to my next to my poor past on cat like wow yeah no bad juju and then we're going toh separate her from her lover uh about 40 50 feet away make him mad you know that's one of those I don't like saying bad words bad bad words round Gavin ha but that's like a [ __ ] around and find out moment like truly [ __ ] find out people well I mean this was the 1700s so they didn't really they didn't really know your land was your land and you lived and died and were buried on your land yeah yeah yeah it's crazy to think for us today but it's probably a very common thing back then now has there been any more public experiences since the girl from college not generally a lot of the uh like visitors experiences are more common uh more I should say more recent but they're not as like big as like say Stephanie who was there overnight which was probably the worst time of the day to be there but they are actually starting up their tour soon so uh I was thinking of maybe having you come down it's a date you don't even have to finish the sentence it's a date let me ask you this is it is it just like a A Day Tour or do they still rent it overnight mostly just day tours do they have anything at night do you know I'm not sure their website isn't the greatest but I think I saw something about night tours which if they do provide them I would love to do a night tour because I know that when when you took me down there what was it last fall I believe you took you took me down there and it was closed and we didn't want to trespass because as a reminder folks trespassing is illegal I condone a lot of crazy Adventures but I will not I will not illegally trespass with with my children so we just kind of stood out on the road and took pictures and stuff we didn't approach the house so I I wasn't sure if if that was still an option to do something at night there even if it wasn't overnight but I am down for looking for some revolutionary ghosts and I'm always down to to rope my poor children into it too so yeah you need to look into that and get back to me oh yeah definitely maybe maybe when Lila's back we could do a an update video or update podcast have you have you had a chance to go inside this yet no not yet you know our summer was pretty busy last year as uh you aware of so we were not able to go last year so my experience with the house is the same as yours where you really just strove past it I I don't know Leila is so technical I wish she was here could answer this because I actually have some some very eerie photographs of this location I will see if I can if I can have Leila attach them uh in our description folks because some of you know I took I didn't take a a lot of pictures there but we were there about dusk is and just just a couple of photographs I snapped you look at them and you get that Eerie sense from them this is definitely a place where you can tell when you pull up out front that there is some sort of activity you might not know what that activity is until you kind of entrench yourself in it but you you can tell that there there's something going on there and I'd love to go back and and kind of explore and go through the inside of the house legally of course yeah because because you know a I don't do anything trespassing with my kids B I don't like to do anything trespassing anyway but you know ghosts or ghosts and and see you know we don't want to be disrespectful of private property and and Museum property and people's you know Graves and all of that absolutely I I do want to look into seeing if that's a location that we might be able to physically check it out know you want to check it out let's check it out people yeah we should definitely especially since most of the like kind of ghost Hunty videos about this place are a little more on the older side a little more on the lower quality side I think there's one from like 2002 is that a challenge for us to go and do some high quality video investigating I think that's a challenge we should we should you know Lea is usually the rational one who gives me a thousand Reasons Why it would be best not to do that shell and I'm like come on Le's not here how scary could it be come on people go to this Museum all the time so of course it's safe I'll go ghost hunting even in the dead of night but I will not go swimming in the ocean off Cape Cod there's Jaws there man show shows you my priorities you know I've actually told our listeners one time gav I told them that you were the kid that would go ghost hunting with me absolutely you were also the kid that would stand at the bottom of the roller coaster with me because neither of us would go on yeah I still live by my theory that I have a kid that isn't afraid of roller coasters and no fear of plunging to her death but the thought of a ghost will make her cry on a dime then I have another child that the thought of going on a roller coaster would make him cry on a dime and he will go ghost hunting with Mommy 247 yeah absolutely you rock Gavin you rock I know like you always say it's hard to wake up this awesome it is it is it is very hard so you know I I'm going to talk a little bit about a house you're very familiar with and I'll I'll get to some pre you being born stuff then we can both talk about our our shared experience at this place so we're gonna you know Gavin was talking about Connecticut spooky State lots of stuff there you know Leila always says the west coast is the best coast but like there's so many things going on in northeastern states even in the southeastern states I mean I just feel like the east coast is one big spook Fest yeah we're gonna we're gonna go back to where we're from gav where you are currently recording from in in Upstate New York we're going to talk about your grandmother's house how about that spooky now I I don't have like the abstract of the house on me so you know I might some of my dates might be off a little bit but I grew up in this house U my parents purchased this house literally three weeks before I was born so for the sake of we're not talking numbers here we'll just say that this house was purchased by my parents in the mid 70s this house dates back to around 1875 it was one of the the the first houses in the small little town that it's in it's not even really a town it's like a is it would you call it a town G like a town a suburb of the bigger city a town of the city yeah I'd say a suburb would probably be the best description yeah they have their own fire department does that constitute for a town I guess I don't know we'll go with Gavin's suburb suburb of a small a small Upstate New York City we'll call it you know the late 1800s this this House was built in at the time kind of like a farming area anybody familiar with Upstate New York corn for days people corn for days and originally this house was built as a is a boarding house one of the town's people that was rather loaded with cash had a single daughter only only child single woman and he bought her this property and built this boarding house for her that was kind of how she made her income how she lived her life she lived in this house and had boarding people in and as kind of the town was built up around it she would board the workers anybody familiar with with AV Aviation avionics and kind of military manufacturing there was a singer link they created the first flight simulators that is in this area there was a mil a military National Guard Reserve there back in like the 60s or so 50s and 60s was actually a medical military base agriculture uh things of that nature there was a railroad right there so as you can imagine you know she had all these borders she had this house until I believe she had it from around 1875 until like maybe 1930 is single the whole time this house was her everything she she lived there it was her job it it it was her everything so she she had always had tenants and you know it makes me laugh and Gavin when you think about it it kind of should make you laugh too yeah can you imagine Grandma's house as a boarding house like when I think of a boarding house I'm thinking huge yeah just to think of Grandma's house as boarding house just throws my mind yeah because it feels like I feel like it could maybe comfortably fit 10 Max so it's very weird I mean we ain't talk in like the Hilton Hotel here people my mother's house is like a normal house in my opinion but anyway back then it was a boarding house apparently big stuff kind of to give you paint the picture for you it's one of those like big square houses big first floor big second floor full fulls size attic full basement and it's in the shape of a square I don't know how else to describe it so yeah boarding house as you can imagine she got this when she was 18 as a gift from her father and lived there and was the boarding house running the boarding house until she died at a significantly old age as a matter of fact she died in the house Gavin just to kind of freak you out a little bit she actually died in Grandma's laundry room oh my God any who yeah right anyway so you know someone else had this house and and I'll get to her in a minute so the original owner passed away she sold the house her estate sold the house to another single woman who again turned it into a boarding house so second single female owner second Boarding House business here we are this woman lived until about the late 60s again she boarded people from the military base and the singer link business she died in the house as well we'll call it the late 60s no one lived in the house from the late 60s until the mid 70s when my parents bought it house was touched that's wild yeah right isn't this wild Gavin it's weird to to hear this like history of a house I've been to many many many times that I didn't really know about it it's just weird that it's been it was vacant for so many years before they bought it so mid 70s my parents buy this house and they do not want it to be a boarding house thank you it's a single family home growing up I would always hear you know my mother talk about the lady upstairs I don't want to hear about the goddamn lady upstairs mom my bedroom's upstairs now when I was growing up there's this back room on the second floor and it was actually a bedroom during my childhood but it is now present day currently the laundry room and that is where the original owner died that was her bedroom ironically enough the second woman also died in the same room and that was also her bedroom so we got these two women die in the same room both own the house that was their bedroom room now you know why I don't want to go in a laundry room at my mother's now is my life would have it my bedroom was right next to this room I would literally as a child run straight across the hall to the bathroom because I always felt like there was something at the end of that hallway there would be times I would see a woman standing in the doorway to the present day laundry room as a kid I'd be like Mom Mom there's a woman upstairs and she'd be like is she in the doorway of this room and I'd be like yeah and she be like oh what was her name Gavin do you remember I want say it's like I don't know if you you've described her hair as like that beehive so maybe I'm thinking of beatric because of that no it was like Kora something like that I don't know my mother would be like oh that's so and so this used to be her house and I be like what you know my parents just and it's so funny because my parents are like the most don't believe in this stuff people truly Gavin is my WT like my mother thinks that this is a cck of crap as she will talk about the ghost on her second floor like I can't even explain her rationality with this so growing up I was it was always oh yeah she's there don't know what to tell you and I am freaked out crazy like running in the bathroom in the middle of the night so I didn't have to look or I'd like close my eyes and run so I wouldn't see her so I kind of grew up with this lady next to my bedroom it kind of became normal for me and I'm not saying that I liked it any less you know a couple of times and Gavin will remember this I had had a house down the road from my mother's house for several years and my washer broke and I would go to my mother's and do the laundry and I'd go late at night when no one was home and we would all me and both of my children would argue on who was going to go inside grandma's house and do the laundry because we were all too scared to go in that laundry room alone in the dark here I am trying to force my children teenage children to go into their Grandma's haunted freaking laundry room remember that gav I'm not going I'm not going you go you go like I always I always use the excuse I didn't know how to do laundry yeah well so you know it's just everyone in my family just always kind of knew that there was something at the end of the hallway as unsettling as it was it was also half normal so we're going to fast forward a little bit from some of my run-ins with her I guess we'll call them to a day and like I said I had I had owned a house down the street from my mother and I had to take my kids somewhere me my daughter Gavin my beautiful favorite son by the way I only have one son you're still my favorite buddy no thank you I know my mother happens to have a gas station across from her house we were not doing anything at my mother's house we weren't going there my mother actually Winters in a different state my mother was not even at the house the house was locked up for the winter no one there nobody there actually if I remember correctly she had been gone a few months and no one had been in the house for months and at the time only myself and my brother had a key just kind of set in the scene here yeah me and my kids have to go somewhere and I had to stop and get gas and so obviously living down the street I would stop and get gas across from my mother's I just remember I had to send one kid you might remember Gavin I had to send one kid into the gas station to pay might have been my daughter yeah and then I was standing at the pump you know doing what you do getting ready you know undoing my gas cap and whichever kid was still in the car it might have been You Gavin I think so yeah said there's somebody at Grandma's and I was like Grandma's down south there's nobody at Grandma's and I remember you said no look at Grandma's Attic Window there's a woman in Grandma's Attic Window and and and you and me and your sister look up and all three of us saw a woman in Grandma's Attic Window on the third floor and then all three of us saw nothing in that window and we weren't at the house my brother was not at the house and my at the time my brother was the only other person who had access in a key there was no one in that house and we knew no one was at that house we were staring at it the people who lived there before us were I remember you said this story I I think it was in passing in a previous episode and we weirdly enough this is like listening to you and Lea talk that's how I kind of unwinded after a day so like here I am my partner's sleeping I'm laying in bed and relaxed uh covering up myself up in a blanket listening to my mom's podcast and all of a sudden you tell that story and I forgot about this for years until you said something on this show and it creeped me out so bad why Gavin tell us why did it creep you out because it it something so surreal that happened to us and I I can't believe like I ever forgot it the second I was reminded to it and the second you told that story it was like it brought me back to that exact moment what would you have guessed that you were somewhere between like maybe 15 and 18 when that happened 16 and 18 years old when that happened I mean you weren't like you weren't like a 5-year-old kid thinking they saw a shadow in Grandma's window like you were like in 10th or 11th grade you were a high schooler you were freaked out yeah I do remember that when we we all agreed that we all saw it and we all agreed that it all disappeared and then we all agreed it was Grandma's ghost I I feel like I remember us getting in the car and getting away from that freaking gas station in Grandma's house as best as we could yeah we peeled out that gas station and you know I grew up in that house I spent my whole life in that house in the same respect you know everybody has their childhood home and they love it and can't live without it I love my childhood home it's my childhood home I mean I know every inch of that if it was ever for sale and I could buy it and go back I would but I'm not a fan of being alone in my mother's house because I know I'm not alone and you know it too Gavin you're not alone Grandma even when grandma's not there you're not alone man I remember when I was little especially I I felt such a weird vibe I think it's before I knew about this whole story I was so creeped out upstairs to a point where I would sleep in Grandma's recliner in the living room and I would stay over and that's the thing you know it's not a whole house thing it's not everywhere in the house it's the whole second floor like I don't feel that in the first floor I don't really feel it in the basement or the Attic but that second floor all the homeowners they're all still living in the back bedroom for God's sakes but you know again not that anything tragic per se happened there I mean yeah they both died but you know a natural causes thing it's not like they were murdered or anything they had spent their their everything you know their their heart and soul and making it a a boarding house you know that was their work that was their home everything they did was was on that property and for that property they just never left their bedrooms you know it's like that you die in bed and you wake up the next day and keep on keeping on and like both of these women died in that bedroom and never left I think they both feel and and you know when when I was old enough for Grandma to tell me the story of this it almost seemed like they were treating us these ghosts these two women were treating us like we were their tenants like we like we were their borders and like they were still what do you call it the renter the Border what do you call it yeah border renter I don't know the person who runs a boarding house yeah so it it really I think was more of a I mean they never did anything I never had anything bad happen I don't think you did did you no just creepy Vibes and seeing like I remember many times my whole life just seeing the shape of a woman with dark hair at the end of that damn hole way I just think that they're not they're not angry they're not you know mean in any way they don't do anything nutty I just don't think they realize they're dead and they think that our whole family is their borders yeah and especially now with uh like you said Grandma goes down south for the winter so you know people aren't there as much anymore so maybe when she is there that kind of brings up the kind new new borders New tendons coming in for them I got a great idea yeah how about this winter when grandma's down South we just park in our driveway and watch the windows and see if they look out at us again like the time at the gas station oh my God we should I don't know if you remember me saying this at the time but I remember at the time saying were they just looking out the window in general or were they looking at us yeah you know what I mean like were they looking at us or just out the window yeah almost like they sense like if they were looking out the window great you were looking out the window and I saw you but were they looking at us because your sister is a lot more skeptical well not as much now because she's had some experiences but out of the three of us your sister's definitely the more skeptical one and she was ready to just curl up into a ball and cry herself to death when she because she was like Mom mom who is that I'm like I can't remember the lady's name Kora Coral something like that and I was like oh you know that's Grandma's ghost and like your sister was off the hook and she was like she was like 18 and she was off the hook yeah so so I always every time I think back of that I always wonder were they looking out the window or were they looking at us yeah but like you said we should definitely go back during the winter see if uh you could see anything go to your grandma she's there now tell her you need a spare key for us to go ghost hunting this winter I'll definitely do it you know I was I I know you might not have been there too terribly recently because grandma just got back and you're out of state and I just happened to be in town when she came back but like I was just in that house a week or two ago it's still the same it's still the same um I had to go upstairs for something you still get that upstairs Vibe which is different than the downstairs vibe that will never change I don't think I think that's one of those even if if if our family were to get rid of that house and sell it whoever were to ever take that house over is still gonna deal with the ladies in the second floor laundry room yeah definitely I just I honestly just don't think they know they're dead yeah that's what I would assume especially with unfamiliar people not being in that house that with like a normal ghost maybe they'd be a little more annoyed but I mean for them they had random people coming into house all the time to like you said to Bard in this house so I I honestly think that maybe to them we were the longtime borders and to us they're just the spooky spirits on the second floor pretty much it was always like a friendly relationship I guess yeah so I wanna I Want to Thank You Gavin for for sitting
