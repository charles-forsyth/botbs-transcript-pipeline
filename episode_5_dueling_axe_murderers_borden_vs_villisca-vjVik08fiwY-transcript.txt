Wednesday before my birthday how cool is that that is cool I mean I'm kind of excited about it it's [ __ ] awesome doing anything do you have any big birthday plans I hope so not yet because you're in California you could go camping and that's so not fair who the hell gets to go camping in February on the East Coast last year I really wanted to do a balloon ride it didn't work out though but um like a hot air balloon I actually have been on a hot air balloon before and it is super awesome and I really think everybody should do it once it was a long time ago I was pregnant for my son when I went actually so that is 24 years ago at this point yikes yeah so 24 years ago I get swindled into going into this hot air balloon ride my father was offered two free rides basically made me go holy [ __ ] I remember when you did that yeah I was afraid of heights and he said he didn't care if I was afraid of heights I had to get up and go because nobody gets that opportunity so I was kind of it was the at Ando Festival right it was the Speedy Fest yeah and you know as scared as I was and as much as I didn't want to do it I'm super glad I did and it was super awesome and if anybody gets the opportunity go on a hot air balloon man it's cool and you don't realize how many people have pools until you're in a hot air balloon I'm not kidding especially in Upstate New York you're just like wow all these people have pools it's not even warm enough in the summer to have a pool it was amazing yeah I really want to do something like that oh we could go on a whale watch tour I could there's all sorts of things that I could do that would be a lot of fun so looking forward to something interestingly enough though I was born on a Tuesday o and February 1 is on a Tuesday thought that was kind of cool taco Tuesday taco Tuesday I love tacos so here I'm going to tell you what being born on Tuesday means oh okay I looked it up you know like um Monday's Child is fair of face have you ever heard that poem yes yes yes Tuesday's Child is full of grace which I get I I don't know what that means like am I supposed to be graceful because I am not is it the grace of God because I don't know about that either I don't know but this says the ruling planet is Mars which symbolizes a fighting Spirit a desire for an independent and an obsession with winning that is me I am an [ __ ] when it comes to being competitive I was born on a Saturday what does that mean okay the this child is born with a task to resolve modest slow and studious tuned to other worlds and lifetimes Saturday's child will be wise professional practical strict and suspicious with a tendency to put their head through a wall when they want something badly wow if that isn't like I don't know gez there's a little more this is also you this is also you Saturday born people are typical individualists and prefer to be alone but have great organizational skills oh I am so organized yes you are you are that's one of the reasons why you and I have always been a really good team because where my Aquarius ass self is not organized you are wow I found out I might not be an aquarius wait what have you ever heard of siderial astrology no what we know and I am not an astrologist so take this all with a little grain of cannabis what we're familiar with is called the tropical system like for example what's your Sunshine what's your Sunshine shell my sunshine sunshine what's your Sunshine shell I am a Gemini you're a Gemini I am an aquarius however I might actually be a Capricorn what I've been discovering I follow some amazing people on Twitter that are awesome siderial astrologists the tropical system follows where the the signs were where the planets and everything were 2,000 years ago however because of the wobble of the planet they move about one degree every 72 years or something like that again not a professional so you were actually not born under the sign of Gemini because of where things are changed have you met me I know I said the same thing because I'm like I am so an aquarius that fits me so well and shelle your birthday is like May 30th or 31st right May 31st all right May 31st you're a Taurus you were actually born under the sign of Taurus because cerial astrology follows where the signs are right now if you actually looked up where you were not through astrology but actually astronomy if you looked up astronomy and saw what sign you were born under you'd be a Taurus Tauruses are not like me I didn't think Capricorns were like me either but then I started reading my chart and It's oddly really accurate in Aquarius there's some stuff that didn't quite fit and in Capricorn there's some stuff that doesn't quite fit but when I look at my whole chart on either one I'm starting find that the siderial one actually fits better it's really bugging me because I always I'm an aquarius I so identify as an aquarius so it's giving me a little bit of a giving me a little bit of a personal crisis here an identity crisis I don't know Taurus like I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm a closet Taurus maybe we'll have to look into it but was interesting right we'll have to do an episode on doing our charts o okay maybe we can get someone who who does Tropical and someone who does cederal that would be interesting oh my gosh that would be a lot of fun I would love that like I just right now like I hear you but I'm not 100% sold on your thought process I felt the exact same way when I started I thought there's no way I'm a Capricorn and I still feel very attached to Aquarius but I'm willing to grow and learn I'm open-minded I'm and and honestly it was really interesting to read it was as much as I'm I guess maybe that is kind of a goat quality as much as I'm being stubborn about it I think it's probably where I'm going to end up maybe I am a Capricorn oh no Taurus now now just one more time what was that way called siderial it's spelled like side real s i d r e a l okay I got I'm gon I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to put a little bit into this yeah it's really interesting I'm very very intrigued and I I I I was so taken aback like can't even process this right now that you know you don't have to switch over nobody's saying that doesn't have to be if it doesn't resonate it doesn't have to work for you and that's okay but I love that you're going to kind of look into it that you're intrigued enough that you're gonna check it out yeah and for the love of God tell me what tourist qualities I have oh I could tell you have you ever done sometimes I've done I'm not going to do it this year because it's it's a little much but every once in a while I goof around with my family and I call it like my birthday month be like Yay it's my birthday month you have to be nice to me and me I don't really do anything special but like I like to claim it's a small month it's very short I like to claim the whole thing uh one of my children is like that she oh I know which one yeah yeah yeah it's a it's it's supposed to be like a national holiday for like 30 days I don't know yeah yeah that's me but I'm the light version of that I just say it I don't actually do anything I do treat myself a little bit you know more likely to buy the better no she means it no no no she she she means it she means it she's hardcore about it it's great she's wonderful love her as we discovered when we were going over topics a couple weeks ago we are both doing axe murderers which is funny because we did not plan that at all not that really shocked me I was quite interested to see that I mean I I just I think my story is just one of those age-old everybody's heard it but no one really knows what really happened even to this day Lizzie bordon took her ax and she gave her her mother 40 wax which actually it wasn't a whack I think it was more like a hack interesting but but the the thing about the rhyme when she saw what she had done she gave her father 41 she actually didn't give her father 41 wax just for the record um she actually gave she actually gave him 29 interesting if we're going to be technical well just a little bit of a teaser the killer in my story also was just about as wacky did about as many wax I don't know they for whatever reason axe murderers seem to be really big on Overkill obviously if you look at the facts it kind of all all arrows point to to Lizzy when push comes to shove she was actually found not guilty oh well let's let's start at the beginning what H I'm going to light a joint because I've heard the I've heard the poem you know I've I've heard that I remember jumping rope do kids still jump rope am I going to date us again if I say I don't even think I don't even think Kids jump rope anymore I really don't well I used to jump rope to it well I am I am ready to talk about the 19th century ex murderer Lizzie bordon was she guilty was she not guilty we don't know we'll never know I don't know why we don't know well there was no forensics that's probably a reason we don't know I think that's why there may have been more serial killers and more murders like that back then because I mean unless you basically wrote your name in the in the victim's blood they weren't going to know it was you or did it right in front of the cops yeah no like there were ways to get away with stuff then and this is going to be like one of those American Mysteries forever did she didn't she she had a lot of good reason to but just because you have reason to doesn't make you a murderer so we'll see what we find out you know they were a very wealthy family in Fall River Massachusetts this took place in Fall River Massachusetts and at the time late 1800s about 1890 their family had what would be equivalent today a $10 million Fortune oh nice so they were they were considered like a prominent family in Fall River you know $10 million isn't nothing to Blink at especially when you're you're talking about 1890 but the father was kind of abusive Lizzy's mother died when she was young she did have an older sister but she she was left with her father her sister and her were left with her father wasn't necessarily a kind man think of like eaner screw like was like that just cold and uncaring and miserly and yes cold and uncaring and miserly exactly like they lived in a house that didn't even have a bathroom but yet were worth like 10 million bucks because wait a minute when was this this was the early 1900s right 1890 it was 1890 they had indoor plumbing then didn't they well if you wanted to install it and I mean if you had 10 Mill million dollars you could get yourself some indoor plumbing and that was why she was pissed she was like why the [ __ ] don't we have a bathroom we can afford it and he's like we don't need to waste our money on that wait I she didn't have a mom I thought the poem says she gave her mother 40 wax or something so lo and behold a stepmother comes into play oh there's a stepmother okay that makes sense so it was actually the stepmother that was murdered it doesn't fit into the poem so well though right right right right gave her stepmother 40 yeah no I don't I don't think that really kind of flows well but yeah so he was like very greedy not greedy per se but miserly miserly did not want to spend any of his money had a bunch of it didn't want to spend it now I actually watched kind of gearing up for this story I watched this movie very interesting on Prime Amazon Prime good selection Elizabeth Montgomery uh Samantha and bewitched remember her so in 1975 she was in a Lizzie bordon movie and played Lizzie bordon which by the way she was kind of like a psycho it was so weird to see Elizabeth Montgomery be like the bad lady so the Bewitched mom would played Lizzie bordon yeah oh wow she didn't do the nose thing right no she didn't do the nose thing you know I I I watched a couple of things and and read back into a couple articles including on uh history.com in the Smithsonian uh magazine website and there seems to be some accounts of sexual abuse from the father well how long was it from the time her mom died until he remarried like 15 years and how old was she do you know she was younger when her mother died um and all of her teenage years and early 20s was just her her sister and her dad okay Lizzy and her sister still lived at home and were in their mid to upper 30s which at that time if you were in your mid-30s still living at home and unmarried you were kind of SP yeah on the Shelf you were no longer desirable these girls really didn't have any other option than to live with their father and their stepmother you know it's not like today you don't just go out and get a job and get an apartment get your own place right they didn't have anything dad has a lot of money reported abuse throughout their their lives whether it be emotional abuse physical abuse sexual abuse and when Lizzie was in her mid-30s it kind of came to a head she got fed up with not living the lifestyle that she thought she should be able to live due to their financial status in the Community she wasn't happy with the fact that part of that choice by her father is kind of what led her down the life to be a spinster yeah there's got to be a lot of builtup resentment there he basically denied her her whole life right but in the same respect you cannot have a lot of money and be that tight to the bell and do business the way you do business without pissing off half the town he was a property owner so you know people didn't pay their rent they got evicted you know you didn't pay your bills they came after you right so you know he did have a lot of enemies being a rich upper class person he was kind of gruff with everybody not just his children and his family so he wasn't the most well-liked guy in town either just because you're rich doesn't mean people like you right you can't buy friendship right so Lizzie wasn't necessarily the only person with a motive but you know some things that really didn't fit well uh are she was the only one home at the time of the murders now at the time that was kind of a bustling town for the 1890s and there were neighbors there were like this was a town and and this happened in broad daylight and she was home like nobody heard anything nobody saw anything nobody saw anybody break into the house nobody saw anybody run away but nobody heard screaming Lizzy claimed to not hear screaming she claimed to be outside in the yard or something nobody knows you know it wasn't the days of like street cameras and all that stuff it's almost like a he he said she said she seems to be the only person that had the access so what what happened well on a nice one ful summer day in August 1892 Lizzy's stepmom was found in the upstairs bedroom hacked to death 20ish axe marks just hacked to death in her bed wow who found her Lizzy oh wow yeah so she's also the person who found them so there's that and then downstairs on a like a a long couch I guess we'll call is where the father was found now the stepmother was just kind of randomly hacked to death no Rhyme or Reason whereas the father he was stabbed or or hit with the axe like 29 times or something and all of them were to his face wow that's pretty vicious so it wasn't like you know hacked him in the back hacked him in the stomach hacked him in the leg whatever like all the hack were at his face o 29 wax of an axe to the face somebody was angry so the theory is is that the father was downstairs napping the stepmother was upstairs the stepmother was killed first and then the father was killed second supposedly Lizzie's outside comes inside finds the bodies here's an interesting piece back then uh religion was very detrimental to status in Upper New England and there was a doctor that lived next door but because he followed a different religious path Lizzie would not let that doctor come over and actually made her servant go to a doctor across town uh people kind of question that and wonder you know if your father was just hacked to death wouldn't you get the nearest doctor not back then no and she wouldn't because the nearest doctor uh was the wrong religion yeah was the wrong religion so you know but she had the motive she had the the opportunity but again nobody saw anything nobody heard anything she could have been outside someone could have broke in someone else could have done it but she was very callous to the fact that her father was just hacked to death you would think that someone would be overwrought with grief she wasn't necessarily shitty why would she be said that the guy who molested and abused her for decades and prevented her from having a normal life was dead and besides it's still stupid to hold someone accountable for how they act after someone died I mean everyone reacts to grief very very differently some people completely go stoic some people are overwrought and fall down and scream some people laughs everyone reacts to to grief especially someone that close to you in such a if she found them hacked like that who knows if she had been in some type of catatonic or disassociative state or something I mean what a horrible thing to say you didn't show grief the way I wanted you to so that must mean you're guilty but that's 1892 for you well I think they still do it now but yeah yeah but that that contributed to why they thought she wasil but again there were other people who hated him there were other people who had motive he was the Scrooge of the town and he had all the money he must have had a ton of business enemies right right and and just because his daughter didn't grieve the way they expected her to doesn't automatically make her guilty right because probably would have then she's a spinster and she didn't show proper grief guilty and stood to inherit everything well with her older sister right right correct where was Sister in all this she was like visiting out of town couldn't have been her convenient there was a servant that also now here's some interesting uh side fact for you so there was a servant and the servant was supposedly Li uh Lizzy's lesbian lover good for her got to find happiness where you can some of the stuff you dig up about the potential of her assisting with a cover up because see now here's some things that kind of make Lizzie look guilty a day or two after the murders she all of a sudden had a paint stained dress that just had to be burned you know when you got a stained dress you burn it right isn't that how they disposed of garbage though like well yeah probably but you know also okay suspicious she burned she burned a dirty dress pink stain could have been blood right well there was a witness that she brushed up against wet paint but you know you know how chicks are did she purposely brush up against wet paint so she'd need to burn a dress so it would cover her ass who knows devious could be devious could be wet paint we don't know right it's just interesting that and it and it it kind of went down to religion was part of the reason she got got not guilty being rich was part of the reason she got not guilty a lot of controversy um in the politics so Fall River at the time was part of the reason she was she was made not guilty I don't think she was guilty I think she was innocent she could have been innocent she could have been innocent because again there was a lot of people who wanted this guy dead they had you know he he was unpopular he had some shady business dealings like I said he was kind of like a a a landlord a big landlord in town you know pay your rent or get out you know nobody likes that guy right but you know what people didn't realize is in in the trial of Lizzy a lot of his tightfisted came out people thought that he was just that way in business and then realized that he actually treated his family the same way it was just it was really sad actually if she did do it you might almost see why but you know again in that time the the lack of any sort of forensic whatever right maybe if she did do it she thought that was her only way out he had kept her trapped for so long maybe she thought that there was no other Escape right right so they just they just had not enough to go on not enough to go on so Lizzie Got Away With It essentially if it was her nope I say she's innocent I'm on the Lizzy board and his innocent crew she didn't give a [ __ ] what people said they talked about her a whis sped behind her back she stayed in that town she lived until she was 69 you know she stayed there and she just so they they tried her and found her not guilty just the on yeah yeah they even tried to get her for shoplifting in like 1905 did she lose all the money no no um she she she lived out her life up with her lover no and she became and and here's the weird thing she did become a Ed from her sister but they ended up dying within days of each other in 1927 and then were both buried next to their murdered parents in Oak Grove Cemetery in Fall River as you can imagine Lizzie and her sister uh whose name is Emma are said to be there the parents are said to be there so it is it is believed that the whole family is still in the house you can hear the stepmother screaming upstairs sometimes you can you can stay in the room that she was murdered in no yeah you know these people died in a tragic way and and had a tragic life you know Lizzie and her sister had a tragic life that that the dad and the the Stepmom died in a tragic way the the spirits that are trapped in this house or refus to leave this house they're sad they're angry they're confused now have people had experiences in the house does anyone describe any seances or people do there has been um Ghost Adventures Ghost Hunters have all been there um all of your traditional popular ghost hunting TV shows I guess you'll call them um have all done investigations there they do hear the spirits they do see apparitions it seems like if you're willing to pay the 225 a night it is or so to stay there that not only are you going to get an interesting place to stay but you will definitely hear or see something in that house oh yay well let's add it to our East United States itinerary I I do want to point out that I don't you know this part I don't always buy into I will mention it because it was mentioned in several things I came across they say there's a lot of activity uh between 2 and 4 am. the witching hour the wiing hour but I definitely believe that if if a house is haunted as much as the Lizzy bordon house would appear to be haunted that you would have those experiences at any time of night but they do say that there's extreme activity in the middle of the night well that would make sense I mean the witching hour is the witching hour for a reason I mean the veil is thinner at that time and and energies might be stronger at that point so if if that is a thing that might be why right right and plus we'll be smoking at 4:20 a.m. so we'll definitely be seeing something maybe in Lizzie boron's bedroom oh or in her lovers I mean I just I can we bring a Ouija board to this one or is that a no no you know I would where would you most like to use a Ouija board in the Lizzy board in house you know I think you're on to some I'd probably do it in Bridget's room the lover the right let's get some she had to have seen a lot more than anyone has gives any credit to I mean the servants see everything she knew what was going on and if she was lizz's lover then you know she had the inside scoop she was also an Irish immigrant and Irish immigrants at that time were looked down on um so she she was very much a servant being an Irish immigrant so she probably saw a lot of stuff that she was just too afraid to report talk about testify against well she's female and an Irish immigrant so therefore unimportant Lizzy was an unmarried overaged female so she also unimportant and they were lesbians so therefore very unimportant and probably evil but if the dad was out of the way Lizzy have the money that's true which is actually what happened good for her so as you can imagine the family is still home they haven't left it's been a hundred or so years and and the bordens are still home every night in in Fall River Massachusetts I say I say let's go have a sleepover with them let's do it what stories those walls have to tell you know and I think that's the interesting part you know I believe that houses buildings what have you can kind of absorb that residual energy oh yeah we've talked about that before you know places for whatever reason like the the Stanley Hotel with all the courts underneath it kind of helping to hold that energy there and and I I think that this would be one of those places where you know you say oh if the walls could talk I think this at this place I think the walls would talk sayings like that become sayings for a reason right I I I think the walls would talk at this place but you know what like I said it's it's a it's an active bed and breakfast I think we need to check it out people people claim to see Lizzie on the regular and and I want to see her too I want to ask her too because I know she didn't do it I'm totally team innocent what if the servant did it and Lizzie covered you know I I think I might be on team innocent because of my story of a similar Axe Murder oo do tell do tell I think it's really interesting that your murder is so well known that there's a children's rhyme about it that's pretty popular whereas the murders that I'm covering are very similar and it's you know completely unsolved very mysterious but I'd never heard of it before can we just just take a moment and talk about the fact that a children's rhyme about an Ax Murderer what is wrong with people kids rhymes are terrible well Ring Around the Rosie is about the plague is it really I didn't know that oh yeah ring ring around a Rosie it was the way the disease looked on you it was like a red dot with a ring around pocket full of posies was posie was a small bouquet of flow and people thought that if you held a bouquet of flowers or sometimes like a sachche of herbs up to your nose and mouth you could prevent the germs from getting to you and a little bit they weren't wrong I mean masks do work and they were kind of masking but not very effectively so pocket full of posies ashes ashes they burned all the bodies to try and prevent the spread of disease We All Fall Down everyone died wow I guess when you look at it that way that's pretty shitty yeah no that's really what it was and so I mean a lot of kids rhymes are really morbid I mean wow yeah who how how are parents just like yeah that's that's a good one keep going Rocka by baby oh yeah that's yeah okay baby how twisted is that took me a minute yeah damn we have a dark history here in America no wonder there's so many ghost stories we're twisted I'm such a helicopter parent I am the person who changed the last line to Rocka by baby cuz I couldn't do it I changed and down will come and down will come baby cradle and all I changed it to and Mom will catch baby cradle and all because I'm I can't do it I'm such a marshmallow I couldn't I just I just rolled with with the tried to true well who thinks about that who thinks that ring around a Rosie or or Rocka by baby or I mean Lizzie bordon is obviously Twisted it's not hidden in there that's like more in yourr face Twisted all right so I'm lighting another joint I'm going to smoke this up let me see what I'm smoking today what are you smoking Today show I don't even know let me look I don't even know silver haze Kush that's what's on to for me today very tasty very good very much a head high nice I am smoking some Captain America OG o yeah this is a little bit less expensive but honestly this is one of those you know how when you go to the dispensary and you can pick the super expensive [ __ ] and it's sometimes it's great sometimes it tastes and smokes just like the inexpensive stuff yeah well I think this Captain America OG is really my it's this is my secret cheap weed it's really not that expensive like ounces out here can go for 350 $400 for the good stuff this one squeaks by at1 $150 an ounce depending on when I get it and it's a local grower and damn it's fire I love this stuff so much it's a it's a sativa it's got a great flavor great high when I want to save a little bit of money which is all the time right but still get good [ __ ] I love this Captain America OG it's good stuff that sounds delicious it really is all right so I'm going to get a little high tell me about your ex murderer so a summer June just like yours summer of 1912 in a little town of valisa Iowa this is a small town of less than 2,000 people everyone knew everybody else I mean all the neighbors knew each other pretty much by sight and they they took care of each other they watched out for each other in this town Josiah and Sarah Moore was a young couple and Josiah had been a businessman and much like in your story he had built up his fortune do rich people always get xed to death is that the theme Here I wouldn't say he was rich but he was definitely well off so Josiah and Sarah Moore young parents they had four children Herman who was 11 Catherine 10 Boyd who was seven and little Paul was five well respected in the town they had a little farm there and in the beginning of June they were helping out as their local Presbyterian Church was hosting a children's day service Sarah Moore was one of the co-coordinators of this event her children and the children of the Town performed little speeches and little plays and recitations and and it was a just a great all day event there was food and everyone having a good time just kind of hanging out celebrating children's day so at the end of the day two children Ena stillinger 8 years old and Lena Gertrude stillinger 12 who were friends of of the Moors daughter Catherine they asked if they could spend the night at the Mo's house and their parents gave them permission and the still inured girls and the more family walked the three blocks from the center of town to their little house and no one ever saw them alive again the kids even too the kids too so it was about 9:30 p.m. when the family got home and since it was so late and they'd had such a big day they had a fun little dinner of milk and cookies the two guests Ena and Lena went to sleep in the guest bedroom on the first floor now this is a really small house so it was just like a a main room in the kitchen and then a small guest bedroom and the two little girls went to sleep there and then the family went upstairs to the two bedrooms the four more children went to sleep in their room and Josiah and Sarah went to sleep in their bedroom while the family had been enjoying the church's Children's Day events someone else was slipping through the unlocked front door of the family's house and then going up the stairs unnoticed to the attic where they lay in wait all day oh so some what they were targeted then they think so they found two cigarettes so they know that the killer hid there smoking two cigarettes as the family had their late night milk and cookies and then he waited while they all went to sleep were they robbed no they didn't take anything so what they determined happened was sometime after midnight the killer took an oil lamp from one of the dressers and took that glass cover you know the chimney off of it and set it underneath a chair so it wouldn't be in the way then he turned the wick down really far and bent it over so it was very very small so he had this oil lamp with just a teeny tiny light as he moved through the house oh so it's casting this faintest glimmer as he's walking through the sleeping house and he goes first to the master bedroom where Josiah and Sarah are sleeping and he has this axe that he must have taken from the shed outside Josiah's Axe and he swings this axe with the blade down crashing into into Josiah Moore's head crushing him and probably killing him instantly before turning the back of the axe again a single blow killing Sarah Moore in her bed before she had time to wake up that's shitty the killer then went to the bedroom next door and killed all four children similarly in their beds bashing them with the blunt end of the axe until they were dead that's horrible he went downstairs to the guest bedroom where little Lena and Ena are sleeping and he killed Ena instantly in her sleep and they think possibly Lena was the only one who may have woken up because she was found crosswise on the bed everyone else was found curled up asleep and probably died instantly but Lena was found kind of across the bed outside of the covers with her arm up over her head and she's the only one who had defensive wounds on her oh wow now the coroner said that there was no sexual assault of anyone including Lena even though she was found without Underpants and her night gown had been pushed up to her chest um and she did have defensive wounds and blood on her knees but the coroner said no sexual assault had taken place even though other outlets said it had so that's one of those things that maybe did yeah so she was probably the only one that who was awake oh wow after he killed everyone the Axeman went back upstairs and taking his axe reduced the heads of Joe and Sarah to pul he swung the axe so many times and with such force that there are blade marks in the ceiling like why was he why was he so angry he struck Joe alone and estimated 30 times in the head and left all six members of the family unrecognizable that is somebody who is really really mad that is not a random I'm just going to swing by these people's house and kill them kind of thing like what did he do to piss this guy off Joe was the only one on which he used the bladed side of the axe everyone else it was only the blunt side and interestingly some of the axe marks in the ceiling weren't anywhere near where the bodies were were found they think maybe he in a fit of rage or excitement maybe had been swinging the axe just wildly in random places then it gets a little stranger after completely going through and bludgeoning these already dead people until they were unrecognizable the killer rummaged through their drawers and took out clothes and blankets and covered all their heads so he pulled the sheets and blankets up over Joe and Sarah and he put t-shirts and dresses over the children's faces that's weird he then in some sort of ritualistic manner went through the whole house and covered all the windows all the mirrors and any reflective surface with clothing or blankets then he cooked himself dinner in their kitchen and left it uneaten on the table on the kitchen table next to a bowl of water that had blood and gore in it like he had washed his hands in the bowl of water also in the guest bedroom he left the murder weapon the bloody axe leaning up against the wall next to a 2B slab of uncooked bacon that he had taken from the ice box wrapped it in a towel and then just left it there next to the murder weapon was this guy mental well nobody knows who did it he then took the keys of the House locked the doors and left before Dawn the next morning one of the neighbors Mary Peckham was out you know the local Busy Body she's out doing her laundry in the morning and doing her chores and those lazy Moors they're over there doing nothing not doing their laundry there's no smoke coming out of the chimney their horses Restless in the barn she doesn't see any sign or sight of them and she normally does by 7:00 a.m. in the morning so she's a little suspicious and goes over to the house and discovers that the windows are covered and the front doors locked again very unusual for the town nobody ever locked their doors here still a nosy neighbor right absolutely nosy neighbor goes to peek in the windows and can't so she's like well can't have this so she calls Rossmore Josiah's brother he comes over about a half an hour later and he has a spare key he opens the front door and lets himself in and because the house is so small he's able to see the guest bedroom promptly shuts the door turns around and throws up completely white as a sheet so he doesn't go any further and he calls felisa's Marshall Hank Horton so Hank comes along and he brings a couple doctors and Wesley Ying the minister of the Presbyterian congregation same thing in this town like the methodists and the Presbyterians were not happy with each other right so they bring the minister some doctors the County coroner comes and another Dr FS Williams who's actually the first person to examine the bodies and give an estimated time of death so Dr Williams goes in and examines the scene and when he comes out there's more and more towns people are coming because they've heard of of this horrible scene he comes out looking visibly shaken and he says and this is quoted in a lot of newspapers don't go in there boys you'll regret it until the last day of your life oh wow that didn't stop anyone at this crime scene where eight people six children were brutally brutally murdered it becomes almost like a maab carnival over a hundred towns people trooped through up and down the stairs through all the bedrooms Town's people picked up the murder weapon the axe and took turns swinging it oh my God like a baseball bat oh my God imagine doing that at a crime scene today absolutely not some of these sick bastards even took pieces of Josias Moore's skull as keepsakes oh my God after over a hundred random people troop through you can imagine there's no physical evidence to be found you can't there's not going to be any fingerprints there any hairs or fibers or anything that they might have picked up in 1912 is now irrevocably lost or damaged or corrupted wow and ironically enough that was the same year as the Titanic bad year that apparently was you've said that before that apparently was a very bad year it is very it is very interesting though about how you know back in 1912 everybody in town could just tra through crime scene whereas today holy mackerel you can't even fathom that thought I think that's why a lot of these things went unsolved is because they they didn't keep things Pure or pristine maybe there would have been some sort of evidence that they could find I mean this guy left a lot of things including like not only did he wrap that bacon in a blanket and leave it next to the murder weapon oh my gosh my foster cat is playing with everything dude they did find like a part of a keychain there that was discovered not to be the stillinger or the mo families so that could have been was it from the killer was it from one of the people that were trooping through the house they don't know well they didn't have the same technology though so even if they did have that stuff they wouldn't have had any any way to do anything with it well they could still do I think they could do fingerprints at that time we'll have to find that out you know they could I don't know I don't know but if any belongings had been dropped you know if any items had been dropped I mean I know they were doing collecting evidence and things at that time so they they should have been able to find something like that there were a couple suspects there are actually quite a few suspects and none of them really ever seemed to pan out of evidence a lack of evidence but to someone to kill children you would think that I mean one of the suspects was a business rival the man that Josiah Moore had worked for and then set up a competing business stealing half of his clients to take with him to start this competing business they hated each other and in this small town they would like go across the street to avoid walking next to each other which was like you know that's huge shade back in the day yeah but kill each other man don't kill the kids right like even if he hired someone to kill him would he really hired someone to kill all those kids too it just it doesn't really add up they think he possibly hired a man named William Mansfield to murder Josiah because of the humiliation of stealing his business oh Mansfield was plausible as a suspect because in 1914 this happened in 1912 anyway uh in 1914 Mansfield was the chief suspecting killing his wife her parents and his own child in Illinois so but you know one thing you got to remember whether it's in the early 1900s or the mid or the late 1900s or the early 2000s you got a guy that is willing to be a murder For Hire guy d a unstable to begin with like the guy is crazy enough that if you give him money he'll just go kill random people so maybe he had no qualms killing the four kids it's possible and it does certainly sound like he had the temperament for it however he had a rock solid Alibi for the night of the murders oh that didn't stop people from thinking that it was still possible everybody loves the whole Revenge story well that's why I was wondering if it had to do with money because you know a lot of people back then would kill anybody for money realistically possible it's very possible but it just doesn't seem again very plausible another person who was actually tried who actually confessed to doing it and then later recanted was a a preacher named Lynn George jacqulyn Kelly he was a known sexual deviant with known mental health issues and the first time he was ever in bisa was the morning of the children's oh [ __ ] what was that called was the morning of the Children's Day event the night of which the Moore family was killed so he shows up for that day and attends Sarah Moors preschool and essentially as a pedophile services and essentially yeah he's a known mentally ill sexual deviant and you said there was question on whether they were sexually assaulted correct it was the coroner said it did not happen newspaper Outlets said it did the only evidence that they quoted was the blood on her legs and that her um night dress was pushed up did the coroner say she wasn't sexually assaulted to spare the family some pain and she actually was or maybe she wasn't and she was just happened to try to move to get away from the Killer and that's just how it happened right uh he was found not guilty and the other there was a lot of stuff about him like the coroner determined that the killer was probably left-handed due to the nature of the marks and the ceiling and the wounds on the people and this preacher was left-handed however the preacher was only 5 foot two my height we're short people even a long axe there was no way he was going to be able to hit the ceiling with that axe unless he was standing on something oh okay so it didn't fit with his physical profile correct also during that time there were other Axe Murders that happened you just told us about one and they had a lot of similar qualities people being asleep in bed and hit excessively in the head multiple multiple times some other murders in other states around that time that the axe murderer killed them in their sleep in their beds covered their heads with blankets and covered windows with blankets that also seems to be a common theme and one of of the things that they found for this murder was in the barn outside of the Moore's house there was a depression in the hay bales against the wall facing the house and one of the knot holes had been pushed out so it looks like possibly someone had made themselves a cozy little spot there to spy on the house either in the days leading up to the murder or the the day of the murder so the pr the Predator the sexual predator actually kind of fits the bill a little more it seems well he fits the bill but he was at the Children's Day events so he couldn't have been holed up in their barn or up in the attic waiting for them and also he was too short to have made the marks in the ceiling and if he was a known sexual deviant and it's true that no one was sexually molested then he really doesn't fit so there was a train station that went right through the town so it's possible that someone could have jumped on the train saw the the girls at the house and spent the day in the barn watching them went up into the attic when they left to go to the Children's Day festivities while and smoked a couple cigarettes while he waited for them to come back and fall asleep and then brutally murdered them before hopping a train Before Dawn you know there a lot of crazy people fell into the crack spec then and it could have really just been that simple it very well could aam's Razer and all that but I think with so many different Axe Murders happening very similarly within a 20year time frame around that time maybe the railroad is common theme maybe it was someone that was hopping the railroad and just randomly killing people right because the railroad did go through Fall River again I mean Lizzy no way the railroad went through the Fall River town where the Lizzy Bardon yeah no [ __ ] it's a coastal town you know they put they' take stuff off the boats and then rail it to wherever well now I am even more firmly in the camp of Lizzie bordon didn't do it and I think um I think as a railway transient serial killer did both of these maybe not the same one I mean there is like 22 years between them but something but you're right though you know there wasn't there was easier ways to get away with stuff back then what better environment to literally get away with murder good point and on that note thank you all so much for listening all of our tons of users we love you so much we love you and appreciate you all so so so so much I'm having so much fun with this podcast I mean who doesn't love an excuse to smoke good weed right not that I need an excuse but please like subscribe and review our podcast on whatever Forum you listen we appreciate you we are so thankful for all of you guys thanks for hanging out with us and thanks for hanging out with us while we get high and talk about apparently crazy a murderers how fun was that so tell so which one is spookier who did it did Lizzie bordon do it was it an Axe Murderer were the valisa murders carried out by the creepy preacher or was it a train transient was it the train transient murderer the X-Man of the trains you decide let us know you know I I I'm starting to agree I'll give credit where credits do I'm starting to get a little intrigued by some of these hauntings and paranormal stories from the West Coast I didn't think there was as many as there are so I'm excited to see what other things you're going to dig up and talk about with us I love that because I mean we we grew up amongst the East Coast stories you know they're they're ingrained it's soaked into our skin and and so that's why it's so good to get out of your comfort zone you know I came out here to the West Coast experience all new things well I always love tacos but experience all new things and all these new stories and I know you love new stuff so it's very exciting to kind of bring stories that maybe not new to everyone but are new to us it's kind of fun now what were you thinking of potentially talking about on our next episode well you being the organized one told me that you had your research list numbered and I don't I have a research list but it's just all sorts of topics I'm interested in or have been recommended to me just kind of all in a in a for in a a document um so if I just go by what's on top Alcatraz is next Alcatraz I I alcatra Island that is some place that's always been intriguing because some of the worst of the worst have been there I understand the whole shark infestation but I I just never have understood why people just can't swim to safety but yeah so Alcatraz Island is going to be my topic for our next podcast interesting I was I I actually i' almost forgot one you know I'm organized got my list try to keep things in order I actually skipped over one which is so unlike me I wanted to talk about uh the Amityville Horror house um again another creepy horror movie from our childhood a book was written about the Amityville Horror house this is a actual house in Amityville New York and I I think that kind of like what we talked with with the Exorcist this is one of those things that there is a there there is a truth behind the book there is a truth behind the movie and it's a little unsettling it's it's it's a little unsettling this is one of those places where you cannot spend the night and I'd give anything to spend the night I drove by there once did you really yeah did you get did you get that feeling when you drove by okay here's the thing I'm not 100% sure if the feeling was like was like a psychic Vibe or a I've heard all about you and your creepy Vibe I honestly am not sure which one it was I'd have to go again to see and we just drove by it's not like I stayed stopped or anything you might have been tainted by what you already knew right I cannot 100% say that the area has a creepy Vibe the house looks creepy I mean those windows are creepy I see a house down the street for me with those windows and I'm creeped out right exactly so I don't know if it's just that the the known history of the house made me feel that creepy Vibe or if I felt it from the place and I literally wasn't long enough there to analyze it gotcha gotcha well we're gonna we're gonna chat a little bit about it see what we see what we find about some things that have happened since the book was written since the movie was filmed oh I'm excited it's it's definitely definitely some paranormal stuff going on you know a lot of people don't necessarily believe in paranormal stuff this is one of those stories that kind of makes non-believers Believers this is one of those houses that could very well be on those lists of a portal to Hell o another portal to hell yeah why does the East Coast have so many portals to hell I was led to believe by Buffy the Vampire Slayer that the portal to hell was in Sunnyvale California like elevators in a hotel there's elevators everywhere and the East Coast just has a lot of elevators I guess I guess so a lot of portals who's making these portals and why do they go both ways do they go I have questions I don't know but there should be a portal to big buds and milkshakes I would go I would go that's probably why there's no portals is because no one would still be here we'd all be in the land of big buds and milkshakes thanks for listening to episode five of the stoned Witches Hour with shell and Lea tune in next Wednesday for episode 6 when we talk about Alcatraz in the amville horror house see you next time on the stoned Witches Hour
