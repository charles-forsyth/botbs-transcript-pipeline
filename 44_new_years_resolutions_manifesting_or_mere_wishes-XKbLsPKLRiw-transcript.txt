welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to episode 44 of back on the broomstick this is our last episode of December and the last episode of 2023 this of course has us thinking about New Year's Eve and New Year's Eve resolutions and what's a resolution if not a wish or maybe it's manifestation in this episode we'll talk to you all about the difference between manifestation and wishes and why shell hates New Year's Eve resolutions wishing all of you a very magical 2024 I'm Leila and I'm shell and I am like super excited because this is one of those fun ones where we have vastly different opinions I think a little bit I wouldn't say so vastly I guess we're already having a difference of opinion right let's start out and say that right now we are recording after Ule after Christmas and before the calendar New Year I want to let everybody know I know what Lea is about to say she's going to talk about how this is the forgotten week of the year so for everybody out there who has commented on Instagram sent us a message I am not ignoring you folks it has been a whirlwind of a UL christmus week two weeks however long it's been feels like it's been a year I will get back to you give me a minute shell is taking on that full Scandinavian Norse tradition of doing no work between Ule and New Year's in that 12 days of Ule well you know life happens but we are here in this Lial space and I love that everybody talks about what kind of a weird vibe this time of year has why is it the Forgotten week you know most Traditions talk about Santa Claus paying attention to you from the first of the year until Christmas so who's paying attention between Christmas and New Year's you know and Ule happens and there's the 12 days of Ule that ends on the morning of the 1 and that's just filled with festivities and hanging out and not doing work it's just kind of a weird vibe well and if you kind of look at the mundane world not a lot of people work this week the kids aren't in school you know it's holiday break it is just a recovering from peopling recovering from peopling oh that's a good way to put it and it's gearing up to the calendar New Year New Year's Eve celebrated the world over what does everybody do on New Year's Eve party hearty well and and drink a lot and kiss at midnight what kind of promises do they make to themselves okay I knew you were going there yes they make New Year's Eve resolutions now for all of you folks out there who make New Year's resolutions do not take any of my further comments personally how do you feel about New Year's resolutions sh I feel like they're just a bunch of you know how people say are you trying to convince me or yourself well a resolution is you definitely trying to convince yourself because everyone around you knows it's a bunch of well you're not that far off the statistics for people actually keeping their New Year's resolutions are pretty bad almost 25% of them go on to quit them in the first week and about 43% of them quit their resolutions by the end of January and fiser college says that by the end of January a full 43% of people have quit them and according to Time Magazine as many as 80% quit by the end of February only 8% of people managed to keep their New Year's resolutions for the full year now the history of New Year's resolutions goes back really really far the Farmers Almanac actually talks about New Year's resolutions going back to ancient Babylon what the hell were they what now their New Year's was in the spring a lot of older cultures had their New Year's either around SA or in the spring but usually at the change of a season which makes lot of sense our New Year's in January there's nothing really there to Mark a change not true not true um the sun has been reborn and it is the first week of the new light and we are celebrating the new light the new growth the new year I love I stand corrected no you're exactly right that's a very good point but as far as like a change in Spring it's not as big or noticeable as a change so sometimes people would celebrate the New Year's when new life started in the spring and so the Babylonians their promises their resolutions usually involved the return of farm equipment that they had borrowed I Goa so it was promises related to that maybe this was like a 80s or 90s thing but when I hear someone say that their New Year's resolution is to lose weight and not eat chips and cookies because we're all going to see you in line at Costco with your chips and cookies and there's a reason for that and I I think the reason gets kind of into what a lot of people think of as a promise or manifestation or some type of spell is usually really just a wish or like you say a lie that they're telling themselves most of these New Year's resolutions don't have a lot of power behind them and so they're doomed to fizzle out but a resolution is similar to a lot of these manifestation things I'm seeing online mind but there is a difference because you see I look at resolutions as like a wish or a prayer or I wish I could lose weight I just don't want to do anything to make it happen or I wish I was rich I just don't want to do anything to make it happen whereas on the opposite end if you're doing spellwork or meditation or whatever is a manifesting ritual or a manifesting spell there's a given take you can't just wish for something and just be like I wish I had this and not put any backing into it or any energy into it or any effort into it and expect something out of it your resolution or your wish is the first step of your spell which is to State your intention it isn't the only step though exactly your first step is to clarify exactly what it is you're asking for what you want and so that would be your resolution or your statement but just like shell said you then have to back it up with other things as well I mean New Year's Eve has a lot of power we've talked in the past about spellwork and manifestation needing to move power both magical energy and mundane energy in order to affect your will and I actually look at this is weird and I'm a weirdo and we all know this but I look at New Year's Eve almost as a I don't want to say it's like a holiday or like a sacred day but because of the society I live in and and you know the things that have been ingrained in me by the good old TV it is almost like a starting a new Clean Slate you know January 1st give it a go again you know I'm GNA try to get my  together this year you know whatever the case may be but it's kind of like an automatic Fresh Start for everybody and those manifestations on New Year's Eve if you put effort into them you can kind of reap what you sew as you go but I don't know I I feel that it is you know how like was the veil is thin you can communicate with your ancestors I look at new years's as a time where you know you can kind of reset Clean Slate start a new put the past behind you put this last year to rest next chapter you know what I mean I think you're exactly right I totally agree with you I mean the name of January itself comes from the Roman god yanis who was the two-faced God he looked behind and he looked ahead and that's exactly what January does you look behind and put the year behind you and put it to bed put it to rest and yet you're at the same time looking forward you're at that cusp that Lial space between one year and the next and it's given power because millions of people around the world acknowledge and recognize that space that day from the December 31st to January 1st it's recognized as an ending and a beginning everywhere that thought form that idea is powered by all the beliefs of all the people around us and you know you'd be foolish to not try to tap into that energy to create change that's very very powerful so yeah just like you said I completely agree it is a holiday that has been given strength and purpose because so many people believe in it that is why I absolutely love to and insist my sweet love give me a kiss right at the stroke of midnight like millions of people across the World almost that the first thing I'm doing in the new year is kissing you you know oh how romantic but there's almost like a a spellwork behind that you know what I mean let's take a little tangent here actually and talk about some of the different Traditions that people do for January 1 like kissing you know your sweet love at midnight to kind of seal that relationship and to bring sweetness into that relationship or having a toast with your friends to again celebrate that relationship a lot of people start money jars they'll get money jars ready for the first of the year for that next following year with the idea of having that power of that change over fuel their spell people will open a back door to let the old year out and open a front door to let the New Year in and I remember maybe not so magical you know until we were separated by distance we actually you and I spent I don't know 18 New Year's EES together many many thing New Year's Eve we actually would kiss our loves at midnight and then you know pack and pass yes smoke out the old smoke in the new you know there was a time when whatever I did I was gonna spend New Years with you no matter what we were doing come hell or high water I was going to make and that because that was a tradition that's what we did and starting the year together just kind of help strengthen that Bond and right it just was kind of second nature that we yeah ended and started together every year exactly and so any spell that you do at the beginning of the month you know the rabbit rabbit rabbit at the beginning or blowing cinnamon cinnamon blow yeah in into your front door if you're not familiar with a cinnamon blow you take either a little bit of ground cinnamon in your palm or if you're worried that it might harm your pets or cause any problems with people in the house you can also take a cinnamon stick and light it like a stick of incense and then you blow that either the smoke or the cinnamon itself from outside your home across the front door threshold into your home with the idea of bringing in abundance and prosperity to your home now take what Leila said and take it to heart because it is it is very true and very important but Side Story So I have two precious kitty cats that I love so I try not to do the powder and if I do I'm very cautious about how I do it I've actually done it out the window just for the sake of my cats so a month or two ago I was like you know what I'm just going to light this cinnamon stick on fire okay first of all people that don't want to light and when it does it smells like a house fire it doesn't even smell like cinnamon when that shit's burning and at one point I was so pissed off I actually just threw the cinnamon stick out the door and called it good for my cinnamon out the door thing so you know whether you're blowing it out the door in dust or if you're just taking that cinnamon stick and giv it a Chuck out your front door it works my intention was there absolutely I've I've seen many a person Chuck the cinnamon stick into the front door and then pick it up afterwards that's where I was at that day another one if you don't want to blow anything into your house is those cinnamon brooms that are super popular if you have a cinnamon broom that's not super decorative you can just sweep into your house but again you're you're bringing in the new the idea is you the night before sweep out the old the morning of sweep in the new but these are beginning of the month things that are so much more powerful because they're done on the first of the year not just the first of the month but the first day of the first month of the year right right it makes it that much more potent and Powerful now my plan it could involve throwing it out the window again I don't know I make no promises but I actually instead of doing it on the first this year I was planning on doing it on the second because I am a numbers person and correlation in numbers and I want to do it on 1 two 34 where's the three four come from I made up the three and the four is because it's 24 okay why are you with my idea here I don't know I don't know what it is it it sounded good in my head until I said it out loud and I'm like wait where is that three coming from well I do know that the last day of this year is 123123 maybe I'll do it that day 123123 is 123123 so that would be a very cool day to do it because that's kind of a neat number if you're into numerology see I knew there was some numerology going on this month I know for our try it next month we're going to be on the first you're going to be working on the cinnamon blow of a couple different types maybe different herbs or something different so we'll talk about that and I'm going to be working on the money Bowl spell for the first of the year so and and not to really give anything away too much prior but you know like I said I I have two lovely fur babies here and I have to be very cautious with what I do with the cinnamon yes so my my tri it is going to be more of a we'll call it shells incent version because I I will I will come up with a concoction that I burn as the pet safe cinnamon version right right awesome we all have animals that we love as much as our children and I am not putting my babies at risk I think one of the big problems shell has with New Year's resolutions goes back to one of the problems that we have with manifestation like the popular idea of manifestation that whole lucky girl syndrome that you see on some social media sites and the idea that your thoughts alone create your reality this can get very toxic and it's a very it's a very watered down idea of what manifestation actually is and to be honest a dangerous Rabbit Hole it is and I blame the book The Secret yeah I mean this book came out in what was it 2006 it was written by Ronda burn and the idea is based on the Law of Attraction and she I mean I liked it and I liked the movie don't get me wrong yeah I mean there's some uh Law of Attraction videos on YouTube I still watch because they're so uplifting and give me such a positive mental Vibe but there's a big old fat ass butt there you know just like anything in life you don't get something for nothing exactly and sometimes the idea that you can just will it to be right or if bad things happen to you it's because you thought it that's  up that's victim blaming that's terrible right and and there's some of us I mean I've talked before about having ADHD and you know my thoughts go in weird places sometimes and I have to raid them in you know it's not our thoughts don't always Define us our thoughts don't Define us and you know there's some people who have anxiety or negative thought patterns and telling them that their thought creates their own negative reality is is messed up and it can cause problems but also in the same respect our thoughts alone are not going to change the energy out in the universe you have to put out energy to change energy and if you ain't putting out you ain't getting exactly and we have talked before that our belief system is that spell workor is about manipulating energy in order to get things in the real world in order for your spells your rituals to work you have to put in energy part of it is going to be mental magical energy and on New Year's Eve you can tap into all that energy that's flying around because everybody's putting it into that idea of newness and you can direct that energy it's going to be very powerful but it's only going to get you so far right I don't know any which who's powerful enough to drop 10 lbs just because she made a resolution on New Year's unless they put in the energy in the real world as well because if that was the case I'd be one skinny ass right now exactly I would have won the lottery multiple times over you know putting your energy into it through spell workor is one step making that resolution doing the spell getting your energy into alignment because the good part of this manifestation is that your thought thoughts can help you know once you get your thoughts in alignment with what you want you start seeing opportunities you start seeing these things come a little easier you know that's what it will do for you and you still have to seize those opportunities and you still have to act on things and like the a no hand it to you on a silver platter it don't work that way the universe or the gods or or the energy that you're putting out are going to make these things these opportunities come come to you but if you don't open that door and step through it it's never really going to happen it there's mundane and magical all mixed in together but in the same respect even if you do put in the energy and the intention if you don't necessarily get that wish or whatever you trying to manifest if it doesn't come to fruition that does not mean you are cursed either okay like seriously a very good point very good point because I also think there's a sense out there that that if I wish for it hard enough or if I do what Tik Tock tells me to do to manifest it hard enough I will get it and if I don't there's something wrong with me that is not the case the universe also has just as much will as we do and sometimes our will in the universe's will don't Jive that's very true too and you kind of have to find that balance between is this spell really raising the energy that I want it to or is it taking me down a rabbit hole that I don't need to go is it causing more anxiety or more stress or is it helping me to feel more in tune with myself and More in tune with the universe and where I'm going and with my path and I also think if you put in time in energy whether it be through spell work or meditation or what have you you can also kind of see if what you're trying to manifest or wish for or have as a resolution whatever the case may be how realistic is that you know is it you know next year I'm never going to drink soda ever again you know me how realistic is that for me like not at all it would require a lot of work but if it was like you know maybe if I only drink half as much soda that's a more realistic thing to try to manifest or you know I want a new job but for that new job I need to get my resume in order I need to have interview clothing you know there are steps I need to take to get that job I want to manifest or you know I want to move into a new home okay well are you working on your credit you know there there's there's mundane back workor to some of this magic magic will help make these opportunities happen and they'll help to get you in alignment with having this happen but there's also that factor that you mentioned just a little bit ago that sometimes life just  happens sometimes bad things happen to good people no matter how much magic you work no matter how much energy you raise sometimes bad guys have good things happen to them no matter how much you've hexed them or how much they don't deserve it right what do they say like uh life's not fair the universe works in weird and up ways I don't know but we can't always control the outcome and it's not always going to be what we've worked towards and I think there's a misconception with was some of the stuff that you see with the manifestation that if I just close my eyes tight enough and wish hard enough it should just happen and kind of like resolutions if I lie to myself enough I'll believe it and we've lied to ourselves come on you've made resolutions that were complete I've made resolutions that were complete  we knew it was when we were saying it so that being said what can we do to make resolutions or to do do spellwork that isn't just that is actually going to at least get us partway well like I said just a minute ago I think part of it is figuring out what you want to manifest and then taking time to either do some spell work or or meditation or whatever and you know really dig deep is is what you're trying to manifest or wish for realistic write down your idea first and a lot of times you'll hear people tell you and it's very good advice that you should write your resolution or your your wish or your spell is if you already have it write it in present tense don't say I want a new job say I am happy and secure and successful in my new job in my new position I'm rich exactly say it as if you have it I am in a loving secure relationship so use positive wording that talks as if you have it right now that's the first step is to Define what you want and to State it in positive and present terms but that in my personal opinion then you need to take a step back and say is this attainable is this realistically attainable or am I just leading myself down to some show a heartache exactly exactly you know what type of concrete steps in the real world besides the magical world can you take to achieve this this is where I like to kind of intertwine magical and mundane ways to get to that end you know do a little bit of your mundane work and then your magical work like they go hand inand one handwashes the other you know it's like ying and yang you can't do one without the other and if you're doing your spell workor and that helps get you into a positive place and gets you in alignment with what you're looking for you know research has shown that these feelings of positivity can be part of the rest of your life they kind of bleed over into everything and it helps you to see the positive in things psychologist tal Ben Shahar says when you think of all you can be grateful for when you take stock you feel better when you feel better you become more open to and are more likely to notice and pursue positive experiences you then have more to be grateful for which then in turn improves the quality of your life and so on so their point with that is that if you can use magic and spellwork to help shift your mindset towards a certain thing it's kind of like the blue car Theory where if you set your mind to I'm going to buy a blue car suddenly you start seeing it everywhere spellwork can kind of put your mind and your psyche magically into a space where you're more likely to see opportunities you're more likely to see relationships or friendships or abundance or new things coming to you whatever it is that you asked for in your spellwork that's the whole idea is to change your mindset and to get it in alignment with what you're looking for so first you make your statement you make sure that it's positive and in the now and then when you start to raise your energy and put it towards that part of that is like what shell said is what are the steps to get there what steps do I need to take to get from here to there on the magical side of it you know like attracts like you know they say not to make the comparison but they say like with folks that have a cancer diagnosis that sometimes their attitude plays a part in their outcome you know if they have a really positive attitude they have a higher success rate than if they have a very negative attitude about their situation the placebo effect is is an actual measurable real thing if people think they were given something that will help them even if it's just a placebo it does help them and the attitude you know if you have a a positive attitude about it like attracts like and if you have a negative attitude like attract like you know one of the things that I learned is that magic flows where attention goes right so if your attention is on a certain area that's where your magical energy is going to be going you know it's not perfect and you don't have to think about it all the time and if you think something negative about it it's not really going to affect it so don't try to worry about that too much but if you can focus your attention on something like the blue car Theory you're going to start seeing those opportunities and those things come to you and that's the spellwork working with the universe working with the energies around you to help kind of get you into the path that you're asking for with your spell or with your resolution I mean for your manifestation to kind of come to fruition you know you have to have the belief the intention and the action and without all three it ain't going to happen you know you have to have those three pieces of the puzzle and it it doesn't have to be at New Year's Eve I mean any time that you want to make a change and you're using and you're using this type of spell it's going to be the same thing create a goal make it measurable and actionable create steps to get to it and then do your spellwork to get everything in the universe aligned with you and your goal as much as you can on a magical level and then go for it on a mundane level I always get so frustrated I'm in a bunch of different groups on a few different social media boards and you always see every single day someone will say I'm having XYZ issue and I want to spell for it I don't want to hear anything mundane and it bothers me I know why they say it say freaking Harry Potter man how can you do a spell and not do anything mundane along with it that's that's to me that doesn't make any sense they go hand inand you know sometimes the mundane creeps into your magical life whether you like it or not my mundane life is my magical life I mean I I guess maybe that's part of it because I don't separate the two you know you don't know your mundane life crash in your magical life until I don't know if you remember this one Lea but oh about 25 years ago I had a little baby boy and we were at my apartment doing a ritual and he comes running out and actually had to change his diaper in the middle of our ritual that's that's life but I do have a a real quick manifestation story that I didn't even think it was a manifestation ritual but it basically was you know we've talked about a couple of different times how I felt like I had a hard time fitting in or finding the magical Community here in Salem yes and this last belan on belan I happened to have to work in the office that day and as we've also discussed I like to spend my lunchtime shopping at local stores spending money on crazy witchy Goods on Main Street in sale Massachusetts actually ess6 street but yes and I remember you and I had been talking and I was getting kind of a little frustrated because I felt like it would be easier than it was and you know we had talked about different ways I could try to infiltrate the witchy Community here and none of them were working out on belan I purposfully went into a store and I was like I'm going to buy something to try to spark that manifestation buy something magical to try to spark that magic okay I ended up going into a store I shall not name currently and I bought I'm showing this to Lea y'all can't see it but it's a pretty ring it's a silver ring that has a crescent moon with a amethyst Stone in the middle of the Crescent my birth stone I like moons love amethyst and I was like you know that's a cute little pinky ring I'm getting that and I'm going to wear that and see if I can manifest myself a damn witchy group so that was belain big getting a May and when did you find me the coven that I'm now currently in what was that July yeah not too long after I mean not that it was like the next day and it usually isn't no and I had worn it actually I've worn it every day since belaine but I was kind of wearing it with that I'm looking for you and I need you to look for me and then what two months later you were like hey Shell I found this thing right mandora Magicka so my intention wasn't maybe to find a coven per se that was the end result but it was to kind of find myself in the witchy Community as as opposed to being an outsider looking in and sure as that thing worked when I bought this ring on belain I bought it with the intention of use this as a bat signal bring me a group or bring the group to me or me to the group and it worked and as a lot of you know metals and Stones hold energy very very well so Shell by setting this intention this idea in her mind as she went hunting for this ring is a spell in and of itself and as we all know shell is very much a seat of her pants you know by the bristles of her broom oh hell yeah just do the magic on the Fly kind of witch so she set this intention this spell in motion and then when she found the ring she felt the energy of the Ring was in alignment with what she wanted and by paying money money is another form of physical energy you know your work your labor goes into creating that money which holds it in value for you so it's a form of magical energy she then exchanged that money for the ring and then wore it for energy energy for energy which is again charging that ring with her intention of finding a magical community and she didn't narrow it too much by just saying coven or high priestess she said magical Community which gives magic and the universe and your deities a little more wiggle room right to give you what you're asking for right and then by wearing that ring whenever she wore that ring it would reinforce this magical energy and it just took a couple months and it happened it's perfect it was kind of like you know I I do a computer work and typing is part of my job and you know I'd be typing away on the old Lappy Toppy and I'd see that little sparkly in the light of of the ring and the stone and it'd be almost like where's people you know what I mean exactly I mean I I wasn't pound in the pavement every day looking for a group by any means but you know I'd look here and there and then I kind of started bitching to you a little more and you looked and you're like oh here it is send him an email and you know me antisocial I'm like oh I'm scared and I was like you know the ring and the whole thing just send the email shell and I did and it was fabulous and worked out exactly and you had looked for a couple years prior to setting that spell before you found it and then after setting the spell it was just a matter of weeks right but I still had to get over my social anxiety and write the email and send it you know they weren't going to freaking pick my ass out of the blue Clear Blue Sky and be like hey we found your email or phone number we want you know I had to right up and write the email and send it and kind of put myself out there which I hate doing there still was a little bit of mundane real world work exact right yeah I bought the ring but I still had to write the damn email and now I have seen some manifestation spells happen instantaneously or happen overnight most of them take a little bit of time I think that really depends on what you're trying to manifest first of all it really does I mean my least favorite thing is when someone is like oh I'm trying to manifest abundance or I'm trying to manifest having a child and then they're like the very next day I had a positive pregnancy test I'm sorry sweetheart but you got pregnant probably six to eight weeks ago your spell did not make you pregnant overnight right maybe the spell helped you to realize you were pregnant and to go by a pregnancy test possibly trust us we know we did a get shell pregnant spell before and they don't happen overnight they don't happen overnight so you have to use a little bit of logic too but yeah a lot of times these things make things in your favor May the universe conspire in your favor like I like to sign my emails because getting that energy behind you can be tricky but it's pretty beneficial and a lot of fun when it is but once you get that energy behind you if you put in a little effort and do your part you'll make things happen man exactly exactly so it's not it's not that I don't believe in the manifestations or that I don't believe in resolutions I just don't believe in the way that the majority of society goes about it yeah a wish or or saying it manifestation when you're not really doing anything when you're not raising energy magically in any way when you're not directing that energy magically in any way and when you're not doing real world mundane things to help take advantage of those magical opportunities that it's just a wish I mean if you're not doing anything behind it it's it's just a wish I had a step aunt once she always used to you know anything bad would happen she'd be like I'm just going to pray it away and it's kind of the same concept you can pray all you want you can have a conversation with Jesus himself but if you are not doing something nothing will happen energy for energy just like a money exchange you know I exchanged my money energy for the ring energy you still have to exchange some sort of energy if you expect anything back nothing is free and it also doesn't account for chaos and the fact that life is up sometimes sometimes you can do everything right and it's still not going to work you love your chaos magic unfortunately life is chaos I mean you can you can be as healthy as possible and do everything right eat the right Foods exercise and still get cancer this is what I like to tell people that I've mentored and and whatnot you can't change everything you can't work everything out with a spell you can't manifest everything you want or just as you can't wish for everything you can't wish for everything to go away either you can only control so much whether that is magically or in mundane world you still can only do so damn much and the rest it's up to the universe you have no control so you can't forget that element of there's a part of it you might have control of 85% but that other 15% it's a roll a dice man if you're doing a spell to get a relationship and no relationship is coming that's not necessarily because you did something wrong in your spell you know if you're sitting in your bed every day and not leaving the house and not talking to anybody some night and shining armor sure as hell just isn't going to pick your front door out of that big old city and be like you know what I'm going to knock on this door because I bet you there's somebody behind it like no you got to put yourself out there but you could still you could put yourself out there you can go to parties you can be awesome you can do your Shadow work you can you know have great hobbies and love yourself and do all the spell work and still not find anybody and that's maybe the person you were met for hasn't crossed your path maybe yeah or maybe the universe just sucks you know but it doesn't mean that you did anything wrong sometimes you can do everything right and still not get it you know and sometimes you can see somebody do everything wrong and get everything that they want not because you're doing something wrong it's just sometimes the universe is a that way you can't work everything every time right so like shell said make sure you're doing it magically and mundane and be realistic and be realistic about it and also understand that you don't always get what you want even if you do everything right think of it like your Christmas list to Santa you might get 95% of your list but when the hell have you ever gotten 100% of your Christmas list seriously and if you ever did your parents need to adopt me right me too but I love to do spellwork I mean saying all of that doesn't mean that I I don't do it because I love spellwork it really helps it gets me into the right mindset it it creates a a perfect Vibe for things to happen and spell work does work we've had spells that work fabulously so I'm not saying that it doesn't I'm just saying that sometimes the universe works in really weird ways with your spell work you're putting it out to the universe I'm willing to work with you are you willing to work with me just know that sometimes the answer is no it's a very good point that's a very good point you know before we end I want to tell you I did find when I was looking at the Farmers Almanac about some of the histories of where New Year's Eve resolutions came from the first mention of New Year's resolutions was in a Boston newspaper in 1813 and that was the first recorded phrase of the term New Year's resolution they also had a list of the most common resolutions from 1947 and the most common resolutions from today and they were surprising I got to hear this I got to hear this 1947 what are people weight loss okay so number 10 was weight loss nine was greater part in home life eight take better care of my health seven be more efficient and do a better job six be more religious and go to church more often five drink less four save more money three stop smoking or stop or smoke less two improve my character and live a better life and one is improve my disposition be more understanding and control my temper so those are the top 10 from 1947 if I called you up and said Lea my New Year's resolution is to control my temper and have a better disposition you would bust out laughing at me well you also were not alive in 1947 so that makes good thing because that is a resolution I would not be able to hold now what about today okay so today number 10 is spend more time with family which was on uh the 1947 is number nine so that's pretty close so number nine for now is fall in love which didn't appear at all in 1947 number eight help others fulfill their dreams also did not appear seven is quit smoking six is learn something exciting five stay fit and healthy four enjoy life to the fullest three spend less and save more which was really close because number four was save more money in 1947 number two is get organized which apparent ly they were all organized in 1947 because that also was not on the list well life was easier and drum roll the number one resolution of today do you have any guesses I'm going with weight loss ding ding ding ding ding you are a winner shell the number one resolution of today is weight loss which was the number 10 resolution in 1947 well because in 1947 body image perception was better that's it was it was it was different things were different then for sure so make sure when you make your resolutions that you have a clear-cut actionable goal that you back it up with some magical energy through spellwork and energy raising that you make steps in the mundane world to reach that goal and that you do something like shell had a ring or I really like manifestation jars or spell jars for this because that's an object like your ring that you can look at every day to help renew that idea or renew knew that spell some people use collages they'll make collages to represent the goal that they're reaching like a vision board like a vision board yeah something that you can put on the the background of your phone or your computer or actually in the real world you know somewhere where you're going to see it every day or a spell jar that represents that resolution or manifestation idea something that you'll see every day a a stone or a crystal or a piece of jewelry that you've charged with that intention so that it reminds you and kind of re-energizes that spell word to keep that energy moving forward throughout the year now before we end for tonight I have to ask and and I'll answer my own question after you answer have you made and if so are you willing to tell any resolutions well I have a couple that I'm not going to share they're too personal but I do have one that I I definitely want to share and you're gonna like by the way I'm gonna ask you offline because I'm nosy keep going this one is definitely for you and for me my New Year's resolution for 24 the big one is to be more organized hell yeah I have a lot of ideas and I've come a long way from our coven days that's for sure but I want to be more organized I need to keep my notes better my podcast information better but we have a lot going on and a lot of fun things coming up and I I really need to get my scattered brain my ADHD my oh look shiny squirrels kind of under control so that's my thing that's my goal how about you what do you have any New Year's resolutions Miss resolution hater I do I'm a resolution hater but I do have a resolution and it is realistic and attainable and probably a bigger issue than it should be um but my New Year's resolution is to pay all of my backd do Mass Pike tolls wow that's a tough one that's that's a big one there shell and if anybody has traveled or frequently travels on the Mass Pike or on the New York State throughway cuz I owe them too that adds up man it really does and it's what you want me to pay in tolls could you at least PVE a damn road get me off this soap box that'll be a whole another episode but yeah my New Year's resolution pay my Mass Pike tools well there you go that's a a concrete actionable resolution I'm impressed I love it because you know what I'm fine with my my chubby old butt and I don't need to lose weight a yeah you know I really like the idea of positive resolutions like this year I resolve to go to as many Pagan festivals and events as I possibly can okay so that's my second one can I give you a probably unrealistic but hopefully not here's here's a good one for you my New Year's resolution is that you and I live in the same city shell that's a big one it is I think there's some inklings headed that way so we'll have to see what the universe has in store for us so if you make New Year's resolutions or if you don't send us your resolution or
