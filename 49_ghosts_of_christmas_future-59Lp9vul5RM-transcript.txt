listener turned guest on our podcast so that's pretty exciting love you Lisa an by the way hope you're having a hope you had a good holiday Lisa an miss you girl and you'll have to tell me what you think about my funny weed I'm smoking tonight Lisa an I'm so curious you have got me so [ __ ] curious I don't have good weed I have just my regular homegrown I'll give you a hint I'm smoking too good a weed today this is definitely great weed don't get me wrong mine is get my my words being all weird my eyelids are all closing it it's definitely good weed I'm feeling happy just boring my pipe's cool though I think the jury's out on the pipe I don't know it looks thin to me it looks fragile well it's not fragile it's just boring and clear and it's hard to clean to be honest yeah so Jerry's out I'll let you know by the end of this episode I'll let you know if I like smoking it or not and now we'll join a conversation already in progress with our special guest Darlene and her bestie kin we've already smoked enough cannabis to kill a rhino done a little tarot reading we're looking at a photograph taken during one of their rituals that may have evidence of ghostly activity Now do you see anything in that picture that's not physically there the things that we saw here was right around here shell had a really big right direct yeah directly above directly above that white box yep so right there and look right next to it to the left do you see the little girl's face you know I do actually now there was also a viking you mentioned a viking energy that was there as well yes and he's on he's above her husband's head I don't necessarily see a viking per se but I do see the outline of a body I definitely felt it was more protective in that moment yes the energy that I'm feeling what what I was getting over here definitely felt very protective to me um I'm not sure what's going on in the center of the picture I don't know what that is and I I'm not really sure what kind of vibe I'm getting from it less of an active presence and more more of a like we talk about the tape presences like a like a ghost that's there but not an active ghost you know kind of like like the like it's on record like it's on replay yeah yeah like like the energy was kind of burned I see a little girl that kind of passes through all the time in my house maybe that's the replay maybe that's where she's that's the video she's walking through and she just kind of does the same thing all the time or does she interact with things or do anything different at all honestly I've only ever seen her pass through she doesn't l so I think that you're right on the money with that one little girl since I'm sensitive she would have approached me by now right she would have said something if it was an active ghost she would have kind of tried to you know react with you in some way or my daughter would have seen her one one of oh your daughter's sensitive as well this run in your family your mother yeah my mom was a clairvoyant medium now have you had any contact with that other entity in the background above your husband's head so I don't want to be Cordy I um I'm definitely more on the Norse side of things so I don't I don't want to be corny but I definitely do practice more in like the norsey side of things sure so to me it read but like again I'm not trying to be that person you know no no no I get it the and the the way that sometimes the way that protective energies appear and that might be why we can't see it as clearly because maybe it is Norse and because you have that connection C you're able to see it a little more clearly I distinctly got a feeling of protection there and that there was a spirit there and I can see it in the shadow shell also kind of could see more of a figure than I could so maybe that's just something to do with your connection to it but I don't think any of the things going on um in that picture or anything to be concerned about in any way they're there but nothing I don't think there's any weirdness going on just kind of we're just protected watched over yeah I don't know you might I feel like you summoned I don't know if he's there all the time but I feel like you guys definitely summoned that Viking like he came because you called so we asked for protection yeah because we were doing kind of a big boy job if I'm gonna be honest took a month a month to finish so just constant it was it was a big one and it was one yeah have you ever had something happen and you're like because you see that stuff with with people all the time that are like I connected with blah blah blah and I'm hexed and all the time and Salem I see it every day yeah so like when it actually happens and you realize it after so many years you're like am I this person right and we've had that happen too I've been there we've been the ones that are like are we just making this up but and I don't want to soundy because yeah yes yes so I sensed it on her husband that he he had kind of a like a generational curse type situation and I felt that it started at War somewhere I mean I don't want to speak too much but there's been a lot of awful stuff all the time and and so she was crazy enough to believe me well it worked I can it definitely tell that there something came at your call to help so I hopefully you're seeing the results of that because it you know there's something there for sure very strong the girl I think is a is a recording but the oh the girl yeah the girl was a recording yes but what did you say I I forgot I'm sorry so high I forgot already oh that's okay no but the definitely I the Viking definitely came at your call so that energy is is definitely there I hope that it's working out so I'm curious you have to let us know how that goes and and that could also be um it could be your spirit guide something to think about don't play with my emot stranger things that would be so cool that's another one of those it couldn't possibly happen to me moments you know and here's sheld to confirm it for you and that's exactly when it's gonna happen is when you like oh this can't happen boom here it is thank you up that picture though like we sat outside we lost track of time we were so in tuned with all the spirit that surrounded us and were basically just giving us download after download and it was amazing like we had an otherworldly conversation it was our first time ever doing something together so we were it it was weird we were doing something and then it just flared and I swear there was nothing crazy in there I know what Florida water does okay like like but it just all of a sudden did the big fire and I was not prepared and I was and then it got hot and it was just and we just both instinctually started throwing stuff on it but those are the those are the times though where like deep crazy [ __ ] happened I love it I love it it was deep crazy I ended up turning that Ash into a protective barrier around my house smile very good good idea yeah very good idea thank you and gotta give it back to the Earth you know yes always a good idea we hope you have the most fabulous birthday ever

looking into the future of Witchcraft and Tarot and divination and stuff myself and I you know for some reason I kept going back to this one article the article is titled modern witches explain why Tech is the future of Witchcraft now interesting we can't say that we deny this at all because no we were just exactly I mean that's exactly kind of what we have both experienced is we went from online to inperson to now it seems to be back online again yeah yeah and the online part is coinciding with a surge in Witchcraft and divination popularity but it's different now and and I think I think it part of it is the progression of time but I also think part of it was sped up by that evil pandemic we've all experienced for the last I feel like absolutely couple years people were at home and they were looking for answers and looking for things that interested them and and found all these online communities and online readers and just the popularity exploded from there I mean nowadays like you can get raiki certified online now you can take tarot classes online now you can take witchcraft classes classes in wiah classes in Buddhism exactly you can be part of an online coven you can be part of all sorts of online groups actually that that kind of surprised me call me oldfashioned but I had come across like online coven like now I remember like we would like talk to each other online but like we were still like in person like there online cins that they've never met each other in person and they do everything online and I was kind of taken aback by that and I applaud those folks for for making that connection but it is it is markedly different than it was even five years ago even five years ago yeah very much so and obviously it's no secret that witchcraft is having a moment I mean it's it's it's our moment it feels like everybody I feel has even even I have and and we all know that I'm probably the least technical person here even I have gone to witch talk yes and and I think that there was an article written just last year uh it was in it's called the debrief and the article's titled online witchcraft is popular as hell and it isn't going away and as people are looking for more natural ways of being and more ways to connect with the Earth as climate change is happening you know people are starting to look to these things and and I very much feel that Witchcraft and science are cousins you know there's a lot to be said for the two working side by side and I think that you know people kind of are going that way as they start to go back to a more natural state of being or desire to be closer to the Earth they're definitely looking for a religion that matches that and paganism is it you know different flavors of paganism or and I just I got to insert this because I was able to find time through the holiday season to catch this on Netflix and I can't not mention it Wednesday have you seen it oh yes love that show that's a great show not necessarily Wednesday per se just because it's so new um I mean it's only been out for like what a month and a half a month I don't know not long but shows like that there's more shows that involve paranormal witchcraft things of that nature I mean Harry Potter for God's sakes doesn't everybody want to be a wizard and have a wand now it it's it's blown up in mainstream media um in movies and in books and in music it's being talked about it's kind of more in your face added to boredom you know everybody wants to start being like Sabrina the Teenage Witch you know true and there's the accessibility of it you know in witchcraft you don't in in different types of of wiah and paganism and Witchcraft you don't have to go through uh a priest or or some type of school or whatever you can and that will definitely help you but you can learn as much as you want to on your own you don't have to be authorized to do it you can just decide to do it and it's beautiful I guess it lends itself very easily to Tik Tok videos and Instagram accounts because you know it's so pretty you know spells they look great but all these all these pockets on Tik Tock and Reddit and Tumblr they've largely stayed out of the public Consciousness until recently you know what I mean there's always been that on there's always been that online presence ever since the beginning of the internet I mean we talked much so we talked about the witch's voice I don't even remember when yeah Pagan and witch chat rooms in AOL but now it's in your face everywhere and before you had to dig for it that's you don't have to dig you don't have to dig for it anymore and there were times you know there were different shows the um what's the one with the sisters the the three sisters that were hcus Pocus no no no no no TV show um Witches of Eastwick nope not that one Charmed so you know there's there's Charmed with the three sisters there's a good point right there there's so many I couldn't think of which one you were talking about right exactly and so there's a lot of them out there and they get popular they wax and Wayne you know and now it's it's W's day which isn't really exactly witchy but kind of it's it's on the edge of it you know and the biggest thing that I see in particular I know my kids are there I'm on there you just said you're there is Tik Tok Instagram and Tik Tok you see wi talk people everywhere they have huge followings and and that's the thing because you know it's interesting that our devices are actually like this is such a weird thought but think of this our devices are now a powerful source of energy not only are they electronic but they have our every thought our every feeling our every desire our every curiosity everything people feel insecure when we're away from our devices you you haven't seen funny until to see someone and I'm not saying it's funny because I've been there and been panicked but when someone misplaces their phone and like go into that fury it's hard not they lose their mind absolute Panic it's hard not to chuckle because you've kind of been there and you've been like oh my God I know that feeling right right and so you know online and and finding things online is definitely going to become more and more the future of Witchcraft and Tarot but it's also got a dark side a very dark side oh absolutely like every but that's that's the internet yeah that's true but that's the misinformation and and like shell said that's the internet there's misinformation everywhere and it seems that misinformation proliferates much much faster than truth so you have to kind of vet your sources and and pay attention just because something's popular doesn't mean it's true I I I came across something really weird and I know my my I know my son plays this game I don't know if you ever have so I have to get your perspective because we all know I'm not a gamer person there's some witches that not only do they share spells that can be cast using technology because they're actually there there's a movement called Tech witch so you got you know your kitchen witch your hedge witch your Forest witch your Tech witch that's been around since the at least since the 90s I never heard of that until now hey we've done magic online so I guess we were Tech witches before it was called a tech witch why do we always do things before it's named weird but no this this one person that that is a practicing Tech switch Tech witch named Maxine her handle is at spook the spoon she uses games such as Minecraft to set up virtual altars create art pieces based on their craft and cast spells and says it's a great way to have fun and can be cheaper and easier for those starting out can you explain this to me yes tell me is this like Sims kind of sort of Minecraft is a building game and it's open worlds much like Sims it just has different just a different look to it and a different purpose I guess in in Sims you build houses and communities in Minecraft you can build the whole world basically we used to do it in World of Warcraft you can have really yeah because your character is your avatar it is a representation of you digitally and so that representation can go to a location and hold ritual with other avatars of people in that same space and I would have ritual with other people all over the world in World of Warcraft not just role playing but also actual full moon and Sabbath rituals sh by the game no [ __ ] you can have representations of air fire water Earth and deity in the game and you can do the same thing in Minecraft build an altar or you know build an artwork that's part of a spell or part of a part of a ritual and you'll start to find this happening more and more often because it is so accessible to people no [ __ ] yeah and it's easier to find a community that way I even I even read that people are using emojis and re kind of basically like repurposing them as sigils they're using emojis in spells to get why not it is a Sigil it is a Sigil and if you imbue that emoji with a certain type of energy that's going to carry through whether it's online or not throughout the valued treasured time at home we'll call it that ah yes quarantine days how we do not miss you during the quarantine days I I spent those two years doing a online raike course and became a raike a certified raike Master oh you're one of those people who spent that time productively I did I did um so I actually took this with someone kind of like a they were group classes in in zoom and then did the attunements oneon-one Via zoom and I was I'm not going to lie I was a little hesitant at first I'm like I don't know how this is going to work out because we're on the computer and we're not in the same place right but actually no you do feel that connection and you do you do feel that that energy exchange and I was taken back by the fact that you actually can make that connection over the Internet so that was a first for me so yeah I got my my first second and and Master raiki Plus attunements all in all online all in cyberspace yeah that's pretty fantastic I I guess I was first introduced to this concept as a kid when I read about have you ever heard of Edgar Casey the Sleeping Prophet yeah he used to diagnose people he did a lot of medical things and he would kind of go what he called the akashic he would go to person's records the akashic records and he would very often visit people while they were sleeping and so he would he would go to sleep and go into a dream state and then he would project his energy into their dreams and talk to people and give them all sorts of answers and insight into things that were going on but he did that from a distance you know there weren't computers back then I don't don't remember at all what year he was alive but there I know there weren't computers then no phones no nothing like that but it was the same if your energy can travel through a dream state or or through an astral projection State then of course it can travel just like electricity through an internet or through a virtual space it's just interesting that and you know I'm always the last person to jump on these latest fat like connecting with people online but yeah no actually I I was surprised and it almost made me wish that I had dabbled with doing stuff like that previously because it is a conduit I don't know I guess I never thought of it that way I can't tell you how much I kick myself that I didn't start a twitch stream or a YouTube channel or a Tik Tock right a lot of time I see a lot of disinformation but every once in a while I'll stumble across somebody that's [ __ ] amazing I have to say I was going through Tik Tok the other day and you see a lot of fluff and so I saw somebody was something about a hex and I initially kind of just like swiped past it and then I went back because I liked the Audio I so I wanted to hear the audio so I was willing to like watch what I thought was going to be like a dumb kind of fluff look at me how pretty I am and what pretty tools I have kind of Tik Tok and instead it [ __ ] L me so this this young witch was there and you know she swiped over to doing a spell jar shell oh oh my favorite your favorite and holy [ __ ] if I couldn't feel the magic coming right off that jar whoever she hacks not good you know as she's adding herbs to this jar I could literally feel the intention and the energy and the magic come up from that Tik Tock and I was kind of happy I stayed even though it was originally for the audio but it's out there you know there there's real magic out there you know there is there is and and you know there's there's somebody that that I follow that I actually originally found on Facebook and then bounc to Instagram and then bounc to Tik Tok she's real good psychic medium does tarot what are those things I can't even think of it the the the metal rods rods love dowsing rods um she does dowsing rods tarot uh just General psychic readings there there are good people out there there are scams out there though there are good people out there some of the ones that were recommended to me was chaotic witch ant um Mara Caitlyn on Tik Tock um Rising High Priestess I'm a big follower um my absolute top-notch favorite is uh KO the medium absolutely 110% awesome yeah we will link some upand coming people on different social media in the show notes so if you're interested in checking anybody out you know we'll have some some links on there for you and actually just as a side note aside from all of the tarot and divination stuff I actually KO the medium is who I got my raike levels and master certification through oh nice nice and she's super fun she's super fun like super fun nice nice girl does she offer classes on that regularly she does she does you can get them on her website um kthe medium.com but she's on she's on every platform she's on Facebook she's on Instagram she's on Tik Tok she's everywhere and she is super awesome and that girl is spot on accurate like spot on accurate she uh does these every once in a while every week I believe it is she'll do like an hour free on Facebook live or on Instagram live or on Tik Tok and she'll just random pull and do some free readings for people and every single person is always commenting you are so spot on you know how'd you know that like this girl's good nice I've been following her now I've been following her since the beginning of the pandemic and I'm hucked I think part of it is it's not just you know being shut in and being quarantined and and things of that there's there's definitely a spiritual shift and that started long before the pandemic and long before you know people having more time on their hands inside with their devices I just think there's been a shift to to Witchcraft and wiah and paganism as a whole I don't know for I think it's actually been ramping up for 20 years um I just think it's kind of really caught fire in the last maybe five years people are abandoning traditional religion like wildfire right now everybody's kind of flocking to a more spiritual self I definitely think I have seen an uptick like you said maybe in the last five years particularly in 2019 prior to the pandemic things seemed to really be ramping up at that point and then after everyone was kind of stuck at home with the lockdown a lot of people started looking it added gas to the fire basically but the fire the fire had already started and I think there's a lot of dissatisfaction with like you said some of the more common relation yeah there's a lot of dissatisfaction there and people want better answers and honestly in the year 2022 slash on the cusp of year 2023 what is a witch's best friend Google man it is a huge source of information I love having it right at my fingertips we used to have a huge website Circle lat.com I missed that I do too I think I've got all the files somewhere but so many spells and rituals and information on the the sabbaths and espit and anything you could want was right there and I love that that is it's everywhere now you know you can be like oh what herb should I use for this particular intention let me Google that and then poof there's your answer you know you're not sending out you know messenger pigeons to get this information you're Googling it so Google has become a witch's best friend um know the infinite YouTube videos and Tik toks and Instagrams and Reddit feeds um the Google classrooms Discord servers there is more than you can absorb of every type of flavor every type of flavor that unfortunately everything it's all out there online but what about that iners Vibe man I've been trying to connect with local pagans and I've looked on Meetup I've looked on Facebook uh can't stand Facebook but I went there anyways because that's where a lot of people wait are you talking about I was going to say are you talking about in person or online in person I want to go to local in person I miss our local community and I miss being with other pagans and it seems like everything here is really far away I could drive hours and hours and hours away and connect with people and that's just not feasible for everyday life I'm lazy I'm not going to do it I don't understand that though because if you go online and you're like where are my witches at they're from like every city in every state all across the land but the minute you want to meet people in person they're ain't a witch for 300 miles well get this I found some people on Facebook people real people real live people and I thought this would be a great opportunity it was a meetup group for the local pagans and I had a little bit of a wait to get invited in and then me and a bunch of other people oh got invited and and there was a whole bunch of yay welcome how you doing and questions about what do you mean you had to get what's the invite process this is where I get a little Leary I guess it was a closed Facebook group which you know they just want to vet and make sure you're not a robot or yeah yeah some spy or I didn't have to like pass any checkpoints or anything it was pretty much I wanted to join and you just had to literally exist for real okay good enough good enough okay yeah so you know I get my invitation a bunch of us did at the same time time and there was a flurry of activity hey how you doing anything going on for you coming up any full moons and then it went dead then it went dead crickets and then a little bit later more people got invited same process so I start asking around and I even made a post hey I happen to have a large public business that has a Meetup space that's free since there doesn't seem to be any local meetups let's get together and talk you know free coffee cookies of course you the one to like try to spearhead some freaking group that's so [ __ ] if I want something to happen I'm going to have to make it happen right so what happened they never allowed the post they allowed me to continue to respond to other people's posts about hey is there any Ule going on no I haven't heard anything have you heard anything but they would not allow me to make a post they would not approve a post about any type of meetup on a Meetup page on a Meetup page because they do the meetups and apparently they're not feeling well so I said hey what about I'll host an in-person Meetup with a zoom option so that more people can attend they didn't allow it so now I'm trying to find other groups I'm using Reddit I'm going through a local Pagan store that also has no information on local full moons or anything like that going on and so I'm going to start my own group and see if I can get something going but I'm going to have to kind of skirt around the existing group that isn't helping anyone what why is this so hard why you know sh you know why I do know why but like I don't like don't say that it doesn't we're dancing around the white elephant don't say that there's not a problem and then create a problem exactly and the problem here is control people are afraid to give up control if they have control of a local Pagan group when we were upand cominging pagans in our group there was a lot of fear by the old guard that these kids are coming in and they're shaking things up and they're doing things differently and there was fear until they saw that everything was just fine and it took them what 10 15 years but they settled down I'm just hoping that this particular local group settles down a little bit faster I just want to help people meet each other I don't give a [ __ ] about leading a group been there done that don't need to do it again but I'm happy to facilitate a meet up you know that makes me wonder if that's why I've had such a hard time connecting with any group in goddamn Salem Massachusetts I am in the witch capital of the world and find somebody good luck have fun you want to go shopping you can go shopping all day long in this joint for anything you want try to get involved in a group good freaking luck okay like I'm going on almost year three being here and nothing not zero can't infiltrate anything and it's not even like I'm some like baby witch like like I've been doing this like 30 years and I can't infiltrate a group in this damn Town it is nut so cuckoo I don't get it it seems like the established groups are not interested in helping anyone at all either join their group or facilitating meetups and spin-off groups not interested but like like I don't get it I don't get it I don't either I don't either and alternately you have newbie groups that start up and fizzle out very quickly because of lack of leadership or lack of support from the the other groups in the area and I I don't understand especially because our topic of this particular episode is Ghost of Christmas future and we were planning on talking about tarot cards and divination and how Witchcraft and is just exploding across everywhere except in person it seems that's so funny because I'm I'm going to talk about this article I read and the title of the article is actually about how the future of Witchcraft is via Tech okay well then that is right on [ __ ] point shell so I also have a couple articles that I wanted to talk to you about that are very current one is something very near and dear to your heart it's about the British Monarchy really o yes oh I'm already intrigued I'm leaning in right so again I know we're leaving the USA which we've done a little bit this year but there is a Tarot reader she goes by the name of the Northumberland witch and she says that amidst this Harry and Megan drama which I know I'm team Harry and Megan and you are not I am so not but she says that that in the midst of all this drama with Harry and Megan that the royal family is actually going to come out better than they have in the past this is actually going to open things up for them and despite all the shell revelations in the Netflix drama that Harry and Megan have just recently put out the Royal uh racism much by the royal family but they said the Northumberland witch says their fortunes have changed the queen passed this year we have a new king we have the first Christmas without her majesty I'm sorry sh can I just say that I have the most beautiful I obtain the most beautiful Queen Elizabeth II Christmas ornament and it's right in the middle of my tree and I love it that's so man she's on my tree now she says that how the papers have perceived them how the British public has perceived this slight it's actually going to work out better for the monarchy in the long run so she says The Wheel of Fortune in their reading says that despite how things are now the wheel's going to change and the British Monarchy is actually going to come out in a better light all I got to say is 110% team Kate and wills man you ever see a reading by someone else shell and kind of get your own impressions of that reading I have I have because sometimes you'll see especially online people will post like the actual spread right and then give their give their interpretation their reading and I look at the spread and I'm thinking huh that's what you get because I get something different that we'll talk about that a little bit because with this proliferation of readers and witches everywhere as you know comes a [ __ ] ton of information so we'll get into that in a minute also those readers that love to blow smoke just to make their clients happy H can't stand that and the ones that are hired by The Inquirer that are they really readers or did they just own tarot cards well before we get too far off topic I looked at her reading just from her words I kind of immediately got a feeling you know maybe because of your conne I'm not big on the royal family but I do love you and I know you're big on the Royal Family and so maybe that's why I kind of got this Vibe but as I was looking at her reading the biggest feeling that I get is something shocking is going to happen in the beginning of 2023 probably the first three or four months and and I do think that the Royal Family Image is going to get overhauled and things are going to get better but not because it's against Megan and Harry I think they're actually going to help will and Kate maybe not necessarily King Charles but I do feel that the siblings are going to something big is going to happen and they're going he the rift I think so and they're going they're going to change the face of the monarchy for the better together because really no matter what side you're on Harry's side or William's side we all just want these poor boys to just they're Brothers stop fighting exactly they're brothers who lost their mother you know and their dad's they lost their mother he's a well chap right and the whole monarchy you have to admit the monarchy has its own issues but anyway so the north umberland Witch is in the news because of tarot you know why we're in the news does it have to be weird stuff but we spoke last week about the four college students in Moscow Idaho who have were brutally murdered and correct the investigation is still ongoing your Debbie Downer episode that's right the Debbie Downer episode now there are a lot of people covering this both just from from a factual angle how we tried to approach it and also from a more fantastic angle a more like trying to get how do you say like trying to get attention a more um attention seeking yeah there you go more attention seeking way uh in particular a woman named Ashley Gard she is a Tik Tock tarot reader and she is quite popular she has over a 100,000 followers because the future of Witchcraft is online it's on Tik Tok in on YouTube and it on Twitch absolutely and podcasts and podcasts I hope so and she has millions of views on her Tik Tok videos we definitely need to get in there shell but unfortunately rather than just talk about these unsolved murders and maybe give a little bit of insight or possible speculation which not the greatest thing but a little speculation is not going to hurt anything but she has promoted herself as an internet sleuth and uses tarot cards to try solve murders oh yeah see I don't get involved in that no way no how no no not interested inserting yourself into such a high-profile case and in this particular case she has accused a professor at the school this professor was 5 hours away in another state and has an airtight Alibi however despite being told to cease and assist Ashley Gard posted over 20 Tik Tock videos accusing this woman oh wow isn't that like against the law at some point yes exactly it comes up against defamation and she is now being sued Ashley is now being sued for defamation by this Idaho Professor wow and they're looking for a trial by jury wow yeah the professor's filing a federal lawsuit and alleges defamation over the accusation that this professor was involved in the unsolved killing of these four students wow yeah just from a tarot reading just from a tarot reading and her own internet sleuthing abilities yeah but you can't believe everything you read on the internet though exactly exactly and that so that's tarot in the news right now and both of them are bad as I mentioned I have a bubble pipe today beautiful it's cute it's cute it's kind of ugly um actually we have it because my husband broke the bong no yes no at least it wasn't me this time that's just what I was thinking it wasn't me so he broke it and rather than spend to replace it he got this kind of cheap bubbler pipe which I'm not 100% sure if I like so rather than talk about the weed I'm smoking today shell I'm going because it's just my homegrown I'm going to talk about my pipe I had a I had a tragedy oh no what happened speak weed it's me being me like everything worked out in the end but it's just me being me so I'm really high and I had to grind up some weed so I I I get everything ready and I get it in there and at one point you know how it has the bottom part that collects the KE yeah well at one point I was scooping out little pieces of ke so I had that part open oh no so as you can imagine the whole thing is disassembled but the KE part is like jam-packed full okay nice nice I love a good full ke container I need to grind more and it's all just sitting there and who pays attention obviously not me so I put the grinder back together really quick and I gr quick shell how quickly did you put it back together shell too quick ah [ __ ] so I grind up like and I grind up a bunch like two big huge buds because I'm like oh I'll grind up enough for quite a while so I grind up a bunch I go to open it to pack my pipe and I'm like why isn't this opening right this is weird and I'm looking and I'm looking and I'm like why is there a piece to the grinder still on my tray oh no I ground all of the weed into the Keef That's G to be that's going to be nice though that that'll be like a couple potent bowls or a few really nice joints oh [ __ ] yeah roll some joints with that [ __ ] that'll be so good so I have like I don't know a little less than an eighth ground up with probably three grams of key there's nothing I could do at that point other than just dump it all in the bag together [ __ ] yeah so it's endgame mixed with God knows what and I'm not complaining hey when life gives you ground end game with God knows what ke you make joints and then you're happy that's right and a good time is had by all so I didn't dump it on the carpet like your tragic Keef story oh thank goodness I didn't intend to grind almost an eighth of weed into the Keef but here we are well that's sounding to me like the problem where the person with the chocolate bar runs into the person holding the peanut butter jar yeah you know that's not really a problem if you need to function it is that's right that's right but I don't know nothing matters right now because I have that endgame mixed with like probably two and a half months worth of Keith I can see your eyes are awfully glassy and your eyelids are coming down you're definitely looking kind of high I did go online and ask people what they thought the future of tarot looked like are they seeing a Resurgence of it are they seeing a new popularity and where do they see that going and most people think that it's cyclical I think most people think that this is kind of a fad it's kind of just like a rising thing and that it'll go away you think I I don't I don't think it's GNA go away I think that Witchcraft and paganism and Tarot and astrology are going to become a little bit more acceptable and a little bit more part of everyone's everyday life I was going to say respected but acceptable works yeah I like respected for sure one person said quote hype Cur curve they called it a hype curve because it's just something new and pretty and flashy and they think that it's it's going to kind of go it's not new but it's not new you're exactly right it is not new it is this is old really really old tarot has been around for an extremely long time some of the earliest references are what in the mid 1400s back in Italy at least yeah I think that's when the first official official decks were created with the 78 cards I don't know we did a on it I feel like it was a little bit before that in China oh right right right right well they did they have cars or was it the the automatic writing might have been the automatic writing but the traditional 78 deck was like around 14 Century Italy yeah and and it was you know artists use it there's theories that the the modern playing cards are derived from that or vice versa um but they've been around for quite a while and people um more than five years more than five years and I think you know whether this is hype or not they're not going anywhere because it's a great tool whether you use it for yourself just personally use the book and kind of go through and and do your own self-guided inner working you know with it kind of do some inner work for yourself okay now since you wanted to talk about the tarot we are going to real quickly divert back to some of our Christmas gifts our Ule gifts that we received real quick before we talk about tarot for those listeners who have been with us from the beginning do you remember Snack Factory pretzel crisps I have added pretzel crisps to my snack rotation because of you so oh and they still haven't sponsored us thanks a lot Snack Factory yeah seriously nothing but I took a break from pretzel Chris for a while I came across these garlic parmesan the other day oh my God okay if you you sound like a bad breath in a bag deliciousness oh my yeah but it is bad breath in a bag but Snack Factory pretzel crisps garlic parmesan I'm a fan okay tarot sound delicious so back to the tarot yeah we were saying that we had gotten a solstice or Christmas gift we've each gotten some tarot decks I laughed because I was I was like oh I got two decks and you're like I got two decks what did you get what' you get what you get oh from my lovely daughter I got the Santa muerto tarot now that looks a little that looks a little it reminds me of like New Orleans am I right am I kind of right it's a little more Mexican a little more Dia de los Muertos uh Santa muera the sacred dead oo the artwork is stunningly gorgeous one thing I absolutely love is the the minor Arcana I don't know if you can see on the skulls can you see their eyes oh they Hearts exactly every their nose is a heart but upside down yep every single suit the eyes of the skeletons match like the like the suit so if they're Hearts they're cups that's right and if they that's a spade like if they're they're Spades so I thought that was kind of a neat little touch but very beautiful beautiful cards okay so I'm going to show you a deck and then and then we're going to go back and forth we do a back and forth go for it show me what you got so my daughter daughters are great this year aren't they wonderful this one is called it's called theme park oh cute oh look it's got cute little animals on it like a cute little bear and a cute little bunny no I don't know if you use line is a is a chatting platform on your phone the line app um we chat online with our friend from England um so these the animals on this theme park deck remind me of the line bear in the line bunny um they're basically like specific we'll call them emojis for lack of a better word they're like specific emojis to that chat platform but they're cute look at them they're very cute that's there elephants and giraffes there lemur I mean it's almost like a like a kid circus kind of deck it kind of does but like I said whoops I'm trying to get a good ankle for you it's called theme park um and they're smaller cards this is not like your traditional it's not like a mini deck but it's not like a full siiz tarot card you know what I'm saying they're little like Palm decks I don't know what to say they're cute that is cute that's a very very cute deck like The Wheel of Fortune look at it's like a ferris wheel and they're holding hands a super cute that can turn a difficult card into a very cute little thing uh this this is a deck that is definitely something for I don't want to call it a fluffy deck but it's it's a fluffy deck it's cute I would I would buy this deck for maybe a a a person a teenager a girly girl it's a very cute deck I love deck and so that was one of my decks I I received as a gift so what was your second well I first I just want to say that I do feel that decks definitely have personalities not all of oh absolutely some of them are just decks but quite a few of them will have a very distinct voice a very distinct personality I've even had one particular deck that would lie to me I don't think this deck liked me if I ever did a reading for myself it always told me I was going to die nice that's awesome yeah and it was a beautiful deck it was kind of a it was made by an artist who had done collages of things and then taken pictures of these beautiful um found object collages and those were the tarot cards and I was never able to connect with this deck it would literally do readings for people that was outright lies it was never right and it always told me I was going to die and one time when we were doing a Tarot presentation at a college we had gone to a large University and we're doing a Tarot presentation afterwards we all kind of went around and um did readings for people and I remember that this young person came up to me and I was giving them a reading those cards just jumped out and I did a reading for this person and it was perfect it was spoton it was glowing it was I think I know what deck you're talking about because I remember that so this deck loved this young person so I gave it to them but I feel like this this is I don't want to say like a fluffy bunny deck but kind of like a fluffy bunny deck like a very cutesy and whimsically yep I believe it they have personalties sometimes the decks themselves will absolutely have personalities sometimes it goes along with how they look like yours it looks cutesy and pretty and nice and it but it feels cutesy and nice mine looked beautiful and had a very Sinister Vibe at least for me for this other person it seemed to love them and so I hope that they're still very happy so what's your second deck the second deck my lovely beloved got for me and this is the I've showed you this already this one is uh called The Dark Mansion tarot love love love love love love I just absolutely love everything about this deck I love the box I love everything on the inside of the the little inscription oh how gorgeous artwork is just stunning and and it it's just it's different and it's beautiful it's called it's a by tarota Studios and it's called The Dark Mansion tarot just gorgeous just kind of you know different artwork this is something a little more um Whimsical than I normally choose but how fun is that it's it's like it is it's fun in a darker way in a dark I guess I kind of gravitate towards those but just I love the artwork it's it's stunning and I I I love a detailed tarot card I like the ones that are rich in details because the way I read there's the meaning of the card but it's layered with what's on the card the symbolism itself that's in the card and you and you know from doing tarot readings yourself sometimes when you're doing a reading a certain symbol or color or object or picture on a tarot card will catch your eye and it's that symbolism you need to follow rather than the precise meaning of the card you need to go into more of a Nuance of it uh so the more richly detailed the cards are the better I feel I can get into a space where I can read for someone right right that's I think that's what started my tarot collecting Obsession because I think the two decks I got this holiday season are putting me at about the 150 range oh yeah what's the second one I think sometimes it's it's about the vibe you get and again you know going to get cards as as gifts and people are going to give you give them to you that that's one thing I do want to point out you can buy your own Tarot deck there are people out there that feel that you have to be gifted a Tarot deck to that I call [ __ ] okay [ __ ] go and buy yourself a damn deck make the plunge buy a deck buy a brand new deck buy a deck with cartoon characters buy a deck with traditional riter weight symbolism buy a deck whatever whatever feel whatever works for you use the book that comes with it use an online guide whatever works for you as long as you're not trying to tell someone that you're a professional when you're not when you haven't put in the work and put in the study go for it do readings for yourself do readings for your friends and you're going to find some amazing truths and insights just using these cards for yourself so go for it but you know we talk about the explosion of Witchcraft and wiah and paganism and spiritualism there's also that equal explosion with tarot which is how I'm going to I'm I'm segueing into my second deck I'm getting there okay I can't wait to see it I'm just so excited I am an Amazon Shopper I think that's that's why I ended up getting Amazon Prime I think like 10 or more years ago was because I started buying tarot decks online you know when you're in rural Upstate New York you know your tarot shop options are limited and when you become an obessive collector you have to Branch out to Amazon so I've been searching I've bought I've bought so many decks online and sometimes you get to the point where you start seeing the same things over and over so I started looking at a little site that I'm sure everybody's familiar with called Etsy love Etsy what's been happening the surge in tarot reading and Tarot interest and divination interest what's been happening is people aren't just happy with what they're finding being put out there by lellan or Us game systems or wherever so they're starting to make their own and you're finding more unique less commercial decks you know maybe a hundred were made or maybe they only are making them as they're ordered Kickstarter is another one I'm working on one myself actually which by the way Lea is going to make sure that it is available for all of us once it's done you know there's a lot of people on Etsy creating their own decks there's you know truly even on Amazon people creating their own decks so now where you might have only been able to find Maybe 20 30 40 different deck variations in the past all of a sudden you're starting to find literally hundreds and thousands of different ones um that are very unique some are very limited quality and I believe that this one is one such deck so the second deck I was gifted oh that's different isn't that pretty it's called pot leaves yes it is it is called the 420 tarot and there we go nice the 420 Tarot this was created by Juliana W Rose the back of the box I love this light up pull a card and answer all of your burning questions nice very cool looking so far Juliana Rose it says 420 tarot comine combines the magic of cannabis with the wisdom of traditional tarot in easy to use deck for the curious and creative Stoner or anyone wanting to unlock their power of their intuition I love it so far good now I'm gonna open the box for you so I'm laughing like you know how boxes are they always got these things so on the inside it says have fun and don't get cursed you don't put that on a Tarot deck for the love of God oh my god well nobody wants to get cursed right so then on the other side it says a warning the magic this deck can unlock is very powerful and therefore protected by a very scary and real curse this curse is activated by unchecked biases and complacency with white supremacy if you are white or benefit from White Privilege and are not actively working for the joy and liberation of black and brown people on a daily basis put these cards away it will not go well for you that's heavy it is pretty heavy this whole this whole company talks about giving back to black women fem according to their website they do a lot of work to kind of promote equality social justice particularly in the Cannabis field and as we know it has been Rife with racism and discrimination and problems right from the [ __ ] name marijuana it still is to this very second what you talking about exactly to this very [ __ ] day it's been overtaken and you know during prohibition the punishments came came down pretty heavily on black and brown people more so than white people and and it just is continuing today so I'm not surprised and I kind of a little happy that they're at least trying to bring an awareness to that you know it might make people uncomfortable but at least they're trying to make people think I like what they're doing I don't like the word curse I love I love the I love what they're doing different verbage I do see one review where it kind of of scared off a a Tarot newbie who was gifted these cards they had no idea the curse was there and it really really scared them yeah but look at these cards like I'm laughing because everybody has like bloodshot eyes they're smoking joints I love these even even the heroin he's hiding the hermit's hiding in the dark with his joint lighting up a joint I love that these are great then they give you some different spread which you know same as a book they kind of give you some pointers there's a section if you've never done this before which they they actually talk about smoking while doing tarot cards under the if you've never done this before section I love it nice I looked up the 420 tarot website and I'm I'm looking at the the part about Juliana Rose she's the illustrator who created it and she says I'm an illustrator who loves tarot and weed and I have magic in my mixed race Korean and white blood I am the creator of 420 tarot and she says that it was sparked from a conversation with some friends who own smoke shops and that she spent a couple months getting high and listening to the Moana soundtrack while illustrating each card and I just think that's a lot of fun and she says the process infused the deck with joy and Magic the experience was an easy and generous flow check this out this is a cute thing there's a section called your 420 tarot fairy gnome every 420 Tarot deck comes with a magical fairy gnome it is a spirit guide here to ensure you pull cards that are clear that are clear answers to your questions your 420 fa fairy gnome will meet you where you are that means there is no wrong way to shuffle the cards you are building a relationship with your 420 fairy gnome when you pull the cards be good to them they prefer when they're home the deck in the bo box is clean and tidy and they love smoking weed with you the 420 fairy gnomes are unique and diverse just like you and me they are speedy and too small to see with a naked eye you can get to know your fairy gnome with your 420 fairy gnome spread found in the sky I love like that's cute I like that and then there's a little picture of the the 420 fairy gome right there oh how cute cute that actually kind of goes along with something I'm doing for my Tarot deck which as you know I'm using AI to help along with some other online art studios to create my own Tarot deck one of the things I want to do is it's going to be a limited run deck of 420 decks and each deck is going to come with its own guide there will be an AI chaos generated deck fairy to go with each deck will have a guide and they will all be unique so every single deck will have its own unique card that has a picture of a creature a fairy a deck guide of some sort that will be unique to each different deck oh that's so cool right one of the things I wanted to do I very often do a yearly spread for myself in January do you do anything like that shell I do I usually do it on New Year's Day though yep I usually do it either New Year's Eve or New Year's Day and I'll do a a year-long spread for myself to kind of see you know give me kind of an idea of what the year is going going to be like and and sometimes Al to put a little intention in there on on what I want the year to look like and so with that in mind I thought I would take one of my brand new decks and Shuffle it up and do a three card draw just for the month of January and since you know I can't do a reading for everyone it would be just way too freaking General I'm sorry my beloved audience but there's too many of you but so so instead of doing a general reading for all of you I'm going to do a three card Tarot spread for all my fellow aquarians and uh so we'll put I'll do that I'm going to start shuffling the cards and I'll uh do a little three card spread and see what our January is going to be like my fellow air signs so what kind of spread do you do for the for the new year shell do you have any particular spread that you do do you do like a wheel of the year no I just do the full-on my normal Celtic cross I think do the Celtic cross and just the intention of it being for the year the Year come I just use that spread for everything I don't really vary away from it not gonna lie I love that spread it's very useful it's very it's very flexible I'm a creature of habit you know I have a um I do have a year spread that I like to do that I will put um I'll see if I can get some type of drawing of it and I'll put that in the in the show notes if anyone else wants to do a tarot reading for themselves for their year to come all right Chef so I've got my cards all shuffled up here I'm going to cut them and then I will draw three cards to be for all aquarians who are listening right now from myself included since my birthday month is coming up here shortly it is I'm still excited for your Tarot deck right I'm hoping to have it out by the middle of the year no Kickstarter necessary but we'll see how it goes it's a lot of work okay I'm going to show you the three cards that I pulled and I just do a little three card for my monthly reading I just do a small three card little crescent and the first card is usually the influences from the past that will affect the month and for that I got the five of Wands nice card I like that card and then for the second card that's going to be the major theme that carries through the month and for that I got the nine of Pentacles oh that's a cute card too and then for the card that's kind of going to lead me out of the month and be kind of the conclusion of all of this I have the hermit oo interesting way to lead into February right very interesting so we've got these three cards my Aquarius tarot spread here but so we've got three cards and we said that the first card forces leading into the month themes that we've had in our life that are kind of continuing to be an issue in this month unfortunately for our January we're going to start out with a little bit of conflict it's not going to be the easiest beginning to the month it looks like there are stresses and conflicts from recent months possibly or recent events that are going to kind of continue to cause issues in January but then it goes into the nine of Pentacles which is a very fulfilling card I can't see Pentacles and you shell without thinking of the T of Pentacles in your one deck was the that was the the weed card what was the herbalism deck yep it was the herbal tarot and the weed card it was a rainbow with weed all over it and it said happily ever after yep that was the one and that so nine of Pentacles is very very good to have here it definitely means there's going to be more fulfillment there's going to be happiness so after initial conflict we're going to move into more of a with the nine of Pentacles also if there's been some extreme Financial stress that some of that will be laying off oh I love that don't we all want that especially in freaking January right the last card that we have for our Aquarius three card spread is the hermit and I think that's kind of an interesting card the first two makes sense you know you kind of have conflict and stress most likely over money look at the time of year you're going to be sliding into February the coldest part of the Year here in the northern hemisphere we are hunkering down we're hunkering down we're hermiting for February that's what we do and I think that kind of goes along with so money stress kind of easing and money coming to you and lightening that burden a little bit more Bountiful a little bit more relaxed a little more relaxed much stressful what I'm getting from it is stresses are eased financially that's right and the hermit is also kind of saying to continue with this financial easing stay home is the season to be a Hermit that's right is the season to stay home smoke your own weed and kind of slow down on the spending and and work on yourself work on your inner self a little bit so I think that's our three cards for Aquarius you know easing of stress and a little bit of money coming and a lot of going within and as aquarians we do a lot of that anyway so totally fitting to my son you're an aquarius listen to Leila yes aquarians unite we got this so yeah it's going to be a good good month for aquarians start out a little rocky but it's going to get a lot better so yay us go aquarians and so you know speaking of your beautiful monthly spread that brought us to a beautiful idea we're actually going to do this every month so our last episode of each month we're going to do a three card spread for the coming month so next month at the end of January I will actually offer up to do the three card spread for all of you folk because it'll be lela's birthday and so we'll we'll add a little birthday Vibe into there as long as Leila reminds my stoned brain to do this at the end of January we'll do another three card spread for going into February so so yeah wait for it it'll be fun but it's just you know it's a lot of fun to use technology for something as old school is tarot you can even use technology to kind of play around with that and to to personalize it and and make it make it something all your own you know there's there's been talk and I've seen on different forums of people saying you know well if you use AI it's not legitimate those aren't real tarot cards you know everybody who listens knows that I am changed is not my friend and even I'm getting into the AI tarot because what is the difference if you're sitting there with colored pencils and a piece of paper or if you're sitting there typing stuff in to an AI program that is still your personal creativity it is still your atttention like we just were talking about the lovers card we were talking about the the the qualities we think make up the lovers card so it's it's your intention as an artist and whatever platform you are using to get your art out there it shouldn't matter arts art whether you're using colored pencils paint and brush or AI programs it's all the intention into it and I love it and is a Terri addict and collector it just gives me more cool tarot decks to add to my collection I don't see myself as an artist using this AI I don't see myself as the artist I see more myself as questioning chaos I see AI as kind of a type of magic it's a type of Randomness it's it's I cannot tell the AI exactly what I want it to do we gave it some suggestions for that lovers card shell and as you saw it did not take them literally it came up with its own ideas and when we said couple quite a few of them were were male female couples but there was a couple female female couples in there as well and the AI will just randomly choose what it wants to do and so when I'm making my tarot cards I I craft prompts with with magical intention with the idea of seeing what chaos comes up with I'm not creating it I'm just kind of doing a spell to it's not your interpretation of that particular thought it's ai's interpretation of your particular thought or what I call it as chaos it's Chaos's interpretation so I am pulling order from chaos I'm I'm doing a spell every time I create a tarot card and then I hone it and refine it uh using traditional art tools so I don't I don't think this is ever going to replace artists it's different it's kind of like back in the day when they thought cameras would replace uh paint and pencil artists and it it didn't it's just different but as a 30-year tarot reader and Tarot collector I would just as quickly buy a deck that was AI created as I would one that was artist created with painting or pen or what have you it's the intention behind it and and absolutely and it's what you're looking to get out of it and different like you said different decks are going to resonate in different ways and with different people and for me I love reading for people professionally I have had a wonderful time and a great career doing that for people and you've done it we we have we love reading for other people and I for I'm stoned I forget where the [ __ ] I was going with this but um but reading for yourself is also a fabulous thing to do with tarot cards and so wherever you can get those cards whatever works for you to unlock your subconscious and to kind of help you get in touch with that doesn't really matter who who created it or what created it absolutely so I mean I just I just wanted to put it out there because I know there's been a lot of questions lately but I think there's just as much value in these AI artwork decks as there are in traditional artwork decks there's beautiful artwork out there and I highly encourage people to seek out like this tarota deck and your 420 deck those were created by artists and they're not a big commercial run right those are the ones that I I Vibe with the most those are the ones that I find have the most value to me the ones that were created more personally I think or crafted more carefully and and um there's less mass produced exactly there's there's always going to be a high demand for that because of the quality from artist whatever type of artist they happen to be right right keep them coming people because I love Tarot and I want more right me too me too so I'm I'm really loving this Resurgence of astrology and Tarot and witch everywhere you into a Tarot collector because I feel I feel like you're you're getting more and more decks on hand you know it seems like in my life I started out with the one deck my grandmother gave me and I read with that for years and years and years and years before I ever got my second deck and then I had like a second deck and I used that for quite a few years and then I got the L tarot and I used that for a very very long time every once in a while I would pick up a deck but I would almost never replace the the main deck that I had so I have a dozen or so not very many at all but I would tend to get attached to a deck and I use it for a very long time and I think once we moved out to California and I kind of left my tarot reading practice behind I I stopped for a little while and it wasn't until right before you and I reconnected and started doing this podcast that I started doing readings for myself and for friends again and really getting back into it and I was feeling that I had outgrown the Laro I was ready for something new and so I'm still searching I haven't found the replacement Tarot deck yet but I think that's why I'm starting to purchase and be given more decks because I'm actively seeking what my next partner deck I guess will be for a little while and that's so funny because I kind of disconnected from tarot for a while and you know I used that witches tarot for forever in a day um I used that deck so much wore out the prince on it and had to buy a new one so but like I had taken a Tarot break everybody needs a Tarot break after a while you do you do you do and I'm actually I I I when I circled back to it you're gonna laugh at me but for the first time in my life and I used to loath this stick I'm like oh that's so cliche I'm never GNA touch that thing WR or wait man WR or wait this is not the first time you have mentioned that is that crazy it it it's not it's not because prior to starting i50 decks and I go back to WR or weight and I've never used it before never ever ever it's reconnecting it's reconnecting to Roots It's Going Back to Basics and and I think that's kind of something that people are feeling everywhere we all want something more something that has real meaning something that that brings us together that's inclusive instead of divisive we want we want that connectedness we want to be connected to the Earth and to each other and and I think going back to rer weight is kind of a symbol of that you know back to Simplicity back to the beginning back to Our Roots it's just ironic it is it is for someone with 150 decks of every color flavor style interpretation that you could possibly have to go back to the traditional rter weight especially when you factor in that I've never really used it ever no no and oddly that's not one that you started with and it's not one that I really could my my original deck was a was a rer weight um knockoff I guess cousin derivative very very similar and that's what I learned on and used for a very long time but when I started teaching my daughter tarot I didn't go to the rider weight because I just the newer decks are so much richer and the symbolism is so much better but that's not to say that she won't get back to it you know I'm not surprised Someone Like You who has such a varied history and such a long history you know you might want something traditional apparently apparently you do how's it working for you are you liking it I do and it I kind of laugh at myself at the fact that I do just because you know who have thought who have thought yeah it's a surprise definitely surprise so I think that I think that's it for our ghosts of Christmas future talking about the future of tarot and paganism and I'm really exced excited we're going to go into 2023 and we're going to bring you guys a lot more taroy type stuff like I said we're going to try to
