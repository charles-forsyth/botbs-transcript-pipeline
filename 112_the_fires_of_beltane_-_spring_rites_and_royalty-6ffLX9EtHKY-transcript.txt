welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode we're talkin about the celebration of Beltane this is a very old fire Festival rooted in ancient Celtic tradition and is traditionally celebrated on May 1st in our old Community for this Festival we would choose a mate queen and a making and on this episode shell and I are naming all of you if you choose to accept the May Queen and or making of This Beltane I'm Layla and let me be the first one to say all hail the queens and kings of the Mets and I'm queen Michelle because well were all queens and kings today's a holiday and I'm so excited to talk about it and it's not my favorite for all the reasons you might think this is a lot of people's favorite holiday is the beginning of Summer traditionally it's celebrated with fire and with dancing and with life and would love  send with all sorts of the things that we absolutely adore and what is the thing that we would do for the first time every year at Beltane I'm going to stop the nine-year-old boy from saying what I don't say that cuz that was camping  it's traditional starts with a camping season at least if you're in the Northeast this is like first camping weekend opportunity now that doesn't guarantee you're not going to wake up to snow outside your tent but I was going to say the same thing it's the first camping opportunity and you better bring three sleeping bags and 12 blankets because you might but we still did it anyway okay quick side note remember that time when we went to Beltane and camped and we woke up till like 4 in of snow and I begged you to go take me for hot chocolate  car in the wee hours of the morning and went out and got hot chocolate and coffee warm stuff it's May and snowing I think we came back and a whole bunch of other people were also walking back to the camping filled with steaming cups of coffee and warm croissants and it was definitely a chilly morning but great community so speaking of our community let's talk real quick because I know we're both excited about this our world community in Upstate New York kind of I don't want to say dormant but they went a little buy it and come South people had life things were going on they're bringing Beltane back they're bringing Beltane back man they are I was listening to a couple of our old belting episodes in a couple years ago I was very excited cuz we had just moved back to the east coast and our old community did a Beltane celebration and I went and it was so lovely to reconnect with some old friends meet new friends and then sadly  last year they didn't do it but this year it has been announced by one of our favorite parts of the community that will be happening now puts it out there then you know it's going to be a Rockin good time and I'm glad that we're doing it because that is the land where I met my husband 26 years ago that long it was and it was all your fault blame me I'll take that one I absolutely blame you there then hand fasted a year later in the year 2000 when are coveted Beltane so this year when we go out there 25 years 25 year anniversary so I totally spaced that 25-year thing until just now when you said Beltane 2020 wonderful two people are wonderful and I'm just very excited that even though that the community is  will slow that it is kind of coming back here even funner fact for any of our listeners that are a part of that group and in the Southern Tier of New York when would I are going to Belton are they going to be excited or are they going to be worried that's the question here because of our listeners that are part of that Community yes we're coming at this is your fair warning I guess we're coming in with a bunch and I think they're going to be frightened and scared and joyful all at the same time that we did tend to push the envelope I don't think we ever did more than cause a few ruffled feathers with the old guard I wouldn't push an envelope and quiet that's exactly how he described you when you're not around we are not asking opinions on that we're just rolling and statement  is having a celebration and she'll and I will be there with bells on very joyous and very excited but looks talk about as far as you know we talked about community and we talked about all these wonderful group things that we do and have done what about our listeners that don't have that why don't we take a moment let's let's dedicate this episode to our solitary friend the kings and queens of the Mets that are all of our listeners this year all of you with whether you're celebrating with a cup in a group friends family or just by yourself this is things that you can do at home to celebrate yourself as royalty of the may as well as celebrate the season the God

whatever that path of becoming is so what you need is a mirror or a bowl of water something you can see your reflection in your phone to work a candle preferably in a summer color like gold or green

powerful sensual happy so as you're in your space and the music's playing and the flowers are pretty and everything looks good take your oil and anoint yourself put on your pulse points like you

crown on to be your Royal self or you can place it on the altar to remind you that you are royalty that you are sovereign of your own life I left now I am bursting to just chat about this real quick so we're going to we're going to walk into this conversation not everybody has the ability of the means the space the openness to be able to just have a ritual or a celebration privately in their yard their family home whatever let's talk briefly about how you recently were doing some May Day Celebrations you spent the afternoon you lucky dog you actually spent the afternoon with my grandson if I was  able to to babysit for a day so you did the things you did with my grandson were such made a things but it was kind of celebrate that spring the new life Outdoors you know the the freshness that is in the Beltane season talk to me a little bit about your little Beltane day fun with my little man well I'm an idiot and when you mentioned that your daughter was moving I was like I'll let her know if she needs any help I don't know why I said that because she been asked for help can you help him like I can't put Leila cat is a said she she offered me the best job which was babysitting I didn't even have to move shit I got to play with the baby all day so I get out there and this lovely house is your old haunted house it really is all my God we need a different episode we need to talk about if he felt anything in my old house  there was someone in the window I thought your daughter was there and the house was empty she showed up we'll talk about that now he's the perfect age let me just say by the way he turns 3 on Beltane weekend just egging  adorable this is your old house and it has a cute little backyard and a cute little front yard that was just bursting with flowers daffodils I mean I know that's kind of a spring thing but it's also more of a late spring or early summer thing with her we're at least bring the grass was green and has blooming in the backyard so I got to take your grandbaby out in the muddy backyard where it had just rained April showers and he loves picking the flowers he would pick the little purple deadnettle zand the violets and these little white flowers that I don't know what they were out of the grass weed say what color they were and he pick a couple and then what he really wanted to do was go over to the little forsythia bush and decorate it with these flowers that smiling bright yellow Bloom of these gorgeous bright yellow flowers which he loved but he wanted to decorate it with these little white and purple flowers so he picked a little flower  hours and he came over and you know tell me how pretty it was and how beautiful and and he really likes decorating it then we got to play in the mud because spring is mud luscious and may is very very full of rain in mods we got to play in the mud and enjoy all of that so being outside touching the dirt touching the new flowers we wove little flower crown waking it up cuz that house has been empty for a minute and I could tell that the land was happy and excited there was a family there again a family that it new and so that's one thing that you can do and belt 8 is say hello to your lands again as it's waking up say hello to those land spirits and I love getting to do that at your old house with your new grandbaby I did send you lots of pictures so so did you did you know that I actually ended up posting on Facebook the picture of him with behind the yellow flowers cuz it was so cute he's the sweetest  it wasn't just so we can spend a few minutes talking about my sweet baby the point of me bringing this up was even if you can't go out in the yard and cast The Circle because the neighbors might put you to the stake or something there such thing as you can do is a solitaire or with your children or with your family or what have you that doesn't necessarily have to be casting a circle calling cortisol it can still be ritualistic but your decorating trees and plants and digging in the mud and stones and weaving flower crowns and declaring your little grandbaby a little prince of the Mets she is and now what does being king or queen of the May mean we've declared all of our listeners are royalty in our old community that means Leila cuz I was a queen of the May and I was just going to point out that after like 20 years I still never was the damn McLean maybe this year  maybe maybe now our community the making and queen wasn't important tradition and in historically a lot of times when they chose someone to represent a season or to represent the holiday the idea is that person literally represents those energies they are that energy battery maybe for the community they bring that and provide it to everyone so the May Queen traditionally throughout the whole year would have represented that growth fertility that blooming coming into season and in our community to Queen in particular but the making of the May Queen held the energy of the community they helped to carry it and they helped to let it grow some people theorize that when the community kind of petered out towards the end of few years ago we had had a series of makings and queens who were chosen and then we're never able to come back and what we traditionally likes to do was we would put all of  is energy of the community into the making and queen celebrate them for the day give them gifts and then throughout the year they would hopefully come back to the community and bring that energy back and then the next Beltane they would give up that title to the next person and allow the energy to be carried on cycling exactly so I think that might have contributed a little bit to it but in our community it was done by chance they would bake a bean or something small into a cake or cupcakes or brownies and in those would be passed around and if you got the bean you are the queen of the May so historically there's not a lot of evidence for a May Queen but there were people that were symbols or hell those symbols of the season so even though the May Queen is like a central figure in modern Pagan and particularly Wiccan bass Beltane celebrations there's no real drift evidence that ancient  Egan's crowned any type of me Queen but her Roots do Trace back through folk Customs it was in a lot of older seasonal rights that we're kind of similar but not the same she was first mentioned we're pretty sure in the 19th century by a folklorist going to leave James Frazier and he linked the current May Day Celebrations to ancient fertility Cults and fertility Rites of older pagan people and these writings influenced a lot of the early wiccans like Gerald Gardner so the main Queen became this idea and expression of the season of the goddess in her Maidenform so in modern rights she is half of The Duality joined by the Green Man the horned God and they join together in the secret marriage that blesses the lands that brings Vitality back to the earth now what that means for our listeners is that they get to carry this energy of New Life of new beginnings of create  send within themselves for their own practice or for whatever purpose they choose to put it to sometimes people have a lot of just the magic of one for the time being and we're celebrating Beltane in the Northern Hemisphere and they're celebrating Samhain in the Southern Hemisphere and these are the two big holidays of the year and they both represent Duality life New Beginnings the god the goddess and while Beltane is celebrating life in full bloom basically the seeds you planted are really starting to come out now that one's kind of the opposite of bad it's when those things are dying off and things are going to pasture so to say right now right no I'm not saying to go there I'm just saying that these are two sides of the same coin just to do Alex and I love celebrating duality of the energies  action and reception of masculine feminine if you choose to call them that they Encompass so much more than just that and just like it sound when the veil is thin just because we call it Beltane doesn't mean that the veil is thick here in the Northern Hemisphere and thin down in the southern hemisphere it's been everywhere so ancestor work and divination is really good this time of year and that's why you saw Claire at my old family home because he knows we love spending and she's got stuff to say Beltane is a fertility holiday It's Fashion it's about sacred unions as god and goddess and and we've been working a lot with the horned God lately if you can leave here knew no sin this is a wonderful time to celebrate the horned God literally and figuratively just saying maybe because a lot of us have Hang-Ups from other religions I'm not sure but I think the god tends to get forgotten and I love to make sure that he's remembered on Beltane  wild Layla Layla wants to Remember the Time belt change  I'm surprised he knows the wild god of the wood the Green Man pan turn all of these Gods goat-footed Gods horns Gods Gods who walk around with their ding dong out these guys I love these guys this time of year because they love being Wild and Free and that energy is beautiful and it is wrong and it is you feel it across the land you do and I grew up in the woods my father is a Woodsman and false he may have honoring the woods and the spirit of the Woods has always been a part of who he is and so I have always felt the wild heartbeat of the god in the woods and in the land especially this time of year so if you get a chance say hello to Karen Uno's spend a little time learning about her nor pan or one of the green men learn about the wild ways  the forest and the path Walker's don't forget the guy he is such a big part you know the God within us we all have these Duality spell teens all about Duality and you don't need a separate person to have that to ality you can find that in yourself so set the Godfrey that's in you when you're celebrating the making and the May Queen you do be both of them and celebrate that guy celebrate that Wild and Free Spirit and definitely Revel in that for a little bit and allow that to be wondrous and honoring and beautiful because he is not about control or putting down he is about running those tabs and being part of Nature and being part of the cycle and it's not about domination it's about Duality absolutely and it's about honoring the life-giving force in himself in the world in the goddess and everything he's beautiful and powerful and I I  highly recommend you guys say hello LG is makes me want to just jump out of my chair and go outside and go say hello to God he's the god of the sun god of healing and light and Beltane typically means the fires of bell you know so just to interject here a little bit I read an article recently now we've talked about this before we got on to record and I am the worst person at pronunciations so I'm going to give this ago so I read an article based out of Edinborough way to teach me pronunciations is to invite me to come stay  oh that would be awesome wouldn't that would be awesome if they do every year which I love this and I find this fascinating to actually would love to attend sometime they do a Beltane fire festival and they have actually what's come of the Beltane fires society that puts this big huge I mean they like balefire is it almost looks almost looks ancient to me when you watch these YouTube videos like you're transported back in time to traditional Beltane celebrations but the town has actually put a ticket levy on this event what what is that it's basically a tax and they're saying that the implications by putting on this tax levy gives to the city at the ability to hold a safe cultural and community of Base defense all for it  is the way they have kind of structured who has to pay this tax levy and who doesn't is kind of not in favor of the Beltane fire Society so it seems to be a little discriminatory it's kind of targeted yeah okay yeah basically what they're saying is if you have an event at this place and you're going to have things like fire and you're going to have say more than 100 people you have to pay this exorbitant tax directly targeted to them but they're not saying you and you alone are tax so they're making it kind of exclusive instead of inclusive and they've added this part I guess it's called but it'll probably go to pronounce this wrong as well good Calton Hill they've added it to the premier Parks events they have this thing called Premier Parks event Levi project  basically kind of targets certain groups to charge him a lot and so this group has been targeted right and they're saying that you know obviously I was with anything else that this is going to put a strain on the facilitation and the attendance so I mean I'm not saying that they're trying to drive him out but kinda I mean this thing has more than twenty thousand attendees so like we're not talking like two hundred people here we're talking over like 20,000 attendees I guess I need to know a little more I can understand having some safety and place and needing to have permits and that kind of thing I totally get that this feels very targeted so I hope not it's coming across and I mean this was right on msn.com not that they're the premier news source but it's not like I got this out of like the local PennySaver it looks like the fyre festival itself very cool it's been going on since 1988 and I would absolutely love to go next year  but they do fire spinning there's all sorts of events that go on all night they have rituals they have fire displays they're going to have a torch-lit procession symbolic figures from Celtic mythology the Green Man the queen of the May will be there I can just see the Rihanna and are of caution with all that fire going around but you know why don't you just don't understand by if that's the case I would hope that this is not religiously targeted and it's really just to keep everything safe and if they work with the local people that are are in Scotland and Edinboro and I would like to know a if you go is this a badass time or what and B is the tendons and is the event going to actually be that affected with the targeted attack on pricing because this is some time is what governments do  assistance my last question to that is pink that was either C or D or 4 I'm not sure how soon should we start looking for Rooms To Reserve at the local hotels cuz it looks like there's a lot of people that go to this just saying I had to say that so there are celebrations around the world for this you know we all like when the days are longer and warmer and you can see that life has started we even had a hard time celebrating ostara until just a couple weeks ago because it's it's been so cold and yucky this is wonderful this year I feel like I'm really blooming and really ready to be outside in our region of the world I've always looked at summer and I know you've kind of always looked at summer is summer is from Belton to Samhain a great and it is time to kick it up folks  ancient Ireland this is one of those holidays but has been celebrated for a very very long time and we do know what these celebrations are there is a I think it was in the tenth Century CarMax glossary sinus Cormac 10th Century Irish text he describes the festival is taking place on May 1st and it was typically the start of summer so I seen this as the summer season May 1st to Fallon even in cold Northeast is historically accurate I believe that in Ireland in Irish and may is the Altoona so some people will sit instead of saying Beltane for the holiday Phil call it by the Altoona which is the word from the month of May that were said to come to Ireland so honoring the Fey folk is another way a traditional way to celebrate Beltane and that goes hand-in-hand with go out and walk your land walk around your neighbor  find a tree in your backyard and leave a little offering of milk or honey or a tiny little bit of food for the Fey go say hello to your land Spirits I have been loving the last few weeks walking a mile and anytime I get a chance go out and pick up some of the branches that have fallen start cleaning the land getting my garden beds ready and Whispering hello and waking up the land spirits and then it's a wonderful thing to do for Beltane as well know you were talking about how how it has it goes by different names and Welsh it's called Colin mine and one thing I have always associated with Beltane and I think of when I think of calling my is to remember when you are kid the little wicker baskets and you to go pick flowers have a ton to Spanish Fork Utah wicker baskets all I can think about the other day was just going through with my wicker basket and filling it with flowers for what reason I don't know just cuz they  all pretty I'm not good at weaving flower crowns that's really kind of your thing but just kind of bring in that life inside to the house cuz this is traditionally my spring cleaning time where I kind of got everything cleaned it all out and bringing a basket of fresh flowers and kind of I don't know I don't want to see rejuvenate fresh cuz those aren't the words that really sound right but something they are their perfect rejuvenating my space and I am working hard to keep these plants alive by the way people and everything is going swimmingly right now leaving crowns or weaving reads to put up on your door you know take down your old Reece that was for fall or winter and put a nice spring wreaths that smells good has some Greenery in it but weaving is wonderful and Maples are not a good example of weaving you know that kind of brings me around to some I did want to chat about today  ribbon magic you know not everybody is familiar with a maypole and the ribbons on a maypole and the other day I saw something on Facebook that talked about Maples and all I could think about was dancing around that pole and weave in the ribbon and I don't have that right now but I still want the concept of that and because I I didn't have that that big community in that 10 ft tall made Paul to dance around took different colored ribbons to Spring colored ribbons I had a pink and yellow and white and blue and did like a for ribbon braid I took that braids and actually ended up attaching it to my broomstick a shout out to The Hags over a stream on Chromecast burn Monica  and all of you that love them and send them energy sending lots of good wonderful energy cuz they're fantastic creators and they're so good the other creators in the space which is wonderful which has any way to put it on your broom to my broom because it was kind of a spontaneous thing that I I was doing it without really knowing why I just didn't really have a y at the end so I put it I just put it in the flower stems how you do the flower crown version of French braiding if anybody out there has a hard time breathing flower crowns if you think of it like French braiding where you're always adding a little bit more hair or whatever to the parade as you go along it's basically you just add new flowers to the Pro Bowl on  sing magic. Magic this time of year when I don't really any other time of year so I think of this time of year is kind of time to be weaving magic together figuratively and literally when we talked before about not magic and weaving magic as you're doing the spell each of those braids or not holds the energy so you can braid as your as your humming a spell eraser thinking about the energies you could do each not to be at a different word of the spell or a different energy that you want to hold and Maples are I'm not sure exactly when they started getting associated with Beltane but because they have a lot of fertility associations they've definitely been part of may-day and Beltane celebrations not just for pagans but Christians and other people do Maple dances as well and now in our community and in a lot of communities the maypole and the ribbons are fertility symbols which again is a big huge theme of Beltane so the maypole obvious  he stands for the phallus and the hole that the pole goes into stands for the vagina so you have male and female aspects I know I make it sound so unsexy or literally would champ with the hall and Hall oh yeah I was there was all sorts of innuendos flying back and forth we had a lot of fun with it I'm hoping it happens again this year so it doesn't again is a fertility thing you put the pool in the hole and the ribbons can stand for all sorts of things they can stand for the Maiden Blood they could stand for semen they can stand for just the energies of the season and so to do a simple Maple spell you would get ribbons in the colors that you want colors that represent Beltane which is typically going to be like green gold red silver things that you would see when you go outside this time of year and also pick colors that represent what you want maybe you're going to put purple in there because you are the God damn made Queen this year and you're royalty so you want to put purple in there to represent your royalty as you  hold your head up and wear your crown for the rest of the year but in our community everyone would get a ribbon we typically use the same ones each year and the May Queen we get a white one the only white one because we would all try to dance and weave the ribbons beautifully and the chaos and she would weave in and out however she wanted to while the rest of us tried to do the pattern perfect and we would do a little bit of maple divination at the end where we would see how chaotic or how the pattern woven kind of predict how the year would go based on the maypole weaving tongue and cheek mostly you can do that yourself if you had a group or if you wanted to do a little knitting or crocheting or weaving yourself as you spoke your spouse and just kind of look at it afterwards and see how it turns out that might give you an idea I've always liked to be weaving intentions into the coming season because I kind of have that theme on every Sabbath every holiday is kind of stuff  sing the intentions for the next segment the next Notch that were working with you know so what it what are my intentions that I'm going to set from now from Beltane until we had left side of the summer solstice what are my goals and in what am I looking to accomplish basically between the beginning of May in the end of June you know so I kind of I like that weaving my intentions for this this next phase of the wheel because sometimes my brain just can't chunk it out a year at a time sometimes I just need to go every six weeks you know what you want for the next six weeks for the next eight weeks from now because I don't have to have space for that I can only kind of segmented out for the here and now and I think that may be a lot of people are feeling that way I recently that I can only think about the  next week's dammit I can't next six months yeah I have a little spell that will kind of combined that idea into a short-term spell from now until Alyssa however many strands you would like 347 whatever kind of rating or not work you would like to do but make sure that it is natural fibers or paper or long strands of grass you can use whatever you want just make sure that it's natural because I going to put this outside this is going to be an offering to yourself from now until Lissa and also to the land spirit so one of the things people used to do for Beltane is to tie ribbons usually there would be a special tree off of near water or in a place where they filled the land Spirits were particularly potent to be like a fairy tree and that would be where people would go to tie ribbons and ask for an offering you know they might leave a little bit of food or honey or milk for the land Spirits for the FAE and they would tie the ribbon and ask for something in return  so in this version of the spell you're going to take your three ribbons you can take like that really thin paper anything you'd like again natural and as you think of what you want three that into the three things you're braiding If It's Paper you can write on it if you want to but speak your wishes to those three strands and then as you're braiding it concentrate on what it is you're asking for a new job I want to see the great fertility time if you want to have a new baby if you want to start something new if you want to bring fertility of whatever flavor into your life this is a great time to ask for it so ask for these things as you braid have to be long very short so Brazier little three things together and then go to your fairy treat whatever outside space you have chosen to be your fairy Bush say your intention one more time and then tie that ribbon on to the tree and then leave an offering of milk or honey and you can say something very simple I love rhyming things you might say something like with this ribbon I give my wish  belief to wind with blossoms kiss May the spirits of the land receive and in their time I will believe or something they would ever say something reimy that fits with what you like doesn't matter or just say thank you and then turn around and walk away and leave it and there's your little offering to the FAE and your little belting tree wish and your little dab of Honey is an offer like you mentioned one time using Acorn caps and I love that it is so cute little tiny flowers of offerings whatever you'd like but yeah so you're wishing to that little braids tie it to the tree and then leave your offering and go. Kind of sounds like my little grandson putting his little flowers and that's what I was thinking of while we while we were doing that I was thinking that he was making little offerings to the land and that made me think of that old Beltane tradition of Thai  things to know about you so I thought about that so you could say that this is your grandbabies spell people traditionally would like to fires and walk through them you know everyone would put out all their fires in their homes and they would like to fires up on a hill by the town and people would drive their cattle between the two fires in order to bless them to give fertility they themselves would walk through the fires you could do that at your house with two candles or if you're lucky enough to have a fire outside you could set a candle a few feet away from that fire to be your second fire or used to read crystals or two drawings of fire two phones with videos of fires burning on them. And then State your intention that these are your bell fires and you're going to walk through these Bell fires and receive the blessing of the God of Light and life and fertility for the coming year  you could pass your items between them like your tools your jewelry your pets bless your grimoire bless your baby whatever just be safe remember your fire safety that sounds perfect especially for folks that don't have a group and don't have a large community to lean on that's the perfect way for them to celebrate solitary to it's pretty cool and there's lots of fire things that you can do just be careful with the fire don't burn your house down. Time we were to Beltane and someone jumped the Beltane fire and caught on fire like we don't need that we don't thankfully in our group there were people right there that took care of that because stop drop and roll folks very often we would jump the fire so times we had two fires that you could walk through but in in our defense when there was fire jumping we always had a fire spotter so if you did have freely close on it happened to catch fire there  somebody they're beaten into the ground I think it only happened once and it was scary scary absolutely fire  some other things that you can do for Beltane Beauty spells and glamour spells and if you go out at dawn or early morning before the do burns off the morning dew of Beltane is said to have special powers you can take a washcloth or a piece of cloth outside wipe the grass or maybe wipe your window if it's got do on it I don't know you can put that on your face you can put that in a little vial and add it to beauty and love so you can add a little bit of it to your bath but they're the first do of the morning of May 1st is said to have magical properties on Beltane morning when the Dew is out so that that magic is something I'm not familiar with the deal will have burned off by the time she is out of bed  do all of our makings and queens we recommend that you braid a crown for yourself maybe set up a throne set up a throne with your squishy blankets or with your favorite pillow or you do make it look Royal Rico have whatever that means to you set up a spot this specifically for you in your home make your alter into a throne room and celebrates the DVD that royalty that's within you to the make Angus in the Mets Queens thank you so much for listening to this Beltane episode of back on the broomstick all of our kings and queens of the Met out there and thank you all so much for being with us for hangout for celebrating these Seasons we really appreciate you guys and you know we're just want y'all to just get outside breathe some fresh air it's been a few months and we finally finally can go out and enjoy that that is nature it's time to go out in the woods it's time to go to the water get out  my folks  play the play the month like my grandson without and within each other I guess I'm starting to sound like a sermon anyway thank you all again so much for joining us we hope you get a chance to enjoy this Beltane and we will see you all soon for the next episode being wise be royal be Wicked and keep it with she cleans
