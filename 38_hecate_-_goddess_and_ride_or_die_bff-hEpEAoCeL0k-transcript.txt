welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick tonight we're talking about a very special goddess a very popular goddess she is the goddess of transitions of lional of Crossroads the goddess of Witchcraft and Magic why are you making her sound like some fluffy happy lady oh no she's also the goddess of necromancy and of death the Crescent Moon and ghosts and of whooping your ass absolutely and to me she's actually the goddess of best friends of ride or die best friends and I'll explain why a little later in the episode but before we get too far I'm Lea and I'm shell and guess who we're talking about can you guess we're talking about hiate you know I would like to just quick start with people pronounce it differently you might also hear HEC or E with no h I think that's more of the Greek pronunciation but don't know I know that she is a big Trend right now she has been for a couple years we we'll get into that in a few but I have actually been a priestess of hiate for oh what 20 25 years yes and shortly after I met you her and I are tight but she is definitely not a around and find out kind of goddess she is not and honestly I'm kind of loving how popular she is right now mostly because to me that kind kind of signifies that now is the time of witches you know that now is witchcraft Rising if HEC is in everybody's minds and on everyone's lips maybe that means that witchcraft is coming into its own well I kind of have a whole different perspective I'm looking at it actually as validating as you know over the years I got a lot of  from a lot of pagans or being aligned with hiate and it's validating I remember I'm going to tell a story on you sh okay and I remember back in the day you were being called to hkat very strongly but at that time in the late 90s the Crone in The Crossroads that was the main depiction that you would see of her anywhere uh she looked like the Elder Greek lady in the robes with the torch and the dogs but always a crone and you kept saying that that's not what I'm seeing she's coming to me as this young woman I see three young women or one young woman and everyone was like no no no and you saw a picture of her and you're like that's the hekate I know that's the one that's coming to me and people kept giving you and now that's the only depiction that we see right and she's always been both she is both the Crone and the young goddess she is she has multiple forms don't know why but back in the in the 90s she was only allowed to be that hag quote unquote and I never got that I kind of more you know like this gorgeous kind of warrior princess whoop your ass and a heartbeat and I never let people get me down and I I I stuck to my vision and and my connection and I never let anybody sway my connection with and a I'm proud of myself B I laugh that now that's how people depict her but most importantly I find this huge attraction to her right now validating she is such a powerful figure for today I think and for today's witches I love that she's kind of everywhere well and I think that part of the reason that people kind of I don't want to say look down on me back then gave me a lot of  about it was hiate is anything but fluffy in love okay very true um and I almost think that I got a lot of for it because she was I don't want to say darker but more serious I really love that you stuck to your guns on that one because that's how she appeared to you and that's the energy that was coming to you and you weren't willing to let other people's ideas even back then sway you and I think that that's something that we can all remember now because deity this type of energy isn't always going to come to you the same way it does to someone else and that doesn't invalidate your experience well and I also had her whispering in my ear being like those people that sounds like Kate Kate is is kind of the boss so yeah those people I mean everybody's ction and experience with deity is different if you don't like mine great I didn't ask your opinion now hagate is a Greek goddess and she is a dual goddess because she does appear both as a young Maiden very powerful sometimes as a mother she's also depicted as a crone very often because she is the queen of wisdom of Witchcraft of necromancy of the Dark Moon well as you're aware um she is often depicted with kind of like three faces or three forms yes I've always looked at it as she is the queen of witches so she can come to you as the Maiden The Warrior the mother the carer or the Crone the wise person almost like I look at her as she's going to come to you in the form that you need at the moment she is a she is a triple formed goddess because she is the goddess of the crossroads she is the KE keep ER of doorways she is the keeper of linal spaces she stands as three people back to back or three faces all looking outward so that she can see everything coming she stands in the center of that crossroads as a guardian as a guide and that way as three formed she's able to see everything and so that's why she's a three formed not necessarily the triple goddess although in modern time she's now seen very much in correlation to the triple moon and the triple goddess her form is actually that of three maidens standing in the center of the crossroads so that she can see everything and also she was kind of The Keeper of the doorway to the underworld and that like triple form guarding the doorway to the underworld you know what I mean oh absolutely I love this is okay this is where the rider die comes in I love this part so as you know hkat was the one who saw pranie being pulled down into The Under World right she sees this kidnapping right and so she's helping demer her bestie she grabs a torch and goes with demer the whole world round not sleeping not stopping helping to find deer's daughter panie and never gave up she found her with Hades in the Underworld and helped to negotiate to bring her back to her mother even better she goes with pranie every year carrying a torch and bringing her nymphs to the underworld to make sure that pranie is safe so that demer doesn't have to worry dude I would do that for you yeah I'd do that for you absolutely so to me she is I know she's tough but she's also the personification of best friends well and you know I've made some wacky decisions in my life as you know oh you know no right and you know I can little cray cray little she is the one who kind of gets you back on track you know hey up get back on track and with the prapan and demeanor thing I look at it as she was trying to keep that going I'm GNA go I'm G to help knowing that you know they'll come out of the underworld with both demer and pranie but knowing that it'll cycle back again and she's going to stand there in the doorway to make sure yeah exactly and I I I think that's just such a cool story for her I never thought of it as like a busty thing but you're totally right you're totally on to something with that oh yeah he and demer they're tight thick as thieves absolutely so some of her symbols that you'll see very often are dogs particularly black dogs although I know she does not appear to you with dogs right but I think that is just because I'm not a dog person don't tell H that so not just dogs but torches in particular one of my favorite herbs I recently learned is called the torch of hak so the Mullen plant which I love as a tea and also to smoke along with cannabis has a very long tall flower a center stem flower that has yellow flowers on it and you can actually break that off roll it or dip it in wax and burn it as a torch and it's often called hak's candle or hak's torch so we're gonna have a information on how to do that and if I can get some I'll see if we can post some pictures of us doing it but yeah so I just recently found that out so that is one of her plans one thing um I I did learn years ago and you know I'm not a dog person I'm a cat person don't judge me so I always had a hard time with with the three dogs or the the three-headed dogs and I did come to find out that she was also occasionally known to travel with owl so I have tried to kind of embrace the owl because I have a harder time with a you know dog thing she'll also be represented sometimes by serpents as rays of the moon sometimes you'll actually see her depicted like with a serpent around her almost like a belt like the the serpent is wrapped around her waist I want a snake belt that'd be pretty cool right she's also of course Very popularly associated with Crossroads and with Kei and also hidden knowledge which you know we're all fans of that one one aspect of her she is a protector you know kind of circling back to her BFF to me her and I think that that aspect of her is kind of what's stuck with me all these years you know I might create my own and maybe I needed to be protected for myself sometimes but my relationship with hiate was sometimes what got me through almost like when someone's got your back she is fiercely protective of her devotees and I always knew if I was done wrong she'd handle my I've seen that in action actually right now how did you know I remember when we were first researching goddesses and studying witchcraft together you learned from several different goddesses you worked from with several different deities and then you came to hak how did she come to you how did you know to worship with hkat well you know I have this love with all things Celtic you know I Britain Ireland you know Welsh stuff scouted stuff like I am all about UK stuff and I wasn't connecting with any Celtic deity I mean I gave it a good effort I even went as far as trying to connect with MB which I know is a a favorite of yours and one of our old coven mates kind of turned me on to p and I really definitely not Celtic right right but I liked the the P Vibe but I almost felt like I wasn't allowed to have that be my thing I feel like I had to live in the Pacific and and live the life yeah she let you so far and no further kind of yeah like I have to live the volcanic Life to Live the P life and I I didn't feel worthy but I kind of liked I mean maybe darker Vibe isn't the right word but kind of that more well to be honest shell you are definitely a non-nonsense kind of person right I wouldn't say that you have a a darker Vibe but you definitely have a very real upfront honest Vibe and you you resonate with deity that kind of does that same thing and I mean I know that that sometimes I can come across on on the podcast as like the the fun Joker one but if you want sugarcoated I am not the one to be asking I tell you it is and if you didn't want to know you shouldn't have asked kind of person and that's what I love about you that's kind of what I look for in my deities is that weird exactly no exactly that makes sense P wasn't a perfect fit it was a good fit but not a perfect fit and I I've pulled on her in the past but remember I had that book can't remember the author I know you'll put it in the notes and I was looking for someone P like but Celtic and one night I was dreaming when I was a kid in in my old childhood house we had those old skeleton keys and I just kept dreaming about those damn keys I always loved them and I couldn't figure it out and I remember talking to one of our old uh coven mates was like you know I keep dreaming of these freaking Keys all the time what the hell does that mean because one thing that is not my forte is dream interpretation she was like well look up keys I did some research and she knew I was kind of struggling with the whole deity thing and she's like you know you know who uh uses Keys as a symbol by the way and she brought me on to hiate and I I looked it up and I was like you know kind of P like and I fought it for a while because it wasn't Celtic because I don't lean in the Greek stuff really but I couldn't shake her and I don't want to say I've made her Celtic in my own mind but kind of kind of she she's Universal I really think she's truly especially nowadays she's truly Universal I mean there's even a holiday which just happens to be the day we're recording today is H's day that's right today is hkat night the Feast of hkat from Sunset November 16th until sunset the next day you work ship and celebrate hiate light Fires for her leave offerings at Crossroads for her leave out keys for her although any offerings that you leave at a Crossroads make sure it's something that you can leave there for good because you're not supposed to look back after you leave the offering don't look well and you know you don't want to be leaving you know your random house key at a Crossroads either not in this day age we've talked before about putting out cookies in the shape of keys because theate loves honey and sweet things so you can make cookies and kind of two birds one stone right there and leave those at the crossroads well I kind of feel like her and I over the last 20 some odd years she knows my vibe I know her vibe and I actually suggested this to you earlier today or maybe yesterday I don't remember when draw a key on a piece of paper oh you did that to me yesterday biodegradable first of all no one's breaking into your house because you left your key but because she knows me and I know her I leave a Sprinkle of tobacco because don't judge me I'm a smoker and a little sprinkle of marijuana and a paper key now this past weekend we were together right we were drinking some tea that you had gotten from black cat curiosity shop in Salem Massachusetts we are not affiliated with them but we love their tea oh yeah this is not sponsored by them but oh my gosh they're amazing the tea is fantastic so we were drinking some delicious yummy tea and at the end of course because sh is a beginning tea master I handed her my cup and said read my tea leaves now this was before we talked about anything related to hkat or today or anything this was just random you know what does my tea say and I said you know that looks like a lock and in my mind you know the where the skeleton key goes it looked like a like a skeleton key lock and you did not know that for the last couple weeks I have been seeing subtle signs that hiate has kind of been reaching out have you because you didn't tell me that because if you would have told me that beforehand I would have been like dude saddle up because you're going for so just little subtle things and so when you said lock I started thinking this is again hiate kind of being not so subtle and making a connection to make it worse when we were discussing this episode and some of the technical issues and things that I have had this past week shelle had the bright idea she out of the blue says you need to leave a key a paper key for hiate at a Crossroads I had already been thinking about making an offering to her and I was like all right I'll make a paper key I look to my left and on my desk is a pile of business cards that I got from the Pagan Pride day this past summer and on the top of it is a sticker from a business that has an old-fashioned skeleton key a paper key right there that you had never seen no no you guys you don't even understand she texted me a picture of this and I was like what the holy hell she'll tell you all I responded back to her text was hail hiate hail hiate so of course I made the offering but yes the point is a paper key is fabulous especially if you use like tissue paper you can cut it out you can write your affirmation on it you can write your offering on it and then it's it's biodegradable you don't have to worry about it hiate also likes garlic and dogs make yourself some homemade dog treats with honey and garlic and peanut butter and oats and put those in the shape of a key or a torch or a crescent moon and leave those at a Crossroads in the woods hey all you witches pagans heathens and magical Souls future Lila here with a little bit of an update one of our listeners let us know that garlic in large amounts can be toxic to dogs so after checking around with our Veterinary friends we discovered that small amounts might be okay but larger amounts definitely are not research has shown that one to two cloves of garlic per pound of body weight in a dog can be harmful I'll include links from the American Kennel club's website as well as from BMC Veterinary research in the show notes so please check with your vets and use caution better safe than sorry and as as far as like stones and crystals you know I love little rocks Moonstone onx hematite smoky quartz kind of like darker Stones um her color is black I love black it's very slimming I actually associate moldavite with her because it's such a stone that brings so much change to people and she's very much about having you accept your Shadow side and and to face your fears and to to have action and to do things and mulite seems to really motivate people to do that too so I don't know if it's correct or not but I really see mulite as a as a stone of hkat now you want to think of hiate as like your stripped ant who I like that the ones that's gonna kick you in the ass when you're doing something wrong but gonna you know give you a hug and help you get through it too right she's gonna sit there and watch you crash and burn and then tend to your wounds afterwards but break up relationship ending you know that is so common in the world I wish it wasn't I have to say two divorces with hiate don't know how I did it without her she's the one who's like you know you ain't crying in bed get out get your ass up put on your damn big girl pants and handle your she is not a soothing deity more of a get up and do what you got to do you can handle it you're strong enough you got what it takes just  do it she's not one to cuddle you and I find it really humorous that after my first divorce my ex-husband who is also Pagan like a couple years after our divorce somehow got the call of hiate she wasn't done with him it it was almost like he was like a a a pseudo follower because we were married and she wasn't done with him after the after the divorce he still had lessons to learn that she was going to make sure he learned right right and you and I and him have talked about that I don't know if you ever got that connection of me kind of giggling in the background but I almost feel like in the beginning she was probably coming to both of us and he just didn't realize it until after more than likely you know honestly for divorces and things like relationship breakups she's an amazing goddess for that time because that is a Lial space in your life that's very much a between time where you're crossing a threshold from one part of your life into another and she is nothing if not the goddess of those thresholds and those limal spaces so she can very much help you in that transition space well as much as she will she will guide you through it she's also the one that is going to make you face harsh realities and truths whether you like it she wants you to grow through it right I mean she isn't letting you hide and and sugarcoat your she's like here it is love it or leave it but deal that sounds like someone I know gosh I wonder who that could be sh you no oh hey right I that right back at you yeah yeah yeah but she's definitely not one to play with no no she's not but if she comes to you she comes to you if you're interested in her study her she loves learning she loves knowledge you don't have to if you want to worship a goddess or work with a goddess or any deity you don't have to explicitly have their name Flash in front of your face and neon lights you just have to have an interest right also remember you can look into like the book I had 10,000 goddesses and gods I mean you're not tied to picking one only one it worked out for me but maybe you like four or five and you know whatever works for you I tend to be a serial monogamist with my deities I go for I go for long periods of time like I will study with a a deity sometimes for just a very short period of time you know maybe a month or three months but I often like to at least dedicate myself for like the traditional quote unquote year in a day right to do study and worship with that deity but often times it usually will be like three years five years and then I'll I'll choose another deity that I'd like to and it it very much corresponds to you know I'll be in my Carwin era or I'll be in my Morgan era or yeah but I I have a problem with that though I I've tried that I thought this was you know way back 25 years ago I thought okay you know I'll work with her for a few years and then we'll move on she said no and that's gonna happen too that happens for some people I I've tried and and she says no and now you know 25 years on we've talked about how I have found a glorious wonderful perfect coven here in Salem finally you know they're kind of like hey you know could you maybe look into a Welsh goddess and I can just hear hkat in my mind saying I got my claws in you woman so I am going to have two because she she she isn't letting me move on from her and that's okay too you know I often work with multiple deities I have not worked with one as closely as you have for as long as you have but I have worked with some off and on over that time period so both are perfectly valid you can be a disciple of just one deity or one Pantheon or 10 exactly or you can switch back and forth you could like I am be a little bit of a serial monogamist and go back and forth with them and I know we haven't really you know we we keep saying you know goddess but that is equally the same for Gods but again I've kind of stuck with the green man konos I don't know I'm a weirdo yeah we'll have to do an episode on some of the different gods that'll be cool yeah but you know with hiate how you perceive her isn't necessarily going to be you know how she comes to me might not be how she comes to you and that doesn't negate your view of her you know I love that the internet is kind of portraying her like I don't know what to say a hot mama sexy H but I like that only because it is that non chrone version that I connected with and that I love so much you know she she's like your your stripped aunt or your grandma that makes you follow the rules or you know your cousin that is always whispering in your ear are you sure you want to do that right and you know I feel like there has been times where I've heard hkat say are you sure you want to do that I don't want to say sometimes I'm scared of her but sometimes I'm scared of her any deity that makes you look at the Dark Side of yourself and handle it is scary that can be very scary to people it's it's a lot and she can be a lot I know you like labyrinths and that is also one of her things and she makes you go into yourself and go deep and if if you don't like soul searching and going deep you you need to not deal with hiate because you know Shadow work is such a big thing right now she is gonna pull you into Shadows that you didn't even want to go into okay exactly and make you face them with her torch but hold your hand while you get through it yeah I'm gonna make you do it but I'm gonna be here with you exactly just like she is for pranie you know she's down there with her torch with her nymphs she's guiding The Souls of the Dead while she watches over pranie while she's in the Underworld that's just cool but she'll be damned if you think you're gonna ignore it and not do it yeah she will not let you take the easy way out that's for sure I also look at her as she has the ability to kind of speed up Karma oh I don't know if that's just a me thing or a general thing with her but she will get your karma back to you if that's what you need to get back on track which I say it now like oh no big deal but when she has done that to me I've been pissed off it's not easy it's definitely not easy it's like it's like your 29 return when everything starts to come back at you you know heck Sayes the same thing it can be very difficult rewarding but difficult and certainly a pain in the ass while you're doing it but yeah she's all about tough love and if if you're not into tough love you need to keep looking some of the best times to worship her are the Dark Moon and the new moon the 30th of the month is often reserved as a night for hkat and of course like we said November 16th which is the Feast of hkat now I've heard this before honestly just in the last few years I I can't really say more than five years or so that I personally have heard of this particular Feast I never really knew back in the day anyone who celebrated this not even you who was all into hkat so I started researching this for the episode and it seems to be one of those things that has been made up rather recently nobody really knows the history of it can I just tell you a really funny thing about this yeah I have for a billion years known about H's night you know I'm bad with doing things necessarily on the day so that's why I never really did it because I'd remember like two weeks later but all my I don't want to say all my life but all of my hkat life I have always known it to be August 13th and I don't know where the hell November 16th came up I mean I kind of worship her and and praise her every day every year but yeah I always thought it was August 13th so I'm not sure what's going on here because I've also recently found something online that said January 31st is her feast day what what the what the hell what the hell I think she has a lot of feast I did find a pathos article and I I do love everybody who contributes to that but um someone else had the same question you know where did this November 16th hkat night come from and no one's really sure it does seem to be one of those that mostly seems to be a a madeup modern date with with some vague ties to historical dates that someone pulled in but I still think it's kind of cool it doesn't seem to have a very long history but I'm okay with having extra days to celebrate hiate I just don't want anyone calling it an ancient right when it doesn't appear to be more than maybe 10 12 years old you know what I like about the November date more than the August date is I do feel she's kind of more of a goddess of the night quote unquote and she fits in more with the darker part of the year than summer you know what I mean I agree and plus it was this half of the year when she took up the torch to follow demer around the world trying to figure out where Hades had taken pranie so it really fits it kind of fit in my mind because of that story but basically I really can't find anything other than possibly there's a feast to St Hilda on November 17th and she might possibly be like an amalgamation of a bunch of goddesses including kkate but there's really no historical basis cool date love the idea doesn't have a very long history still like it though well I just kind of I'm not always great with dates and you know like last year and the year before I wished you a happy birthday either day before the day after whatever I did it that's all that matters exactly I celebrate her when I celebrate her and if it is on some madeup day great and if it's on whatever day I do it you know her and I are good she knows my intent and I think that's another thing to remember with deity whatever agreement you have amongst you and your deity that what's going to work if you have made an agreement to leave an offering for hkat every day on your altar you better stick to your agreement right you know if you've decided every 30th of the month to do that just stick to it whatever you come up with whatever works for you and feels right between you and your deity or deities just try and stick to it as best you can you don't have to go by what works for someone else and just like we would always tell you don't don't break a promise to people don't break a promise to your deity yeah those are pretty serious actually especially hak because she'll whoop your ass and and been there done that you don't want to go down that road not a fun time you know we kind of talk about I don't want to say the the darker aspects but you know don't get me wrong she is also on the flip side compassionate loving and a wise guide you know kind of that I'm going to force you to learn your lesson and then when you do I'm going to help pick you up you know so there there is a sense of a loving aspect a caring aspect but after you've done the work with with h you have to do the work and she'll make you she'll make you but why why is she a trend right now do you know I think it's because it's the rise of Witchcraft I think because she's the queen of witches and of Witchcraft she is rising right along with all of us I think her energy right now is is soaring and is so big because witchcraft is coming into its own I mean look at us all we're everywhere I'm loving this so much I'm loving our listeners reaching out to us people saying that they're finding community Through us you know they're they're finding validation and I just see I see it everywhere I see other podcasts and websites and books and and there's so much out there I just think it's the rise of Witchcraft she's Rising along with it I love that and you know we actually uh will be having a a episode coming out here shortly where Lea and I were a guest on a different podcast and one point that we made on that is not only is there a rise in witchcraft as a whole but I feel more men are coming out of the broom closet it and that is huge and that is awesome and welcome to the I love seeing everybody claiming the title of a witch it's a beautiful thing to see but yes hopefully next week we should be on YouTube you'll get to see our beautiful faces on the YouTube of the lovely Morgan from busy gritty in and witchy and do not judge us I was so anxiety ridden about being on camera that you know if you go look at that and I look like a weirdo I had anxiety girl you're gorgeous don't even don't even worry about it but yes you'll get to see our lovely faces on her Channel hopefully next week we will put a link to her Instagram and her YouTube so y'all can find it I I I do want to just real quick with the hak thing I just want to say Don't Force It if you have a connection great but don't think that that because she's an internet Trend or a Tik Tock Trend that that is who you have to connect to there are literally like the book I use 10,000 goddesses and 10,000 Gods my My Hope Is that Lea and I will come back and over time pick a few other ones and and do episodes on individual ones other than hiate but she's not the only option just because she's all over social media so if she doesn't work for you it is okay but if she does work for you strap in friends if you want to call to hkat the best thing to do I would say would be to have a place set for her or or have your altar set up for her maybe with crescent moons maybe with Honey Cakes a key definitely Keys certainly Keys especially found keys any Keys you have found are sacred to hiate or if you just go buy some old keys that works too or like shell said I love this idea shell is the paper Keys put it on some parchment paper or put it on some type of really thin paper make your keys that way for my altar I have actual uh skeleton keys but when I leave offerings at Crossroads I don't want to leave my cool old antique skeleton key exactly so yeah you don't want to leave those anywhere plus you know litter that's not so great purple and black candles is what I use for hiate on my altar are there any incenses that you like for hkat yeah like like a cedar that could be a me thing but Cedar based stuff I like for her really kind of musty smell and I don't know maybe it's because I sometimes see her as that witch in the woods kind of persona but musty type smells like Oak Sage Cedar I burn a lot of wood type stuff I also like the the resin type incenses for her too like the copal and dragon's blood in resin form form is really nice they're very smoky smoky incense make me think of her and her colors red black and white your traditional goddess Maiden mother Crone type colors triple goddess colors yeah a torch is also candles are great to represent her as well dog hair I found is a good offering for her where do you freaking get dog hair that is one of one offering that you can leave at the crossroads for her and if you no but I'm saying where do you obtain that if you have dog I don't then you would not make that offering well hak and I we have an understanding with the cats we're good and you can also a couple things I've seen mentioned that I really liked to um show Devotion to hkat another good offering is an act of service if you go to a shelter and help with the dogs there walk a dog don't have to Foster them or anything but if you can help at a dog shelter or go to a cemetery and clean up the cemetery uh she is is a goddess of guiding the dead and so doing that can be an active Service as well or helping a friend because remember the whole ride or die ride or die and I one of the things you know I didn't think about it at the at the time but now that you mention it I have been helping a friend for the last day or two so I've been channeling my hkat energy we had a couple technical issues this week and Leila was off the hook and I channeled and her back on track you did you gave me the tough love to keep going actually you have been it's been a week and you have been absolutely wonderful so thank you for being and I'm usually the crazy one it's been a crazy week but it's been a lot of fun too but I think the the last thing I want to say before we end for today is if she works for you it will be the best experience ever but if you don't jive with hiate don't worry just because it everybody else is talking about her be like I was 25 years ago be different don't listen to people's and connect with who you connect with and if it's her great and if it's someone else great don't let other people's sway you and if you want to worship with her just for one ritual or one spell because she is the queen of Witchcraft that's fine too you don't have to dedicate yourself to her for a year or a lifetime you could just work with her for one ritual or one spell almost like a test drive or maybe her energy is exactly what you need for that particular ritual that's okay too like like speed dating hey hkat you want to do a ritual see if you know we got a connection you're in such trouble I can't believe I just equated working with hiate to speed dating she's going to whoop my ass tonight I know it better go make some offerings so
