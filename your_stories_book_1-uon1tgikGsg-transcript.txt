boards that we're involved with to send us in stories to let us know what ghost stories what creepy things have you experienced what are your personal true experiences because we've shared a couple of ours and we've shared some things that we found and we were you know just we know there's more stories out there and man you guys did not disappoint from stoners to witches to everyone who's experienced creepy things I was surprised you know I'll be honest with you I thought we were going to put this call out for for people telling us their stories and we'd get like one person right and it would probably be someone who's related to us oh yeah I fully expected your kids maybe my brother somebody to send something in right right and I was like well you know we'll see how this goes and then the responses we got I was blown away and Not only was I Blown Away by the amount of responses we got but I'm like there are some other spooky funky ass people out there and I love it yeah I love it our people our tribe we we found our we found our Stony people you know witchy witchy and witchy friendly people people who love paranormal yeah yeah and I everyone was so nice they're so blown away and if we don't get to your story we had to I'm so sorry but we have limited time we could not anywhere near get everyone's stories but we're going to get to a handful each of some of the best ones now I I did try to separate these as best I could you know Shell's got a handful that she loves I've got a hand that I love and we've tried not to read each other's stories too much so we can we can kind of spook each other out here and you know never fear this isn't going to be our only listener Stories episode I'm sure so if we if we didn't get to yours today there will be other listener episodes I can see it coming I foretell this this is a a sure thing it is a shell prediction you heard it here first yeah judging by the response that we got we we will definitely have to do this again and besides who doesn't love it this is I get to kick back and do dabs and just kind of read some fun ghost stories I didn't have to do any work right right how fun is that yeah just let our our listeners have all the experience and do all the work like I said some great stories I just I love that this stuff doesn't only happen to us that we're not the only ones interested in this stuff and that we're not the only ones that may in a fit of stupidity provoke things to happen to get experiences ah yes the fits of stupidity that does sound how a lot of our things have started hey Shell hold my bowl right and then off we go and we're in big trouble before we know it right I am going to light up some of this I've got some gelato shatter that I got from the gas station delivery place this is some of their house shatter I just laughed that it's a gas station a gas station really and I don't know why TGs I mean that's not very original name the gas station great group of people though super nice love them always willing to suggest things and if they're out of something they they've always got something in stock and more than more than willing to make up for it you know just great people love them but it's not an actual gas station not an actual gas station you know the gas that they have is like the super kind green that they've got they've definitely got that kind of gas I'm thinking like gas pump pull your car up fill the gas tank go in get a soda get a lottery ticket get a joint wouldn't that be nice pardon my torch sounds over here I'm heating up my dab R so I'm GNA do some dabs whilea we tell grow stories today what are you smoking today shell um I'm actually smoking the sweets got that a little bit ago starting to wrap up that batch and we'll be moving on to something else but today I'm I'm finishing up the sweets very good love it that was another high THC concentration wasn't it correct correct um that's generally what I go for let's be realistic um I would have to say I have a tendency to do that as well I think a lot of people you know especially old heads tend to do that you know we we want the most bang for our buck I think you even said that the other day exactly exactly and I know it gets into a little bit too much but sometimes I have had the really high THC concentrates that don't hit as hard or as good as lower THC and from what I understand I know it gets back to Tarpin and I don't know I just I'm glad with the science I want more science behind it because don't we all just want the best stuff that we can get we do but do we need to have a degree just to get high no and that's that's what I'm hoping for or someone can maybe it can be Quantified better so when you have your bud tender or just have a little card on the weed you know and it says like have you ever gone to like farmers market or something and they have the little cards and it says this tomato has a sweeter taste with a sharp aftertaste or something I don't know and describes it kind of in detail I'd like that with with a little bit better descriptions of the pot like don't just trust that this white widow is going to be the same as another white widow I I want to know what what are the feelings behind it like did it help with pain did it help with anxiety did it did it get you as high as it as that 32% THC would suggest that it should you know we kind of want to know these things and you don't always know it you kind of have to rely on Word of Mouth and it's it's h i don't know we are just it I laugh I laugh because we are just like the exact opposite in this like I'm just like am I melting in the couch or am I functional that's all I want to know that's all I want to know and like you're very scientific about it and very intelligent in the ways of weed I just want to be high is there anything wrong with that no nothing at all wrong with that nothing at all I guess what I'm saying more is that sometimes that 32% THC isn't going to get you as high as the 20% THC and I think I I just want better descriptions that's all it should just be every time you go to the store because your guy can't do this if you're if you're just talking to your guy um your your neighborhood fella he's not going to know but like when you go to the store on a scale of one to 10 okay where we at are we is today's batch of five or is today's batch of 10 right you would always ask your person you know what is it is it is it Hydro because that was the thing back in the day is it fire is it Hydro is it dank is it gas is it brick right brick weed is it brick is it fire or is it swag is it kind or is it bad and you just kind of have to rely on Word of Mouth and I think you still do I don't know I I guess I haven't had very good luck with descriptions or with Bud tenders and you've had very good luck with Bud tenders you know I I still and and I will say this till the end of time the bud Tenders in Eastern Massachusetts I don't care what store because it it's it's every store spot on man spot on and you can tell that these people are really deep Stoners too oh I love that they're not just getting fed you know a a script before each shift these people are like yeah man I smoked this last night and blah blah blah BL blah basically I think the general rule is they're not allowed to smoke on the clock and why not I mean come on I mean obviously in a pinch if I had to go to the place that doesn't give a [ __ ] about me I'm going there you know you do what you got to do hey you buy brick weed when brick weed's all that's available but I do have places I kind of have like a a rating on where I go my favorite place is probably the furthest away it's 20 minute ride up in Gloucester and then my second favorite is one of the here one of the ones here in Salem so you know I prefer to go to the other one but if I can't make it I have a close backup that I like there's always a backup a good stoner always has like a couple plugs they know of right right right and then you know so you got your in a pinch but then you also have the places of hey you know I'm going to go on a road trip here and if I go to this town I could stop at this place and check it out and see what they got we did that once and I found this this I don't what am I calling it tarpine a turpine tpen a flavor a different a new one a new one what am I calling that a turpine a tpin are the little chemicals that are in in that they're the ones that make up the the flavors and the Aromas sometimes the effects of the Cannabis that you have and they're usually an e of some sort like a pine or lemine that type of thing well this stuff I found on a road trip was called kitchen sink let me tell you it it it was everything but the kitchen sink and I've not been able to find it wa was it in flower form or was it in yeah flower nice yeah I pretty yeah yeah I pretty much generally stick with flower form but I have that was the only time I seen it and I haven't seen it again kitchen sink it might have been one something that they maybe they bred or maybe they just they exclusively grew I don't know well because we just went on a random road trip um and picked that up in a different town I don't necessarily remember what town we had gone to or what store we had gotten it from so it's yeah I haven't been able to track that down since but you know that sounds almost like the type of name that I sometimes when especially when I was maybe growing um a little more undercover shall we say I've always been legal just for you know just so everyone knows I've always grown legally absolutely 100% always grown legally but maybe there might have been a time when I grew undercover undercover but legally sure yeah let's go with that undercover but legal let's let's go with that all right yeah so during that time period s if I didn't have access to seeds you know there there wasn't always the access to seeds that you have now I can think of 10 different seed places I could go get seeds from of varying quality and sometimes you had to kind of rely on a friend of a friend or what you got in the bottom of a bag yep I have grown bag seat I've grown bag seat I've actually had pretty good success with some Bag seed damn I've gotten some fire some really good [ __ ] out to get bag seed but who the hell knows what that is I mean most of the time the weed we smoked didn't have a name nobody knew the name of the pot that we were smoking it was you didn't know it had a name you didn't know it had yeah this didn't have a name it was called weed it was called weed it was some varying form of you know you got you got what you got you get what you get you don't get upset you just you smoked it yeah and so I would grow it and my only goal was to try and grow the bag seed better than the bag it came from and I was usually pretty successful in that but I would just give it a name kitchen sink sounds like something I might name a you know I've got all these seeds in a jar like my friend shell and I'm just growing them I don't know what any of them are it's a kitchen sink who knows that's probably what you got never find it again sad right right right ah the sadness that is mystery bag seed you'll never again know what it is yeah yeah back in the day when I used to smoke them seeds well yeah oh Lord so I don't know so we did cut talking about pot um that's what happens when you smoke too much pot you forget even when you're talking about pot you're just like for now I'm high and I don't know where I am I do know that we're going to be telling some submitted stories and I'm pretty excited I was like I couldn't believe that people like I thought they were all good yeah right I thought we were just going to get yeah I saw a ghost when I was 12 I was scared right no these are good like these these people like sat down and like wrote a story I was impressed all right so we're gonna start with some stories I've got my bong my little cute bong packed did we say what you I love these chillums I don't I don't know what my Fascination is you do love a Chillum they're just the right size right yeah yeah it's like it's like a one hitter that has like half a gram in it so it's more than a one hitter that's a shell one hitter that's a shell one yeah for real but anyway so yeah chill them smoking got a story this one everybody you know witchcraft H you always got to be playing I think a lot of people go through a period where where they want to kind of experience with experiment with everything that sounds exotic and you know you get on the the witch talk and you get on you find all these these little witchy things and I think everyone goes through a time period where they want to try it and then all your friends are doing it all your friends are doing it every generation either has a movie or a TV show oh my gosh yes if your friends are all drawing down the moon are you going to do it too shell well yeah duh so this is from a listener uh and if I'm saying your names wrong it is me it is not you please don't take offense send an email put in the subject line shell said it wrong and and I'll correct her don't worry it it it's the weed it's not you so I believe this listener's username is Jano alons alons e that sounds about right okay gono let's go with that okay we'll go with that Jano hi Jano hey Gano uh first of all thanks for the story we're gonna tell it yeah um so when when they were around 15 um they thought it'd be cool to M around with witchcraft everybody does oh yeah 15 everyone does I think well you know apparently Jano had some friends that that brought this person into the more dark uh desecration of religious emsy kind of Witchcraft oh not like the good witchcraft we're talking about uh the Witchcraft that's more just like anti-christianity is that what you're saying yeah like I don't they didn't necessarily say that it was like a Christian religious item just desecration of a religious item that we could probably assume was Christian in nature anyway anywh who anywh who so you know like every 15-year-old would you're like oh yeah I'm G to go out and I'm gonna do this up with my friends on a Saturday night and then and then we're done and I'm gonna go home and off I go to school on Monday no harm no foul well yeah no um so so Jano unfortunately found out that they set off a chain of events that as self-described created the worst year of that person's life oh yeah that's what happens when you [ __ ] around with witchcraft I guess so small things started uh Shadow People trouble sleeping got a little worse to the point we not sleeping at all Shadow People every night blankets being pulled off oh my God Jano you had no blankets on that would have getting your blankets pulled off you know that we've talked before blankets are your safe space and if Spirits are pulling your blankets off that seems pretty serious and pulling it their legs as they slept I would have peed the bed no o Dro if you did not pee the bed Kudos because I think I would have and uh Dro described it by saying quote think Paranormal Activity bad oh my goodness so they were going through like a Paranormal Activity kind of thing I guess so I guess good got to the point where where they could only sleep if they had like loud music and and something covering their eyes because the activity was just so ongoing and constant oh wow like imagine that I cannot imagine having to in order to sleep you have to have loud music and like a blind and like a sleep mask on because the the Paranormal stuff going on in your room is so bad apparently got to the point where no one in the family would even go into the room Dono described the room as a black hole of Oppression holy [ __ ] holy crap I don't know how how how how old Jano was but like if I was old enough to maybe relocate I probably would have at that point if you're old enough to say the words black hole of Oppression I think you're old enough to articulate hey we need to get the [ __ ] out of here so you know I I I figure if if this all started at 15 probably at 16 is when this activity might have been happening at 16 poor kid I like Mom Dad we got a right my goodness got get out yeah but who really has the ability other than the people in the AMD horror house like who has the ability to like move in be like oh yeah by the way it's haunted let's get the [ __ ] out not everybody has that like Financial solvability well it got worse apparently they thought they could get rid of it on their own never a good idea like you said you know calling the big dogs at this point um but no no gono tried to handle it but it intensified um started affecting other people in the family other people in the family were not able to sleep at night oh wow so it kind of spilled over to everywhere yeah yeah um gerano woke up to the violently shaking bed towards towards the end of these experiences actually got to the point where he kind of just gave up and laid there um heard some growling um had tried to get out of the bed and was shoved back into the bed and in and and feeling like laying there on the floor for hours like it's it almost sounds like being attacked in bed by a dog that wasn't even there yeah it sounds like some sort of poltergeist with the growling and the bed shaking and all and being centered on a teenager it sounds very much like some sort of poltergeist activity maybe exacerbated by their their entrance into witchcraft earlier but I think where I would like even [ __ ] myself even more was there came a point where Drano kind of gave up not gave up but like just like got too tired to fight anymore and just kind of laid in the bed as it was shaking whatever it was grabbed Jano by both feet and literally dragged him out of bed wow holy holy crap when Dro tried to get off the floor and tried to get back into bed was shoved back down I'd be [ __ ] in wow like being attacked by an entity like how do you not at that point wonder if it's just a dream and that that's not really happening like I'm not saying that I don't believe it I'm just saying I would be so freaked out that I would be having such a hard time wrapping my head around what was happening to me at that moment oh ex I be [ __ ] myself I think I'd be able to maybe explain away blankets and the bed shaking I mean I live in California Bed shaking is not an unusual occurrence but growling being pushed to the floor um being dragged out of bed by your legs yeah this sounds like you know when you're being that physically attacked it's kind of hard to at that point think that it might be a dream that's that's pretty that's pretty rough to explain away and H and being like a 15 16 year old kid yeah how do you tells that to someone who the hell believes you well they did say that people other people in the house had started to experience things so maybe if they talk about it you know everyone if everyone in the house can kind of compared stories did they do that what happened next oh my gosh poor kid I mean like I don't know how many years ago this was or what year this happened in but like this isn't something you just go to school and be like hey friend how was your night last night let me tell you what happened to me I don't know I did have friends that told me ghost stories when I was when I was in Middle School and High School this is the kind of stuff that that that like the next day you kind of wonder if you just went a little cuckoo oh absolutely I'd start to wonder myself that's just such an experience so anyway I guess after that particular event activities started to slow down um just happened every once in a while because remember this would have been when when they were like 15 16 so everything slowed down so then maybe when they got a little older it slowed down or maybe that that violent Act was like the cmin and it it started to get better well that that violent Act was the culmination then it cut down and then the story cuts to when jono was 23 oh boy oh boy so it like went dormant for a little while right jono was living on living on their own and had had to move back to their parents house preach it never fun never fun there we have both been there's done it happens thank all the gods for par and people who take care of us that can take us back in thank you we don't love it don't want to have to do it but oh my goodness thank you well apparently um the parents it was not an empty house per se but an empty house the parents bought another house but never had sold it let Jano go live there oh that's even better wow nice yeah score jono Jano gets roommate which you know hey now is this the house that Dono had grown up in where the stuff had happened correct okay okay so back to the scene of the Paranormal crime correct all right back to the scene but now older wiser parents have moved out have a different house and now now Jano is living there with a roommate a nonf family member I would assume so two days after they moved in roommate started begging to sleep in the living room oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] because there was so much so much activity in that room that it scared her and she didn't want to sleep alone anymore uhuh uhuh yep so it begins so basically Jano the moral of the story is and I'm goingon to continue your story but you did some stupid [ __ ] as a teenager that drove your family to sell the house or move out of the house and they couldn't sell it because the activity so they owned it and made you move back into it is torture oh you're blaming it all on poor gono blaming it on jono this is from a parent who is into witchcraft who has had children dabble with witchcraft and I've come home from a weekend away and my children had Unleashed holy hell in my house and I'm like why do you touch stuff that doesn't belong to you yeah that sounds like a 90s movie right there yeah which Mama comes home there's ghosts everywhere gotta start call in the coven gotta fix this it's like the ending of um Practical Magic when they get all the towns women together to form the coven and they help kind of sh up kind of had to do that after that weekend it was more like when the ants had to come home and help clean up the mess but so anyway roommate Dono same type of stuff the Shadow People the noises the shaking bed getting pulled on I guess the last straw for them is that they were in the living room um heard a radio in the bedroom at the end of the hall turn on like no one would sleep in it that room I guess they just they just Unleashed some holy hell yeah they Unleashed something and for whatever reason it you know went dormant when jono got a little older but then when they came back in maybe going back into the empty house kind of stirred it back up or maybe the nonam member or something or maybe just jonal themselves being back in that house well I guess hi Kitty hi kitty kitty kitty oh big fluffy orange kitty he's headed to the window but I guess the last the last straw for gono I oh what pretty kitty he's bathing former Foster now total love of Chuck's life permanent resident permanent resident he and my husband are best friends he adores adores Chuck so much oh my God anyway back to Jano so jono last straw I guess in the back room there was a radio that turned on by itself by itself creepy creepy creepy creepy I love how like ghosties seem to always like manipulating electricity seems to be something like a little bit easier than maybe manipulating objects you know lights on and off radios on and off that kind of thing I don't know just a thing go ahead sorry Dono and a roommate decided to go down the hall together and turn it off Smart Smart Stay Together Stay Together smart correct right it well once you've reached this point don't be alone that's one right thing right yeah so they go down the hall they turn off the radio they go back to the living room few minutes later son of a [ __ ] comes back on no they go back down the hallway and not only do they turn it off but they unplug it okay okay go back to the living room because I guess at this point they're so freaked out they decide to like you know camp out in the living room nobody story sounding very I have a very similar story I'm not going to tell it today but gono I feel you so they unplug it go back to the living room they decide to sleep in the living room for the night radio comes back on again no no the unplugged radio again jono right there right there so they decide not to get up because they knew they unplugged it so jono yells yeah yeah no that's too much I no listen how funny this is J I think it's funny if I was Jano i' would be [ __ ] myself I would have [ __ ] myself eight times over by now I know so brave going back so brave hollers down the hallway and asks whatever it was that was messing with them to turn the radio off and then there was instant silence there you go when they checked the next morning the radio was still unplugged nice nice see sometimes you have to be forceful with them and tell them kind of like that cowboy ghost in um the Estes um The Shining hotel was that called The Overlook Hotel whatever it was called honestly I'm too high The Shining hotel where the the ghost the cowboy ghost in that one room the couple said would you please stop and he did you know but that's something that in a spell or in a ritual that is a major component is to tell them to [ __ ] off you know tell them to stop be forceful tell them to get out sometimes you have to tell them well that was kind of the straw that that that broke the camels back um Jano and the roommate decided after that it was time to move out they left don't live there anymore says blame them one bit says the place is still haunted to this day and has a very dark feeling as soon as you go to the door now Jano does your family still own this house I want to know a b um is it something that I could go stay at because I'm so intrigued I'm so intrigued sh would like to Airbnb your haunted house just let us know so the moral of the story is don't unleash things unless you can put them back that's right put your toys away when you're done with them yeah so yeah probably the house has still got something in it I would imagine if your family still owns it my recommendation is to get like a psychic medium or a Catholic priest pick your pick your favorite flavor of uh banishment and do one yeah or the other alternative is get that [ __ ] listed on Airbnb Pronto right as a haunted location those seem to be getting more and more popular I see those all the time but jono thank you we appreciate you first listening and second sending in your story yeah great story very good so creepy and we we hope that that you have no more experiences with whatever [ __ ] storm you opened up ah oh my goodness yes I hope things are much better where you're living now Tano and I hope your roommate didn't bring anything with them either so I have a story this one was submitted by a someone who's going by Brando Sapien and Brando Sapien story goes like this this story as crazy as it sounds is 100% true it was 2015 and myself and a friend of mine were driving around late one night just sticking around you know as one does we know that we've done that we have done that usually ours involves a joint or something but yeah so we were what did we call those bull rides yeah we were discussing how cool it would be to do a ghost hunt hey hey Brando were you riding around with us in 2015 was Brando in the back of that van I think so that van with like Tom and Mel and yeah so we must have been the one that was camping on the bowl for a while there you go Brando pass it on the left man so Brando says we were discussing how cool it would be to do a ghost hunt or spend the night in a haunted place Rando we feel you man while driving I remembered that a fatal train wreck had happened in the earliest 20th century near where we were in McDonna Georgia claiming the lives of 35 people oof that's quite the train wreck my friend pointed out that there was a road coming up that used to cross the tracks but had since been mostly torn up the idea of driving down a torn up Road near the sight of a deadly accident gave us both kind of a thrill we would do the same thing oh yeah we'd be there as I turned onto this road I remember looking down the partial Road and getting a slight chill at the unnerving environment since we are surrounded by trees on a deadend road at night oh yeah this is perfect this sounds like a really fun place this is absolutely where shell would want to go on a bowl ride the screams let's pack a bowl and go see what we can find it'll scare us mhm yep so he says this is where it gets weird all I remember is turning onto the road and driving back towards the main road but when we got to the stop sign my friend was looking at me with wide eyes and a freaked out expression I paused and asked him what was wrong he responded by asking me the same thing after telling him that I was fine he said then why did you freak the [ __ ] out when we got to the end of the road I was noticeably confused because I had no memory at all of doing that he told me that when we got to where the pavement ended I started repeating we got to get out of here we got to get out of here then I spun the car around and hauled ass away from there at that point I was just as freaked out as he was needless to say the thrill of going to a potentially haunted place was gone so they went down there and dude has no memory of gets to a certain point and dude blacks out and just freaks out and his friend sees him freak out but he has no memory of it whatsoever the first thing I would do is go back down to the end of the road would you though I'm like a glutton for punishment but he never told his friend what what was making him say it he didn't even know he didn't know he was blacked out he doesn't remember any of it all he remembers is heading down that road and then the next thing he remembers is he's stopping at the stop sign like coming back out that's so weird and he doesn't remember any of it and according to his friend he like freaked out saying we got to get out of here once they got to like a certain point so then he says fast forward to early 2021 my friend has been a County police officer for about four years now he texted me a few months ago saying he had something crazy to tell me I called him asking what this crazy story was he said another officer told him about some human remains that had been found in MCD when asked where the other officer said that they were found right off that same road we had had gone down almost 6 years ago hearing that was the most surreal thing I've ever experienced and it forced me to wonder if I had been possessed or something that night that's the single weirdest thing that's ever happened to me whoa so they actually found bones there they found a body in that spot where he had kind of blacked out and freaked out oh my god wow oh I have chills oh my gosh I have chills Rando oh wow I wonder his cop friend ever went back there feeling like more a little I can handle this now because I'm a cop I cannot but can you imagine you know your cop friends like hey we found bones in XYZ spot and you're like wait a minute you found them where so we do Brando I'm afraid for you thanks for your submission Brando great story really appreciate it we got another one for us sh I do um this one is H from a Reddit user I going to probably butcher the name woit 1990 woit woo it wow it woit says well I don't have a giant ghost story I have a bunch of small ones I was a paramedic for a while and lived a block and a half away from a pair of late 1800s cemeteries in Western suburban Chicago so woit 1990 says my sister and I were home alone One Summer Night windows open with two dogs that had had hair trigger we had one of those large blue garbage cans with the arm grabs and tilts like the 30 lb cans each you know 30 pound you know like the the garbage man garbage garage like the ones like in GTA can I tell you just I'm sorry the garbage cans are making me I'm stoned um so when I came out to California one of the things that really made me laugh is I I'm a gamer I like playing games and I played some GTA in GTA there's all the houses have these um certain type of garbage and recycling and yard waste cans and they're exactly like the garbage cans I have here and I have a GTA moment every time I put my my garbage cans out so anyway okay so garbage cans so they have they have a garbage can no you're killing me stone side so so poor poor W it 1990 is stuck living like a half a block away from these cemeteries so he's got these garbage cans about 15 feet away the window windows open you know nice summer night the sister also hears these two loud bangs about 5 Seconds Apart which would maybe lead you to believe that someone's doing it as opposed to like maybe the wind knocked him over you know like bang bang right right yeah if it's that rhythmic you'd think maybe a person's doing it didn't hear anything else no running no jumping uh on the fence nothing they ran outside and both cans were thrown about 30 feet what like was it windy no no whoa whoa was and there was no one around no weird that would freak me out that's kind of that's weird oh another kitty hi Kitty Kitty oh black and white fluffy kitty that's Minnie Hi Minnie today is Kitty day at Shell's house it is we've got Minnie and Jack it's definitely Kitty day that's because it's warm today and the windows are open so they keep going from window to window a hi kitties sorry go ahead thankfully they uh uh they they aren't uh following ghosts or or any strange paranormal Things cats in their like weird ghost senses so w being a being a paramedic was unfortunately uh one day transporting a woman who was dying oh that's got to be a hard part of the job I'm sorry W she had a DNR which has also got to be frustrating because even if you thought you could do and you really can't right um so so the lady the lady they were transporting had a DNR and was unconscious so there wasn't much they could do but drive while it was in the back uh with her and saw her when her heart rhythm had indicated that she had passed away all hail the traveler well it says that there was almost an immediate swirling Breeze in the back of the ambulance not like papers flying around but you could feel it for sure what it was not Breezy in the back what they had no windows open in the ambulance in a closed ambulance like a there was a there was like a breeze swirling around no [ __ ] way all I can think of this is how I'm visualizing this currently you got this body laying on a gurnie in the back of an ambulance and almost like a tornado swirling out from the body up like a dust devil oh wow oh wow that's that's how I'm visualizing this like her soul leaving her body basically the swirl of a soul as it leaves her body oh my goodness right right and and and witnessing that has got to be sad yet interesting one of those experiences that you don't know to whether to be intrigued or heartbroken a little bit of both I think so so those were those were w at 1990s um two experiences well thank you for being an EMT w that's kudos to to wo it 1990 for for all that you do is be at a paramedic because unfortunately um You probably sadly see a lot of people pass and and have a lot of those types of experiences and you know as as much as that can be interesting it's it's heartbreaking at the same time especially when you're doing it on the reg so shout out to you for being a paramedic very much so thank you yeah all right so what kind of candy are you eating I eating you know you know how they put out candy for the next holiday like eight years advance so Easter Candy's out so I am eating Almond Joy eggs oh yummy yeah um I I know that the the world is very torn on coconut it's pretty much a split divide I am on the pro coconut side love coconut also Pro coconut yeah same love coconut Almond Joy with nuts or without yeah yeah but I love when my children get candy well they're adults now but even still they give it to me now but but I I always was guaranteed all the coconut candy loved it so what is your spooky what is your spooky next story our listener story I got to put down this Cherry headband bong I'm smoking because it's so tasty I can't it's really good excuse me my next story is from Shelby and Shelby writes I'm Shelby and this is my spooky story so thank you for sharing your story Shelby she says I was really ill as a kid so just to put that out there before I get too far into my story Milo I might need to let my cat out if he doesn't stop being a jerk I was really ill as a kid so just to put that out there before I get too far into my story so hold on to that and see if that makes a difference at the end of it here it was summer and I was too sick for summer school that year so one day my grandma arranged for me to go to my friend's house across the street the next afternoon and I was to stay at her house the night before so that I didn't have to spend that all day by myself at my own house or to have my mom drive me in the morning it was the year 2000 something and I had a great night with my grandma a nice so I had a great night with my grandma we played cards and talked and did beads and embroidery all night that sounds like a great night with your grandma I mean really it does it does then we went to bed like any other night we had a sleepover I would stay with her during the weekends but sometimes like this particular night she had to leave for work the next morning I was a big girl and was ready to have a half day alone so anyway I got up and had breakfast that morning with my grandmother before she went to work at 6:00 a.m. she told me to have a good day and to not get into trouble like she did every other time we parted ways I told her to do the same and then she said she would call and wake me up later in case I fell asleep it was a little early when she left so I took a nap on her couch thinking if I went back to bed I'd sleep all day and not make it to my friend's house in time for a lunch a while after falling asleep or so I thought I felt my blanket fall off me and it was cold so cold that I shot up thinking something was wrong realizing a few seconds later just where I was yeah so they had their blankets pulled off me what is it with ghost pulling blankets off people cves ghosty perves perves or maybe they're just like we want everyone else to be cold too or maybe they know the power of the protection of the blanket and so they're trying to like preemptively take your protection away from you I bet that's it I don't know if I was a ghost I'd probably be a little pervy on occasion at least at least on occasion yes so I felt my blanket fall off me and it was cold so cold that I shot up thinking something was wrong realizing a few seconds later just where I was the world slowed and about halfway through sitting the rest of the way up a wave of nausea and Bone deep chills hit me as fast as they would fade I saw some movement across the room and quickly went to put my glasses on to see who was home excited that it might be my grandpa home from driving truck I fumbled a bit I found my glasses put them on and then realized it's still dark outside weird yeah I look around all the lights are on in the living room where I was sleeping and the ones in my grandma and grandpa's room down the hall were on as well I don't remember turning them on except for the one next to the couch oh wow I then think for sure papa is home and call out for him as I walk towards the bedroom no answer not a problem he has a hard time hearing from driving truck I take another step and the chills and nausea waves rush over me once more oh geez I notice a dial tone coming from the phone in the bedroom oh God suddenly sick to my stomach this is sounding really creepy suddenly sick to my stomach I take a hard left before the bedroom into the bathroom like an instinct right before throwing up barely making it to the toilet before vomit erupts out of me like a science experiment gone Rogue oh good writing there that's very graphic very graphic right oh my gosh like the dial tone from the phone is what really really creeps me out does that that doesn't happen yeah yeah no wow uh a minute later the nausea spikes and drops as the heat returns to the room following a figure as it crosses past the open bathroom door with me kneeling in front of the toilet I'm peering out the corner of my eye pretending I didn't see a thing that's what I would totally do increas Le tensing up when it passes fully I Collapse and sit down waiting for the nausea to pass before venturing out of my current known safe safe Zone before venturing out of my current known safe Zone Bang I hear the door close and the dial tone go from a buzz in a distant room to being so loud that my little self was willed to go and hang it back up no matter what was going on oh my god wow wow right so the dial Tone's getting louder I leave the bathroom and go into the bedroom where the blankets on my grandmother's side of the bed were folded open almost too perfectly for it to for it to have been done by her and to top the covers the phone lay with the line open the hairs on my back stood up as I grabbed the phone to hang it up I'm now too scared to be in by myself in the house and with the Sun finally coming up I'm thinking it's only 7:30 or so I leave the house and sat outside until my grandmother called later on around 9 to wake me up oh [ __ ] right oh my gosh I would totally sit outside that's freaking creepy I'd leave it sounds like she did she sat on the steps outside no i' like leave the property like go to the friend's house early be like hey I know I'm early for lunch but I'm here now I pretended to be just waking up and her not realizing I was sitting outside grasping the garage phone in my hand increasingly tightly for the last hour and a half oh my God can you imagine that poor terrified kid just holding the phone tightly waiting oh my gosh that my heart breaks that must have been so scary I can't recall ever telling anyone besides a school friend once about this let alone my grandmother for fear that she might not feel safe at home alone without us during the week a what a caring kid that's so kind but yeah so [ __ ] up because what if the ghost was going after your grandma like would want you warn her I know you don't want to scare her but like the heads up would have been nice just saying you know maybe maybe that you know it never happened again or something I don't know oh my gosh who knows oh my goodness that's kind of creepy so she says that um I can't recall ever telling anyone besides a school friend once about this let alone my grandmother oh yeah I said that I will never know if it was a home Invader or just bill the nextd door neighbor coming to grab something and I startled him so he just left without a word you'd think if it was the neighbor they would have said something I'm going with ghosty I'm not going with neighbor it may have been the mind of an anemic child riding the line of life and death or a ghost I'm going with ghost I would flatl oh my God I would Flatline a week or so later oh [ __ ] at the hospital from blood loss due to my illness oh my gosh oh my God who knows the reaper may have had his schedule off and come for me on the wrong day so he just let himself back out the way he came holy [ __ ] this took a dark turn what the [ __ ] where did the reaper come from well obviously they were Wast thicker than we realized because if they flatlined and almost died a week later maybe it was the Grim Reaper coming and was like oh wait got the wrong day got to come a week later oh [ __ ] wrong appointment time I was thinking somebody else who Among Us hasn't shown up a little early for an appointment time really or maybe it was something that was trying to hold off the reaper oh maybe or maybe it was something that was trying to warn her it maybe it was more of a protective ghost oh my god oh now I have chills again oh my good you know what I'm saying somebody being like Oh my god look out what's with the dial tone what was what was with the phone like was someone trying to contact her were they trying to tell her something here's the thing that's where I'm going with that thought you know maybe it was a a a an old family member trying to come warn her the spirit of an ancestor the spirit of a past loved one and maybe um you know ghosts work in weird ways and maybe they were trying get the message through on the phone or maybe the neighbor was trying to call some of those like 1 1900 numbers using his uh nextore neighbor's phone and got caught and took off yeah but why would the dial tone get bigger and longer and louder and the waves of nausea I don't know no idea no I'm I'm wondering if maybe it maybe it was like a a a message that someone was trying to say look shit's about to get real in your health related life maybe maybe oh wow messages from Beyond or the Grim Reaper Miss Missing an appointment nobody ever wants the Grim Reaper to show up early we would all like the Grim Reaper to be as late as possible thank you you know and we've mentioned this before I think on a couple different podcasts but Shelby didn't tell anyone about it you know I mean these people are telling us because we ask and that's you know that's a little different but a lot of these people don't go around bragging to everyone you know they'll tell people in a safe space like you know a forum on the Internet or or us a podcast who is interested in this type this a Thanksgiving dinner combo right they're not they're not out there like telling everyone they meet these stories you know they kind of keep them a little close to the vest until they feel comfortable telling them so that's that's pretty interesting thank you for your story thank you thank you Shelby for your story and by the way I am I am glad that you were able to fight off the reaper and are still here to tell your tale oh man yeah anytime you're able to escape the reap that's a victory and it sounds like you did it twice Kudos right I'm doing another dab so pardon me while you set up your story this next listener story and let me tell you I am so glad I got this story I feel bad for the guy kind of a crazy experience but this guy had me laughing oh a funny story I love those I I I wasn't laughing at his experience I was really laughing more at how he told it so his first line he he caught me at word one okay this this guy had me roped in at word one he writes for the record I am not a witch but I am married to one lucky you and I smoke enough weed killer Rhino yes yes yes wow married to a witch and a pot smoker quality guy quality guy that sounds like something I would say like I'm the I would actually say something like yeah I smoke enough wead to kill AO right we both definitely fall into that category of of probably smoking more than our fair share is how I would put it so like this dude is already like my long lost best friend okay welcome to the fold best friend welcome welcome welcome to the fold our Anonymous best friend your wife too please bring the Witchy Woman along bring the wife bring the wife we will we will do we will do witchy stuff with her and and smoke like rhinos with you um this lovely Anonymous Couple live in San Antonio Texas so he says my experience centers around a friend of mine and his brother my friend R was a mechanic at his parents shop at the end of his street he lived in a small guest house next to his parents house and ran their business and took care of them as they were elderly okay nice guy nice guy full well so they're there hanging one day and he says we were smoking while watching TV one day sounds like something you and I would do it does indeed when he heard someone coughing in the back room which was unoccupied and used for storage oh no no no no no no no so he says did you just hear someone coughing and his friend goes yep and he goes who's back there and he goes Nobody are you his friends all nonchalant about some random coughing coming from an empty room yeah we just got some Stoner ghost in the back don't mind him he's smoking his own weed as long as he brings his own [ __ ] so then the friend is just like yeah whatever my house is haunted okay like you just leave it at that friend friend where's your details so our Anonymous our Anonymous guy goes on to say in fact the construction crew that was working on the main house had just walked off job and even left a bunch of their tools because they were scared that's that's pretty scared those tools are not cheap so our Rhino smoking friend here decides he does remodeling work and he's looking to make a quick Buck he'll take over hey why not tools are still there who's afraid of a little ghost well apparently our friend here I still all I can imagine there's this Texan construction guy who just pounds down weed like nobody's business and I love it I love it right I love it so the entire time he worked there he felt like he was being watched and he goes on to say more times than I could count I'd see shadows in the corner of my eye this was all in the main house and I always felt uncomfortable there F your in the guest house even stranger [ __ ] went down for some strange reason between the living room and the kitchen in the wall up to the bedroom there was a window like who put a window in the middle of their house I don't know these people yeah sometimes when you make an addition or something you might leave the window like as a little architectural detail maybe well next to the window was a TV and many times they'd be watching TV and they would see someone peek around the side of the window like what the [ __ ] just like a random ghost or Gremlin or something so like what there's like this friend just invites people over it's like oh just like watch TV pay no pay no mind to the ghost in the window right oh that's just the ghost is spying on us I mean what but he but he but he goes on to say that it would be a really quick Peak and he goes it was unnerving as [ __ ] well yes it is I'm just hearing about it and it's unnerving as [ __ ] and he goes every time it happened my buddy R and I would look at each other so we so I knew it wasn't me just tripping maybe you were both tripping maybe you wish you were both tripping maybe the weed was just that good so then what does this scaredy cat do brings his [Music] wife did he he bring her for confirmation or just to hang out he says this is what he goes on to say my my wife started hanging out there as well they'd watch Spurs games and barbecue o I could go for some barbecue yeah barbecue would be nice smoking weed and barbecuing oh [ __ ] yeah this guy's so smart weed barbecue my God our people our people so the wife sees the face in the window she freaks out now remember yeah did they not warn her did we go back to like this friend just doesn't [ __ ] tell people that there's legit ghosts here well and remember from the beginning of his story his wife is a witch she's not a witch but his wife is a witch right she's a witch going to hang out for some barbecue and Spurs so Anonymous friend I got a confession to make I don't know what the Spurs are I know they're a sports team but I don't know what sport I know it's a probably a Texas sport team but if it isn't hockey I don't know it but whatever Spurs are they were watching the Spurs game and having barbecue so you're gonna bring your wife over she's gonna freak out but so of course is the is the guy you know he found it validating that his wife saw the face that his wife freaked out too oh sorry honey you're a horrible husband here's why he wanted to be validated because um I can understand you don't want to influence her before she shows up you just kind of want to get a natural reaction well no he has a better reason um he found it personally validating because him and his friend are smoke a lot of weed and his wife doesn't smoke so he thought it'd be nice for a sober head to confirm what they were seeing okay I can yeah yeah okay yeah I smoke I also smoke that much weed that sometimes I'm like did that happen or did I smoke too much so yeah so over the next couple of months they'd go there and she would invariably have her hair pulled or be pinched I would be like husband I'm gonna [ __ ] you up for bringing me to this house well yeah it sounds like it escalated with her is it jealous or is it upset like it before it sounds like it was just kind of smoking with them in the back room and kind of peeking around the corner watching what they were watching on TV but now you get the girlfriend or wife rather I'm sorry get the witchy wife show up and she sees this ghost and she's getting pinched and she's getting pinched getting her hair pulled you know that sounds like it's kind of escalated to me and she's not even high enough to be okay with it a lot of you know not all witches but a lot of witches are very sensitive so maybe she was just more sensitive to to was going on and and not blunted by you know an ounce of fine kind bud you know here here him and his friend are are sitting there getting high on the good weed and they're letting this poor girl get her hair pulled and get pinched and she's Stone Cold Sober dude like you owe her dinner like you owe her dinner bottom line oh yeah final straw for our Anonymous friend here that I love is so he's working there decides to be the construction guy he's working one day a alone in the guest house wouldn't you think by now that he wouldn't do that yeah why would you go there alone you know better you know better your wife knows better ask your wife typical man story so he goes on to say I was relaxing on the toilet in the bathroom and the bathroom door opens outward and the house isn't level so if the door isn't closed it will swing open he goes as I was on my knees oh maybe he wasn't pooping maybe he was working oh maybe I I didn't mean to imply you were pooping I'm sorry well you do you have experienced men you know men as he was on his knees bolting the toilet to the floor hey hardworking man as he's on his knees bolting the toilet to the floor the bathroom door violently shut what no wait he said it was because the house was wasn't level it would swing open right and it violently shut wow so that would take some like force that's not something uphill battle Yeah to quote him it scared the living [ __ ] out of me yeah well yeah same same dude he jumped hit his head on the sink and ran out of the bathroom oh [ __ ] oh man don't hurt yourself escaping from the ghost there was no one in the house he rushed out no one so he call [ __ ] he calls his friend R thinking he was [ __ ] with him R was like down the road he was like at a store or something not even nearby not even a practical joke from the friend damn you know what you know what our friend did quit working there that day yeah I think I'd be I'd follow the professionals be like you know what you're gonna have to get someone else to do your repairs Man Too haunted what happened was you know ours Brother Jay I love how he actually like totally wrote this out for us so that we didn't even have to worry about names ours Brother Jay was working at the oil fields at the time because you remember the Texas oil fields so Jay was the first one to tell him that the house was haunted so they were smoking one night probably the good weed and this story came up and he'd asked if he had ever been to three paths and he said that sounds like a place it does and he said that he hadn't so they went he now now our Anonymous friend describes it it's outside the gates of one of the missions and it's super haunted I you know there there's a lot of Spanish missions down there yeah okay um and he says that he's been there many times with many people and they've had W weird [ __ ] happen almost every time while walking on the concrete paths you can hear someone walking in the grass next to you you can see the grass bending over and hear Twigs cracking they saw an orb so bright they thought it was a cops flashlight and started to take out out their license you have now found an or yay yes this story has everything everything not only does he smoke like a rhino but he has orb story yes I love orbs and this one was as bright as a cop's flashlight [ __ ] then he goes on to say another another interesting tidbit his son is a photographer and actually caught a misty looking Apparition on his camera there and he says he mentions this because all this while all this was going on Jay came to town for the weekend he had been working in the oil fields checking pump stations which are 20 to 30 miles away from anything and out of boredom took a selfie to post on a dating website as one does as one does what is with oil riggers like Tinder it wasn't until a girl who replied to him pointed out that he pointed out to him that there was another figure in the picture why what plain as day over his left shoulder and they can only describe it as a grim reaper like figure what's with a grim reaper Reaper again oh my gosh wow you can actually see four skeletal fingers on his shoulder no way oh that's a little much he says he only mentions it because he wasn't sure if it was a familial haunting or if Jay had something follow him home from three paths or if it was just um a ghost in the house so basically he's wondering if this ghost of this Grim reapy thing from the oil fields was brought back to this house maybe holy cow so could Jay have brought this Grim reapy type presence back to the house and it stayed in the house or is it just something that was with the house and it followed Jay or was it just attached to the house you know was it attached to Jay was it attached to the house what what the hell but either way our our our our friend here was was scared shitless now um our our friend did ask he did say at the bottom um that that he would love for us to share his story and if we do to give credit of the story to be evil so be evil this one's for you and I'm gonna smoke like a rhino today in your honor uh this bong's for you Mr B evil thank you so much what a good story love it love it like I was laughing like I'm not laughing at the fact that you were scared I'm just laughing at how you told your story love it so so good you still owe your wife dinner dude nice nice well my next story comes from Braden C and Braden says hey there witches I've got a couple of ghost stories for you if you're interested every one of them experienced by myself and family I'm a 27-year-old man and a witch myself along with my wife hey witches what up witches these stories all happened before College I love how many witches rod in how awesome is that love our witchy friends truly love our witchy friends you know our next full moon we should have like a a little virtual podcast coven of Witches full moon of that or something that would be fun actually that kind of would be fun bradden says these stories all happened before College feel fre to tell them all at once or to spread them across multiple episodes if you'd prefer so we're just going to do one story today bradden this one is called the sleepover o yeah bradden says so when I was a kid around 8 to 10 years old I would occasionally spend the night at my cousin's h house in rural Texas o Texas represented again they and their parents lived in a nice little farmhous where their dad raised horses a you know Texas I think is really haunted apparently it was just outside of my hometown and it was terribly haunted just a quick list of occurrences before I get into my personal story the cabinets in the kitchen would slam open and closed in the night Whispering noises could be heard doors would open on their own you would hear knocking on the front door at night sometimes and according to my cousins and their dad their second oldest would often see a dark figure standing in the hallway that led from his room to his parents ooh so with that said the night I remember most was one of the last nights I spent over there before my cousin's parents decided to make the den a joint a joint a joint room for their boys I my stone ass read that as a joint room and I was like wow I want a joint room I mean I have a joint tin I do like joints so I'm like hey I want a joint room that's not b not what he meant that's not that's not yeah know no wrong kind of joint okay so to make the den a joint room for their boys like like a co- room after a long day of being little tears we were settled into bed the setup of my cousin's rooms were interesting while laying in bed there was a door to the living room on your left a door to the eldest boy's room it was wasn't connected to any other rooms but this one on the right so kind of like those shotgun houses you know you like in order to get to one bedroom you have to go through another bedroom you ever see those in some older houses yeah so it sounds like their bedrooms were like that you go into the one bedroom and then to get into the last bedroom you have to go through the first bedroom so and the hallway to the parents room okay so the doorway is the living room on your left and then a door to the other bedroom on the on the right and a hallway to the parents room straight across from you on the left side of the wall honestly the night was pretty peaceful to start my younger cousin insisted that we watch Care Bear so he could sleep a I love Care Bear I love Care Bears and within minutes we were all snoozing comfortably the horror for me began a few hours later when the VHS stopped with that familiar click that familiar click that happens when a tape ends and the screen reverts to Blue see now we're getting into Poltergeist movie territory oh right doesn't it sound like that a little bit a little bit I've always been a light sleeper me too so it woke me with a start I wanted to go rewind the tape and play it again so the room wasn't filled with that electric ring from the old TV but I found myself rooted in place by a fear was seemingly no origin as the minutes came and went I grew increasingly stressed and tried to wake my cousins this was a desperate move because they were both terrible grumpy monsters when they were woken up but they wouldn't budge oo so he's like filled with this Rising dread and they won't even wake up as my efforts grew more frantic I was stopped dead by this horrible cold feeling of dread like something was standing over me I turned towards the door to my older cousin's room on the right next to the TV and stared for a moment unable to look away holding my breath I didn't know why I was so focused on it and terrified but it became obvious the second that the door knob turned that room wasn't connected to to the rest of the house just this room my heart was racing the door knob clicked signaling it was turned all the way around and the door began to Creek open slowly I'm not ashamed to say I ran leaving my cousins to whatever was going to come out of that door I guess it was empty had it been empty I don't know I don't remember oh yeah everybody was sleeping in that one oh my God so that room was empty it was supposed to be empty holy [ __ ] I would have started freaking out I would started freaking out right oh yeah so I I'm not ashamed to say I ran leaving my cousins to whatever was going to come out of that door he was a little kid that's okay that's okay don't no shame no shame run I bolted at full speed down the hallway the shadowy main hall the shadowman hallway I bolt I bolted at full speed down the hallway the shadowman hallway and that's the one where the kid had seen the shadow man and into their parents room where I promptly screamed and shook their father awake my uncle is a good guy and very protective I'm glad he lied to me that night he told me that it was the house settling on its foundation and that that can open doors and he says in quotes that can open doors but it can't turn door knobs and he took me back to the room I was hysterical terrified of the demonmonster Freddy Krueger on the other side of the door and scared and that scared my younger cousin as well my uncle insisted it was was just the house but he told us he would lay us out blankets and pillows in the living room and he would sleep on the couch so that we felt safe and so that he could get some sleep which is you know more likely he told me when I was around 20 long after they'd moved out of the house that he knew it wasn't the house settling what a dick he had experienced similar events and he was horrified that night what a liar he told me that he needed to keep us calm and he slept in the living room to protect us and probably to keep himself calm probably he kept you he slept you in the living room because he was scared and thought you'd protect his scared ass right and he said also to literally protect them so that if something went wrong he could swoop us up and get us out the front door thanks Uncle I'm glad we had you looking out for us Oh My Lying wow well I guess I now that I think about it I guess I can't blame him for lying to a bunch of little kids right you know they were just like 8 to 10 he said but he did move them to a place where he could get them out of the house quickly if he needed to how freaking creepy you know shit's real when you feel like you could potentially have to actually flee right if if a grown ass adult is like you know I might need to get these kids out here in a in a heartbeat and moves them to a safe location you know that that they're more than a little spooked out wow Braden signs off and says I have more stories to tell and more in detail just let me know if you want to hear more we do

joint tin do you like all my joints nice nice right I'm going to smoke a joint while you tell your next story now this this next story um I keep getting I get these I got another anonymous one I'm getting these Anonymous men here I think sometimes the the the females are a little quicker to admit uh when they've seen stuff than some of our men but that's okay you know I wonder if that's true I wonder if that's true I wonder if uh you know those of us of the female persuasion feel a little more comfortable talking about it we maybe feel a little more in tou with it admitting it you know maybe it's those of the masculine persuasion of whatever flavor you are and maybe they feel they have to tough it out or something or I don't know so so this next listener um Anonymous uh says back in 2007 my wife and I split dude I have been there and I've done that and you know I hope you are a better person at this point she left and he fell into a rut of work and sleep he goes on to say my mother came to visit to check on me prior to her visit there had been odd things happening Silhouettes in the living room window voices in other rooms he mostly laughed it off and kept rolling he go he goes on to say I was working a new job and was focused while my mother visited she commented on hearing voices I didn't want to say anything but eventually curiosity got me and I asked she stated that she would hear a voice calling my name from the closet I [ __ ] wait no no closet no I'm sorry so like appar calling your kid's name from the closet that's when you call it an exorcist or really [ __ ] good witch he's not there his mom's there and his mom hears someone calling his name from the closet okay hell no hell no like the ghost is wondering where he is now I don't know how old of a guy he was obviously he was married and and divorced at this point so he wasn't a kid but he goes I was kind of struck that she wasn't scared or upset and he goes what happened and you know what she said what she said she told him he's not here now shut up and be still what his mom just like casually told off the closet ghost dude's not here shut up and be still and it did it listened to her like did she use that Mom voice he because this seemed to do the trick and there was no more issues for several years no [ __ ] way no [ __ ] way just tell him just do the mom like I said some times you just have to [ __ ] tell him bad ass Mama badass Mama tell them Mama ghost calling out her his kids from the closet she's like he's not here shut up and be still [ __ ] and it listened for years listen so fast forward to 2010 [ __ ] gets a little weirder so in 2010 he goes on to say I had a new girlfriend and we had moved into our second place she complained of children laughing while I was at work I never heard it myself but I figured e and I recommended she get rid of them you know his only experience is as mom told him to shut the [ __ ] up and they did so girlfriend should be able to do the same thing he goes if you hear them and I don't then they are for you send them to their rest wow okay like like he's on the right track if he ain't hearing it and you are it's probably your message and you're a [ __ ] take very good point take care of your own [ __ ] exactly um so yeah he recommended you get rid of him several weeks on she stopped talking about it and over the years just made jokes about it but eventually they parted ways broke up what have you and he was back to living alone and occasionally he would think that he saw something running out of the living room when he'd come home like a white flash of something that would run from the next to the next room and I love this this is to quote this guy I love how people tell their stories he told himself that he was nuttier than a Christmas log and went on with his life nice so wait after all these experiences that people have had he's gonna dismiss his own paranormal experience as just himself being quote nuttier than a Christmas log correct correct okay right that's some self-denial right there one night a friend came home with him from the bar little uh something right right she jumped like she was struck when she opened the door and she goes what the [ __ ] was that and he goes what what did you see and he was looking around and she goes she could have SE she could have sworn she saw a woman standing behind the chair no [ __ ] wow he looked around the apartment and didn't find anything so so from voices to him seeing like flashes of an image to now a full-blown apparition maybe she was just super sensitive well then they just figured they had a little too drinky drinky and blew it off and went to sleep CH why why are you ignoring all these things all these signs this is why do people ignore that the house tells you to get out you get out and then he goes on to say this happen several more times with other people always the same they saw a woman behind my chair and each time I would find nothing and dismiss it and dismiss it like a man again again the evidence is piling up you're hearing auditory things and then now you're seeing things now people Everyone that comes in is seeing an apparition in the same place I'm sorry but you've got to start thinking it's some point that this is an actual full-blown Haunting of some sort something's going on Mom comes back oh good mama needs to take care of this [ __ ] because obviously it got out of hand one Christmas the mom comes to visit she complained often of someone walking around in the living room while she was trying to sleep he himself had heard the footsteps before but put it off to his imagination again come on dude at this point you're just self-d deluding yourself now well then he goes on to say I'm hearing Footsteps in my apartment and who the hell is GNA believe that dude I believe you okay I believe you we believe you he goes as time goes as time passes he ignored it and got comfortable with with it obviously he keeps dismissing all these things they never seemed to do much um not harmful the lady Behind the Chair always ran away nothing was a problem except occasionally the person he was with would say there's a guy staring at us from the next room and he'd make a joke about it and they'd continue doing what they were doing oh why is the ghost staring it's no I'm sorry pervy peeking ghosts no so it sounds like there would be a guy staring from a room and the lady Behind the Chair so and then children laughing so we're talking about multiple a whole family or something multiple you know it's not just one ghosty right something from the closet now you got to wonder what the history of this place is so fast forward to 2016 he meets his second wife congratulations and he had found found through their getting to know each other that she was very used to seeing ghosts and actually hat dealing with them how does he keep ending up with all these sensitive people I wonder if it's something about him or something about the place that he lives that keeps attracting sensitives now as she put it they would stand around like they wanted something scaring the crap out of her but they'd never say anything so basically they concluded that maybe she can't hear them but can see them so after they started after she moved in shortly after she moved in she started seeing white blur behind his chair and they blew it off as an overactive imagination dude like do you need like a 2x4 like semi four need a written map like what is wrong with you so they're karaoke fans Love karaoke I I guess he met his second wife through karaoke maybe it was like that Captain andil loveful keep us together I don't know um so often she would practice her songs while he was at work or if he was playing games he mentions this because it made him accustomed hearing singing in the house one night he realized that she was singing but she wasn't home wait so he what she would always practice karaoke around the house so he was used to just living his life hearing her sing in the background so one night he's hearing her sing but she's not home then it Dawns on him that she was out with her girlfriend and was not home so now the ghost is mimicking his wife's voice fiance's voice he says I W I wandered around the house thinking that maybe she left her laptop or or a TV or something on nope nothing the singing stopped too this cons this continued for several months until I said something dude why is he ignoring so much stuff so then the then the then the second wife here she reassures him that it's just his imagination and he goes along with it sure why not I'm gonna let it go until one night he heard a scream from the bathroom and his wife came barreling out of the bathroom like she had been scalded with hot water screaming swearing so he got her a drink she had heard singing now so she's naked in the shower and starts hearing singing and realizes she's hearing her own voice wait a minute now she's hearing herself sing her own voice whoa ghosty oh my goodness she said she thought it was the pipes and started singing with it got out of the shower start I don't know got out of the shower started to towel off she dried off her arm and turned to drive another dry off the other arm and there was a woman standing next to her doing the same exact thing holy [ __ ] holy crap yeah wow um so oh wow yeah oh wow and wow like a mirror image that's when she came out of the bathroom screaming yeah yeah yeah same I totally would too I would have before that as soon as I heard myself singing I would not have sung along with me that would not be a duet moment that would be a run screaming out of the bathroom moment guess what happens next oh [ __ ] what happened next they decide to ignore it all and move on what is up with these people what is going on here why are they how do you ignore this much stuff I just I can't even comprehend this is what he says he says no sense letting the world know we were crazy wow wow they just kept it to themselves because they they thought they were both delusional like all these pe oh my goodness after so much validation and then he goes that and now keep in mind this is his second wife so his first wife a string of girl friends some friends his mother mother now his second wife like dude it's not you it's not you okay we know you're not crazy yeah it's that house get out get out oh my goodness it changed when someone threw a water bottle out of the kitchen it was the third time it happened and it now they didn't throw a water bottle out of the kitchen didn't throw it at the at him and his wife just straight out of the kitchen door into the wall and they three times it threw a water bottle out of the kitchen then they tried to get it to happen again they figured out how to get the bottle to hit the wall opposite the dining room now we're really sounding Poltergeist here you know like when they set up the chairs in the kitchen now this is what I thought was super cool so you know if you're G to have a bunch of [ __ ] and you're gonna act like oh I'm crazy blah blah blah you know this isn't happening me and 40 other people it's a figment of our imagination these people actually Kudos got a hold of some groups and they had a group that was actually excited to come and interview them and document them about their experiences well yeah so I think it's very cool that they actually reached out to somebody after I don't know a long time I think that's very smart I mean that much stuff happens to that many different people I mean took you long enough there pal something weird is going on and you you should probably reach out to some professionals so the so these people asked if they could come out and stay at the house and they actually um this man and his wife decided to leave the house and let them have the house all to themselves the Paranormal people got the singing they had voices um someone had picked up their camera um Spirits this is what I think is the creepiest thing that what I find the creepiest is that these ghosts were imitating their voices and calling their names the paranormal group actually found something manifest in the hallway and then vanish um bright purple light that phased in and flashed out these paranormal investigators actually found a whole bunch of [ __ ] all throughout the house and recommended that they have their house clean uh cleansed immediately which they ended up doing and they ended up moving because they uh they had a a crazy neighbor things were quiet but they moved because they had a neighbor who was paranoid schizophrenic and she started telling everyone that this guy's wife was a witch trying to kill them all oh my goodness yeah so the new place they just recently moved into um they did go ahead and have blessed before they moved into it smart I would too after everything they've been through they had also asked that person to go and bless their old place and we told to leave coins and candies at the old place and then say this is yours do not follow and all he all he leaves his story as that worked for about four months oh wow dude is there a part two I think we need part two holy [ __ ] wow where's part two wow I'm genuinely scared for these people now this is what I'm wondering could this guy Anonymous could his wife his first wife because remember the story starts with went right after him and his first wife split that's a big emotional thing too you know it could be the emotional turmoil sometimes causes like Poltergeist type activity you know when you go through something big and emotional like that maybe that kind of Drew something out but it follows him everywhere at multiple locations I'm wondering if she just threw some bad juju o not to throw any shade on the first wife or anything but yeah for whatever reason it sounds like around that time something kind of attached to him wow and it was asking for him it was literally started out asking for him by name and it B others and mimics the females in his life and it seems to be female in nature you know female's voice and and all the the the women that he brings over seeing the woman in the hallway there is that the one Spirit seems to be a man but mostly yeah it does seem to be some sort of female entity that's attached to him in some way for some reason thing what strikes me about this story in particular is the fact that not very often it's very rare when you hear about um ghosts haunting is Paranormal Activity where where a spirit is actually like mimicking your voice mimicking your sound that's a rare thing yeah when do you hear that that's not something I don't I don't think I've I can't think of any time I've heard that particular thing no you hear about you know oh I heard voices I heard them calling I heard them or even I heard it sounded like my dad's voice who passed away like sometimes it'll sound like a person who's passed away but not mimicking you right um so that really struck me about this story and actually kind of freaked me out yeah that's kind of freaky but I I do fear that because he's lived in so many locations these these things I think are attached to him not the loc sounds like it oh please send us part two Anonymous so he might think that he has shed Whatever by blessing the old place like dude I want part two because I think this shit's attach to you where you live ston Witches Hour gmail.com please we need more we need more details how are you doing are you okay yeah like like singing singing witch part two like singing Ghost part I need to know what happens next because I'm telling you it's attached to you not your location there you go free advice from Shell the Ghost Hunter all right well pallet cleanser here I'm going to go with a story that I actually skimmed over and I love this story so much shelle you're going to like this and we all need this after that story I think so this person gave me their real name his name is Samuel sadil and he sends us a true story and he says here is a true story you should do this one to remind people that not all ghosts are evil and thank you Samuel we really need that right now he says this happened about four years ago so here's a little backstory the day I found out my wife was going to have a baby girl I was so excited absolutely baby girls are a blessing congratulations to you both I called my grandma to tell her the exciting news about three maybe four hours later I got a call from my little sister saying that my grandma had passed away oh that sucks yeah right after telling her that wonderful news about his baby daughter oh my gosh yeah that's horrible it is he says I was so heartbroken still am to this day she was like my mother we're heartbroken for you Sam a he says okay so fast forward it's about to be my daughter's first birthday and I spend all day getting supplies for the party finally I get home and the wife takes my daughter for a bath while I unpack everything I happened to buy this writing toy we have all probably had at one point you know the one with the little pen attached to it and if you need sketch and if need to erase anything you slide the thing at the bottom Till It's Gone I opened the toy for my daughter to play with when she gets out of the bath smart that's a smart dad trick right there open the presents get the toy out of all that crazy packaging before your little one-year-old gets to it right make it easy so he he says I get distracted and start playing on my phone oh I feel that and it's just me alone in the room my wife walks in the room and asks me a weird question did you write that now keep in mind I've been on my phone most of the time I ask whatat are you talking about she then pointed at the toy I picked it up because it was right next to me and when I saw it I couldn't believe it there plain as day the name Viola was written in cursive handwriting was that his grandma I started to feel like I was going insane because there was no way that name should be there number one I can't even write cursive and number two that's my grandma's name who passed just about a year ago at the same time he sent a picture I'm going to show you first of all should we oh my God right oh wow we need to talk about the fact that that grown man cannot write in curso but that's a different podcast different podcast we're Gen X I I don't think anyone younger than Millennials can write in cursive but he says that so that was his grandmother's name to this day he says I don't know how to explain it it's just one of many wild experiences I've had in this lifetime cuz she was there for the birthday party right she came and she

great-granddaughter and of course she was going to be there for the F oh the hair my hair is standing on end of course she's going to be there for the first birthday party and she signed her name I love that that was that was almost like her way of like leaving a gift by signing her name on that oh shell that's so sweet I love that that was her gift that was Grandma's gift y there you go a so it's very cool that he got a picture of it too so cool thank you for sending in the picture we really appreciate it Sam W so I've got I've got one more story here this one is from chaos Queen name love the name great name and uh this story happened in Iowa so chaos Queen starts off by saying once I became a teenager I got to hang around with adults we all know that where you finally get to like stay up a little later and be out in the kitchen with your aunt and uncle are around oh yeah get parents other friends and stuff like when all the other younger kids had to go to bed get to stay up we all know it that's right that's a good time so she remembers stories that they would tell her most uh in the summer at backyard fire Hangouts so it kind of sounds like you know they'd have like a backyard fire all the younger kids would have to go to bed and all the adults would kind of sit around and sweet there's the goal is to have a house where we can do that shell yeah she came to an age where she was allowed stay out at the fire kind of thing so one of the stories she was told when uh was when she was 16 she was out on this Farm outside of town and there was a mother who was so bad to her kids that at night she would lock them in a cage in the Attic oh no chaos Queen didn't believe it and called [ __ ] and told them that she read a book called Flowers in the Attic oh right yeah that does it does sound like an urban legend that could get started from like a famous book like CL in the Attic sure but these people kept insisting that it was true and she told them to prove it right put up her shut up right and then she annoyed her family every day for a week and till they found a sitter for the rest of the kids and they were taking her to this house no way so they decided to actually show her oh [ __ ] she goes on to say my dad always like to see how Brave I am at dumb things like I dare you to go in the basement with no light or or whatever so her dad would kind of like poke at her like something you do with your daughter right so they all got into their parents van and her dad drove out of town so they're down this Grava Road and then onto a dirt road took us about 10 minutes she goes on to say my dad pulled into the driveway and as I looked out the window I never saw this place before the house was iconic Square Farmhouse with a porch that wrapped near all the way around um we got out and looked around the grass hadn't been cut in years and other buildings on the farm have holes in their roofs and the paint has worn away the house itself was just as bad the front porch steps uh were sunk in so they had to walk around into the back and they went up the three back porch steps so as they gathered on the porch near the back door the adults talking and peering Through the Windows she remembers feeling like she was being watched from afar um her dad said that it was time to go inside and so they went in WoW family that ghost hunts together yes like family friend ghost hunting nice nice so she goes on to say we entered the back door and found ourselves in the kitchen it was your typical Farm kitchen just stuck in a different era cobwebs dust all over everything um they were looking in drawers and cupboards just kind of being nosy and when they entered the dining room they were immediately creeped out is the dining room table was set with the dust cobwebs and a mouse [ __ ] all over oh wow like a ghostly table setting why do some of these old houses have like the taable set like people are G to come din as is yeah right so she still has this sense that she's being watched so she stood closer to her dad she wasn't scared at first but she was starting to get creeped out and out of the corner of her eyes she saw a doll laying on the table oh no not a doll yeah it was made of glass so like like one of those porcelain dolls I would imagine even worse those are always demonic like in every story every those are always bad news I don't touch it so she wanted the doll no what did I just say young lady so she wanted the doll so she moved to the door so she could grab it when they left I said don't touch the demon doll don't touch the you never touch the demon doll but she decides to she's staying close to her dad as they wander around um they go in the family room and there was a piano um they found stairs to the second floor and and then they heard a crash oh did someone fall through the floor nope they pulled down the attic steps you know one of those pull Downs Uncle says he's going up where did the crash come from not sure yet wow I know okay um they all walk over and climb up the ladder okay attic it's going to be the creepiest spot you know of course you're ghost hunting you go to the attic or the basement so she says she hears her mom's friend gasp and Mumble oh my God so of course what does any kid do go hurry to see what they saw right it's got to be something good there was the cage the cage they said was in the oh [ __ ] I forgot about the cage that's right they said they kept the kids in a cage in the Attic no way it really was there they found a huge massive cage and the story was actually real oh [ __ ] oh that wasn't the scary part of the story nasty that's not the scary part though no so they're messing around in the Attic like why couldn't my family teach me to trespass and Ghost Hunt damn so they heard like what they felt was coughing downstairs somebody I thought everyone came upstairs they did oh damn they did oh damn um then they hear four notes being played on the piano oh whoa even worse that's the worst oh God now remember I have the hey G remember how everything's covered in dust so they all run down they all run down from the attic they run to the piano there's no marks on the layers of dust on the piano keys how the hell did someone play the piano without disturbing the dust on the keys oh wow like go oh my goodness oh my goodness everybody starts getting freaked out and they decide to leave the house so oh [ __ ] well good that's the smart thing here it's time to leave she remembers the doll oh so she runs she runs back to the house to grab it since she knew she left it inside the door right she put the [ __ ] demon doll by the door it wasn't there ah no did someone else take it so she yells to her dad to see if he had it and he didn't but told her to check the house really fast oh [ __ ] she's in the house by herself she ran back in and looked around and found it found it back where she first found it no way and she left it there and ran out of the house and never took it because she was so scared she told her dad she couldn't find it I am so creeped out all I can imagine is that piano playing like creepy notes while she's running through the house looking for that stupid [ __ ] demon doll only to see it sitting back where she oh oh gosh that's creepy a few weeks later somehow mysteriously the house caught on fire and burnt to the ground and since it was abandoned the fire department just let it burn wow probably for the best wow wow so to chaos Queen first of all I love the fact that your whole family is like czy that they're like you know what you don't believe there no [ __ ] witches everybody get in the car I love that they told a story and they're like yes we can back that [ __ ] up we can we can back that story up we absolutely got the we got the facts and and and she she ended her story by wanting to let us know that she is also a stoner witch yeah hey Stoner witch hey girl so to chaos Queen this Puffs for you oh yeah I love that so what's your last story what's your last story what you last story oh my gosh this has been so much fun I can't believe this is the last one all right this comes from black cat 1206 and they say I come from a family of sensitiv so I've had paranormal and Supernatural experiences all my life as has the rest of my family I don't really get scared when I have experiences as I'm so used to them and I have techniques to keep the more darker entities at Bay smart same right things still take me by surprise or creep me out though and this is one of them same same when we reached 10 years old my cousin and I were allowed to play on the street just out sorry that's my dog my cousin and I were allowed to play on the street just outside my auntie's house same yep yeah there was a busy Lane which ran down beside the side of the houses where all the kids used to run up and down kick a football around ride their bikes and generally messed around same exactly I liked it because I had a long walkway to practice pushing my wheelchair without the danger of the main road and my cousins and our friends and I spent hours of fun running and wheeling up and down that lane that sounds fun that does there was a funny little deadend alley just leading off the lane which always had a weird vibe around it there was only one house at the end of the quote dead end alley as all the kids used to call it the house was different from all the other houses around it the others were bright colorful and cheerful full of life with a neighbors talking over the fences with with one another and always ready to tell us kids off tongue and cheek for making too much row oh see I was wondering if they were British because they spelled colorful in neighbors with too many letters there's a u where there shouldn't be let me tell you I have a my my friend we we talk about my friends sometimes in England ghost my ghosty friend hi ghost hi ghost one of our funny conversations has always been about color I'm here in America c o l o r yeah and in England um Great Britain c o l r yeah what's with the extra U I don't understand it same thing in neighbors they say we're wrong they call it the lazy American way but you know gasp no I don't know I like them both I do spell gray with an e g re y I like that I do too I like it better than the a don't know what to tell you but yeah it's a little extra don't you think leave me alone I drink and I like the queen oh I like tea too anyway I know you don't love them but you know Harry and uh Megan are my neighbors next door neighbors many many miles away but anyway so they say and so they call it a row is it a row or a row like a row a row for making too much row a typical slang term for noise and rust L like you're gonna get in a row you're gonna get in a fight you're gonna get an argument you're gonna get in a row I thought it was r no it's row I think ghost send me a message is it row or row so black cat continues um oh now I lost my spot all right black cat we need more slang I appreciate that give me more slang from West London the house down dead end alley was always dark even even on a sweltering hot summer's day it always seemed to have a Gloom hanging over it like a dark ominous Cloud you know neighborhoods sometimes they have that weird haunted freaky house yeah and it doesn't help if it's on the dead end either right exactly so obviously we being merely 10 years old were banned by my mama and Aunt from going anywhere near the alley let alone the empty abandoned house although my older cousin and his mates who were 13 hung around dead end alley from time to time with the sole purpose of frightening his little sister and me with horror stories of the house and its imaginary monstrous inhabitants that's pretty typical yeah yeah having heard rumors hey do they spell rumors with an extra U too what's up with this extra U having heard I'm sorry sorry black cat I kind of it's okay we the problem having heard rumors about the dark history of the house although not knowing anything concrete the house had the dubious reputation as a haunted house can I just say we have some great storytellers dubious I love that word du I love all these stories everyone has painted great pictures for us one typical summers's day my cousin and I were playing in the lane with our friends we kept hearing a baby crying now being in the middle of a council estate hey ghost what does that mean it is not uncommon it is not uncommon to hear a baby cry so we paid no attention however as the afternoon wore on the baby's cry became louder and constant almost deliberate that got our attention and we all decided to investigate the noise so we stopped playing and began to look around to our horror after searching for the root of the noise we realized that of the baby's cries were originating from the front garden of the deadend alley house oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] of course it's coming from the haunted freaking house one of our friends who is slightly older said he would go nearer to have a look we were all concerned by now as it seemed obvious to all present that it was a real baby who was in distress but everyone present also pleaded with him not to do it but he was and still is a very principled moral person and his conscience overcame him that's probably a good thing CU what if it was a baby somebody's got to ball up and go over there exactly somebody's got to go in and take care of it yeah we waited for 10 minutes until he came back he looked awful his face was white as a sheet and he looked physically shaken he told us that he went into the garden but there was no sign of a baby anywhere his best mate asked him if he saw anything else and he just nodded and said I don't want to talk about it oh what did he see nobody forced the issue in fact I think everyone was secretly relieved about it we left very quickly and returned to the safety of Home years after my cousin and I were talking to her mom and she began to tell us about the history of the local area the subject of the deadend alley house came up we were horrified by what my auntie told us it still gives me chills talking about it now in the 1940s the area where our family lived was way rougher than it was present day lots of domestic violence gangs prostitution and unwed mothers also a high pregnancy rate which is to be expected in some ways what would the war along with it came a fair percentage of unwanted babies it turns out that the house in dead end alley was a baby Farm where women took their babies that they couldn't look after or didn't want and they gave them to women or couples and for a fee they would take these abandoned infants in and find good homes for them it's like an orphanage yeah but maybe not NE sounds like maybe a shady one it was said by the locals that the couple running the baby Farm were quite an unsavory pair again with the extra you people and there were rumors at the time of coercion and intimidation of young unwed mothers to give the awful couple their babies and neglect and and abuse oh there was also rumors of neglect and abuse of their young charges so definitely a really rough Shady Place yeah yeah not on the up and up at all the Scandal was uncovered in the 50s my auntie didn't know the full facts but the remains of several infant bodies were found in the front garden in a shed where the husband kept his gardening tools the couple were obviously charged with murder and because of the number of remains discovered they were put away for a long time oh that breaks my heart oh wow we don't really know the truth of of what happened that hot summers's day long ago but my cousin and I have our theories my gosh those kids all heard babies crying coming from that house ghostly baby crying wow my cousin still lives in the same house with her own family and my auntie and every time my husband and I visit them I still get the
