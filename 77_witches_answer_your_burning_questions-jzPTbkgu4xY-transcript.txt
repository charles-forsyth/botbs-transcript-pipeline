join us as we get back on the broomstick welcome to back on the broomstick I'm ilila and today we're recording another witch's answer episode where we answer your fan mail your email your DMs and help you out with your burning witchy questions and in case you haven't noticed I sound a little bit weird I am recovering from covid unfortunately she got the Rona I did and I got it pretty badly too and I guess it's because I was bragging that I had never gotten it before so it had to show me who was boss you know what I think it was I think we've like partied like rock stars all summer long this was like Karma saying okay it is time to get back on the saddle but we did good we caught up we we we stayed caught up with everything except for communication pretty much pretty much happens yeah it happens that's where this episode kind of came out about today so tonight we wanted to answer some of your burning questions woohoo so so before we get started doing that shell and I wanted to touch on a maybe burning PSA Public Service Announcement I guess we'll call it that call it that we've talked about counterfeit tarot decks before Oh my God you're gonna get me started aren't you I am I am you're exactly why I wanted to bring this up now I do have a happy ending to my story which I will get to because even you don't realize this but I did have a kind of in my mind happy oh good well over the summer shell and I went to quite a few different festivals workshops camping events things regular Pagan shops places and saw all sorts of amazing Creations people's books people's bomes capes but we also saw scams there were counterfeit decks Galore it almost seems like it is worse now than even like a year ago when we first started talking about counterfeit tarot decks I got scammed I got scammed me the tarot queen I'm I'm pushing 200 decks who get scammed me I was so and and it wasn't even like at a festival it was like at a store that feel even worse yeah I was gonna say it made the burn hurt more yeah absolutely and if even someone like shell can get scammed by these counterfeit decks it's going to be hard for anyone to tell especially with the proliferation of secondhand Decks that you'll see like on Facebook Marketplace or some place like that so what can we do shell how did you know that you got a counterfeit deck and that's the kicker I didn't know it first you know I had sent you a text message one day I do this to you often hey look what I bought at lunch at work that's a text messenger used to and I had gotten these three decks and I was like oh I love these and I started using one of them a lot for a few weeks because I really liked it that ended up being the real deck so because I liked that one a lot I kind of put the other to a side temporarily so I think that's why I didn't notice right away so I open this deck beautiful deck I'm showing you right now it's called the black cats tarot it's about kitty cats I love kitty cats yeah it looked normal and in retrospect I think it was my addiction overcoming me because I'm going to jump to the Happy Ending really quick as you know I went and I I got out of storage my hundreds of tarot decks and I've brought them back to my doile and I've been going through them so on my Google spreadsheet because everybody needs a Google spreadsheet of how many tarot decks they have I realized I have the black cat tarot already thank you Jesus so I put it down and I set this one that I just recently obtained over the summer next to it and I I was like sure as they are not the same size and the other thing was you know those scan codes SC Q codes the QR code it had a QR code at the bottom but here's where they tripped me up because this is where I usually and I'm changing my ways I promise normally I uh open up a deck and I look to see if there's a book in it this one didn't have a book and that should have been the first sign to me but it had a card that was almost like it explained the four suits on the card you know what I'm saying like it wasn't like you know the ace of cups should mean something along these lines no it was more like the suit of Cups generally means this the suit of Wands generally so I kind of was just like oh yeah that's cool you know things are new maybe this is what they're doing now yeah know stupid stupid stupid stupid me but like I said luckily the happy ending was is that I accidentally bought it bought this when I already had it and didn't realize it so I actually do have a legitimate awesome perfect copy of the black cat tarot but I also have a freaking fake now let's just say did you notice that it was a fake before you put it down next to the real one or or after well I'm going to say before only because I had noticed the book issue and the QR code before I put it down next to the other deck and those are really going to be your biggest clues that that's going to be counterfeit is the size difference they're almost always like a just slightly larger than standard playing cards in size see they're toying with the sizes now and you can get different of all different sizes that are legitimate and that's the problem legitimate decks tend to come in many different sizes fake decks tend to be all the kind that will fit into those very simple flat pack boxes you know what I'm talking about yeah they're very simple flat pack boxes and they tend to all be somewhat uniform in size the other thing is they'll have a QR code on it at the bottom at the bottom usually and here's what I've been finding is my most reliable way to tell if it's a fake or not look at the back of the box they almost always make the front of the box look very similar to the commercial deck but the back of the box will be very very simple may have the QR code on it but it will not have the ISBN which is the the number and barcode that you'll see on most books and Tarot decks if it does not have that ISBN bar and it has a QR code you are almost 100% guaranteed looking at a counterfeit deck if someone's trying to sell you a second hand deck maybe on Facebook or through some other Online Marketplace ask to see the back of the deck or the back of the box or the bottom and ask if it has a QR code on it unfortunately I think even retailers are getting scammed because I have commented on uh one vendor at a festival and one Vendor online and they had bought it from their regular supplier and had thought that they were legitimate tarot decks so even as a vendor you need to be cautious well and that's exactly what happened to me I bought this from a local shop in Salem like I wasn't just buying it from a street person and the reason you don't want to buy counterfeit tarot decks is one they tend to be very very low quality the card stock the colors the ink the artwork is all going to be extremely low quality and the biggest reason is it's a ripoff for the artist and the author of these decks they make very little money to begin with and then if you have these counterfeit decks out there that's going to eat into their profits people are going to stop making these decks and we can't have that we need these creative people to continue making wonderful amazing tarot and Oracle decks well and you know I can I guess I can kind of see the draw if you're looking at it from a certain way you know we're all poor folk we're not all independently wealthy you know and and you see these decks and I'm not going to mention the website that begins with a T but you see these websites that like oh get a Tarot deck for $7.99 or $6.99 and you know times are tough and we're all poor mofos and you're like you know $7.99 that's a lot better than $25.99 and I can afford that and then you buy it and you're like  so you know kind like what my father always used to say you get what you pay for if you are not paying I'm just going to throw a number out there 17.99 or more you're GNA want to question the validity of that deck yeah and a lot of times they'll come across and they'll say oh it's a 50% off sale 75% off sale it's a scam trust me if there was a 75% off sale of tarot my ass will be on that in a hot minute a hot minute now I also have a this also happens to be a cat deck that is a fake deck really we both got cat fakes we both got cat fakes but so what do you do if you happen to have I have a fake you have a fake that freaking cat deck I gave you was that fake it is was it really because I bought it at the same store at the same time that I got this deck fake so basically that day I bought two fake decks from a local retailer yes itchy spells all around like I said what makes what makes the burn more is that it's a store it's not like we bought it from like a tent sale at a festival you know what I mean exactly exactly and even if you did the tent sale at the festival the vendor that I spoke to she had had no idea that she was purchasing fakes this is a vendor that she would buy other types of uh statues and and jewelry from and did not think you know she didn't buy it from the website that begins with a T she bought it from her regular vendor so it can be very difficult for people you have to do your due diligence and now say against you know against your better judgment or you know it's a fluke or it was a gift or however you got it in your hands is a fake Tarot deck what do you do okay I have some mixed emotions here I say just use it and keep it unless you're like dying morally on the side okay the artist got screwed we we've established that what was done was wrong on a lot of different levels probably borderline illegal actually as well we've we've established that but the images are the same we all Garner some sort of truth from these images and even legitimate tarot Decks that you buy are mass-produced in some Warehouse in who knows where so it's not like the quote unquote magic isn't there because you bring the magic to the cards the cards are just really a conduit yeah it's not a fake Tarot deck in the sense that it won't work it will obviously work it's a fake Tarot deck in the sense that somebody got screwed out of their due profit yes I would still use it actually and I actually thought about this and I was going to bring it up I'm gonna actually offer this deck to any listener who wants it black cat's Tarot I'll post a picture if you like it is a fake deck but if you are interested I'll ship it to you there you go so some of the things that you can do with the tarot Decks that you get if they are fake and you don't necessarily want to use it first off don't beat yourself up about it do try to educate the seller and let them know I was pissed I was pissed at myself more than anything and one of the best things that I've seen to use these fake decks for is for learning now you have a travel deck that you don't have to worry about getting dirty or getting ripped or being used by other people you have a deck that you can write on yes I'm going to tell you now to write on your tarot decks you write on everything don't you books tarot decks pretty much so write on this one put your keywords on it put the things that you want to remember on it use it as a learning tool oh my God you could put like planetary correspondences on it or herbal correspond that's a brilliant idea you could you could use it for your scrapbook grp grimoire you could use it to put in your journal pages instead of stickers you could take a card or two out if you are trying to assemble a magpie deck correct they'll still work any cards will work you could print cards out on your computer that will work as a Tarot deck the ethical concern some morally shitty implications that's all exactly so you want to take care of that first educate the person that you purchase it from see if they'll take it back as a return and maybe get their money back as well smack yourself in the head smack yourself in the head a few times no don't do that maybe try to buy the real deck if you can if you want to support that artist and see that's what that's what my original plan was I was going to play replace it with the real deck until I realized I already had the real deck and then I'll well that ends well there you go so that's our PSA for the beginning of our witches answer episode is what to do if you get scammed like unfortunately shell and I did I also want to mention that our hosting service Buzz Sprout has also started something called fan mail if you check out the description of the episodes you'll see that there's a link right there to send us something called fan mail we can't respond to you we can still get questions from there and someone from our Pagan Community back in the day shell contacted us through that and said that they listen to the podcast and really love it yeah so I want to say hi to our old community members that are listening and we love you guys and miss you maybe we'll see you on S shout out to the B PC so we got an email from a listener named Kina and she's a new witch from the UK and she's also solitary and self-taught and she says she has a question about ancestral work because she'd very much like to connect to loved ones who've passed but she's worried that it's risky she's kind of scared because she's anxious that she'll call something harmful or mean through and her husband doesn't really help her much because he also says that she should be very very careful that she doesn't get everyone into trouble by mistake I see where she's coming from continue on before we address this her other questions are how do you dismiss or send away the spirit how do you finish the workings to make sure no one stays or follows you and she also had a question for me because when we talked about ancestor work I mentioned that I reached way back to a potential ancestress who was not too pleased with me and she wanted to know how I knew that and how I handle now I do want to address one portion of that first and foremost with when I'm thinking about ancestral work you know granted you are far removed from these people but in my Twisted little mind this is my fam here and I know the crazy that I am and I know the crazy that my family is so I just kind of look at it as I might be calling him crazy but at least it's a familiar crazy it's a crazy I can deal with because it's familiar that's really kind of my approach to should I shouldn't I you know it it's kind of like Ouija board work be cautious but move forward proceed with caution proceed with caution I agree ancestor work is not inherently dangerous it's actually like shell said this is your fam this is your family these are it's more dangerous to get out of Ouija board if that's what you're asking there you go if your intention is ancestor work I do recommend that you set up a space you don't necessarily have to cast a circle if you don't want to but I like to have a space that's sacred to ancestors and to that particular type of work as best I can I like to have something yeah um a picture a trinket like when I'm doing it with more recent ancestors say my grandparents are my great-grandparents I like to have a trinket there a little further back I like to try to dig up a picture ancestry.com is great for trying to find old pictures of relatives that you may never have met in her hundreds of years old but if you can come up with some sort of something to tie you to that that person yeah even if you just have a name or a region and you're just calling some people don't know who their ancestors are you might just be calling to your ancestors generically and seeing how they come through in those cases it's definitely a good idea to have a space that you use maybe a circle you can use protective crystals or have something grounding to you and to your home or if you have an AMU amulet or sigils maybe have those Place yeah clear quartz for protection maybe obsidian or black termine for protection or grounding but it's not going to hurt you to call out to your ancestors the odds of you bringing something bad back with you are slim to slim to very little bad movie slim slim to bad Hollywood movie yeah that's not usually going to happen almost every single time you're just going to connect with ancestors who want to talk to you have a message or maybe just a good feeling it's normal to question your abilities especially as a solitary practitioner who's new as shell and I always say your intention is very powerful if you sit down with the intention of calling to ancestors that's what you're going to get even if you're worried and we all we all have a different uh different version of what an angry spirit is or what a what a a a a grumpy you know pissed off spirit is you know was my grandfather super pleased with some stuff I did did he come and tell me that not so much would I have said he was angry yes because in real life you know when he was still a part of this physical world that was how he was when he was angry but if we're talking like my house is shaking Exorcist my head's spinning type of stuff yeah know that no no no that's not going to happen and when you're done with your working when you've done your meditation you'll know that you're done and then maybe you'll have a phrase to say goodbye bye um like Shell's Ouija board analogy you know you always make sure you say goodbye at the end you can say goodbye in many different ways you could clap your hands you could ring a bell you could get up and get something to eat make yourself a cup of tea treat it like you have visitors in your home in the physical place it is time for you to go bye-bye that's right I love that if you have to get to the resort to get out now you know you you draw that Line in the Sand this is my space and you need to go your time is up goodbye my grandmother has way too much advice for me most of the time I usually have to do that when she comes into a working right CA she won't stop talking you have to set that boundary with the spirit world just as you would set that boundary in the physical world you know when your aunt suszie Q comes over and you have had it and you're ready to show her the door you're going to do the same thing when she hits the afterlife and comes back to you and does the same you just got to set that boundary it is time for you to go goodbye yeah and I like to have the same goodbye ritual every time it's good for me consist consistency is definitely a thing yeah so if you ring a bell if you turn your B home upside down if whatever you do consistently do that to say goodbye that's going to signal to your subconscious as well as to the spirit world that you're done and see that's why I like to cast a circle when I do that type of thing because that's where you get into that habitual flow you know what I mean when you cast a circle you know that there's a certain order to things and so if you do it in that type of format you you kind of automatically incorporate your goodby I love that yes exactly and also say you do feel that you have some negative energy maybe a negative Spirit or maybe your Aunt Suzie Q was a little bit today and you just want to cleanse that energy out do your regular cleansing you could use a a salt bath you could use a smoke cleanse you could do a music cleanse you could get up and dance you could drink a tea or do an herbal smoke with cannabis and herbs to cleanse yourself again same thing as with ending the ritual I recommend using the same type of cleansing thing every time maybe you say goodbye and then you turn up your favorite song every single time and that helps to cleanse those energies but if you if you're worried about it just perform an extra cleansing and you're good I'll be honest with you one time my grandpa came and had a grumpy message it kind of fre me out so to combat it I then invoked my grandma to handle them I love that I panicked I didn't know what to do so I was like oh grandma and that's what your ancestors are there for they're there to help you even if it's your ancestors you need help from but you know when you know I I I kind of joke in it being my grandparents but you know most people are thinking ancestral work you know talking four five 10 15 Generations back and you know we don't have that same physical relationship with those people when they were in the physical world but I in my opinion same rules apply because I look at it as they might be you know ancestors 10 Generations back but where did you think I got my crazy from right yeah you know them they know you and okay the last part of the question is my ancestress that was not too thrilled with me we are working through that and we have a good relationship with her now I like to think so anyways but the way I first felt that was I I reached out to her I don't know her name and I I guess I was a little rude reaching out to her it more manifested as just kind of heaviness it felt prickly the Energy felt off you know I'm in a nice meditative state I'm in my nice meditative ancestral area and you know I felt uneasy I felt nervous I I started to embody some of the feelings of anger and upsetedness I could feel the anger kind of like I was getting angry like I was getting upset and so it was more just kind of feeling those emotions you know similar to when you connect with any ancestor you can kind of sometimes feel a wave of Love or you'll feel a wave of comfort in this particular case I felt a wave of anger and and it just felt more prickly and uncomfortable so we we kind of ended that session and then I approached a little more cautiously a little more respectfully each time and and it's gotten better you know it's all going to depend on how you approach them and how you handle that afterwards but it it usually comes through for me as just waves of emotion and feeling I don't know it's kind of more just like you and kind of like similar to you and I having a conversation it's just kind of a conversation and maybe it's because people kind of sense or no or absorb things differently and maybe I'm just very audio but it's it's very much more just a conversation yeah with this particular ancestros it was more emotion rather than words I Goa I gota but that's a good point that could be interesting and I haven't experienced that before and it would maybe be Nifty too but with me it's really it's very conversation based I'm really glad you brought that up and I'm just going to really quick tangent on that because how you experience this in your magical or meditative space is going to be different personto person it might just be emotions maybe it's going to be pictures maybe it's going to be words maybe it's going to feel like a dream uh it's going to be very different depending on who you are you know and how your ancestors just how things come to you yeah exactly so that's going to very wildly between witches and and practitioners as you contact your ancestors so you're need to be open to how that works for you all right so what's our next question now I want to bounce around here a little bit and we're gonna take a little good with bad so you know not everybody loves leilan show w yes news flash you heard me so I'm going to read this and I'm going to I'm I'm going to read this and then I want to know your opinion because we're going to talk about this like reasonable adults here all right let's go for it so we had a listener right in the first episode I'm listening to and not even halfway through there's Shameless cultural appropriation and it's clear the hosts don't actually know what they're doing what knowledgeable herbalist or green witch creates an herb bundle with dried herbs and also can non-native folks please stop using the term smudging it's 2024 and there are tons of available resources about smoke cleansing that don't appropriate indigenous practices talk to me okay so this was a review that we got and part of it is absolutely 100% correct we have used the term smudging and we should not smudging is a Native American practice it is something that is taught there is more to it than just smoke cleansing this is a word in shells and my vocabulary for a very long time a lot of witches particularly in the 80s and 90s uh we learned about smudging from a Community member who happens to be native I don't know if that's a point that we need to make or not but now let make that point we were taught smudging and taught the word by a native Comm Community member that doesn't mean we get to use it and so just because we were originally taught quote unquote that word that was the proper one to use for smoke cleansing because we were not initiated or trained in these practices we do not have the right to use that word it's better to keep these practices pure we can appreciate as much as we want but some things require training they require initiation they require being part of the that culture and you cannot separate those things just because you happen to know the word and what the word means it's it's very much deeper than that I'm not trying to make excuses by saying that's how we learned it I'm just explaining that that's where it came from and we are working on eliminating that from our vocabulary to be more respectful to the culture where that came from so we're going to do better about using the term smoke cleansing because that is exactly what we're doing when we're talking about that so on that point they were correct we shouldn't use the term smudging uh we do try not to but obviously we have in the past a little bit so we know better we're trying to do better now the other one I take complete exception to the herb bundles when did holy heck did we ever say that I'm not really sure I know we talk have to go back I I'll have to go back and listen because I've talked about having herbs dried while they're bundled but I how my question is how do you make an herb bundle with dried herbs because it would all crumble right right which you know I'm not sure if we yeah I'm not sure if we implied that we did that so we're going to give you a quick how-to on how to make a smoke bundle if you would like to dry your herbs and use them for smoke cleansing or any other type of incense basically you take not fresh herbs you do want them somewhat dry if you take like like wilted like maybe as Tad more than wed exactly I like them a little bit more on the dry side you obviously don't want them to be crispy or like shelle said they will break apart but you want them to be a little bit more than wilted you take your mug wart your your Sage your lavender your Rosemary whatever herbs you're making a bundle put them together tie them with string hang them up to finish drying and that's how what you sometimes have to do is like after they've dried for a few days sometimes you got to like pull that string a little tighter cuz as the moisture comes out of it more the string gets loose yeah and so I'm not really sure where that part came from but you know hey we don't mind being called out when we make mistakes I do have a I do have a a quick ask here sure what's that if people want to call us out if people don't agree with us first of all we're not all here to agree second of all we could do it in a little less snarky manner just saying there I'm gonna move on next question Lea yes so here's a negative thing I'm going to have you read it but I'm not sure what they're getting at one of the other comments negative comments that we had recently was why would you celebrate something evil are we celebrating something evil did I not at all I was thinking did I forget something I'm pretty sure I've been here for every single episode and there's been nothing evil on any of them so I'm not oh my God I know what it is what is it we're witches and we're evil what no in this big year 2024 people still think witches are evil well Shell's tarot addiction's kind of evil well there's that all right moving on this I think is a legitimate question I don't think this is this is not a slab on us someone asked the question why would you tell someone to use a poppet on someone else because they asked you to yeah pretty much that's pretty cut dry pretty much that's why if someone says hey I that's the short answer I'm trying to get pregnant and I want some help will you make me a poppet yes yes I will happily help you with a fertility poppet um you want a new job and you need some confidence and you want me to make you a poppet yes I will make you a poppet there are a million in one reasons why you would make a poppet for someone that are not negative I am pretty sure though I asked you one time to make a puppet against one of my ex-boyfriends and you willingly did it but I asked that was my next point I'm also not going to knock someone who's making a poppet against their ex to get them the hell out of their life I am not judging you for that I mean honestly we never portrayed ourselves as all angels and sunshine no and like shell said I have made poppets against other people in the past we'll probably do it again poppet is not my first choice it's not my it's not where my talents naturally lie but it is it is it is powerful magic it is very very powerful it's a tool in the tool box but it's not necessarily my first go-to there you go and just like any tool it can be used for good it can be used for bad it's really going to depend on how you as a practitioner use that magic do you know you can use a toilet plunger for good and and for bad too I just want to point that out I I don't want to go there I don't want to even know but yeah tools there you go so that's that's why let's get to another question that is actually kind of relevant to to Magic and in learning and understanding here we heard from a nice man named Brian Brian wears a hematite ring you know I used to wear a hematite pinky ring for a long time so Brian writes that he has a hematite ring and although it has not broken it has a crack that is all the way across and through it does this mean the ring has done all it can should I replace it or can it still be cleansed and used I have a couple thoughts on this I think that maybe for Brian the ring has run its course but could he maybe I don't want to say cleanse that hematite for other purposes but kind of that's what I'm saying like like if he wanted to use the fragments let's say you know you had a little travel alar and you wanted to have some hematite chips on your travel altar like that kind of thing do you get what I'm saying am I crazy I hear what you're saying no I hear what you're saying and yeah when I responded to Brian's email I did say that in my belief a protection item like a hematite ring in particular or say like a um if you have a a God's eye if you have a the evil eye if once those break that is typically thought to be a sign that it has protected you from a magical strike it has protected you from something big and negative and and done all it can so that you did not get hurt so it's done its work for you in my opinion now I personally would probably either retire that hematite ring or possibly like shell said uh she said she might use it for chips yeah I might retire it and honor its service at the same time so maybe I would put that in the bottom of a protection jar for my home or maybe I would bury that under U one of the quarter stones in my on my property so it can continue to do kind of the same work that it quote unquote died doing kind of continue that work because I think once something has taken a strike like that it can't be your full armor anymore it definitely can't be your full armor and I think even if you repurpose that stone into something else it can be very difficult to let go of that residual energy in my opinion other people may be happy cleansing that and using those chips for some other some other working but I would only use that in something similar like I said another protection spell or but not as not as like a protection amulet anymore like how he was wearing it as a ring right and definitely not as the Cornerstone of that protection more as just something additional to kind of like retire it uh honor its service and still have it continue to do something that it component it's basically gone from the main show to a component of a recipe yeah yeah one once it's cracked like that it usually means that it has done its job so but I've had I've had quartz crystals crack like that too and that's been kind of my thought okay your work here is done right right now I do have um I have a a really beautiful green and purple fluorite uh cylinder that I got that cracked along a flaw in the stone that was just an accident that just happened that wasn't anything Mystic or magical that was a weak spot in the stone though that was so that's different and not everything is a sign not everything is something magical is all I was trying to point out is that one broke just because it there was a flaw there your ring sounds like it broke in service of protecting you so it makes a difference I love how you phrase that it died in service well that's what you know when you charge these Rings or these charms to take care of you that's what they're doing they're like little soldiers kind of guarding you and protecting you in my mind that's all okay so I have another email and this is from a person named Phillip and I loved this email thank you so much Phillip you and your husband sound absolutely lovely first of all Phillip thinks that I remind him of a Crazy funloving Aunt who would totally lie to the siblings and take the underage niece and nephew to an red movie or concert first of all Phillip you got me freaking tagged spot and as long as you were over the age of I might give you a joint too yes now philli has been listening to our podcast and has discovering both Celtic and Norse paganism philli started out with the big blue book buckland's Big Blue Book didn't we all I still have that book love it I know I love that book however philli pointed out a huge flaw with Buckland is that it's very very outdated Fair crab it is I love this book because it's very simple and straightforward and has every single little component you need to be a magical practitioner to be a first of all Phillip I hear you because I feel like in 1993 it felt outdated basically the way you feel right now is how I felt about the same book in 1993 I hear you it is outdated and one of the things that it's outdated in is in its depiction of heterosexual everything well yeah men are men and women are women and so are the and goddess and the cows of the cows that's right and there's so much more Nuance to the real world and to people and relationships and you know as a gay man Philip felt that this did not fit so and he's looking for some books that would help out there are so many wonderful amazing authors right now in the Pagan World from the lgbtq plus Community from different cultures from everywhere you can find pretty much any you're looking for so that gives you the secondary problem of too much of a good thing sometimes so I'm going to give you a list of excellent books that either we have read or have been recommended to us so I have a huge list I'm going to give you just a couple quick ones as well as some names and I will put a very large list of these books in the show notes so Enis book is amazing author their book queer writes a magical grimoire to honor your Milestones with pride is fantastic gay witchcraft empowering the tribe by Christopher penchi is also very good quering your craft witchcraft from the margins by Cassandra snow also don't forget because you know I can't let this go by without throwing in a Tarot deck one Tarot deck that I I received as a gift is the pride tarot beautiful deck I recommend it for all tarot readers Christopher Hughes Mara Starling Jack chanik Matt Ain Lee Harrington Devin Hunter amber k Thomas Ford storm fairy wolf there are so many queer authors out there that have amazing amazing books um the path of the green man gay men wiah and living a magical Life by Michael Thomas Ford I mean there's books from decades ago and current books it's just a rich wonderful tapestry of magic so we will put all of these books uh in the show notes so that people can find them don't forget to put that Tarot deck in the show notes I will also put the Tarot deck in the show notes as well so yeah I mean we all know that there's a spectrum of male and female in deity but sometimes that can be hard to find in our books it's getting less hard to find with these amazing amazing authors so so we have a a another interesting question that I think is is kind of struck a chord with probably at least a good 99% of our listeners we have a a message uh that we received from Jula and she writes after she tells us that she loves us which by the way we love you too um she writes that with all the chaos surrounding the 2024 election ain't that the truth um and fearful thoughts it is stirred among Americans what practices prayers spells or rituals would you suggest we would do separately and or as a collective to promote peace while protecting our energy and each other man if that ain't the question of the month Lord yeah everything is crazy right now there is a lot going on there's a lot of emotions people are very invested and worried about the upcoming election and we get it you know unfortunately I hate to say this but we already have experience with this from roughly about 40 years ago because I think that there was that same turmoil and that same uncertain certainty and a lot of the same anger this isn't new territory for us and I think first and foremost magic aside spellwork aside put things in a perspective keep a level head and if you expect kindness then damn well better be kind register to vote volunteer for something local keep it local is my way of staying sane and I have also joined in a couple groups online one group in particular um we do weekly guided visualizations and one of the big things that we're working with is the archetype of Colombia the goddess of the United States and if you don't know anything about her I highly recommend you look into Colombia but we're using this idea of a a United States goddess Colombia the spirit of America to help us visualize coming together you know people working together for justice that truth that these things will prevail know that's so funny you say that cuz a group that I've been working with uh to the same end actually put in reverence the Statue of Liberty so we basically look as the Statue of Liberty as the goddess yes ex you know exactly so the Statue of Liberty is a wonderful egregor we take these ideas uh egregor are basically a a thought form an idea that you put energy into and can create can make that into something and so in this case we are are working with a lot of uh VIs visualization of the spirit of America trying to focus everyone's intentions contribute positive energy to the nation because we we need that right now I also love uh sigil work you know that I do love to do sigils creating sigils towards the upcoming election can be a very powerful way to focus your intentions uh Laura Tempest zacharov has some sigils uh you can find I was just thinking that yep yep she has created specific sigils for this moment in time in our nation in America right now if you are in the US or even if you're outside of the US and and you want to contribute energy towards helping us come through this with Liberty Justice and happiness for all then you can also focus on Laura Tempest zacharov sigils or the idea of Colombiana but you can find a lot of these groups on Facebook or online maybe your local uyu church or your local metaphysical shop might have groups that meet regularly but getting involved at a local level especially you know around getting out the vote or making sure that people know where their polling stations are any local things that you can do really can help you know make you feel more connected or make you feel like you're helping to make a difference but magically you know the idea of the Statue of Liberty as goddess and Colombia as goddess can be wonderful thought forms to help you put energy towards that positivity and if you don't have the time or the inclination to do something in your community then I'll give you a real easy thing that you can do in the words of Taylor Swift whom I love just go vote man there you go I love that vote that's the best way I think to kind of promote that piece protect our energy and each other is be heard exactly make your vote count and to make your vote count you got to vote there's that yes we might not always talk about it but these are things that we are definitely working with you know behind the scenes and you know what Ila's going to actually put a link in the show notes of where you can go register to vote if you are not currently registered absolutely so check out the the show notes if you are not registered to vote because it is important it is a right of every American citizen and you should most definitely exercise that right kind of like tattoos tattoos voting they go hand inand they're rights fundamental freedoms here people I want another tattoo now I don't I don't even know where to go with that all
