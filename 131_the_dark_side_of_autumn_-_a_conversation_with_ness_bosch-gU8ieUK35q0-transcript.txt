Hey listeners, just a heads up before this episode.
Our conversation with Nesbosh gets a little dark.
It gets a little deep, kind of like this time of year.
You know, it is the dark part of the year.
We are in the dark season.
And it is time to do that dark work, that deep work,
and have those dark conversations.
And tonight we are going to have one of those dark conversations.
So we just wanted you to prepare yourself.
Welcome to Back on the Brumstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimoire.
Where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots
after a long period of mundanity.
We're re-walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells,
rituals, and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices.
So grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron, and your crystals.
And join us as we get Back on the Brumstick.
Welcome to Back on the Brumstick.
I'm Leila.
And for this episode, we are sitting down with Nesbosh,
the author of Sacred Bones, Magic Bones,
Stories from the Path of Bones,
Nesbosh is also a shamaness and priestess,
and founder and head of many, many pagan groups,
including the covenant of the waters, the temple of Astarte,
and the goddess community, Scotland.
I'm Shella, and we actually met Nesbosh's sacred space,
which is a fabulous conference we've talked about in the past.
But it was such a pleasure to meet you.
And I think the first thing that pointed me out to you
was that beautiful, long, dark hair,
and then sacred bones, magic bones.
Leila's a bone girl, and that immediately drew me to you
because you and Leila have this bone thing.
I'm very afraid of bones.
I don't know what it is.
I'll look at it and I don't like to touch them.
But we ended up having nice conversation.
We hung out at Sacred Space, and we had a lovely time.
So we are so glad that you can join us today, Nes.
And if you could just tell us a little bit about yourself
and tell our listeners a little bit about you.
Well, thank you for having me.
It was such a gift to meet you and everyone in Sacred Space.
And I was also wonderful to share also one of my workshops.
With Leila.
So as you said, you know, I am a shamaness and a priestess.
I'm Ivarian.
I'm from the Ivarian Peninsula.
I'm Spanish.
But I lived in Scotland, where I am, as you said,
from the member of the Goddess Community Scotland.
And I'm a mom.
I got three beautiful children.
Two of them, quite young.
So they keep me with me.
I try to work and write in between and teach and do the things I do.
And I also study.
I'm a student in the university.
I'm a study archaeology.
Focus.
Makes a lot of sense.
Focus in on the archaeology of ritual.
Mainly.
It seems like archaeology fits you like a glove.
Speaking of archaeology and in your fascination with bones,
your wonderful book about bones.
And again, Leila will put all the links in the show notes to your books,
to your website, your socials.
But we are at the time of year where bones are our big part of ritual.
And the sister work is becoming a big part of this seasonal ritual time.
So we want to start and talk a little bit about bones,
a little bit about ancestors.
My first question, and this is what I always say to Leila,
why work with bones?
What is the connection we are getting by working with bones?
Can we start there?
Absolutely.
I mean, we start where you want.
And I think that's a wonderful question, actually.
Why bones?
If, you know, in my book, I talk about both animal and human bones.
Okay?
And I speak about how bones are a gift of connection.
The bones embody the energy of the animal, the human,
that once was held by those bones.
So I do believe that bones are that very special container of spirit.
I love that you called it a container of spirit.
That's a very cool way to put it.
Yeah.
And obviously, I'm not the only one that thinks that because back in the day,
you know, in history, our own ancestors worshiped bones.
You know, they look after the bones of their ancestors.
You know, they worshiped them.
They look after them.
They did rituals for them.
You know, they carry them around.
The mommies, you know, like fetish.
You know, they moved from one place to the other.
There are some tribes actually used to carry their mommies of their ancestors with them.
It's like, no, you're coming with me.
You belong to me.
I belong to you.
So you come with me, whatever I go.
And all the cultures used to bully their ancestors in the earth, you know, the earth, in the kitchens, you know.
And so obviously, the humanity has been aware of that power of the bones, of that magic of the bones.
You know, we can look at bones as a magic box, you know, they contain that spirit.
And that's why they're so special.
I was going to say as much as I say, I don't like bones.
Now you've kind of brought to light why I have a big container of both of my children's baby teeth.
Yes.
And that was something that I was going to mention is that even before we knew that bones contained our DNA,
that you can tell the history of where someone was from and what their diet was.
And even how they lived and how they died by their bones by this magical record of who we are.
We also know that it reaches back through our DNA.
But even before we knew all that scientifically, our ancestors created all these rituals around.
Like you were saying, Ness, honoring the bones, as someone passed, we have all these funeral rights and all these rituals,
where the bones are honored and kept in some way.
And even today, we still do that.
And I was going to mention, Shell, that here in America, and I know around the world,
a lot of people have rituals with baby teeth.
The truth fairy is pretty prevalent in American society.
And I mentioned the teeth in my book as well, because my mom used to keep oral teeth,
you know, that she used to put them in a wee box.
And I actually, for my book, I created a ritual to protect our children or family by using the teeth of our children.
And I did something similar with my children.
When they first started losing their teeth, I had little boxes that I created.
Admittedly, the first one was a pill box that I decorated, but that I made cute little boxes.
But I imbued them with energy to protect my children.
And as they would lose their teeth, I would hide them in those little boxes.
And I kept them with me through all these different moves.
And I would keep their teeth in these little and spelled boxes.
And when they each reached adulthood at age 18, I originally released those to give their energy.
You know, now they're adults, I'm no longer, I mean, I'm still their mother and still connected.
But to give that energy back to them by releasing those teeth, that was kind of my personal ritual with the teeth.
So you're no longer the keeper of their bones.
Yes, they're, oh, that's plus.
They need to look after their own bones.
Oh, you said that's a beautifully, yes, exactly, exactly.
And so even though we don't realize it, you know, that is a carryover from us honoring the bones of the people that we love,
even if we don't realize that's what we're doing.
Yeah.
And obviously, you know, we are literally, as we approach the end of September, we are literally, I mean, once we close the portal of the equinox,
we are literally in ancestral seasons.
Okay.
You know, this is not about waiting for the first show in, you know, or the 31st of October.
No, no, ancestral seasons begins with the autumn.
And there is one I, you know, when the wind comes back, blue wind cold, you know, after the summer,
and we see the leaves flying about.
And then is one I can, I can hear the song of the ancestors, you know, coming with the autumn, you know, playing with the leaves, you know, singing like a flute.
And around me, you know, the ancestors are already calling for their bones.
They're calling for their bones that coming, they're calling their children, their grandchildren to remember.
Remember me, I'm coming with the winter, you know, I'm coming with the autumn, you know, remember me, I'm coming.
And that's the song of the season, you know.
That's why I have a program I share with people online, you know, it's called, you know, your blood and bones.
And I start this program like the beginning of October because we need time to connect with ancestors
before we reach the portal of showing, you know, before we reach that date.
We have a job to connect with the ancestors and prepare their drawings and the altars, you know, and so, yeah.
That preparation period, yeah, we have a preparation period.
Yeah, it's about now.
Yeah, because if you think about it, we go through the gate of autumn in the north, obviously, we are in the north.
So we cross that gate and everything, you know, this song of bones, this ancestors start singing to us, you know.
So we need, we are connecting to death, okay?
So this is the season where we connect to the death, we connect to the past, we connect to the shadows of the season, you know.
Or our own shadows, you know, we already had a very long year before we entered this portal.
And the season, all these work prepare us to literally die in the last days of the year before we cross the next portal.
Before we go through the winter solstice portal, we literally have these few days before the solstice where we literally die.
It's all about death. It's about dying before we can receive the light and go back to life.
It's the Persephone time. This is when she goes within. This is the Anana going down. This is when it begins.
Like you said, it's not a, it's not a quick now is the time. Here's the doorway. It's a, it's a liminal space.
It's a, it's a gradual descending into the darkness. And it's honoring that descent.
And however we see that and it's, it's recognizing we need to get ready for that journey. It's, it's making those steps to connect with that energy, I think.
And finding that. And for me, I find myself a lot of times, I go out a lot more.
As the days are getting darker, I find myself clinging even more to the sunny days and being able to go out into my woods a little bit.
I think, you know, there's that rage rage against the dying of the light kind of moment happening.
And, and so I really look for that, but I also find that one of my practices is to decorate a lot this time of year.
You know, we bring the season in the pumpkins and the, the dying leaves and the, I happen to have a lot of bones.
Shell maybe not, but I have, I have deer skulls and antlers that I usually have year round.
But is there anything that you do to prepare for this time of year?
Well, like you, I try very much to be present with the citizen and to just try to connect and try to dance with energies of the season.
Because we are living in this crazy world where, or times that marked by what you need to do during the day, you know, what you need to work or you're looking after the children or whatever.
We hardly had time, you know, that time for connection. So I do make an effort to connect with the system and just tune in and just kind of open my heart and say, and ready to die again this year, you know.
And actually, last month, I have in my Patreon, the Invisible Sandals, I share with, with, with my students in, in Patreon, a ritual to literally kill themselves.
Hey witches, future Leila here, future Shell here. Wait, I'm usually not future Shell here. This is weird.
How funny.
We're just popping in to let you know she means figuratively.
Not literally. She means figuratively.
A lot of the themes and the mythology around this time of year involve figurative death, figuratively sacrificing ideas or habits or things in your life that no longer serve you.
Not literally. So just keep it in mind. She means figuratively.
Alright, so that's it for now, future Leila and future Shell out.
In the last days of the year, like, is there something you need, you want to kill? You want to let die before we close the portal?
So I actually shared a ritual and I said to them, I know a summer, but this is a very serious ritual. You need to get ready for this and you need to prepare through the system till you get to this moment.
And if you're ready to die, if you're ready to kill part of yourself, if you're ready to kill what no longer serves you, you need to prepare to do, you know, be prepared to do this.
So yeah, they're very much already getting ready for that.
You mentioned summer and I'm so glad you did because one of the things I wanted to touch on very quickly is the dark half of the year started at the summer solstice.
Yeah, that's when the dark half of the year starts and I know some people forget that, but that's when it really the days are really starting to get shorter than.
And now with the equinox is when we really notice it because now, oh crap, now it really is half and half in the dark.
We can really see the dark. I love that you have them start in the summer because that's when the dark work really begins.
I liked when you said that this is the time to kind of kill the things in yourself that no longer serve you because one thing I like to do this time of year is make lists of things that I need to be done with, put behind me, get over, move on.
You know, the whole point about these rituals like using those very last days of the year because for me the year ends right, you know, with the solstice right.
So those days before the solstice are the darkest ones of the year is literally about death and also winter is death.
Winter has been death in many cultures, many days are related to winter also related to death, you know, like Kyler and, you know, different goddesses or different days.
So the whole point was like, okay, so let's use this death, these days of death of pure darkness to do deep shadow work and use that powerful, you know, that powerful time right before the solstice to literally cleanse and kill whatever part of ourselves that no longer serve us or to kill
to kill, I mean, I'm talking like to kill, but we know it's an apothecical death, you know, but to kind of kill something whatever we need to kill in those days, so it doesn't cross the portal to the new year.
So for me was like, you know, everyone is, yeah, Christmas, you know, everyone, a lot of people celebrate Christmas, so the solstice is a happy holiday, but really we should be doing shadow work before the solstice, so that was a whole intention.
Yeah, that is the time of the kayak that is when she's walking the land and she's very scary death is scary, you know, I think even if it's a symbolic death like you're talking about, you know, setting those things down much like, you know, and Nana taking off each piece as she's descending, you set aside what, what doesn't serve you or you set aside offerings, but that's difficult, that's hard for people, you know, we're afraid of the kayak, we're afraid of the dark, we're afraid of death.
But remember what you don't shed, you'll end up carrying with you again to the next phase and sometimes that's the worst thing you can do for yourself.
Yeah, absolutely, that's why I thought, you know what, I need something hardcore, I'm going to go for this and I'm going to share it with my people in passion and I'm going to send it to the, you know, I actually said to the editor, do you want a winter ritual?
She would be happy, but she went like, yeah, send me a ritual and she got it.
Yeah, that might not be the sugar plums and pretty stars.
No, no.
Ritual she was thinking of, but it's definitely timely and seasonal, that's for sure.
Yeah, and at the end of the day, as a shamaness, you know, I'm a shadow hunter and that's what I help others to do, you know, to hunt for their own shadows.
As someone who is comfortable walking in that shadow realm, as someone who can walk the liminal like that, is there any advice or is there something that you could help prepare people so that they're not so afraid of that space?
Helping someone to maybe identify what they need to to kill off in their life or to let go of, they're afraid of letting go of that, is there any advice or is there anything that you would recommend to someone that they could do to face those shadows?
I mean, I can say to people, tap into yourself, you know how much this is affecting your life.
You know how much this is controlling your happiness, your day by day.
So if you're really tapping to yourself and you know how disturbing or sometimes destructive, it can be for you to carry that burden.
Then you're going to do for yourself, whatever you need to do, so you don't carry that burden anymore.
Sometimes you have to have that honest conversation with yourself.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
And sometimes it's easier for me to do things if I think I'm doing them for other people.
So I like how you said to have that conversation with yourself.
And yes, Shell, I'm going to mention journaling, but if you write it down, like write it down, like you're giving advice to someone else, like if your problem is say, you know procrastination or whatever, what advice would you give your best friend if they're struggling with procrastination, write that down, you know, and be that support for yourself.
And maybe sometimes if you can't find the strength to face those things for yourself, maybe if you pretend you're doing it for someone else, sometimes you can find that strength.
And in, you know, in this ritual, I mentioned, I actually also included something for because, you know, sometimes we carry the energy of other people, we carry the energy of others, other people at people's actions, you know, and things like that.
So as part of the ritual, I also try to tap into killing, whatever we carry from other people and get rid of the fear ourselves.
That's such a good point. You know, we do, we make those ties sometimes even when we shouldn't or even when it's hurting ourselves and being able to let that go is very important.
Yeah.
We talked about a little bit about ancestors and DAD and working with those energies. Do you have anything where you like to give back or to maybe make offerings to DAD or to land spirits in that way?
Are there any type of rituals or anything you do to recognize in that way?
I'm always making offerings to the spirits always is something something I do, especially to, you know, to the local spirits.
I normally, I normally keep my, my altar, but I'm packing boxes as we speak because I'm sending some stuff to Spain.
So I have this mantle, my, my altars, but I normally go to visit a local river and we go to, to see this river.
I go with my children and sometimes it's them that say, Mom, let's go and buy some milk for caramel.
You know, and we go and buy some milk for the river and we go, we make, you know, we do a prayer together and we offer caramel, milk and whatever we find in the shops like pancakes and, you know,
and so I'm always making offerings for the spirits always.
One of the questions we get sometimes from our listeners is if they make an offering, you know, if they're not maybe someplace where they can go to a river or outdoors to, to make offerings to the land spirits or to ancestors.
How can you make that big city?
Do you mean how do you make that offering a big city?
Yeah, if you don't have the link.
Okay, well, the big city is just a box, you know, the big city is just a bucket of the middle of somewhere, right?
And if you open that window, there is a steel wind blowing and there are stars in the sky, you know, that's not going away even if you live in a city.
If you don't, if you don't see them, they're still there.
We look at the same stars and the same moon that are ancestors or ancestors worship.
There are birds.
There are still we animals in the city, you know, they're parks.
They are trees.
You might not be in the middle of the forest, but the sacred is, you know, all over the place, even if we are in a city.
I'm going to pick up my wee boy from school and we cross a very VC road.
And just at the other side, it's this huge tree.
And it's very, you know, it's just grass, this big tree, next to the road.
But when we cross the road, immediately, we go under the tree and we say hello.
You know, it's like, hello, you know, we can see you and we're here.
My boy and my girl asked where when she was we.
It was, you know, she found moss, moss somewhere in a wall.
She will stop and say hello, moss, you know, and just touch the moss.
And my wee one does the same.
You know, my wee boy just touches the moss and say, oh, my mom, there is moss.
Can I say hello?
Yeah, yeah, just go and say hello to the moss.
And he just goes, touches the moss and says hello.
You see, there is life and sacred all around us.
That's the matter where you are.
You can still connect to the sacred.
You can do this.
You mentioned that your children are so connected to the natural world.
I heard an interview with you in the past where you mentioned being very connected to the water and to the sea.
And part of that has to do with your father and your childhood.
Yes.
Shell is also very much a water priestess.
Do you mind telling us a little bit about your connection to animism and to the sea?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my dad was a scuba diver in the army.
So I was a scuba diver before I was properly running.
And yeah, so I learned scuba diving with my dad.
He was always surfing or we were always sailing.
I spent my days by the beach eating whatever I could find on the beach.
I had my knife and I could just go and get stuff and feed myself.
So make a fire and cook some food or eat some star raw that I knew I could eat, you know.
So yeah, I always had this special relationship with the sea.
But then my mom is from the mountains.
And in the mountains, I enjoyed this roaming in these wild spaces.
You know, proper wild forest with waterfalls and beautiful rivers, you know, and ponds.
And so I was kind of in between the mountains and the sea.
But there was always water.
There was always water for me.
It sounds like your childhood was very deeply connected to the earth and to natural spaces.
Yeah, yeah.
Obviously, I didn't know I was a nearer divergent person.
And when I was little, my mom just said I was too much, you know, she used to say I was too much.
I had too much energy.
But I guess me being a nearer divergent person.
And also a dreamwalker, being a dreamwalker.
Because I always been a dreamwalker, walking in between space, you know, dimensions and places.
Since I was little, I guess these sensory issues that I have when I go out to the world and everything is too noisy, everything is too much, you know.
When I go to nature that was for me was like it opened that huge connection, you know, to nature in a very special way.
And my whole childhood was like very animistic, you know, everything.
I was literally connected to everything around me plus being a dreamwalker and being connected to the spirits and spirits coming to me.
Because they, the new, you know, I could listen to them, I could, you know, and things like that.
So I think it was all set up for me from the beginning.
Does that make this time of year difficult for you?
Being a dreamwalker and being in connection with the spirit world like that?
Sometimes he's heavy.
Yes. Sometimes he's heavy.
Now for folks who have kind of that similar type of connection, do you have any recommendations to kind of turn it down a while,
shut it off for a little while so you're getting that kind of mental and spiritual break from being bombarded by spirit?
Yeah. You got your contracts, right?
So write down the best closest you can for yourself.
If you know what's coming, set up your closest and say, okay, so this is my line.
I'm not crossing this line.
I don't want anything to cross this line.
Because I'm, you know, I have my space.
I got my responsibilities and I need to focus on what I need to do.
So set up your contract properly with the spirits.
I like that. I like calling it a contract.
Yeah, absolutely.
And make sure when you are in service is very important that you are in service from consciousness.
Okay, you are in service. You're not a slave.
So it's very different. You're not a slave to the spirits.
You know, I am as a priestess. I serve the gods and the spirits.
But I got my own mortal life.
And I need to be present here as well.
Boundaries are important in spirit world just like they are in the material world.
Yeah, with working with with the spirits and with ancestors to kind of bring it back to bones just just for a moment.
I'd like to talk just a little bit about working with bones in practice.
Because I know, you know, Shell gets a little ick doubt by it.
I do have some bones in my charm casting set.
I have some bones on my altar and on my ancestor altar.
And I know the reasons why I use them, which is mainly because I think that they contain so much of the universe.
They connect us to so many things to each other, to the past, to the earth, to the carbon that makes up the universe, I guess.
And so I feel that that very much just by seeing the bones of a creature or having that they are honoring the life of that being and honoring the connection to the all is a lot how I see it and why I find them powerful in my workings.
Could you talk to us a little bit about working with bones and how you work with them or honor them in your practice?
You know, I think for me, it's exactly the same that it is for you.
I find them a way to connect to everything that is and when you study the biology of the bones, how they form the minerals, everything, you understand.
You know, we are from the earth, we belong to the earth, you know.
And we are all connected by the bones because they contain the same material, you know.
When you really go into the biology of it and how they form and they function in everything is easy to understand how we connect to the world around us, you know.
To the world that we walk in and obviously, as you said, they connect me to those spirits.
And for me, that's important, especially as a shamanist, you know, as a spirit worker, I want to connect with the spirits.
So if I'm doing a ritual and I want to bring to my ritual dear energy or badger energy for whatever reason, you know, if I want to protect someone and I want to work with a badger because they're great protectors.
I actually have a badger tooth just there in the wee box, you know.
So, you know, I include that tooth as part of my ritual because I want to bring the energy of the badger to my work, you know.
So for me, well, I mentioned earlier that containers, you know, they're key to the energies, you know, to those energies.
So I want to be able to do that. Obviously, I honor those energies, I honor the spirit of those animals, I make offerings, you know.
But basically for me, they actually are a very important part of my work.
I agree. I just think that they are, it's the magical framework that kind of powers this meat skeleton around.
And I just, there's so much mystery to that for me. I know that we understand them scientifically, but there's something mystical about them.
I just, they last forever. I mean, we have bones from dinosaurs and mammoths and people that lived thousands of years ago, we know about them because of their bones.
Yeah, but you see, they are, they really are that containers, you know, they really are, they really contain the memories of who we are, as species, as human beings.
Their storytellers, bones are storytellers. They have so many stories to tell and every time someone digs out a bone, there is a story being told, but that very bone.
So that's why my book is so many stories, but it's not spooky, you know, it is not as pookies. I think it's a lovely book.
It is a very lovely book and I do highly recommend it. Again, the book is sacred bones, magic bones, stories from the path of the bones.
And it is full of stories. There's folklore in here. There's all sorts of information. There's things you can do.
So I do highly recommend it. Now you have another book coming out in December, also looking forward to it.
Yes, tell us about that a little. Yeah, of course. So there is this anthology that is coming out in December, divine wounds.
And basically, this anthology contains a story of healing, of feminine healing linked to the divine.
For many, many women approach, approach the goddess from a wound because they need healing and they approach the goddess from that wound.
But what a lot people, a lot of people overlooked is that there are goddesses that they are really wounded, like really wounded as well.
And it's funny because sometimes women seek, they vibrate with the same wound. They connect to the deities that carry the same wound, you know.
And sometimes we underestimate the power of working with a goddess that is wounded as a woman that is wounded.
And we connect the divine and human. We connect, you know, mortal and immortal. We connect through the winds.
And sometimes they are amazing stories that connect us, you know.
So yeah, the book I invited a beautiful bunch of ladies to share a story, to share a healing story connecting to a deity.
And we put them together in this anthology because I think there is, there is too much glitter, you know, when we talk goddess, you know.
You know, people tend to think like, oh yeah, new pagans, they're just about crowds and glitter and fighting unicorns.
And it's like, no, you know, there, a lot of people carry very deep wounds.
It's a deeper darker side.
Yeah, yeah. And there is a reason that it was this emerge of the dark goddess some years ago, because, you know, there is this shadow, this very deep shadow and the pain and the wounds that we carried, you know, in the community as well.
Most of the people I know in the pagan community, they have their own wounds as well, you know.
And we just get together and we connect to the gods and we are together.
So this book is kind of a breach between mortals and immortals, you know, to kind of say, hey, you worship this goddess.
Maybe the goddess has wounds, you know, you have not recognized, you have not mirror these wounds.
Look at the goddess again, you know, you might be actually be working with this goddess because there are wounds that do share with this goddess.
And we do that unconsciously sometimes, but other times we are fully conscious that we are approaching this goddess because we are wounded and we share the same wound.
First, I am going to give you an example. She is not a goddess, but she is kind of becoming a goddess because of the amount of devotion and energy she is receiving.
And I am talking about Medusa, okay.
She is a good one for now.
Yeah. And I actually mentioned her in another book that is coming. I have another book coming.
It's called Sacred Tatooine, you know, about ritual tattoo, you know.
And in that book, I mentioned how some people that have suffer sexual abuse, they actually tattoo themselves a Medusa as a way of connecting with her because she was also sexual abuse, you know.
And I think Medusa is a great example on how people connect to the myth and her story and her wound, especially if they can mirror their own wound, you know, with hair, you know.
They just start in front of Medusa and they can recognize that they can see their abuse and they can mirror their feelings, you know, with the spirit, you know.
And so I think she is a great example.
And actually, one of the authors, CNCBly, she wrote about Medusa for divine wounds.
And myself, I wrote about a Welsh goddess, Arianderoth, and the narcissistic wound, you know, the narcissistic abuse.
And I put on the table how she was actually, you know, she suffered narcissistic abuse.
Arianderoth, you know, in the myths and everything. So I put that on the table. I put the shadow of the myth, use of the myths.
You know, I put that shadow on the table for people to be able to mirror that wound.
It's very powerful because I think if we can recognize that these all powerful deities, these goddesses that we revere and that we honor, if they have wounds that are similar to ours, and yet they are still goddess, they are still powerful, then we can be too.
Yeah, absolutely. That's the whole point about the book.
There is also another author, Lindsay River.
And I actually, I asked her to bring this story to the book because she shares the story about how in Anna was actually raped.
And how she searches for the rapist, like, you know, and it's a really hard, harsh story. And she is powerful in Anna.
And actually, there is a, because I also, this year, I was speaking in the goddess conference in customary.
And I was running a workshop because I have been working with in Anna also for, you know, for some time, I will say.
It was one of the things that always pieces me off, that a lot of people knows the story of the scent of in Anna, but they have, they have not kind of explore why that she goes, how does this goddess ends up going to the underworld.
And the thing about what it strikes me from the myths is that actually when she gets raped, okay, when, you know, when she's suffered these sexual abuse and maybe you should put a content warning.
I will, I will.
She's just back from heavens, from taking the powers from her dad, okay, so she's back from heaven, she has the symbols of the powers from heaven.
So she is very powerful at that point already. And then she lies under this streak, or she's exhausted from the working heaven trying to get the powers, you know, she's tired.
She, she goes into deep sleep onto this tree and this guy, this gardener sees her sees the goddess sleeping in it, you know, in a deep sleep and abuse her when she's already like super powerful, okay.
So yeah, goddesses also suffered, they carry deep wounds and yet they are goddesses, the resilience and power and will to continue and become more strong even, you know, after, you know, it's, it's a beautiful mirror for a lot of women that have suffered abuse.
Like for me, you know, survivor of narcissistic abuse, it was actually a real rose that picked me up and kind of said, I know exactly what you're going through.
And then is when I actually surrender to the story and when deeper and she just put it on the table for me and I was like, wow, she was my mirror at that point.
And, and she helped me and actually this, this anthology of divine wounds, it's happened because, because of her.
It's beautiful.
It was my gift to her. It was like, no, I try, I actually try to submit my first article, you know, my first to say about abuse and a real rose to another anthology and say, no, because it's a bit too dark.
Everything else is a bit nicer.
And I felt so, you know, so upset, I was thinking, so you're not taking this piece because the rest of the essays are like glitter.
But we need, we need to read this as well, you know, we need the shadow to, we need the shadow, we need to look at the mirror of this wound.
I was like, no, I'm going to honor that part of the story. I'm going to honor Arianne Road by putting an anthology myself together for her.
So that's December. And as I said, there are other amazing authors that really open the wounds, you know, and put them on the table and how, you know, they've been working with different goddesses to connect with, you know, with and find healing.
You know, that's the whole point. And this is a good time of year definitely to do that. Well, thank you for sharing that. I'm definitely going to be looking for that. You said that's coming from moon books.
