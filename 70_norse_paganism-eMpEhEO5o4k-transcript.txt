welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick in this episode we'll be talking about Norse paganism heathenry the Norse gods and how you can worship like the ancient Norse I'm excited about this who are you tell us who you are I'm Leila and I'm shell who's overly excited tonight to talk about Norse paganism you don't sound overly excited shell you you sound kind of the opposite of that no actually I am because this isn't necessarily something I would by any means say I'm an expert at or have tons of knowledge about and I think that sometimes when we do these types of things if it isn't something I totally know about I learn more after the episode just like everyone else I only know a little bit about North paganism myself mostly related to runes and Thor the world tree those types of things but in the last year or so I've actually learned quite a bit more that's mostly due to the love of my life who has been more drawn into Norse paganism in the last year or so supposedly his family is related to The God foret Who is a Norse god oo yeah right it's kind of fun because we have a copy you know how you can go into your um ancestry you can go into ancestry DNA and see all your DNA and see all the documents right right well someone on his side of the family at one point has written out their entire family line because they're Scottish Lords it's well documented ooh so there's documents of his family names going back to like the 1200s from when his family was deeded land then this handwritten list goes back even further and list the founding person of the family as the God forti so in Norse mythology forti is the son of balder who is the son of Odin so Thor is technically poet's uncle and Odin is his grandfather you know back in the day a lot of royalty wanted to claim lineage from important people and so this particular family claimed lineage from foret and his last name fory is very very similar so I mean obviously not true but a lot of fun anyway I love ancestry.com that's how I found out I was related to the queen there you go see everyone's related to someone fun I highly recommend dig into your ancestry find someone cool and study about it that's kind of what my husband did so that's how he got a little bit into Norse paganism now you met him because he begged you and your husband to take him to a belain celebration back in the day which is how I met him but I'm still shaking my head at that still shaking my head oh well yeah you're shaking your head now sure but it was your fault and your ex-husband's that I even met him and if anybody wants to check that out I think it's in one of our past belane episodes but he has always been a very Pagan Soul as much as I Define myself as kind of Celtic eclectic Heathen he never even went that far he never even said he was an Eclectic Pagan until he found Norse paganism and so there's there's a lot to be said for finding something that fits whether it's in your ancestry or not and another piece to that Norse pagans practice Rune work and he is very into Rune work too that's right he has especially again gotten into that very much in the last year or so he found it we go to a uh Pagan Festival in Brushwood at Brushwood Campground and it's called serious Rising one of the people who gives workshops at Brushwood is Diana Paxton she's an author she's written a lot of books about runes uh and aatu she teaches classes on transor norl and the runes and a lot of times she'll have these workshops available at Brushwood so he started going to some of these workshops not just with Diana but with other people as well it very much resonated he would go every day to what's called a bloat or a daily basically it's a daily offering now I I learned something and I wanna I want to kind of put this out there early on I thought that Norse and Viking were kind of one and the same and I found out they're not Norse is kind of like the umbrella and like Vikings are Norse but not all Norse are Vikings Viking is a job description actually yeah I found that out that that started out as a job description yeah Viking is pretty much a job description they would go a viking it was something that they did uh not who the people were right and the Norse heathenry existed before Vikings happened and after Vikings happened so it it's it's both older and you know more continuous than the whole Viking thing a lot of people nowadays are into Norse heathenry Norse paganism because of Vikings because of the popularity of some of the TV shows and sadly because of the rise of white nationalism so we're only going to touch on that a little bit because there is a strong current especially in um United States of America white nationalists have kind of co-opted the idea of aatu Norse paganism as being some sort of unbroken white Pagan religion where do people come up with this I'm not exactly sure however if you do decide to studied Norse paganism just do your research on any groups that you get involved with because there may or may not be a strong streak of white nationalism there so fire beware probably my most the the most exposure I have had is probably been through the gods so just to kind of red off a few um some of the Norse gods include Odin frig Thor Loki ones we've heard you know balder any other ones you want to mention well they're actually broken up into three different groups there's the Acer and the vaner which are the two main ones and the gods of the AER they're the ones of wisdom War uh the hunt that type of thing and that's like Odin who's the all father Thor who's the God of Thunder Frayer who's the god of farming and I think weather uh tier who's the god of Law and of War heimall who's the Watchman and the guardian of the Frost Bridge which a lot of people know from the Marvel Series right there's braggi who's the god of music and poetry balder who's the god of joy and light and foret who's the God of Justice and Reconciliation there are of course more but we're not going to go over all of them because no one would recognize their names anyway and we'll be here all day then there's the vaner and those are the gods that are associated with uh wisdom the ability to see the future they're very witchy those are the Gods like Freya who's the big one that you'll see she's the goddess of not only love and sex but also of witches she's the goddess of magic of the cther then there's the jener the jenim and that's Loki frig hell Scotty those Gods but there are a lot of gods once you start taking a look at Norse paganism you'll find out that they practice something that's called animism which is basically that everything has a spirit has a soul is sacred and holy and so there are gods of place there are spirits of place some of them are called land whites or land Spirits are very very big in Norse paganism so there's a lot of little gods in different places as well I had no idea you knew this much about Norse paganism well like I said it's something that has always very much interested me but particularly when my husband got into it and started researching runes then when we met with Wayne Brey his excitement about the runes is catching so love him love him he is great love his book um I got a set of runes from him actually he makes runes as well and so I've been doing Rune polls every day and uh it's interesting it's definitely very interesting I love the shamanistic animistic aspect of Norse paganism and plus have you seen some of the things these sether wear the shaman basically the the witches the holy people of Norse paganism were very very earthy shamanistic think antler crowns and cool leather and the makeup I mean I'm not saying I'm into it just for The Outfits but the outfits are pretty Kick-Ass I'm just saying right who's your favorite Norse god do you have any favorites you know strike me down I I feel so Celtic right now in this conversation like I said I I I never really delved into this much you know I think that is an important thing for people to take note of you don't need to know everything there is to know about every Pantheon or or every different lore you don't you know go to what calls to you you know this is called to you at one point or another it necessarily has not with me doesn't make either one of us right or wrong it's just not something I really have a a great knowledge of and and it it's something that I never did until Rec recently um there were stories I was interested in I love Odin the all father the allseeing I love runes and yil the world tree and the idea of hanging upside down to get all of this knowledge that Odin did I I love those stories I wasn't really attracted to it until recently the one thing I have known way too much than I wanted to about is Loki I had learned about Loki is a god whatever 20 30 years ago and I had had a cat this was a very special cat you know my ex-husband and I had taken an a stray in in within weeks a stray gave birth in my closet and we had this cat and we couldn't tell if it was a boy or a girl I don't know if you remember this we kind of joked around we were like oh you know we should call it Loki because you know it's a trickster and we ended up when the cat was like whatever six eight weeks old took it to the vet the vet had a hard time Discerning the sex of the cat to this day I can't tell you if it was a male or female we'll leave it at that and that's one of the characteristics of Loki the God is they are described as both male and female they're not just a male they are shape shifter and a trickster but this damn cat one minute it was like a female in Heat and the next minute it was like a freaking lion that is ready to roar like it didn't even act like a boy or a girl like it was a Loki that cat was a damn and so I always had that you know trickster androgynous always kind of with people kind of mindset about Loki and then of course the movie we all know kind of gave you that same Vibe you know what I mean right that movie made Loki seem a little more evil I never looked at Loki as evil but more as a trickster and sometimes tricks suck yeah sometimes tricks are fun but some tricks suck and then you know oh Odin we all kind of we all have pretty much heard of Odin not that I know a lot about Odin but I I do I think of Odin sometimes is like the Fool on the Tarot deck you know that eye patch kind of hanging upside down deep in thought that could be a me thing but when I look at the fool card in uh any of the wrer weight based tarot decks I think of Odin typically as a tarot card you see Odin depicted as the hanged man you know he's got the eye patch he's hung upside down on the world tree and he's gaining knowledge but you know now that you've mentioned him as the fool I mean that's kind of fitting it does sound kind of Apt and Odin is sometimes called The Wanderer I'm intrigued right he is the god of wisdom you know and the fool is someone who is trying to speaking knowledge and so Odin is definitely someone who is considered the allseeing he was a seeker of knowledge and he gained it all that's part of his stories he sacrificed his eye and he hung himself up side down much like the hanged man in the tarot and sometimes you will see the hanged man tarot card look like Odin yeah that is exactly when I think of Odin I'm I'm thinking of that tarot card you know he was also like Loki was a shape shifter Odin was also a shape shifter but he hung himself from yasil which is the world tree which is considered to be the center of the world Norse mythology says that there are nine Realms one of them is midgard which is where Earth is and yug Dil goes through all all of the different levels so Odin hung himself upside down from yug Dil for nine days and nine nights so that he could gain all of the knowledge of the world and that's when the knowledge of the runes was given to him so that's part of that story but he is the allseeing even though he has one eye he is the allseeing all father and he knows everything he's the god of war and of wisdom of wandering and of you know everything life and death and he sits at the hall of Valhalla where Warriors go after they die in battle uh briefly I know a lot of people have also heard of Valhalla which is you know the Norse version of the afterlife it's not heaven or hell it does not correspond in that way but there are different places there isn't just Valhalla Valhalla is the afterlife that Odin sits at each God sits at their own version of the afterlife some are better than others um but his is for those who have died in battle now I need to tell you something about Thor what's that that is very important he's a big ass bro give him a beer oh my God the most important thing you need to know about Thor he's hot in the movies Chris Hemsworth oh my God oh my God he's totally Thor right seriously right but yeah all that aside you know you got the thing about Thor that always struck me is that whole I look at him as like like a thunder and lightning god he is like that kind of weather God I guess would maybe be a better way of how I see it but kind of that don't make him bring out the hammer yo yeah he really doesn't want to either I mean he'll use it like a around and find out now a lot of Norris mythology is reconstructed let's put it that way they do have the poetic edas which are basically um stories that were written down but these were written down after after Christianity had already taken hold in most of the places that practice this type of religion I call that like fifth hand information exactly so there isn't really good direct information there's these poetic edas there's other stories there's folklore that has been passed down but no firsthand information that's right so people are reconstructing a lot of this so you're going to find variations of things here in there thought I was talking about Thor how did I get from Thor to there I have no idea where you were head with that me either but Thor a bro in a lot of the stories in the poetic edas maybe that's where I was going but in these poetic edas you can find out a lot about the different gods and how they act and what they're like and what they like and don't like and you'll find in these stories that Thor is a big time bro so just like the later Marvel movies I guess where he's a little more Goofy and you know that's what he's like in these edas in the stories he is the god of storms the God of Thunder but he's also pretty much a laid-back bro now I found like a like a quote for lack of a better word that I thought was a good distinction um to kind of circle back to the whole Norse viiking thing um the the term Norse refers to settlers Traders farmers and sea farers who originally hailed from northern Europe while the term Norse and Viking both refer to people from Scandinavia Vikings are a more specific group of Norsemen who served as part-time Warriors under their Noble Chiefs so if they're settlers Traders farmers and seaf fars then the Vikings just are the Seafair grouping of that is you know what I mean just a job but I think that for some reason I know I've said this to you in private but this is something that is like taking off right now Norse magic is like exploding you know I've joked with everybody's a viking now but it's really a thing you know there is this band I don't know what they're called you know who I'm talking about I do hold on I'm gonna share my screen with you it's high lung this band I yeah because I see the girl and the guy holding up a chalice halfway down your page yeah these guys yeah yep yep yep yep yep it's high lung when I we're talking about Seether and I wanted you to show the shamanic dress this is what Seether dress like oh I have seen that I just didn't know what it was called yeah um it is taking off right now everyone is a viking and mostly because of TV there's a couple different TV shows that are very very popular right now also everyone's kind of trying to find their roots and find what did my ancestors practice folk magic and finding you know your particular Pagan Roots is super popular and the good news is as we've talked about before is you're related to so freaking many people if you want to do it that way find what's good for you if it's a closed practice and you need a teacher you better talk to those people and those teachers however everything else just go where your interest goes go where you feel that pull where you feel that uh you want to learn but Norse paganism is huge and it's it's very cool another reason for the popularity I think is because of the laidback nature of worship it's got to be the drinking horns the drinking horns help drinking is a form of offering it's a form of worship if you want to have a beer and say this is to you Odin or this is to you Thor and drink that down that is a great offering and you've done your ritual for the day Norse deities if you just talk to them if you offer your first bite of food or oh this is a cool thing I heard the other day is they offer the steam or the heat from their food the aroma from their drink interesting interesting and then they eat that the food that has given off that heat to their deity to consume that part of it which I think is kind of cool so to worship like a Norseman to worship like a Norse Heathen you would follow the seasons like the wheel of the Year particularly the solstices the equinoxes you know it follow the seasons and that's how they worshiped so really what you're telling me is it's kind of the same as a lot of other Traditions but specific to them yeah oh yeah they're all all these nature worshipping animistic religions are very very similar they all have a lot of similar things one of the big um components to remember in Norse heathenry is the is the animism part that All Things Are Holy you know they have certain standards that they want to live by if you can separate some of the bad bits asatu has like the nine virtues that are all really good things to live by and so they try to live and be good people but at the same time you know following the cycle of the seasons they'll often have a house altar to their household Spirits the spirits of the land their houses on maybe to ancestors or to deities and and give offerings there animism and the spirits of place are very very important part of Norse paganism now I have always thought something and maybe I'm wrong so definitely educate me I was always under the impression that Norse had a little fluff of Christianity sprinkled in true or false true very true okay like to what extent Norse heathenry they very much Incorporated Christianity like a lot of places that had Christians come in they pretty much just kind of became part of the community and they adopted a lot of Christian practices and then gradually Christianity just kind of took over and most of the Heathen practices were relegated to folk magic or very small Pockets where people Incorporated Christianity with their Pagan practices that maybe their grandparents taught them okay so similar to Great Britain then very very similar okay I I just then that's different than what I thought I thought that from the beginning they had kind of a Christian flare about them okay but it was more of an infiltration yeah kind of an infiltration you know they they pretty much let it happen there was no great big conquering or anything the Norse people were very fluid I guess for lack of a better word they brought a lot of servants and slaves from other places they fought and intermingled with people from all over so they got a lot of ideas and a lot of different flavors that would kind of pop up in their communities well at that time they were probably the main group of Travelers right right and so they Incorporated a lot of the things that they found and so it it just gradually over time became more and more Christian that's why even the edas the poems that have all these stories in them are heavily Christian influenced so okay you'll find a lot of different variations much like most of paganism you'll find a lot of different variations of Norse heathenry take the best leave the rest that's exactly right and find a group that works for you so there's like the vanatu group uh also sometimes called the way of the vaner and they mostly focus on the vaner pantheon there's the ratu which is like the underworld Gods I don't know much about them the asatu which again you have to be a little careful with asatu because a lot of them have been co-opted by white supremacist groups so just be a little cautious there's theodism Anglo-Saxon heathenry germic heathenry there's odinism so you can pick and choose your flavor of Norse paganism that works the best for you some have more Christian influences some have less some focus on one of the pantheons over another some are much more Wiccan based you'll find some that are heavily Wiccan influence because they came out of that group of people at that time so you know as with most things do your research and I will put a link to a couple different books and things in in the in the show description so that you can get an idea because neither shell nor I are experts while it's this is something I have a high interest in compared to me you're a damn freaking genius at this you know honestly shell that's what I love about this religion what I love about this way of life is kind of dabble in things see what you I am constantly learning new things and interested in new and different things you and I I know you're not the world's biggest reader girl you have a big  library because you are constantly reading a new witchy book or Pagan book you know we're always grabbing something new and trying something new this religion is not static it shouldn't be static it is the way of the wise and and that's one of the things I absolutely love about it is all the learning and as much as I talk about you know being into the whole Celtic Thing by no means think that that's it remember that time I dabbled in Hawaiian magic and had this like obsession with P yes I do yeah you know so so it's not that I don't like to stray away from Celtic stuff but it takes something really deep to grab me and I just like I never even really got in the runes even as a divination tool I mean how many times have you tried to Strongarm me and trying different divination tools and where do I end up tarot you know the other thing too is a lot of the magic of this type of heathen uh this Norse heathenism is very shamanistic the Seether or saders that type of magic is meditative it's deeply Dream Magic it's it's very trans it's very Trans Magic meditation trans and that's not always your jam you don't love those meditative things Gemini in me and so this type of magic where you get into a trans State and you communicate with the spirits of the land with the spirits of your ancestors to Divine the future to Divine what you should do and it's it's deeply personal and it's very heavily connected in Trans State to the land and to the spirits around you and that's not exactly your type of magic not my cup of tea exactly and and that's you know some people it will work for better than others and I think because I like that type of shamanism that type of animism it works good for you it works better for me yeah I've always been very much the meditative self- hypnosis witch you know so it's a little different and you know I think from my perspective the important thing is learn a little bit about everything so that you can decide I'm really into this and want to know more or you know that's not my thing and this is something that I learned enough about to know that it really wasn't my thing but you got to take the time to see if it's your thing or not and that's the important piece yeah exactly you gota like you said you have to keep looking and researching things until you find what clicks for you see now like I said at the very beginning I was excited for this because I knew I'd learned something and I did well all right awesome I'm glad I could help you out there shell now if I can just get you to meditate every day
