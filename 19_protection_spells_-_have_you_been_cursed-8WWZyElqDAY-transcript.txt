Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to episode 19 of back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and we're getting witchy today with hexes and curses oh and a little bit of protection too don't forget that side of it that's not the fun part hey you're talking to the little kid who used to make uh curse potions in her backyard so well I know the fun part I'd hate to be any ex of mine if we're talking about curses I had a jar once and it it was like a ceramic or maybe it was Pottery jar and it had a little plaque on it and it said hex's on X's oh sometimes you got to put an X in a jar that's all I'm saying yeah or the freezer one or the other the best part is when you put them all in the jar together [Laughter] you're just you go in the jar and you go in the jar and you go in the jar yeah what is with the popularity of hexes and curses right now because I feel like it's super popular it is I think every time I open any type of social media app Instagram Pinterest Tik Tok all I'm seeing is people talking about hexes how to get rid of the evil eye how to get rid of a curse people talking about how they feel like they've had generational curses placed upon their family I think little bit of that is over exaggeration but most curses we think are put on yourself absolutely here's the thing with with the whole protection and and hexing and cursed thing I feel like every time I get on Facebook or the Tik Tock as I like to call it everybody in their brother feels like they've been cursed they've been hexed I need to be protected from this person that person I go through my Facebook feed and I feel like 80% of what I'm looking at is hexed and cursed people when you first come into witchcraft because I'm not saying there wasn't a point in my life or I didn't think that too but I think when you first come into witchcraft you're going one way or the other I want every love spell on the planet or somebody has cursed me or some of us go down a rabbit hole where we need to read every book ever written but yeah and it's very true I think some people that and and I am not B I'm not down in anybody but I just feel sometimes when you make bad choices you try to blame it on a curse I'm going to start right off and say I think 90% of the time when someone thinks they've been cursed or hexed it's really just a run of bad luck or you've done it to yourself most of the time it's it's negative selft talk or you you know you've perpetuated these negative things in your life and that's where your quote unquote hex is coming from not an there's another option there's there is another option here my friend and it is called the ugly person that we never speak of karma there is that too and again that is another bed that we have made ourselves usually and I'm not saying that nobody's ever been hexed or cursed but I just think it's almost like a go-to thought or a go-to phrase oh you know I got on today by a bird I must be cursed no you were walking under a tree with a nest in it I don't know what to tell you but again I'm not saying saying it hasn't happened and you know I've put people in bottles before and put them in the freezer not going to lie I just think the majority of people especially baby witches just run right to the I'm cursed I'm hexed I have like a eight generation curse I don't want to say I kind of get a chuckle at but I kind of get a chuckle at because the eight generation curses are so few and far between my friends I promise it's probably not you the energy required to sustain something like that is not for the light-hearted because made someone cranky one day these are serious workings but they saw it on Practical Magic that's the problem but one of the things that we should all do is doing protection spells and protection magic because While most of the time someone isn't hexing you on purpose that doesn't mean that when your co-worker is giving you the stink eye or when your relative is talking behind your back that type of negative energy does add up and that type of negative energy can be a drain or if you were the guy doing 55 on the Mass Pike in front of me last night you might have got cursed I was pissed can't lie but I think the important piece to all of this is always going to be cleanse yourself protect yourself you know there's been times where I've had to protect myself from myself no lie doing a good protection and cleansing is a good Habit to get into if for nothing else practice it teaches you kind of that flow of getting yourself in a good place that is exactly where I wanted to go with that part I think we're our own worst enemies and I think that we a lot of times curse ourselves and doing a daily protection type ritual or protection and cleansing can help you to not only get rid of the stink eye from your coworker but also the negative selft talk and the negative energy that you have been feeding into in your own brain right right I think people get so worried about what other people are projecting Adam that they created themselves the minute you learn that there is such a thing as hexing and cursing you're like oh my God that must be happening to me and you know my mother-in-law she's mean to me she must be cursing and hexing me no she probably just doesn't like you it could be that simple it's funny that you said that because I recently was reading a book it's called production and reverse magic a witch's defense manual it was written by Jason Miller and in one of the chapters he's talking about a person that he knew who had been having a problem with their neighbor and she asked her teacher what she should do and the teacher said she should make a puppet a doll that looked like the neighbor blindfold it tie it up and nail it to the tree in her front yard facing the neighbor's house sounds like she's the one doing the cursing right and her friend was like oh wow why would I do that that I don't want to hurt him what's GNA happen happen and her teacher said nothing but it's going to scare the crap out of him and he'll do the cursing himself oh my God most of time you don't have to curse someone people who are guilty will curse themselves if you give them reason to believe that they've been cursed by you or someone else and unfortunately people who have anxiety or whose brains like mine just won't shut up are also really good at cursing ourselves so because of that I really want to talk about protection magic you know because I think we need protection not necessarily because someone's attacking us but because we're attacking us we've got some negative self- thoughts going on we've got a lot of stress with work with home life with family going on and so sometimes we need to cleanse and protect ourselves to get rid of that buildup not to mention sometimes you just need to protect yourself from the greater world you know no matter where you are listeners all the corners of the world wherever you are life is a little volatile right now society's a little off-kilter as a whole and and that's no matter where you are you know whether it's the mass shootings or the natural disasters the fires up in can like there's just a lot stuff going on that's just just negative I feel like there's just a doom and gloom over Earth right now and it sometimes it can be hard to suck yourself out of that negativity everything is heavy right now and while it might not be directed at me or you specifically it's just in the air it's in the air and it feels like it it's still an attack it's still something that's going to weigh you down and so there's a lot of things that I'm trying to incorporate into my daily practice a a meditation or a small cleansing something to help refresh and purify myself in the morning um and then later in the day kind of go back through do a small meditation and maybe reinforce some Wards I've been feeling run down I've been feeling like I have a run of bad luck you know I've gone through everything in my head I'm like am I being hexed is there something negative is Mercury in retrograde again and you know I go through all these things and no it's it's just things are kind of shitty right now but a protection's still going to help it's still going to cleans all that negativity off of you and let you kind of start fresh and give you better energy and you know went back Leila's way better at this than I am but um several episodes back we did an episode on egg cleansing and that is an easy way relatively easy way and you can kind of refer back to that episode where we talk about the the details of how to do that but these don't need to be big extravagant fullon High magic rituals you know that was the first time I had done a quote unquote public egg cleanse and hey I recommend it yes an egg cleanse is definitely a great way something to do monthly or regularly in your practice you can also just do cleanses in the morning you know say you get up and make your tea you can Infuse your tea with a little bit of energy to start your day and kind of bring that positivity what I've always done kind of more as far as a daily thing like you know I did the egg cleanse we've done cleansing rituals done cleansing meditations but as far as like on the daily thing I'm kind of more of a Talisman person probably as long as you've known me up until like six months ago I have always as you have worn a pentacle always always always but recently I found this awesome like moon phase one I am more of that Talisman person like I have I have a pentacle ring on so yeah I'm not wearing a pentacle necklace right now but I have a pentacle ring on it I've been always more of as far as a daily thing a Talisman person yes that is just as as effective and you know they get charged in you know charged in the moon or or cleansed in water as any other tool maybe but that's kind of more my jam because it's kind of a quick easy thing that fits my lifestyle as opposed to a 20 minute meditation before I'm half hour late for work you know right right jewelry because it's metal and gemstones very often it holds energy really really well so if you're going to do a ritual or a spell where you charge that jewelry to protect you and put those energies into it you can then just do that monthly and just recharge that jewelry I've also seen people take cute little charms like you can get at the craft store or at your local pagan shop charge those charms and then put them on a safety pin and pin it to your pocket or pin it inside your purse oh my God remember when we were kids we'd do safety pins on our shoes on our sneaker laces you could do that yes yeah you could do that make it uh make it cute something like that but charms are a great way to carry a protection around with you something to remind you of the magic that you've done and also just quick um because you had mentioned jewelry too not that this is necessarily a protection thing but there was a point not too long ago where I felt like I had some negative energies from other folks in my household I actually uh for the last few months to kind of repel negativity same along the same lines as protection but to repel negativity um I also actually wear a hematite ring so I have my Pentacle ring for protection and I have a hematite ring to kind of repel that negativity so I kind of keep my personal space with the two prong the repel and the protect and I think you do need to come at this from multiple ways I like to do things in multiples of three so if I'm wearing a charm or jewelry I like to have three different pieces or you know maybe five different pieces I am personally I'm big on protecting my space I like to have my house protected any place I'm staying in I like to go through and do a full cleansing and banishing and then I'll seal it and then I like to fill it with my own personal protective energy and my personal energy for my space and the way that I like to do that we did this I think together in an apartment that you moved into where we'd go around on each window and chalk a pentagram or chalk a protective Rune each doorway each window each entrance to the home all our mirrors I think we even did the faucets because folks just so you know faucets are an entrance way for stuff to get in your house just like it is water yep energy Outlets electrical outlets you can do all of those if you like you know how many times I've saged my laptop yeah pretty much every time I get off social media I think I need to Sage my laptop right right going through your home and protecting it regularly like on a monthly basis is a really really good idea there's lots of ways you can do it and I as much as I I love the the traditional go-to Sage I love sage in my house sage in all my doorways sageing you know ceiling and everything with that but that's not always an option and in my current situation I can't just be bur and Sage like Mega smoke at where I live so I have to improvise so what I do here is I do Moon water I trace all my Outlets all my doors all my windows all my mirrors my faucets my my everything with moon water because I can't be smoking up a place that I don't own 100% so you got to find sometimes Alternatives don't pull a Lila and use salt because here's why ilila please tell people why they shouldn't use salt in the home well inside your home I don't see why not yeah that's what you tell the roofers yes I did used to make circles of salt outside on a tar roof and the salt then baked into the tar roof and made a permanent white circle that was very visible to anyone who wanted to look and also outside the home salt will cause uh plants to die so you don't really want to put that out there but you don't want to put salt somewhere where it's going to eat away at the surface of your floors or rugs um or where animals are going to eat it because you actually can kill your animal if they eat too much salt so keep that in mind folks the moon water great the sage Sage is my go-to if that is an option smoke wise I like to use all the elements when I'm cleansing my house so I usually use some type of cinnamon uh I like to burn cinnamon because it's really good for banishing a sage can be used as well some type of pine any scent that you enjoy actually is great to kind of cleanse and smoke your home then for fire a simple candle maybe a red stone for water I like to use Moon water with a sprig of pine because Pine is also very protective and cleansing now now do you put the sprig of pine in the water and then you're dip in the water or do you take the sprig and use the sprig to kind of Fleck it all over like a wand exactly dip the sprig of pine in the moon water and kind of Splash it around your home and the areas that you want to protect and then for earth I use chalk and if you want to be super sneaky you can get chalk in the different colors of your paint you know and just Mark a chalk sigil Pentacle or Rune on all your different entrances so now you've used all the different elements to protect your home yeah actually I remember it when we did that in in my old apartment it was very convenient CU I had like these pure white walls with pure white woodwork so the white chalk you couldn't even tell you know you've actually reminded me of another thing that's kind of an easy secret way to do protections on yourself is to use your perfume if you use perfume or oil even your makeup as you're doing your makeup you can draw sigils on your face or on your arm in makeup that you then you know blend into your skin you can do it in an oil or your favorite perfume you you can do it in sunscreen before you rub it onto your arm or onto your body or lotion or whatever lotion yeah exactly it's a way to inscribe it on yourself to bring that protection to you personally that other people can't see just another sneaky way to kind of get a protection sigil in there now I do want to just transition real quick back to the protection slash repel slash Return to Sender oh I've got a Return to Sender spell for you shell I you know I don't know maybe it's because my parents liked Elvis or something but I always as soon as people are like I just want to just give them back what they deserve I'm like return sender address unnown and this is where mirrors come into play I love mirrors yes mirror magic can be very powerful I I love mirror magic as well now A Return to Sender spell is basically it's an I'm rubber your glue kind of thing whatever energy someone is sending towards you bounces off and sticks on you exactly so you're not actually doing negative magic against them you're basically protecting yourself reflecting it back to the person who's causing it and making them feel the results of their own energy usually with a little extra added in so it's not that you're doing anything you're just sorry I don't live here send back to the originator so if it sucks think of it this way hey that's what they sent out that's right that's their own Karma that's their own actions and if they stop they won't get anything bad but if they continue it keeps being bad several popular Return To Thunder spells will usually involve um I've seen them involve mirrors I've also seen them involve Circles of salt to kind of make a ring around that person so that anything that they send out reflects back on the ring of salt sometimes people will use not magic to bind that person as you tie knots in a string think of that person being bound and their actions being bound away Freez the freezer magic you put them in a little Ziploc baggie and freeze them but some of the herbs I like for Return to Sender um I like garlic because that kind of pushes it back to the person cloves are really good especially if someone's gossiping about you or if they're saying a lot of because cloves will also put that back on them don't say that there's G to be a clove shortage in America now everybody's always talking too much people talking there's blackberry Thorns are great for protection or Rose Thorn sometimes especially if it's an ex-lover I'm a fan of Valyrian oh that's a good one that's definitely a good one I'm also a fan of putting in a little bit of pepper flakes put in some red pepper flakes because you want this lesson to sting a little bit when it slaps them back yeah you don't want to just hand it back you know just here here you go here's you want to kind of have a kick in the ass with it yeah you want them to learn their lesson you know be the uh dealer of karma if you will and you know very rarely have I ever ever projected something not so kind and nice on someone I save that for special occasions but Return to Sender is a favorite of mine it's like you know if that's the way you want to be here here let me mirror it right back at you and and as far as in a home and how you kind of how we've equated that to protection because you've also participated in this I think probably in the same apartment we've totally mirror mirrored my apartment in the past we've mirrored our homes so anything coming at our whole not just us as a person but anything coming at our home got mirrored back to sender so you can just you can take that concept and and protect your home or you know your space or whatever the case may be I absolutely loved that ritual that was phenomenal unfortunately that was a time when there were some people that had some negative thoughts and feelings towards WS us towards you and your family in particular and when we came up with the idea to make a permanent mirrored copy of our home and direct any negative energy to this fake copy I love it I love it it's was such a powerful such a good spell such an interesting way to do the mirror spell and I'd like to put in a side note very effective it worked phenomenally there's plenty of options on on protecting yourself and it can be as simple as if you get if you've done a lot of protection meditations you can get to a point where it's almost like you snap a finger and you're protected like maybe you in a a weird social situation and you almost need like instant protection sometimes and and that's why you want to make sure you have a couple of different options and meditation is one of them because when you're not home and you are out and about it's almost like think of Star Trek Shields up you know what I mean yes and I I love my bubble I I tend to Bubble myself I I've talked before about doing bubble magic where I project the image of a think Glenda the Good Witch of the North you know that big pink bubble it looks like a big like Lila in a soap bubble Laya in a soap bubble and my meditation for protecting myself starts with building this Bubble at my core expanding it out to surround me completely so that I'm floating within it and then I imagine a big Sledgehammer from outside banging against the side of that bubble to no avail but if it shatters I know that I haven't done the work properly and I have to rebuild it and then I keep doing that until it does not shatter and that's part of what I've gotten back into as a daily practice to try and build back up that ability to in an instant bring up a psychic protective shield right so that when you're in a situation you can you can pull a Captain Kirk and be like Shields up yeah and just pull out that Glinda pink bubble and be completely in a better space and be safe from any negative energies and honestly you know I I I've had handfuls of of of baby witches say where should I start start with learning how to protect yourself step one if you really want to know if you're confused and there's you know there's elements and deities and rituals and spells where do I start start with protection start with that bubble because you're going to be in situations whether you're Christian or Pagan or or or Jewish whatever the case may be atheist you believe in nothing whatever there's going to be situations where you need to kind of like Shield up no matter who you are we've all walked into a room and felt the negative vibe we've all stumbled upon a conversation and are like oh what the just happened here because you can feel that negative energy in the air and again that's not intentional that's not towards you but you're going to gather a lot of that I you're going to kind of have it on you and so learning how to push that off and create a clean positive space is pretty important you know I've kind of in in in my day job I can't wait until this is my day job but my day job is in human services and you know I have over the years over the last couple decades gotten myself it's almost like I don't even think about it like the ride to work is like how I leave the house and how walk in the door at work I don't want to say it's like two different people but like I almost subconsciously build that bubble on the way to work because when you do work with the public in person all day you know you kind of need to Shield yourself from stuff I can only be so helpful and empathetic before it starts affecting me as a person so I need to make sure that that the public that I'm dealing with their emotions and and their sometimes negativity and and and what have you that comes with what I do doesn't get kind of soaked into me yeah and and building that work Persona is a type of shield in and of itself right and then on top of that you know you you put on your work armor your you know your work clothes and then you put on that hematite ring and your Pentacle ring and we're going to I think for an episode coming up we're going to try veiling where we wear of a veil on the top of our head or some type of jewelry on our head to protect that type of energy you do these things to protect yourself and you can find that your sense of well-being your sense of peace and and inner Tranquility can start to increase and honestly it can be as simple as it just makes your mental health a little better exactly exactly finding that space or finding that way to protect yourself really does help it really does help you to get through the day and I think the reason I wanted to bring up the work thing is because you know we kind of started this off with hexes and curses but I think we really need to emphasize the fact that it behooves you to cleanse and protect even if everything is sunshine and Roses like this isn't just when you feel like someone's coming at you like you should be learning and practicing and and implementing cleansing and protection regularly even if it's like I said just the energy from we're in a weird world right now folks you know right you don't just put locks on your door when you're being robbed you put the locks on your door to make sure you don't get robbed to prevent you from being robbed and so good protection particularly around your space around yourself around your car around your office having Wards and protections there is a good idea even if especially if things are going sunshiny and well you can you can put those WS in place while things are going good and that can make make them more powerful so that when things are going badly you don't have to worry about warding your house you can worry about taking care of yourself and and your are you talk are you talking about those two iron coffin nails I have in my car by chance iron coffin nails are phenomenal protection you can even make jewelry out of them if you feel like you could be in a situation where someone's going to be coming at you wouldn't you want to already have the knowledge and the wherewithal to to Shield up prior so you know you want to get in the habit of it so if on in the event something were to be projected at you you're good like Lea said I'm rubber you're glue what bounces off me sticks on you instead of oh my God I'm cursed what do I do you're just like play your games I ain't interested in that so these are preemptive it's like going to the dentist and getting cleaning is before the cavity yes exactly now the very first type of protection thing I was taught you know when I first found Witchcraft and started seeking out other witches and people who had knowledge I did find a couple other groups and and a couple other coven and I was introduced to the concept of witch bottles oh what's that a witch bottle a witch bottle is really just the original spell bottle we have kind of expanded a witch bottle to be so many more different types of spells but Wich bottles go back to they do also write another thing that's popular right now that's the same concept they call witch balls um they're almost like a clear ornament ball um that you can hang yeah yep same thing witch bottle witch ball spell bottle spell jars all the same thing the idea a container that you dump a bunch of in yes and witch bottles in particular are not the pretty bottles that you see today a witch bottle is actually meant to be ugly and the ones that they have found from the 17th century are Rusty  yes so you take a a container and in it you put in Rusty Nails pins knives razor blad sometimes they'd actually urinate in the in the jar as well almost always they would urinate in the jar and in it you would put the urine of the person who is being attacked and then what you also put in it is broken glass broken pieces of mirror maybe you put in some brew or Bay other you know protective herbs into it and then you'd seal it up with black wax and you would bury it usually where someone would walk so like the entrance to your home or somewhere where someone would walk over it to get to your house and it would serve two purposes one the witch would not be able to enter your home and two if the Witch sent their energy to your home they would be attracted to the urine in the jar as a tag lock of the person that they're looking for and they would go to that urine and then the broken glass and the broken mirrors and the iron would trap them in the jar and so they wouldn't be able to cause any trouble to that person or to your home again not very pretty and this jar that they found I believe was in 200 4 was dated to the 17th century and it put one of those like needles down into it and to get out some of the liquid and it actually was urine of someone who smoked cigarettes and they also found traces of Brimstone in the jar and from xray in Brimstone damn right so they also from x-raying it they saw that it had these bent and broken pins and Nails in it because the idea is you're killing the iron you're killing the pin or the nail by breaking it you're killing their spell and what that does is it now releases the spirit of that thing to attack the person that is sending the negative energy to you and the broken glass and the broken mirrors are all these fragmented surfaces that keep reflecting their energy back to them and preventing them from harming you so that's how I was introduced to a protective bottle and you're supposed to make this bottle and bury it or hide it somewhere in your house and then you should renew that regularly now how I was kind of introduced to to it was kind of and you know we've we've talked about my my love of certain aspects millions of times protection sachets you know again I'm I'm the herb lady here so it was like little sachets full of um loose incense basically protection herbs mixed together and then that kind of turned into you know I I got into all the herbs and the incense so a lot of my protection in the beginning was was with herbs and incense and either in burning or sachche form you know sachets in my pillowcases you know sachet in my car all over you know in my window sills I had sachet in my kids' rooms you know so it was more how I was kind of introduced to it was more on an herbal level utilizing herbs I love those sachets because first of all the herbs the smell of it is a reminder a very easy reminder of that spell or doing that ritual and you just renew it once that smell starts to fade exactly and into that bag into that sashet you can put a charm that you have imbued with energy you can put a crystal what I would actually do is I would put all the herbs in the sachche and then on the the string or the the ribbon that it would tie shut that's where I would put the charms is on that as I was sealing it with the ribbon or the the string yep and that's another level so now you can do all these different levels different layers of protection in your home some that you might charge monthly maybe you put crystals or regular Stones around your home to protect it and you charge those once a month and you replace your sachets that you have hanging in different places you know once every every holiday or you know how weird I have looked on occasion walking out in my apartment at like 1230 1:00 in the morning with like four bags of neighbors are probably looking at me like what the heck's she doing and I'm just laying stuff out in the yard oh don't mind me just charging stuff under the moon thanks look away it's probably easier to do that in Salem Massachusetts than it is in most towns well yes but in Upstate New York it was kind of frowned upon but you know put stuff in your window sill or if you've got a small table that you can put in front of an open window and charge it under the moon actually I've been recently charging things in the sun it's a perfect time of year to charge them in the most people think that you can only charge and and do things like that under the moon oh no my friends you can charge in the sun too different energy so no no you know know what energy you're you're pulling in or taking away but yeah I mean another good go-to is um I'm a sage lover when I have the ability I'll Sage things I will Sage things to death I love sage you know just just wand over things and you can kind of do that now we've talked about passive ways to protect yourself and to protect your space there are also a few active ways when you know specifically someone's being an and you know exactly who that person is you can do a Return to Sender but sometimes you might want to do a little bit more the the don't with me ones there are the don't with me ones and I actually found in an old Book of Shadows uh a like a chant that I did as part of a don't with me spell so are you ready for this show I want to hear this chant cuz I'm probably going to remember it and giggle my face off now keep in mind I prefer chants that rhyme and that are simple our subconscious likes them makes it easy and I find that it makes it a little more powerful so so this is from my old book shows it goes you're not worth my time and now we're through what you sent to me is now sent to you buckle up it's about to get rough karma is here and we're calling your bluff off stay gone keep your head down you'll be fine send more my way and Justice will be mine and can I just say folks all you guys out there listening I know who that was written for and it worked it worked it worked yeah they didn't keep their head down unfortunately for them that's the thing with this particular type of spell that leans a little bit more towards the return descender with a kick to it that that kind of makes me want to point something out because because I knew the person in the situation everybody always I see a lot of this in some of these newbie Facebook groups I I'm on can someone write me spell for this can someone write me a spell for that folks For the Love of Glory you are going to come up with something more potent yourself than any other Facebook friend author of a book Pinterest post whatever the case may be it may not sound like Shakespeare but it's your intent so you know Leila gives off this cute little chant it might not work as good for you because your intent to who you're directing it to is significantly different than Leila's intent was when she created that for the person she did right so even if you don't think you're a word wizard you are when it comes to spells and Magic yes and exactly like shell said anything that you write even if you find something in a book or online or use chat GPT anything that you find rewrite it rework it put your own words in there keep it simple and it doesn't have to rhyme I am but I do find that very simple rhyming couplets are good for your subconscious your subconscious likes to keep things simple and repetitive it likes patterns and so if you can keep your spells simple like that it really helps your brain to latch on to that energy you might even find yourself repeating that line over and over in your head when that negative energy is kind of being sent to you and realize that your subconscious is warding you and putting that spell back up because it was so easy and kind of got into your brain um but yeah like just do it do it yourself put your own energy in there instead of instead of asking people on Facebook or or any of the other socials to write it for you you might get better responses if you ask could you give me a rough outline that I could rework in my own wording oh that's a great way to do it great because you might get folks that might be more apt to help you if you ask for assistance instead of something done completely for you and the magic of you contributing or doing it yourself is going to be a thousand times more effective and I'm going to tell you a secret this is something that all high priestesses high priests know sh everybody don't tell anybody this is a secret shush sh shush this is just for all you witches magic is easy it's simple most of it is sympathetic like for like you know what you're doing if you want to send something back to someone and make it sting put some pepper in there put some nettles in there you know if you want to send something to someone and have it be sweet put some sugar in there some nice smelling flowers listen to your subconscious listen to what feels right for you and just do it do your research are great but but your inner self is greater than any book you're going to buy use a book as a guide and your intuition is like law of the land yep and you'll probably find as you're writing your own spells and doing more research you be like wow I just learned about this great way to do a freezer spell and I wrote that myself 6 months ago thinking I was making it up because you'll realize you have tapped into this Universal knowledge these archetypes that we all understand on a very basic level so let's talk freezer spells all right this is this is I love this and you know it's funny because I know a lot about them but I've never actually done one other than one time one time I had to and actually I think you kind of had to walk me through it let's be real yeah um so I'm gonna actually let you kind of delve into the the who what one wears and wise because you're a little more experienced with putting people out in the cold put the people in the freezer so a freezer spell is very similar to a Return to Sender spell it's basically a freezer spell freezes someone in their tracks it stops them right where they are at so if you've got someone now I've done this for a coworker and for an X but if you've got someone who won't leave you alone who's constantly pestering you who's constantly messing up your your energy your Chi whatever you've tried all the conventional methods do a freezer spell super super simple take a Ziploc baggie pen and a marker shell likes bay leaves you don't have to use paper you can B fan she is you could use you could you could use anything you could use a piece of paper a piece of napkin a piece of cardboard whatever anything write that person 's name on your paper and you could also write more you could beite you could write off Becky don't talk to me again could write whatever you want to on there Becky with the good hair that's right hell away from my man anyway so write that person's name on there right why you want them to stop if you want to you can even sprinkle in some herbs some black salt for warding you could you know whatever you want but you could just keep it simple with their name and water in the Ziploc and then ezure writing their name down and you're putting the little bit of water in this Ziploc imagine that person being frozen in place being frozen out of your life being frozen away from you unable to move towards you or to put any type of energy towards you in any way they're completely blocked and it's like 100% block kind of thing put all that energy into it and then put it in the literal freezer and then leave it there but tell them the coffee out of it like say if your power goes out yeah if it melts they're run fro Frozen yeah and a lot of times there's usually a boomerang reaction I've found if you melt it once the spell has run its course hopefully before your power goes out and it unfreezes you can take it out and let it thaw out and then release it in running water I like a toilet or you can toss it in your garbage and just get it out of your house once it's run its course what's that mean they stop talking to you like what what you'll usually know um if the spell has worked this person should stop talking to you and stop bothering you and that could happen in numerous ways it'll either do one of two things it'll either stop working in which case you'll have to do maybe a more potent spell or it'll work so well that eventually you'll feel like you yourself are able to let the situation go that you are over this situation over this person and at peace with the situation and because now they're gone just don't freeze out someone that you don't really want to freeze out you know care for what you wish for you just might get it that's right this one is is reversible you can then pull it out and either again let them go permanently by releasing it into running water or into the garbage or you can thaw it out and just say you know I'm open to renewing this relationship or I'm open to thawing out this situation you know you can do either one if I was looking to freeze you out permanently if my power went out I'd burn the bay leaf done burn that bridge burn that bridge that takes it from a temporary as long as you need it to spell to and immediately you're gone and and that works too some people you need to do that and sometimes you might need to take a little bit of time with a freezer spell before you know if you want to burn them out completely or not you just need things to cool down for a while but I think wrapping up here the biggest the biggest takeaway we want everybody to know is practice protection and cleansing yourself because no matter where you are what you do where you go no matter if you're new been doing this a while or a seasoned vet everybody needs protection and cleansing if for nothing else the outside world yeah we all Walking Through This World We Gather a lot of negativity most of it's not directed at us it's just the kind of way things are it sticks and and I also want to say that for anyone out there who thinks that they're cursed or hexed I would definitely say you're probably not so take a deep breath and then practice some cleansing and some protection and if you're doing your daily cleansing and protection spells you'll know if it's just the detritus of a a difficult life or if it's actually something that might be coming from someone you know maybe you've got a cranky ex or maybe your ex has a cranky new girlfriend I don't know or maybe you're super super sensitive and super um empathetic and you're just dealing with a rotten human being yeah so definitely I think a a daily practice is a really good idea and that will help you to determine if it's just regular daily yucky crap or if you're actually being hexed and if you have been hexed you now have the tools to deal with it and if you'd like to converse further uh about putting hex's on X's email us at back onth broomstick gmail.com don't we have a FY butthole curse floating around there on YouTube somewhere we do we do and uh maybe if if you if you're all good we'll we'll give you'll find it yeah we'll find it so um take care of yourself make sure that you're not cursing Yourself by accident be good to yourself love yourself take care of yourself and take care of others there you go and uh we will see you next week on back on the broomstick keep it witchy
