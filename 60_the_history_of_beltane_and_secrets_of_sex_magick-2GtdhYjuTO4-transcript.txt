the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick in this episode we'll be talking about the wheel of the Year holiday of belan and also about a type of magic that goes hand inand sometimes with belain we'll be talking a little bit of Sex Magic today as well I'm Lea and I'm shell and I'm so excited about this next notch in our wheel this is a good one belane has always been one of the favorites in particular in our community it was the first outdoor ritual it was the first time was warm enough and nice enough for everyone to get together outside get our toes in the grass and in the dirt now the reason we're kind of pairing this with Sex Magic is a we had a listener ask and B because the whole fertility thing with belan they really do kind of go hand inand and honestly when I think of belain I am like this is the first time I can go camping and go out frolicking in the woods belan is May 1st in the North Hemisphere and in the southern hemisphere we would be saying happy sin right now belain is a fire Festival it's about fertility it's the height of spring and it's the very first glimmerings of summer traditional Irish festivals it was actually considered the first day of summer and it's all about sexuality sensuality Vitality passion joy and the beginnings of abundance well and we can't forget the other thing um that belan signifies especially here in the Northeast the thing that that coincides with belaine is it's opening a camping season my friends oh yeah hooray hooray the 1 of May outdoor camping begins today right and you know another thing and we'll talk about this in a minute and I know that this is one of the things that you love more than anything about belain I also want to talk about flower crowns I do love flower crowns I also think of flower crowns when I think of belan obviously you can make them all summer long but there's something about belain and flower crowns traditionally flower crowns were used to Mark the queen of the may people also would decorate their Windows their doors with flowers again to signify that abundance and to honor the goddess who's in her maiden like blossoming into mother phase she's she's looking for a mate her ferle stage exactly flowers are also Associated sometimes with the Fay and May 1st is also a time of fairy magic it's a time when traditionally the tuaan were considered to have come into Ireland on May 1st and you can honor them on that day by leaving offerings of food or money sometimes by water or in your garden now I just want to throw in here left turn real quick fun shell fact so we've talked about in the past about how I kind of grew up in some non really religious atmosphere my grandma always made us celebrate Mayday we would make baskets and my family was big on like ceramic making it I don't know Ceramics were a big thing and I remember as a kid painting ceramic they looked like wicker baskets but they were ceramic and then we would put we'd go out in the yard and put flowers in them now ask my grandma we were not Pagan or involved in witchcraft whatsoever but I remember making these Mayday baskets and doing the flower thing there was a song I don't recall it even in my bad singing voice you know I'd sing it if I did but I think Mayday is celebrated kind of by everyone is like that put your winter clothes away you know you can finally go outside you know here in the Northeast that's really the beginning of planting season like the world opens up May 1 it really does and it's not just that I get to go outside barefoot then either there's so much more that happens and you know it's funny that you mentioned painting the ceramic baskets because there was a tradition in my family that my grandmother would have she'd get all the grandkids together and it was paper though she usually used newspaper but she'd have all these flowers that she had gotten some of her first flowers from her garden a lot of daffodils some tulips you know some of those blue bells and things like that and she would wrap them up in paper and then she would send her Army of grandchildren now this is a woman who had nine kids and they all had many multiples of kids of their own damn right she'd get all like 25 of us or whatever together and she'd get each of us these newspapers all prety wrapped with a couple flowers in them and what we were supposed to do is run to a neighbor's house put it on their porch ring the bell or knock and run away what you really do that's what we did no that's exactly what we did it was fun it was kind of like ding-dong ditch but you left the flowers there on May 1 I love how our non-pagan grandmothers celebrated all these holidays my non-pagan very Christian grandmother said it was to bring luck and fertility and blessings to the houses that you did it to so she's a witch she's a witch I know she was she gave me my first deck of tarot card so she was definitely a very spiritual lady but she never would have said she was a witch Never Never So giving flowers and things like that is very traditional especially yellow flowers and I've also heard that it's considered bad luck to bring Hawthorne flowers into your house except on May 1 Bel on belain you can bring them in and it brings blessings to the house now I would be remiss if I didn't mention this especially for my cup and peeps who are listening love you guys I'm not allowed to call it belain I want to say what oh Colin my okay got it oh yeah that's the Welsh word for it seriously well they'll be like oh yeah well we're going for blah blah blah and I'm like oh yeah I'll be there oara I'm like you gota you gotta learn and I'm like oh belain and like gotta learn yes cuz you are in a formal Tradition now and you have to do it the way of the tradition after 30 years it's [ __ ] belaine Colin ma is hard for me to like I'm having a hard time adapting to new words it will always be belaine in our hearts it will be I'm willing to argue the mabin thought but yeah call in my so I wanted to mention that I am trying to learn in my Welsh traditional Cen if I'm saying that wrong I apologize I'm learning here people so my point is is that different people call it different things but belane is probably the most standard name belan means the fires of bells sometimes people say there's a god named Bell who's the grain man and Tain which is fire there is a tradition of jumping the baale fire at belain um especially if you are looking to either become pregnant or get married I've jumped the fire I've done it it worked got a beautiful sun to prove it but let's talk real quick about the the tradition of jumping the fire what's that all about Lea that came from again traditionally Irish uh ancient Irish people would put out all the fires in their home and especially back in the day it wasn't as easy as it is today to Kindle a fire so that was a pretty big thing if you put out your hearth fire that that's pretty significant so they put out all their fires and they'd go to you know some place in town or out of town where the baale fire was kindled a big huge bonfire usually two of them and they would pass their cows through to get their cows blessed or their cattle or their sheep people would leap the fires like shell said to uh hand fast or to ask for a lover they'd also leap for fertility or to purify themselves because these are considered holy fires and then at the end of the celebrations people would take that fire back to their house and rekindle their Hearth fires from the central fire so everyone would share in that same fire and actually I've read in a couple places where people try to keep that fire burning actually all the way till sa and they'll bring it in as like a hear fire an inhome fire so to say and that they would try to use it for cooking or what have you within the home and never let that fire die until sin and we do know that belane is one of these celebrations that is definitely ancient in the 10th Century BCE there's a a king known as sanis Cormac he was an Irish Bishop King and he wrote belain took place on May 1st to celebrate the beginning of summer in this writing he talked about that they would make two fires to drive the livestock through so we do know that this is a celebration that is at least a thousand plus years old wow wow well you know I I also look at belan like you had said a little bit ago as kind of a new greeting with the fairies so to say I look at it as like the fairies kind of like a lot of things in the winter in my opinion I could be wrong who the hell am I but I kind of see them like going dormant for the winter like hibernating you know like how the bees go away for winter I feel like in my opinion that the fairies kind of go away for the winter and I feel like this is like their Awakening where they come out where you want to leave things for them and kind of remake that connection again for the year like I said this could be some [ __ ] in my head but that's how I look at it well the Irish and the Welsh you know that they're very connected with spirits of place and with the F and with the Tuan and the higher fairy folk and they have a lot of Legends and a lot of their holidays are intrinsically entwined with these creatures so you can't really separate them and I agree with you know historically they're said to have come to Ireland on May 1st so it it makes sense that they would awaken at that time there's also a lot of tales you know how we talk about it sa that the veil between this world and the spirit world is thin right you know people also talk about at belan the veil between this world and the world of fairy is very thin and so you need to be careful fairy magic is not to be trifled with you don't make promises to them you don't say thank you don't give them your real name don't bring iron but it's a good idea usually to keep some iron back what did we we did a ritual to the Fay once didn't we take our athm iron aemes and we bound our coven cords to the AEM Struck it in the ground outside of the circle and then tied the other end to our ankles while we were inside the circle just to not bring that iron into the realm of the Fay but to have us anchored to the real world with that iron in order to keep us protected so be careful and don't [ __ ] with the Fay that's my advice yeah there's a lot you know I am such a [ __ ] on in find out person and even I am cautious so just saying that yeah but leave them offering especially in your garden if you want to leave some seeds out if you want to leave a little honey excellent offering honey fruit sweet things like that Natural Things dried flowers uh little bobles things that are shiny so that can be good too another tradition back in the day we'll call it is people used to often visit the holy Wells on belain and they would pray to the Wells for health and you know kind of good well water for the year it really seems like the time of year in history where folks would kind of give blessings to the newness and give thanks to what has kept them through the hard winter and they were hoping for that fertility they were hoping for those blessings and one of the ways that they celebrated that that we continue today is the mapole dance you have the mapole itself which represents the phace the God and you put that into the Earth representing the goddess and then you dance around it and weave ribbons to symbolize the union between god and goddess the the very spiral of life you know and and the whole dance itself is is Raising joy and vitality I just remember it in our local community rituals way way back I would sit there and and I know I would say this out loud I don't know if you remember this I would start chanting put the pole in the hole put the pole pole in the hole I love a good May pole and you know everybody out there if you have a chance to participate in a maple dance good time good time don't get twisted up tied up or trip on yourself but good time another thing that our particular community did in in conjunction with the mapole was we picked a May queen enime king which is another traditional activity that goes back to these ancient rights of belain or Colin ma Colin ma Colin Ma and they would usually pick a maiden that would represent fertility and and the land that's waking up and then a a young man would get picked to represent the Vitality of the God and the green earth and the oak king and the two of them would symbolize the sacred marriage sometimes called the Heros gamos you know the union of the Earth and Sky the goddess and the God I just want to point out that if I if memory serves me you you were picked as May Queen like at least twice and I was never in my life may Queen just saying just saying just putting that out there being May Queen is pretty transformative especially in our community it being May queen or may King it's chosen by chance by Fate by chaos by the goddess herself you're tasked with carrying the energy of the community and you feel that it's an actual weight that you feel there's there's a tad bit of responsibility that came with it like a yes I don't want to say like a spiritual responsibility but kind of it very much felt like it it really did the May King and may Queen we're not expected to fool around or have sex in our community although it it wasn't unheard of but in the past traditionally the idea was that the May queen and the May king after the ceremony would go off test that fertility stuff that's right and some people would wander off to the fields or to the forest or to someone else's home and I don't know how historically accurate this is but I've seen it it mentioned quite a few times and it was certainly taught to us coming up that it wasn't not considered bad to go off into the forest with someone who was not your significant other you went with whoever you felt like going with to fool around to have sex in the woods to bless the land and any children that were born of these unions were considered holy they were considered given by the goddess and very often whoever got pregnant you know sometimes a hand fasting would come from that to help take care of that child under Irish law under Celtic law they call it brhon law there are nine different types of marriage and one of them was just specifically to look after children which was probably the kind of hand fasting that they would do after a belain child was conceived but you know it doesn't have to be all you know stranger danger either we've mentioned this in a past episode I at one time in the past had literally got married three days before and we did a whole I mean we did a rich we we did a monthong or two monthong buildup rituals to this but Our intention was I had had a girl already and I wanted a boy and we kind of did some belain magic to assist me in getting pregnant with a boy and hey you know knock that one out of the park let's not tell my son that he is you know Godly and holy because his head will expand way too big but you know these are things that yeah they did these a thousand or 2,000 years ago but these practices are still kind of upheld to a certain degree today in work and although I think the emphasis on sex and belain really ramped up in the older communities it was a Wiccan thing that very much played up the sexual aspect and everyone going off and having sex with each other and while that was very prevalent in the 90s and early 2000s that has very much slacked off in the last few years oh yeah while I wouldn't say that pagans are prudes by any means um I mean polyamory was a thing in Pagan groups that we knew and has been for decades any type of sexual flavor you can think of is okay as far as pagans go but belan is all about the union of the God and the Goddess that does not necessarily have to mean a man and a woman it means youra and your animus your active and your passive side your what would be considered traditionally masculine attributes like will like having will and strength and traditionally feminine attributes like emotion and nurturing and merging those taking that polarity and kind of finding a melding of that and you can do that within yourself you can do that with you and your partner does not matter what sex or gender at all that you are you can find those dualities within yourself and within your partner and a phenomenal way to do that is through sex magic I know you're leading into our next topic but I just wanted to take that thought and circle back to the balefire MH in our old Community there were people that you know they had no interest in the whole relationship fertility aspect that wasn't where they were at which is absolutely fine so they would take that opportunity to jump the fire to plant maybe a seed of intention or you know they they were still kind of fertilizing an idea giving birth to a thought so it doesn't have to be taken down the literal sexual Road even though if you're going to say that if is there a holiday in the Pagan religion that has anything to do with sex this is it not going to lie but it doesn't have to be it can be about you know impregnating your ideas your intentions I just wanted to put that out there yes and this type of energy is something that if you're following the cycles of the year if you're following the cycles of the seasons the Earth is EXP FL floting with abundance and new life and you can use that for your own explosion into anything you want to start school now is the time to plant those seeds so that it can grow you know you want to have a baby you want to have a relationship you want to buy a house whatever it is you want to grow that you want to see become its own thing you know like a like a baby would be I guess now is the time to plant those seeds it doesn't have to literally be sex equals the sex act fertility equals baby it can be fertility of ideas and creativity you know use those thoughts and transform them I mean we're [ __ ] witches that's what we do we transform this energy so you're taking this raw energy of all these rabbits that are out there and the birds that are having babies and the the flowers that are bursting out of the ground you're harnessing that new fresh growth energy and you're channeling it and transforming it to work your will whatever that happens to be I am like a 12-year-old boy because you just said rabbits and all I kept thinking about is [ __ ] like rabbits such a belane thing but again does not have to be you know in our old Community there was a tent off in the woods that was the Temple of Aphrodite and you could go there and get your freak on but a few Fields away we had crafts and you know kids making ribbons and doing hula hoop dancing and flower crown making flower crowns everybody had flower crowns on and in the middle was dancing bonfires and feasting those things were all there kept separately but you know you could honor and worship in whatever way you felt called to and comfortable doing consent at belain in Sex Magic in life consent is Queen that's what you need consent consent consent now let's take a minute what is sex magic I mean are we just banging here like where's the magic in it let's talk about that because you know I think this is where we get a bad rap is this topic everybody thinks that witches are sex crazy I guess just as sex crazy as your average person right I was gonna say it's not like we're not but you know just as much as Jo blow down the street you know before we get into what Sex Magic is I kind of want to address the whole whiches our sex crazy because I do think that we do have that image and a lot of it is because we have been so accepting of so we're so sex positive we're body positive we're people positive you know we have never had issues in the Pagan Community with lgbtqa never never never never any issues with trans people none of that I mean we've talked before on belaine episodes about how the very first May queen of our Pagan Community was a biological male and that's never been an issue I can't help that I'm freaking sexy in Black that's very true and you do you a damn sexy I might add so but you know polyamorous couples I mean we knew thres back in the freaking 80s and it was no big deal and communication and consent has always been a Cornerstone of any Pagan event that I have been to where anything sexual might possibly happen rules are stated in the beginning there's a lot of communication it's very open I think the reason we get a bad rap for it is because pagans as a whole are non-judgmental as long as you ain't heard anybody we don't give a [ __ ] what you're doing and it gives people kind of more of a platform to be themselves instead of hiding you can go and wear a raccoon tail and nobody's gonna blink an eye you know you can go and have a thruple and nobody's gonna blink an eye you can't necessarily do that in mainstream you know what I mean part of the bad rap is because we don't make a big deal about it right open relationships and things like that are only just now hitting the mainstream and they have been part of pagan culture for a long time and I think because we have been so sex positive and so sex open that's why you know we're not afraid of sex or our own sexuality and that scares people and you know we're willing to have the conversations and we're willing to have you know talk about it and have discussions and other large groups maybe aren't and are uncomfortable with it so that gives the appearance that we're sex crazed when really we're just okay with talking about it and don't give a [ __ ] what other people do exactly exactly and like you said earlier as long as you're not hurting yourself or anyone else get your freak on we don't care we're not going to yuck anybody's yum yeah and and I think right there is is why we get a bad rap because you know we're not going to yuck the Yum because sex is awesome and we're very happy having it and you know very happy celebrating it it's part of life and there's nothing wrong with it it so we're just not afraid to say it yeah and I think that sex magic plays a very important part because you know like we've talked about in raising energy episodes sex is one of the best most potent ways to raise a phenomenal amount of energy in a very short period of time whether by yourself with one or multiple partners an orgasm is a [ __ ] ton of energy to put out into the universe the trick is keeping your spell and your intention in your brain while your partner is blowing your brain or other parts of you which is why I personally recommend that don't be doing this unless the other person is aware like if yeah consent for sex is one thing but there has to be consent for magic during sex does that make sense yes sex magic consent if you're raising energy with your partner they should be aware of it my recommendation for Sex Magic is it's very power F it's a fantastic way to do the energy raising part of your spell I do recommend that if you're going to use it as the energy raising part that you keep a chant or just a couple words in your mind to help you remember your intention or better yet create a Sigil for your intention and put it like on your headboard or on the mirror across from your bed or somewhere where you can see it while you're fooling around so while you're having that orgasm or your things are really intense and you're raising that energy you can just stare at that sigil and push the energy into it without having to have too many thoughts in your brain it's probably a little busy and occupied I can't I can't I can't even tell you where I was just thinking a Sigil could go that's a whole different x-ray yes bodily fluids if you want to draw sigils in using bodily fluids those are pretty powerful if you have sex during your period that can be also extremely magical I have heard a lot of people think that you can accidentally bind someone to you if you have sex with them while you have your period and I'm going to say honey there's no accidental about it right if you're not thinking about a binding spell while you're having sex period or no you're not going to be doing a binding spell but if you are but if you are so that that's really what I mean by accidentally so it just having sex with someone on your period or during a full moon or whatever that in itself is not a spell I don't care how mind-blowing the orgasm is but having sex with someone and intentionally trying to bind them to you or weaving that magic and you'll know that's what you're doing you know what you're doing right then yes that can bind someone to you and again that goes right back to consent consent for the sex consent for the spell and you know people think that oh if I bind him to me he'll love me just be careful that I mean put that up in the same category is if I have his baby he'll love me more you know yeah yeah and don't it's the same thing as you know don't ever tattoo someone's name on you yeah right guess that's another version of don't do Sex Magic and bind someone to you because it usually ends very badly bindings like that even when your emotions and your feelings sour that binding is still very strong and that's just going to create bad magic and bad energy between the two of you because it's just going to bounce along inside that binding and get worse and worse and you know just with any other magic intention is everything with with sex magic and it is easy to lose focus not gonna lie I not that I know this hahaa but you know if you go into it knowing your spell and your intention and during climax you focus on your intention if you forget to focus for a minute in between you're all right oh yeah you're totally okay Sex Magic energy is very very potent and honestly you don't need to do anything differently if you want to get out your magic wand hahaa or your rabbit haa you certainly can get your magical tools out for Sex Magic but you don't need to what you really need is an intention this can be as elaborate of a spell or ritual as any spell or ritual or as simple as drinking a cup of tea it's up to you and you know you're thinking how can I do a ritual you know I have to cast a circle sudden altar you can cast a circle around your bed make your bed the altar yeah you know if you want to burn candles and incense you know what better for romance you know have a little wine or you know smoke a joint together ritually beforehand as part of your magic as part of your spell [ __ ] your whole date could be part of it go out to a nice dinner or make a dinner at home together depending on what your spell is you could add ingredients to that dinner again make this as fancy or as simple as you want the spell could be in the spur of the moment you and your love are together and you're like hey let's have sex and raise energy to get better jobs or get a better house get a better living situation have a baby you know whatever it happens to be and then both of you have that idea in your head as you're fooling around that's all you need you know it it really is something to be careful of because you know like you said before this is another point of the Year where the veil is thin and spirit is here in your spells oh yeah they're listening yeah and especially if you're screaming something out in the middle of an orgasm they're listening and they're paying attention so make sure that you're asking for something that you really want I guess careful what you wish for that's right especially if you get the Fay or spring magic involved definitely be careful what you wish for for sure so for my son who's listening we wished for you love you buddy a I keep going back to Kamasutra there's the Kamasutra oh my gosh Sex Magic is definitely not a pagan thing there's the whole Kamasutra there's um calini yoga people have been harnessing sexual energies for centuries I mean look at what Christians do they make people not have sex ever as part of keeping their power to be like nuns and Priests right they don't ever have sex so controlling someone's sexuality is in all sorts of different religions in our religion using that energy to express yourself to create energy to do spell workk is is very very powerful and also I remember a time when it may have been the May king and the May Queen would act as like the the Incarnation of the God and the goddess and the act of sex was the coming together of the God and the godess hero gamos yeah the great Union it wasn't even about you know Joe and Sally it was Joe and Sally were embodying the god and goddess so it was almost like it wasn't them as people like the god and goddess were invoked into them kind of using their bodies to [ __ ] you know you know what I mean it's the great right it's the whole blade and the Chalice it's the you know the God and the goddess just like literal great right the literal great right on belain in order to bless the fields to bring fertility to everyone so maybe for belaine if you're lucky enough to have a partner or Partners you can think of that energy going out to heal the land to bring fertility and growth and joy back to everyone in your you know people in your circle people you love although I guess that sounds kind of weird if you're having sex you're like I want my parents and my family to have all this great joy that might be a little odd but okay I've never done that in reference to my children or my parents that's creepy and weird okay no no I can't say I ever have either but you know sending that energy out and that's an excellent way to to celebrate belain is to uh to have that Joy if you if you want to do that again all of these things don't necessarily have to involve a partner you know if you're out there single playing the field don't feel like well I can't participate in belain because I don't have anybody to [ __ ] it ain't about that set your intentions plant your own seeds have sex with yourself have your own orgasm be your own seahorse people here you go you know find that Duality within yourself have yourself a good old time and use that orgasm to power your spell you don't have to have any partner whatsoever nothing wrong with that so as you're celebrating your belain just remember that this is one of the two very old celebrations that has been around for quite a while I don't want to say the second most important or or tied for most important but you know belain and sin they're the two main out of our eight holidays really yeah you know how some people say that they're like Christmas and Easter Christian right some people are belane and sa and pagans I guess right right right but those were traditionally the two that the ancient Irish the Welsh did celebrate you know the the other ones were lesser were more localized or were more modern inventions but those two are definitely historically very very old so you are continuing a long line of people having sex and getting freaky for thousands of years W so get your freak on have fun celebrate the Earth celebrate yourself celebrate fabulous sexuality and growing life and make a flower crown make a flower crown go out and put your feet in the grass feel that new life all around you and celebrate New Beginnings in so many areas of your life bring in that creativity that vitality and that joy and just you know let the sunshine in
