welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I'm shell and today we're going to be having a conversation with some very good friends of ours founding members of the coven circle amarat with us and which is from way back in the large and wonderful Pagan community that shell and I were both involved with facilitators of rituals large and small teachers leaders and male witches our friends John and Kevin welcome Jonathan and Kevin would you guys please introduce yourselves I'm John I'm um been uh around the Pagan Community for a number of years um probably since I think I started in 1990 and um have been around uh many different circles I'm very eclectic I don't belong to any particular path or tradition so I I think I have a kind of neat perspective of learning from a lot of different people and a lot of different traditions and ways and so you know I've enjoyed the whole past so far and here we are welcome Jonathan and I'm Kevin River day amarat back in the day I've uh started my journey about in the early 90s it uh again very eclectic and currently do not I'm not in any part of any group but uh I'm definitely part of the getting back on my broomstick been an exciting Journey so far the conversation today that we're having is around gender and what it means to be amaz man in a spiritual practice that has often been seen as woman Centric and Witchcraft and more specifically wiah has a complicated history when it comes to gender on one hand it's a sanctuary for those who identify with the divine feminine offering an alternative to patriarchal religious structures and on the other hand the focus on the feminine has sometimes led to the exclusion or marginalization of men as well as non-binary and gender queer individuals so the conversation that we're having today is hopefully evolving becoming more nuanced and inclusive we recognize that gender is a spectrum and that this spectrum is reflected in the divine the god and goddess are just the tip of the iceberg today's witchcraft is making room for a more complex understanding of gender one that includes all identities and expressions Kevin you were one of the first witches that I worked with on a regular basis one of the first male witches I think I worked with on a regular basis but I I guess this kind of answers the question can a man be a witch are you a witch absolutely I I've I've always thought that I definitely agree with some of the things said in the intro uh that uh some you know definitions are evolving which they should and I've evolved with them but even from the very beginning yes I am a male and I am a witch how about you Jonathan I totally identify as being a witch I just don't um you know I might not identify as being Wiccan per se but I definitely identify as being a witch I that I I like to say I have Wiccan DNA because when we were learning you know in the late 80s early 90s a lot of everything was wiah it was it was all Wiccan Centric yep yeah it was everywhere so I also say I am not Wiccan but I I do have Wiccan DNA because there are some Wiccan things that I just can't get rid of you know calling the quarters casting a circle the doing that for every ritual it's kind of ingrained in me a little bit yeah but I think like a real like witchcraft is more like a little more Primal a little bit more like in your DNA in your soul it's it's something that comes from within us and and wi is something that kind of is we we reach out and learn from externally but it might not necessarily come from within oh I love how you said that yes you know you've always been that to me Jonathan since I've met you you have always seemed like a very Primal witch a very Primal Pagan and I think it's from you that I really learned to work with elements and drumming was something that I learned from you as well and using incorporating drumming in ritual and using that type of energy which for me very much comes from within kind of a deep well inside very cool you know I wanted to point out that I am very glad that both of you John and Kevin have identified as a witch because I never really thought that the gender thing was an issue with witchcraft because when I did my first ritual Kevin and John were a part of that so from ritual one all the way through I have always known men to be a part of the circle I was never part of a female only Circle or a female only group and so to me it's just normal that men are a part of it but we see a lot on the internet right now where men are kind of feeling ostracized or feeling like they're infiltrating a female only thing and that's kind of weird to me like I said because from from my very first moon ritual at John's house on the third floor it's always involved men that was the best it was it was those are good times you know that's a good point shell because the Pagan community that we all kind of grew up in was very much everybody it had men and women in it there were wiccans there were witchin there were pagans and heathens of all different types of belief systems and we all came together and formed this beautiful eclectic mix it just worked without question yeah I mean I remember there were like alexandrian groups and there was like a little bit of Gardiner then there were these you know totally eclectic group and all these like little some Shaman folk Shaman folks um solitary practitioners and it was neat to see all those people come together as a group it wasn't just even just like men and women it was like a fusion of traditions and belief systems and ideas and throw in a little bit of chaos and let's just go and wing it and we're not necessarily going to go with the rules and then you know sometimes there would be tensions like you know what we're a very structured group and you're not very structured and we're going to have to figure out how to mash this up and there'll be a little bit of attention and a little bit of like uh I we used have a lot of dialogue back in the day we used to have to really dig through like our issues and and um get to the root of compromise yeah compromise that's a good point because there were so many different types of people in that group we did have to learn compromise and one of the biggest compromises was one of the biggest rituals that we would put on regularly and that was for belane and belain would generate people would call that ritual a year ahead of time and they would have meeting groups with the community and everyone would get involved and it would always come out great even as difficult as that process could be i' point out that Circle armat started the calling it a year in advance and and we uh kind of set that Trend and uh other people picked up on it I thought it was great fun calling the the year 2000 wasn't it it was great the year 2000 belain we did that one yep but going back to the community really quick and how diverse and eclectic it was kind of circles back to what what we were saying about a wika it seemed to be like the Common Thread was the framework that wiup provides you know the calling of the quarters calling the god and goddess and what you filled that outline with was just so eclectic and different and everybody was able to offer just what they believed to everybody else everybody else you know took what they wanted left what they didn't need and I think we grew everybody in the community grew spiritually that way and I do think that it is is interesting to point out that you know we talked about having to have focus groups and work out our issues to get ritual done based on but the one thing we never ever questioned was having men and women in circle together that was never that was just never a thing no it was never really an issue at all in our group and specifically to bring a little bit of that that WIA Centric idea in like the framework was there sometimes for belaine we would perform What's called the great right and that is a pseudos seexual I don't I don't know how to exactly say that nicely a way to celebrate the union of male energy and female energy and bringing in that Synergy at its most basic I guess you could say it's representative of a sex act but it's so much more than that uh and in this a man would hold an athem or and a woman would hold a chalice or vice versa and there was a whole poem and as an aside guys I couldn't remember the entire poem like I remembered part of it right and so I went online to try and find it it's nowhere to be found online the great right yeah like try and find the poem for the great right I can find rituals where they talk about it but like the poem let it be known what is it let it be known that no man is greater than a woman nor is a woman greater than a man for what one lacks the other shall be provide right yeah um for one lacks the other shall give oh then and when they are combined they become one in Truth for there is no greater magic in all the world than that of love that's it yeah that's pretty much it see if you can find that online anywhere that's crazy I can't believe you can remember all that it's been so long it's been so long but the funny part was I I just saw somebody getting burned for giving out a book of Shadow secrets that they should not have o be an oath breaker I'm like am I gonna be an oath breaker if I say this out loud because I can't find that  online anywhere that's so weird I mean people put everything online these days so the Great right is the symbolic sexual Union of the God and the goddess symbolizing the joining of these energies of opposites of polarities it's a it's a magical force and in belain to honor these two Polar Opposites we would have um men's Mysteries and women's Mysteries and in our Pagan Community when I first joined they had been doing belain for a little over a decade maybe two decades at that point yeah they were very proud of saying you could go to whichever mystery you chose regardless of what equipment you were born with you could go to the one you felt called to that was never a problem and they were super proud of saying their very first May Queen had been a biological male that story was repeated almost every single belate so as men in community what was your experience with those Mysteries and then the later creation of the Fool's mysteries for people who didn't feel that they fit into either of those two groups well my first time I this thought it was amazing we I just I had no idea you know my first my second Baine I did a a small one with a coven as a guest the year before but then here I am in this big Community there's all these people there's a lot of different traditions and I'm like really confused at this point because I'm just a young kid and you know I'm not sure what alexandrian means what Garian means at this point there's just I'm being introduced and we go off into the men's Mysteries and you know we have our little thing and we find a big poll and you know we pick the making and the women are off doing their mystery and they dig a big hole and then we come together in Union and I remember the first time the women kind of came together as the men marched down from their section in a different in a different field we were greeted by the women and they created this wall which was symbolic of the Heyman and we had to like slowly push through and it was just push back and pull back and push back and pull back and everyone was moaning and groaning and it was very sexual and the energy just grew and grew and grew until the point where they kind of came into this whole like climatic experience of inserting the pole into the hall and that being symbolic of fertilizing the land the union of the God and the goddess and you just I just felt it it was so magical and real and my jaw was like on the ground like this is just the most amazing thing I've ever experienced I was just hooked at that point you know and then the men you know we we reveal the king and the Queen and we have the mapole dance and pull the whole Community together you know just blending all the ribbons together doing the whole weaving dance and it was just just so wonderful and I I've never I've never forgotten it this has been with me ever since I'm I'm so glad you're here John because it's uh exactly every every word that you spoke is my experience as well you know we start at the camping field at Al together and then the men break off into the path to the ritual field and when the first men's mysteries in that ritual field and being surrounded by other you know male witches it was home it felt like home yeah and there the symbolism of uh you know chopping down a tree and bringing it down that path all on our shoulders one of us wrote a song Do You Remember the song about uh Pagan men I uh I I I Shan uh sing it but uh I'm worried I'm worried uh I'm worried about being an oathkeeper so I'm trying not to reveal too much because it is uh you know half of the men's Mysteries is mystery and uh you know that's that's part of it as well but but yeah the the the tradition of the two groups starting together and then uh separating into male and female and then joining again is more than jaw-dropping as as as you you described it it is for real I wanted to just add to the men's mystery part that what was it maybe late 90s or so um a new element was added and that was called the Fool's Mysteries that was more of a I don't know how would you best describe it kind of a A non-gender or gender fluid group if I remember correctly I mean we were doing it the normal way and then all you know and it's part of that whole give and take kind of thing as we get to learn about each other over the years um and grew as a community the more and more people would show up I I I remember some people and both women and men were saying you know I don't quite feel so comfortable with this setup we don't feel that we're living in this dualistic you know male and female world as some of us fall in the middle you know and we're not quite sure how we're supposed to fit in at belane it's a little awkward for us and so okay well let's explore that and then some people came up with this thing called that you know they started working with what SU called the two spirit Mysteries which is based on some Native American story I think or tradition I'm not sure but then it evolved over over time to what they call the Fool's Mysteries and um the fool is neither male nor female it's everything in between and um so they kind of created this third mystery and Incorporated it into the whole belan festival I don't even know if we can call it a ritual at this point it was a long day a full day of like it was almost like a full day Festival rather than it was often a full weekend yeah um but going back to the fools it did uh there was uh maybe a perception side of it but it was where where children were also welcomed as well and you know it's like children go through that latency period where they're they're not male or female per se I mean they obviously were we're born with whatever plumbing they were born with but there was that kind of a an aspect of of it as well to touch on that a little bit Jonathan like you the very first hell almost every single woman's mystery I ever went to with this community was amazing I mean absolutely an amazing magic experience from my head to my toes my magical self was thrilled every time the different people that facilitated these the getting on my hands and knees in the dirt to dig this hole that had been dug before by the women in the community to see myself in the mirror at the bottom of okay I'm giving away Mysteries now but but to do the whatever mystery we happened had been planned for that was powerful and beautiful and and Primal and I cherished that but it was also very sexual that energy of life and of of new beginnings is inherently sexual and you can't really get away from that too much and I think another reason to bring in the Fool's mystery was because a lot of people in the community did have children and were bringing children and it was kind of a rule that belain was more for adults and not for first timers but that broke down as we got bigger and bigger and we needed something that wasn't so sex focused that everyone could be at whether you know and I think that was a small part of forming that group as well yeah because those rituals if I you know it's just kind of coming to the surface of my Consciousness right now that we you know in doing these things and separating off into the male Mysteries we were really pulling out like the Primal divine divine feminine and the Divine masculine in our own separate groups before we even came together to unify so I mean if you're not feeling comfortable in either of those Polar Opposites you know we definitely had to have something alternative for someplace for other people to fit in right you know feel comfortable and um who knew Upstate New York was so Progressive in the 90s whoa I recently came back to this same Community after having been gone after covid after moving across the country to a belan ritual which was different the land is different the people are different everything's kind of different after all these things have changed and there was no men's women's and Fool's Mysteries any longer yeah I see you're surprised but it was they had decided instead and there was a little push back against that but they had decided to instead go with still polarity but instead of labeling it male and female to give that polarity names they called it active and passive and they talked about the different energies that each would that each required and that you would work with when you did it and you could choose based on that and I can tell you it almost split I would say 90% down gender lines but I went with the men's Mysteries to go help chop down the tree and and that was very transformative for me in they didn't call them I went with the active Mysteries because at that time I felt I needed that type of energy in my life whereas always before I had gone to the women's Mysteries it it just was different this time it felt a little different and I don't know necessarily if I loved it or not but I did like it it was interesting well you know I always felt like drawn to explore I always felt curious about the women's Mysteries as well and you know I would never want to be intrusive or be where I wasn't supposed to be or insert my energy where it wasn't wanted but there were times where I had been gratefully invited to you know kind of sit in in some of these um I don't even know rituals and and I thought it was really wonderful it really helps me to connect because I mean I think that we're a combination of active and passive of masculine and feminine in most of us and you know especially being a man in a patriarchal world it's really um refreshing to have that experience to learn to have that relationship with the divine feminine so that we're able to to pull out um our nurturing aspects you know all those like things that like society as you're a male like you're you're told to you know don't have your emotions don't cry you're not allowed to do this you're not allowed to do that you have to be this this and this and so like all of those things are kind of like pushed out of us at an early age and so one of the wonderful things about Witchcraft and paganism has been the matriarchal aspect and learning to heal and reclaim those parts of our El as men and I don't know if it's the same for women like I don't how what was your experience with that was it like you know hey here's a whole aspect of myself that I've never been able to explore as a woman what was your experience with that definitely for me it was extremely empowering when I found witchcraft it was like a lightning bolt hit me I I had come from a background of a Christian Family Christian step family that I mean they were methodists so they weren't like super hardcore but it was still God this God that and and women didn't really have a place there and so when I found Witchcraft and found all these empowering ideas of the goddess and the goddess is within you and you are deity and you have god and goddess within you and you can do all these things and sexuality is actually holy it's part of nature it's part of life you know your sexuality and your gender are not bad they're celebrated here you know all of this and for me it was I mean I'm getting chills just talking about it because I needed that in my life I needed to be told that in my life and and so it it kind of completed like you said from a patriarchal society to here women are goddesses that was revelatory to me at the time yeah and as a man even like be told that the goddess is with you as a man you know is just like amazing you know it's just I don't know absolutely yeah number one Bel in uh in community at the beginning of it the people that organized it they made this big ying-yang and half of it represented the male and half of it represented a female and they offered you an opportunity it's like where do you fit they presented it like like a spectrum like like a scale and you know where do you fit on the scale you could stand invited everybody to stand in different places you could be at the at the table of the yin-yang or you could be at the other side the big you know open other side and everybody stood where they identified and then they kind of flipped the script if you were on the the maale side uh you were doing what traditionally was the the women's mystery and if you were on the female side you went and did what was traditionally the the men's Mysteries ah to give you balance oh wow I like that and was that was an incredible experience you know to to be on the opposite side to uh be able to work on spiritually in this large group supportive group to work on like the feminine energy aspects of myself and I don't remember what year it was but it was uh probably if it was the early 2000s i' I'd be surprised it might have been mid to late 2000s I would say I think that's was the start of my Evolution um into uh gender identity and uh we lacked the language at the time and I think the one thing that we have seen uh throughout all of these years is the is the you know just simply having the words to be able to articulate some of the you know some of the things that uh we felt that is definitely the the one belain a community that I I I will never forget I think I'm the only one here that that only has one perspective um I have never participated in anything other than the women's Mysteries that that's my only frame of reference um that has just just been where I've been drawn to but I've always wondered what goes on on the other side but yeah as much as I wonder um i' I've still I've kind of stayed in that women's mystery group but we'll see you know times they are a changing but I do have a I do have another question um and and I want to start with you Kevin kind of building off of this so as a CIS man what is your relationship with the goddess like and do you call upon her in your practice is that something that you kind of do you integrate the goddess or just the god like how does that work oh I I I definitely integrate the god I definitely integrate the goddess I definitely integrate uh both of them sometimes I've lacked may have lacked a link anguage to articulate it but I've always felt that gender is a spectrum um and I've recognized that personally at a very young age I lean very very very very heavily towards the male side of things yet there is the the feminine side of me as well that is you know part of the reason why I was drawn to Witchcraft is that balance so I do call the goddess and I have even the even a goddess is as called me and uh didn't realize I needed to work with hkat but uh she tapped me on the shoulder at one point in my life and it was an interesting uh spiritual exercise or Journey that uh with that but uh to me it's it provides that balance I think uh I would have a hard time believing somebody is 100% one way and even if it's only half a percent or a percent it still needs to be explored it still needs to be tood and uh otherwise you're not whole you're not spiritually whole if you don't recognize um the opposite gender that is that is in you and how about you John do you do you incorporate the goddess or do you find that difficult or or is it just you know no such thing is difficult I find that no such thing is difficult so well when I first started you know I well I got introduced into witchcraft um there was a woman okay who used to follow me around a little bit in the 80s on on um one of the streets by the by where we lived and she would approach me and talk to me a little bit and like we would pass each other and then she just kind of kept getting to know me and she waited she would ask when my birthday was she waited until I was 18 because back in like the late 80s early 90s everyone was still in the witch closet the broom closet it was very much frowned upon to say hey acknowledge somebody else as a witch in public if you do somebody in our community in any Community you know you were not really allowed to discuss it very taboo very taboo and so you know when I was 18 like she finally like kind of invited me to her house kind of turned me on to a little bit kind of like tested me a little bit with like hey look at these crystals what do you think kind of wasn't sure how to approach the subject did you get groomed by a witch totally and so you know then I started like looking at the some of the books that were laying around and I picked this one book I mean ironically my first book my first witchcraft book was a book on dianic witchcraft called Earth Magic and that um but yes I totally went with the goddess first I did not you know look at the god or the male Mysteries at all I was just really attracted to the moon to the lunar Mysteries to different goddesses um HEC um Aphrodite I started with the Greek goddess and kind of moved on to you know learning about all the different goddesses in mythology you know you learned about osun and Oya and KH and P and and really learning about all of these goddesses and their aspects and how we relate to them and how you know I relate to the world I I I learned how how my place in the world by learning to relate to them and their stories and they're kind of like ah I don't even know how do to I call it like everyone seems to have their own like little n each God and each goddess you know and then after some time I felt more comfortable to learn about the gods I don't think that there really were any as many sources back then everything was very goddess focused and it was like plentiful so it wasn't a lot to learn about P or caros or yeah yeah any of that um it wasn't as readily available back then so I mean my I connected to the goddess first for me from the oppos to the god from the opposite perspective John and and I I think that Kevin and I had a similar timeline to our journey so Kevin may agree W with this statement as well but a lot of the goddesses that I was exposed to early on in the very beginning was through you you exposed me to KH you exposed me to pale like some of these non-traditional goddesses so to say I had been exposed to through you um so you kind of opened my eyes to so many more aspects of the Goddess than you know your traditional kedwin or or hiate or emus or or Bridget like you brought in the khes and the PES and and that was that was pretty awesome to get all that Knowledge from a man well thank you that's amazing well I learned a lot of that from such our eclectic local community and all these different people so I'm really glad I learned it from them and you learned it from me and you know that's how things used to work before the internet it was we that Pagan community that we all grew out of and the coven that we formed at that time was special I don't know if we knew how special what we had at that time was I mean I still go to Pagan festivals and and different places and there's nothing like that Pagan Community I mean you can get it if you go to a big festival or something like that but but local communities like that are few and far between unfortunately what uh shell said I completely agree with and what it is it's a perfect example of of why Circle amarat was so beautiful we learned from each other if you had a question there was one of us that we could turn to and ask and we we we grew together and we had no idea how beautiful that was at the time and I think looking back on it we're not exaggerating it in any kind of way it was Circle Aral was just something that was one of a kind it was absolutely but men in our Coven in our community you appreciate women but you also appreciate being a man you don't have to give up one to have the other you know being a pagan I think you understand intrinsically that all of these things are a balance and that you need all of that one of the nice things one of the neat things one of the things that I love about you know this whole Pagan wiah witchcraft whatever you want want to call it um is we learn to connect to the elements we learn you know earth air fire water spirit we learn about the God we learn about the goddess we learn about each other we learn that all of us each one of us has particular talents whether it's through tarot someone else is like a a rune Master someone else you know really loves to Mak you know staffs and someone else is just great um with the drum someone writes music mus someone's a poet no matter what who you are there is a talent inside of you and so like one of the things I love about this spirituality is we're allowed to pull that Talent out of ourselves and when you get into a group especially with a coven or any kind of community you learn that together all of our aspects coming together unify us in a way that is greater than ourselves and so I've learned that I'm able to walk Walk Through This World realizing whether you're a Christian whether you practice Judaism you're Buddhist whatever you are an atheist we're all bringing our special talents our energy into this circle of life and so we all play an important role so walking through that I've learned to be far more accepting of people where they're at and where they need to be um everyone I I've have learned to trust that everyone's where they need to be in this world and even if it doesn't agree with where I happen to be um it's okay you know it's okay I don't have to dwell on on things so I've learned to accept other people and ways that I think other religions and spiritualities um or maybe other religions don't allow us to connect and acknowledge each other and and accept each other for who we are and what we are and you know if that makes any sense at all it does it does absolutely it definitely uh Echo some of the things that Jonathan has has already said but you know it's that that idea that you what's the way to to say this you almost like create your own religion you take everything that you need and you leave everything that's left and echoing what John said you know people are at different parts of their their paths and the relationships I've I've been in it's recognizing that in the person they have their own they might have been brought up in as Methodist or Christian or Jewish or any any religion but they may not know it as well but they are doing the same thing they are taking what they need from that and leaving the rest and making their own their own religion their own belief system their own their own spirituality and that that's what I see are try to connect with and and try to understand with with any relationship no matter if it's you know just a friendship or you something more intimate or what have you it's uh being able to see that Divinity in in that other person or what their Divinity is and you know where they are on their path didn't we used to uh do a piece of a ritual where we would say the Divine in me recognizes the Divine in you yes right along with Kevin's thought now is there anything in particular that you would like to say to any men out there who think they might be a witch or who think they want to might want to research this spirituality a little more is there any advice you might give or that think that they shouldn't fit into this my advice would be if you're thinking you are a witch you are a witch yes where you are your path where you are on your path is the only other question and if you know if you're at the beginning if you're at the beginning of your past I am envious because it is a very very magical time it's that Spiritual Awakening it's when you um you know walk through uh this world and you know everything starts to pop out at you and you just realize you just accept you just understand I reason why I'm a little envious is because uh once you start walking down that path you start to integrate that and it comes integrated to the point where it's just the tools drop off the the uh rituals you know drop off because you it's just so integrated in into your life and then you get to the point where I am where it's like I need to get back onto my broomstick you feel you so for the person questioning um you already know the answer you are you are a witch well said very well said do either of you have any particular deities gods or goddesses that you like to work with or that have called to you h i mean growing I I think when you enter into this you're really learning to discover who you are and you're evolving and you're changing and so a lot of times you learn to connect to certain deities but like Haven said like you kind of get to a point where you integrate all of that and everything comes becomes almost like so intuitive that you don't even realize you're practicing the the craft you know you just kind of like light a candle and you know here's this and that and you know I live on the country now so I just kind of feel connected to the earth and the elements quite often I come here and this is my my safe space my Sacred Space and so not really do I feel connected to any particular deity although I'm open to when they want to you know kind of tap me on the head and just say hey you need to pay attention here um that doesn't really happen as often as it used to and I think kind of that's that's part of the natural progression of being on this kind of path you want to explore you want to learn everything everything all the things and then eventually you've learned a lot of different things and you come to terms with who you are and then you get busy with life people have kids people have careers people you know are off in the world and you just kind of distract yourself and like Kevin says you know I'm learning to pull back now I'm in my 50s and it's like okay I've got all this stuff done let's reconnect with myself a little bit here and so I'm kind of getting on that broomstick again myself and learning to reconnect and you know questioning like what is you know what was all of that I still I have this like little weird Crossroads here which I call like that's hiate spot you know and um there's there's little things where I still connect to different deities but I don't necessarily like have a um any anyone special that I work with at the moment H ta me on the shoulder um when when I was much younger and that was probably the most in intense um uh work that I've done like John it's it's nobody specific as of you know right right now and you know maybe opening up being open to the idea maybe I'm going to feel a tap on the shoulder but um when you get tapped you you know you get tapped especially by H yeah I was at a campground uh there was a place called The the ferry Woods I was like looking out over this uh you know Hill parking lot and all of a sudden um you know L just rolled in and her presence was was known to me and when it happens it's like the am witch question you know it's like you can ask yourself is this really happening and the answer yes yes right I remember one time all of us in circle amarat we were doing some ritual in a field it was a lunar eclipse and you know sometimes you go through the motions you go through the theatrics and you light the candles and you do all your stuff and you do your ritual and you go on home but there's other times where we truly step between the worlds I remember that one particular night all of us were together on a Hilltop with the lunar eclipse and we were like just between the world it happened you couldn't deny it remember that energy flying we're in that limal space it was magic everywhere yeah yeah sometimes it works out like that and sometimes we now you know we're older I still find myself every once in a while accidentally walking into those moments yes without intentionally doing so like before we would do it with intent you know and now I think when you get older and you get used to all of those things sometimes you just find yourself accidentally in the magical moment right in that space and and I think that in Cycles like shell and I the the whole reason we started this podcast was part of that that cycle we go through Cycles the moon goes through Cycles Seasons go through Cycles we go through cycles and and there's a time to rest and I think you know we kind of did that and and we did other things we put put our energy in other directions and now that time like you said Jonathan is come back to ourselves and to give to ourselves and I think my magical self is someone I kind of sacrificed a little while ago and I'm trying to resurrect her now and it's part of a process and I'm hearing more and more people we're not the only ones a lot of people are getting back a lot of folks they're seeing that those broomsticks and they want to hop back on totally take a look at take take a look at how when when Circle amarat was was was was formed for us I mean we had this larger community that that we went to we were looking up to our elders looking for guidance and we weren't getting it so we formed Circle armaro because we could get it from each other and what we what I'm realizing now that I had no idea at the time is they were integrating their spirituality all the the person people that we looked at up as elders we're going through the integrating to the point of you know where where we are right now I I see that it's like knowing that now they were in a part of their path where they were off their Boomstick and then watching them you know as a decade or so goes by we saw them you know reconnect and get back on their broomstick um but that was part of the reason why Circle ararot was was formed is exactly what we're talking about there is that everything e and flows and um you know when when you're in the E you could say you're off your broomstick and then but once it starts flowing again you you're you're getting back on it yeah I like to think of it as the spiral dance and we just keep expanding and expanding and expanding and just as we expand like that Circle just takes longer and longer to get around and and kind of loop back to where we were once upon a time yes but then it spirals back in it can always spiral right back in and I think that's it's that energy raising where we're at right now you know everything old is new again you know yeah we're shifting all that die shall be reborn well I think you guys so much for joining us I mean I have loved this conversation about men in paganism which again for shell and I is and for you guys obviously is not very unusual we're pretty this was like getting a band back together or part of band had half the band back together this is amazing it's been an amazing time thank you thank you for this invite yeah thank thank you so much this has been great we're so glad you guys wanted to wanted to chat with us because we were we really wanted to kind of give this perspective and we thought who better than the male witches we know best ab well and it came in the most perfect time for me too because I was just really like at that like it's time to get on my broomstick and then like all of a sudden you guys reached out and I'm like well wait no wait yes this is a sign this is a sign this I Jonathan I have to say when I messaged you about this you're like you know what I need to think about this I need to meditate on it I'm like all right cool no problem Jonathan half an hour later you're like I'm in so I I loved it but it it's it's a good time for all of us I think there's the whole world it seems like is coming up witches we're everywhere now so hopefully we've helped a couple people know that you can be a male and a witch you can be anything and be a witch
