welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hey witches welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I am shell and today we have an awesome topic I don't know how I feel about it but it's awesome today we have decided to do an episode where we try something new and one of the things I've seen a few people try is chat GPT using AI for magic so shell and I have decided to ask one of the AI generators and see if we could come up with a magical spell or ritual and then try it and see if it actually works is there magic in AI I do at some point want to just also quickly touch on the AI art that is something in a lot of the stuff where I read a lot of articles on people's opinion on you know chat GPT generated um spells and rituals and along with that was the art aspect of AI generated tarot decks oracles and other ritual tools so I do want to briefly touch on that at some point too and get your opinion oh absolutely let's talk about all things Ai and magic and we'll see where it goes where it leads us first let's start out with what is chat GPT according to their website it's an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by open Ai and it was released November 2020 22 and the name itself combines chat which is its functionality and GPT which is an acronym that stands for generative pre-trained Transformer which is basically a type of large language model all that means it's fancy words to basically say it's a big script it's a big mathematical program that uses language you give it a prompt and it will come up with an answer for you it'll answer almost as if it's a person as if it's speaking to you with any type of question or prompt that you can put into it and all it's really doing is it's taking every word and looking for the next most likely word to go there and in doing so it can come up with very realistic sounding conversation now let me dummy this down for people that think more like me and not Leila's geek talk how I look at it as when I write in a prompt it is going to scour all of the internet every bit of information of available and shoot me back an answer with that there are some M truths on the internet but I'm intrigued let's debunk some mistruths what are we talking about we had decided to do a try this thing and initially I didn't know what spell to look for I wanted cat GPT to come up with a spell for me I didn't know what the hell I wanted I didn't necessarily need a magical act in my life so I was doing it more for the sake of experiment so I put in love spell now it did generate something and you did it so you know it kind of gives you step by step one do this two do this but what really grinded my gears at the end there was a disclaimer it was one of I forget the exact wording but it was something to the effect of magic is a bunch of  you know take it with grain of salt we don't support spirituality oh see I got an entirely different disclaimer at the end oh what' you get I got remember that the best spells come from the heart so feel free to modify this to better suit your needs the most important part is to believe in your spell and the power of your intentions good luck on your path to success mine also did say something to the effect of if someone doesn't like you deal with it and you can't make someone like you don't think you're going to do a love spell and manipulate someone's like true like basically they were chastising you for wanting a love spell that's kind of the same advice a lot of witches would give you if you asked for a love spell though it was the wording and how they Blended in we're writing this but we think spirituality is bunch of mumbo jumbo it rubbed me the wrong way so I decided screw that I change it to a Prosperity spell what I got at the end of of that it says remember spellwork is most effective when combined with practical actions in a positive mindset focus on cultivating gratitude embracing opportunities and making wise financial decisions in alignment with your goals may this spell bring you blessings of good fortune and prosperity on your path blessed be two totally different endings this one is like oh you magical being good luck to you and the other one is like who do you think you are doing a love spell you horny lonely  I think that's because on the internet if you ask a pagan a witch or a Wiccan for a love spell most of the time you'll get an admonition don't do it because it's manipulation and we've talked about this before in love spells you know whether it's manipulation or not and they can be they can also be like psychic flirting so I think that's pretty common to what you would get if you asked a real life Pagan as opposed to artificial intelligence but a real life Pagan has tacted that's intelligence does not have tacked okay I think it might have come down to the tacted thing but I was like I got a  robot now telling me I'm an  what prompt did you use like how did you ask it something to the effect of pretend you're a Wiccan High Priestess who studies Celtic lore write me a spell for love you did something very very good there pretend you are a wick and high priestess you put that in your prompt I highly recommend anyone who's listening to this if you're going to ask chat GPT to give you any type of information on spellwork or rituals or magic ask it to pretend it's someone first you know ask it to pretend it's a a modern eclectic green witch Pagan or ask it to pretend that it's a goddess a deity ask it to pretend it's anything that has um meaning to you or your path and then ask it for your ritual or your spell and you'll get a much better answer if you just go into the prompt and say give me a love spell you're going to get all sorts of admonitions and disclaimers in the beginning you'll get a much better answer if you ask it to pretend to be someone first for the ritual I wrote pretend you are a high priestess in the Celtic tradition with a ritual being Wiccan based and then it asked me if it wanted me to uh explore ancient Celtic Traditions so I kind of had to I had to prompt it again and I said in the Celtic tradition with the ritual being Wiccan based and then it wrote me out a ritual so I feel like how I wrote the beginning of the spell command and the ritual command is what made it work does that make sense yeah I love that it was trying to give you a lesson kind of very high priestess like right but that wasn't what was looking for I did a very similar prompt I asked it to write a spell for Success making sure to incorporate casting a circle calling in relevant energies or deities and include a list of all items and I said to do it in the style of a modern witch Pagan High Priestess with mild Celtic and Wiccan leanings I wrote WR a spell for Good Fortune and money hey I guess we're both looking for Success after I told it to pretend it was a Wiccan High Priestess who studies Celtic lore then I said a spell for Good Fortune and money I have access to GPT 4 which is the most current version um most of the free versions are GPT 3.5 Lea's a nerd yeah I definitely am a nerd so I asked both versions the exact same prompt to see if it would give me any type of difference and it did so I'm GNA talk a little bit about yeah so just because it's AI doesn't mean it's consistent that's correct and if you go through bar or chat GPT you're going to get different types of answers but all of them are pretty interesting mine also gave a step by step it told me how to set up a Sacred Space and cast a circle and the gpt3 gave me some kind of cheesy by the power of earth air fire and sea I cast The Circle Sacred Space for me with each step I take success shall be my guide as I Journey forth May blessings be multiplied which was pretty cool I thought you know what I got for quarters which by the light of this flame so bright I call forth Fortune day and night from the ancient lands in Realms unseen bring prosperity to flow like a stream I like that I love it that's pretty cool I did have it doe a chant oh I didn't even think of a chant duh and this is what it came up with which I thought was a pretty powerful spell breeds inspiration lose golden light through degas's sign let my dreams take flight air fire water and Earth combine lead me to success for Now's the Time golden coin green Flames dance guide my journey Advance my chance through the elements my plea resounds guide my steps to prosperous grounds as this note turns to Embers bright in my will I trust I invite with the spell my goals in sight manifest Prosperity by day and night you know my favorite phrase in there is what's that Embers bright I have to say that's some good right and the reason it talks about as this note turns to Embers bright is because in the spell they have you write down your definition of success on a piece of paper and then you anoint a green candle with your success oil and while anointing it you focus on your intention and imagine your success manifesting and then you light the candle hold a golden coin and the green candle and you know do all this invocation but then they eventually have you burn that paper where you've written your definition of success in the green candle right and then uh drop it in a fireproof bowl and as it burns you're supposed to imagine your desire being carried out to the universe to make this manifestation come true which is everything I've read in this spell so far are all things I would write or suggest or you might write or you might read in a popular book or on someone's page and then it goes through and has you thank the deities and the energies and close the circle it has every single step that I would do in a spell now with mine all the steps were there they had two different or three different um verbal spells quote unquote but it didn't go into detail on a lot of the steps you know step one you know find a quiet and Sacred Space where you can perform the spell without interruption clean the area and cast a protective Circle if you wish doesn't tell you about the circle the quarters or whatever that's on you the good thing is chat GPT and most of these AI programs will elaborate if you ask them to so right after it gives you the spell you can ask it to elaborate on or explain any part of it that you need more information take a few moments ground and Center you know take some deep breaths visualize peaceful green light enveloping you now remember I did a a prosperity and money so they tell you to visualize this green light while you are visualizing this green light that is when you say that short little paragraph I read a few minutes ago then they say place a few drops of pachuli or cinnamon oil in a small dish or bowl hold it with both of your hands envision your life filled with abundance visualize your financial goals being met opportunities for success and an overall sense of prosperity gently pass the green candle through the aromatic smoke rising from the dish love that phrase use that energy to kind of manifest the thought of prosperity and they have you it says as you do this repeat the following which again this is like Rock Solid candle of green bring wealth my way good fortune and abundance come and stay with every flicker my desires grow prosperity and blessings now I know this is you would read in any book right then it goes out to you know once you feel that the candle has absorbed your energy and intention extinguish it safely I prefer fingers I think when you blow out a candle that gives different intention personally I think that no matter how you put out a candle you're using a different element so I don't worry about it mostly take a green ribbon or cord tie it around a pouch or container and create a small like sachche they tell you to put a charm in this put your intentions into the charm and into the bag carry it with you and then closed the spell by expressing gratitude to the universe the elements deity spirit release and Trust the process in mind the same thing happened I made sure to put in a request for a list of ingredients and gpt3 gave me just a list clear quartz crystal bowl of salt green candle Etc gp4 gave me a list that said a white candle to represent Purity truth and peace a green candle to represent wealth and abundance a golden coin to symbolize success and prosperity and then it went through and it it told me why like a piece of aventurine for luck and opportunity and I checked these all of these are correct correspondences wait what one gave you that GPT 4 okay because I use the Baseline poor folk free version of chat GPT and what I got was a green candle representing prosperity and abundance pulier cinnamon essential oil symbolizing wealth and success and then it just says a small dish or bowl a small pouch of container and green or gold Ribbon or cord both gave us lists gpt3 and four gave us different lists and sometimes it would explain why it gave the list and sometimes not right you can always ask it for more information when you did the spell did you do it exactly as written I did not when I am trying to manifest Prosperity I am very big on right and  on bay leaves you and those bay leaves everything's on a bay leaf you know I don't know why it just is I have a thing for the bark from uh birch trees like birch tree bark I love to use shed birch tree bark to write my spells on and burn that it's a lot of fun dude I have a birch tree in my front yard I will start getting that off the ground and saving it for you well hell bay leaves are so small how do you write out everything you need sometimes you need a big piece of bark man now I'm glad you brought that up because I have in the past don't judge me like when my kids were in like middle school and high school you know the the little pen thing of the solid glue and you would rub it on yeah yeah like the Chapstick glue stick looking glue stick right I would glue bay leaves together that I could write like a damn paragraph you know I'm wordy you know I'm wordy I love that I'd have like three or four or five kind of glued oh my goodness shell that's awesome I do remember one time contemplating stapling them and then I was like you know what metal in a spell is not what I'm looking to do the point is is that each of these spells came up with an actual success spell and you do need to be careful because if you ask chat GPT a question any of these AI these large Lang language processing models a question they're not a truth model it's a language prediction they just come up with what's the most likely next word and so they can be misled and they can give you false information what the developers call a hallucination so if you ask it for information it will give you an amazing amount of information it could be your high priestess it can just like everything else on the internet you can't always trust and believe 100 10% verify verify verify it will help you in your learning actually if you use ask chat GPT a question and then go through and verify the facts that you find there it's going to help you learn that information that much better and it will also help you kind of learn your craft if you are newer or hone in on some things or remind you of some things if you're not newer everything online you should at least check two or three sources before you fully trust and believe absolutely and that goes with anything online not just magical stuff or or what have you you know just you can't just trust everything you read out there that's so true so true but back to to trying the spell you said you didn't do it as written because you like to write on bay leaves well there's a couple points to that one you know I'm a weirdo and I have these weird Fascinations especially when it comes to like herbs and stuff I feel like I can't do spell that doesn't involve herbs it's weird it's a shell thing as written your AI spell did not involve any type of herbs no it involved Puli and cinnamon oil but because I'm also a weirdo I just happen to have those two things on hand but no it didn't and to me that just don't fly I am also a spell rewriter we usually write a lot of our own spells but particularly in the beginning and sometimes when we don't have time we will take a spell from online or a spell from a book and rework it right and rewrite it to be our own and either be tailored to more specific situation or just to be more personal and that's what I did the bay leaf thing was me manifesting specific things as you are well aware I have had a issue with my vehicle that has somehow become more expensive than it should and that has been piling on some stress on me so I did this one night after work pulled up cat GPT rocked it out and the next day other than adding the bay leaf and writing out my specifics which were car related other than that I wanted to do it verbatim because I want to know is what it's producing good enough I don't want to say good enough in a hoyy toyy way but in a but will it work right because there are people out there that'll take this verbatim so I wanted the verbatim experience that's what I did I just added the bay leaf thing at the end you know funny story so one night I look it up and research it and and get it to write out the next night I did it and then the next afternoon stuff started to work out with my car situation and that will be resolved in like four days wow that's fantastic love when they come back so quickly so it definitely had power and worked for you could have been the bay leaf I don't know but when I originally pulled it up I was skeptical do not get me wrong but when I read that by the light of this flame so bright I call forth Fortune day and night I was getting sucked in I was like no no that's good and I mean you and I separately and together have written some badass rituals and spells this is isn't horrible I like how you put that I I agree this is not horrible this is just as good if not better as stuff that I have read out there from other people I I wouldn't say it's like better better because it it definitely has a a little bit of a rotness to it you know it's doesn't have quite the so of some that I've seen or things that you and I have seen but it's D good it's good and you can make it better so I did mine as is I did it verbatim for the exact same reason I wanted to see if there was power here if I gave this a shot would this actually work as a spell now mine has not had as immediate results as yours has uh but I I felt it as I was doing the magic as I was casting Circle it felt like a spell I had written or a spell you know that someone had written for me and it it worked I could feel the magic moving I felt like I was in that space now my success was for something very specific as well and I do feel like things are moving in that direction and I I very much felt the energy I felt the magic so there's definitely something there now in the future I would rewrite it just because that's who I am I'd like to make things personal on the flip side so that was the spell I then went back in pretend you are a high priestess in the Celtic tradition write a ritual that is Wiccan based it kind of was confused so I had to rewrite in the Celtic tradition with the ritual being Wiccan based and then it gave me little tidbits for each holiday and not a full ritual so then I got frustrated and I was like I I gave it a new prompt write a full moon ritual based on these principles I'm going to put it out there right now I have not done this yet so I am actually going to hold on to this until the full moon because I do want to see the legitimacy of it which I wouldn't be giving it full credit if I didn't do a full moon ritual on the full moon it gives me supplies candles matches or a lighter you know an altar doesn't tell you about what should be on the altar but just alter Moonstone clear quartz salite it does this one I liked because it had incense lavender or Sandalwood which I would make my own personal incense maybe combining those two with other things a journal or a pen in optional it says you know optional herbs flowers other items of Full Moon energy like Jasmine mugart rose petals you know it gives you preparation steps rounding and centering I like that adds that because you don't want to forget that they do an invocation light the candle and say I invoke the powers of the Moon sacred and bright ancient wisdom and guidance shine upon me tonight goddesses and gods of Celtic lore bless this ritual I open the door not horrible you know it ain't bad right it's definitely a good start you know if you want something different or if you're not even sure where to begin to write one I mean you and I have been writing stuff for pushing 30 years what but for people who either are not writing inclined or are are new this is good you know and then they do a section on reflection and intentions you know reflect on what your intention is for the moon what do you want to release or manifest they want you to write down your goals and Desires in the journal they do have a a moon blessing it gives you all the steps and I would love to hear that Moon blessing because I also had it do a full moon ritual that I have not yet done and I have a really really cool little blessing that it wrote out that I'd like to read so read yours and then I'll read mine okay it says hold your crystals or stones in your hand and say blessed Moon radiant and true Infuse these crystals with your magical Hue charge them with your loving light Illuminating my path throughout the night and then it goes on to tell you to do any spell work or meditations that you want to do and then you give gratitude close and release nice the poem that it gave for me to honor the moon was Luna's gaze in Sacred Space Crystal might reveals my Chase words of flame fears disclaim wisdom's sphere is my aim Moon's guidance elements dance in your blessings I Advance as the circle fades in night I send attitude to the light I like that did you get a did you get like a release poem too I did and it says mother earth I release what no longer serves into your loving embrace it dissolves and curves I am free is the Moon's glow gleams renewed refreshed in my wildest dreams oh wow that's beautiful see it can come up with poetry it can come up with deity calls quarter calls Circle invocations it is a fabulous imination starter I think but to get back to business to kind of bring it back to the harsh reality of the world is any of this being stolen from somebody is AI coming up with this or are they plagiarizing okay that is a good question and for the language models it's not because what's happening is basically it understands your question and then it comes up with the most likely first word and then it comes up with the most likely next word and then the most likely next word so I will not find that poem any of the poems we've read I will not find them in a book or on an internet website somebody's not going to say you stole that off my Instagram nope that is like brand new I'm the first one reading it brand new you're the first one reading it it is so Random each word is generated independently it's not going to take phrases or anything like that from somewhere else will it make stuff up yeah yes does it learn by reading everything it can on the internet yes so it's learning based on reading what it finds but it's not plagiarizing it's not plagiarizing okay no as you saw I gave gpt3 and gp4 the same prompt and got very very different rituals if you ask it to regenerate a response you'll get again a very very different ritual it's going to be different every time because it's going through so many different possibilities for what the next word could possibly be that you're really truly working with chaos and Randomness here which is part of why I like it because as you know I love chaos magic and that type of universal energy and to me AI is very much a tap into chaos magic it feels like a tool to use that I just got to be devil's advocate here I read a few articles on this um got some opinions a con of this is it takes away your personal energy from your spellwork it produces very generic sometimes cheesy ideas it was described as soulless and that spells are supposed to be a spiritual experience I agree with that some people have actually said chat GPT can be judgy don't be judging me um I it can only be as judgy as it's programmers but what I have to say to that is is just kind of what we said as we've been talking here is that it's just like something you would read in a book none of these are any different than than spells I have read online or in a book and those I would also recommend that you rewrite to be personal to you because that is very very true spell workk works much better when it's tailored to yourself to your belief system to your magical energies you know it's attuned to you the way I've always looked at you know like books on paganism witchcraft what have you my view on those has always been take what you like take what works for me and leave the rest and knowing full well that if you read the same book you might take away something different than me but what I need to do for me is take what works for me and leave the rest and I kind of looked at these results the same yeah can we write something much more meaningful and beautiful absolutely so can you so can anyone who's listening but doesn't give you a good place to start yeah if you're a newbie if you are a a witchling a found which maybe you are prone to write but you just don't know what to do you you don't know what you're supposed to do or what order to do it this could give you a guide to help you start writing your own yeah and if you find something online that you like you could put that into GPT and say write me an original ritual with this idea right you know not copying their idea but you can use it as a as a launching pad to give you ideas or to to modify something else which is what we've always done with books and things we found online I I don't want I mean we could talk about this for four hours so I want to quickly wrap around to the art part of AI do you feel that a Tarot deck that's artwork was generated by AI is just as equal of a divinatory tool is a deck that was not AI yes absolutely and the reason is because decks come and are created in so many different ways we have Decks that are photographs we have Decks that are collages I have a deck that's pictures of collages that the artist made of found things I have Decks that are entirely Photoshop created I have Decks that are are made in so many different art styles AI is just one more art style remember that old deck I got it's it's a big big deck the roow rig deck yes that's trippy that' almost look like like mag cutouts of pictures I read some people's opinions that they hate it again they use soulless no spiritual base in them but let me tell you is a person who owns more decks than some stores I don't even know what I'm at now I'm pushing 200 but I own a lot of decks and I don't want the artist or the creators Mojo in my deck I want my mojo in that deck I don't want other people's so to me I don't care about AI because I'm going to cleanse it and put my own Juju in there's good decks and there's bad decks regardless of what medium is used to create them and I think it really depends on did that person put thought into it have they studied the symbology and the meanings behind the cards do the cards have enough in them to to kind of give me something to chew on when I'm doing tarot and that's what I want wouldn't I be taking those same thoughts and turning them into phrases to write into at GPT so really what the hell is the difference yeah exactly you can do that and I know there is a lot of concern right now that AI is stealing art so we need to make sure that it's learning from art much like the language model is learning from language that's out there it shouldn't be stealing and we definitely don't want that to happen but as for the soulless and non-magical part of it I would say those people probably need to learn a little bit more about chaos magic and about that type of energy because there is so much of it involved in this random generation of things that to ignore that part of it I think is to deny a little bit of magic but I myself am not going to sit here and say that this is the most beautiful Soulful stuff I've ever seen because it can be flat you know it really depends on what you put into it and how much you work with it what you're going to get out of it I totally agree so for spells and rituals I give it a thumbs up with the caveat of put a little of your own personality into it and I give the AI art being used for tarot and Oracle I also give that a thumbs up yeah I'm GNA have to give a thumbs up on both of them as well I think they're an excellent tool they're a tool and it it's something that should be used with research and with study it shouldn't be your only High Priestess it shouldn't be hopefully it's not your only connection and it definitely should not be your only source for information but as a tool in your magical toolbox 100% yeah it it's a lot of fun use it modify it let it spawn your own creativity and your own magic to go into some amazing places just as useful as buckland's big blue book I would say maybe even a little more so but yeah so I hope you all have had a lot of fun listening to us talk about our magical experiences with AI and the realm of the computer your overlords if you have any questions please email us at back
