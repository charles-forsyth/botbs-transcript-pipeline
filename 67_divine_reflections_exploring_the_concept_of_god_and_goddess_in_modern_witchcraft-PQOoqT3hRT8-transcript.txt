welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick in this episode we're talking about the concept of deity the God and the goddess in witchcraft we'll cover several different theories about the gods as well as our own personal beliefs we'll also answer the questions do you need to believe in a god and goddess to be a witch and are the gods needed in your magical practice ready to jump into a Divine discussion I'm Lea and ready to talk about my version of deity I'm sh modern witchcraft is a practice and not necessarily a religion for many people I'm glad you said that because that's like the first thing people get confused they think that witchcraft is a religion two separate things people two separate things exactly so in your practice of Witchcraft you may or may not have deities that you work with some do some don't you do not have to have deities to be a witch however in my experience most witches that I talk to do work with some concept of deity gods and goddesses in their practice whether they view them as archetypes or Universal forces as egregor or sentient entities it all kind of varies but in a lot of cases witches work with some concept of deity now I think this is important because you see a lot on the Instagram and the Facebook about can you be a Christian witch well yeah because that's basically going along with exactly what what we're saying tonight except for their version of deity just happens to be different than our version of deity so if if if Jesus is who you want to work with in your witchcraft practices rock on with your bad self you know people are like oh my God you're a Christian witch that's not possible yeah it is and this is why yeah witchcraft is the practice of magic it is using your will to change the energies around you most people that I find that are witches work with multiple deities from many different pantheons well and you know each deity kind has their own I don't want to say repertoire but kind of everybody has their own angle of things so you know maybe this week you need to work with a protection deity and next week you may need to work with a Hearth and Home deity and the week after that maybe a a mothering type deity you know so your need and what your magical working is at that moment could very well dictate the deity that you are utilizing quote unquote for your magical working and this gets back to like the very basic concept of what is a God or a goddess where did these forces come from and a lot of them came from our ancestors who were trying to figure out what these forces were that they didn't understand and things that they wanted to say thank you for you know they wanted to understand and say thank you for sunrises or a good harvest or falling in love you know the concept of creating new life or good fortune and so they basically made like backstories for these energies that they didn't understand and that's where I think a lot of deity came from and so if you're looking for that energy like shell said If you're looking for love you would look to this concept of Love Like say Aphrodite to bring that into your life you know so you're working with that particular aspect of universal energies but in that same vein I always twinge when I see something in a book listed we'll use hiate for example they have her listed as the goddess of Witchcraft there's a whole bunch of other goddesses listed as the goddess of Witchcraft I don't know if I buy into that first of all and second of all any name you give to deity in my opinion is a quote unquote god or goddess of Witchcraft you know it's people trying to understand forces that are greater than them and in order to understand that we kind of put a name to it and I guess in hak's case because she's part of magic and she's got this guide and she's the the goddess of the crossroads and she kind of looks out for people maybe because of those qualities that's where people took it and that's what we do with deity is we're looking for a relationship with a certain type of energy you know you want to be more forceful in your life you want to be more outspoken you know maybe you you want to work with a deity that's a maybe a war goddess maybe you're looking for the Moran maybe you need to you know to embody some of that really primal strong energy so you look to a deity that embodies those characteristics yeah and I know when we first started sh one of the things that we did a lot of was we would dedicate to a de for like a year and a day oh my God I remember that right so we would go through this whole thing and we would just pick them whether we felt we were called to this deity or we just you know the name kept popping up or something associated with that deity kept popping up or we were just interested or we felt that there was something about that deity we needed in our lives and so we would have a ritual with the whole coven we' dedicate ourselves to that deity and maybe we'd take a name associated with that deity for ourselves for the year in a day and then we would work with them we would find out you know where did they come from what's their story what do they like what do they not like we would set up altars to them we would you know give them gifts give them offerings and and incorporate them into our spells and rituals for that whole year in a day and that was a really great way to find out a lot about them about the deity about the religion and about yourself too I got to say that year I spent with P was probably the most tumultuous I was gonna say part in the pun the most explosive year I had didn't you dye your hair red too at that time I think I did when I had a burgundy yeah yeah yeah folks had burgundy hair there are pictures to prove it but I think that kind of goes along with something we talked about in a previous episode where it's almost like really picking the energies per se and not necessarily the name and personification the name and the personification come after it you know like I'm looking for a deity of Love or I'm looking for a deity of protection or of of of steadfastness you know you're not like hey I'm looking for Hestia what does she do you know what I mean that's not going to be true for all witches because there are some witches who worship deities as part of a religion and for them it would be very disrespectful to pull that out just for the correspondence that they have so there are some witches that follow it as a religion and so they would worship deities based on their religious beliefs so in that case it would be just a little bit different what we're talking about here is more the magical ideation of these deities more looking at them as universal forces or very strong energies around you as opposed to from a religious perspective and no matter how much you're studying a deity or looking into that religion or that culture you always have to be very respectful of where that deity came from their history their culture and everything around that deity you can't just pick them out because they have one quality that you like you have to take them as they come with everything involved in that deity but for me personally I got to say even though we did that and and we tried to immerse ourselves in different deity for for a while I always kept going back to hkat I was an Oger with with her um I know she's a hot thing on the internet now but 25 years ago people were like what why are you why her she was seen more as a minor goddess until she got this Fame as the goddess of witches right that was more it was what I aligned with now I might not align with a different aspect that was more I don't know calm and fun and you know I was kind of more fiery and you know I I had I had to associate myself with that but before we get on too much of a tangent we are really focusing here on goddesses so let's Loop this right back around and talk about the gods as well yes definitely having that balance especially back in the day a lot of it was very kind of Wick and based and a lot of magic talked about polarity you had to have that Duality yep you had to have that balance the push and the pull the creation and the destructive force and in wiah in witchcraft at that time in the'80s 90s it was all about the goddess uh she reigned supreme but god and goddess were supposed to be equal and represented that polarity so like when we were doing things like say you know some of our rituals there wasn't no you just call the goddess we had it was a God and a goddess that's because we were very Wicked based but we always tried to pair them up appropriately I guess for lack of a better way to say we're not putting you know Zeus with KH oh wow that would be interesting we you know we ain't creating that kind of dinner party here we would try to for each ritual or or whatever we were doing at the time we try to almost like appropriately pair them up so we had that Duality yes and what we were really doing without saying it like we said god and goddess but in the community that we were both involved in that also very often involved a third form a form that was neither one that was in that was the all but in the beginning we more talked about the energies the life force the creation the the destruction all of the stories like the the oak king and the Holly king and the goddess was all about Seasons it was all about life it was all about how things change within you within relationships and within nature it was all about what was happening around you following that wheel of the year and within yourself too you know following those forces of your life you are born you create life you create things you you know create relationships and and then we all eventually die and so it was honoring those Cycles but at the time the language we used was god goddess right I mean even now so let's take belan for example which is the seems to be the height of the god goddess polarity where they talk a lot about that and it can feel very exclusionary to people who maybe don't have you know they don't want kids or they can't have kids or it doesn't apply to them in any way and so our community created multiple ways of doing that we still called it god goddess and fool we had the Mysteries right but just recently that's kind of that wording has even changed like they've dropped the god goddess wording and they talk more about creative force and like the push pull of the universe they talk more about the energies themselves without giving it so much a gender because there's there's so much more to it than just a female and a male there's so much more to life and I think you know going back to that Pagan Community we were involved and I I I don't want to think we were cutting edge but we were cutting edge back then you know I mean very speaking of belane and particular you know I'm sure a lot of folks are familiar with you know women's Mysteries and men's Mysteries and and 20 years ago we came up with a Fool's Mysteries um for those folks who didn't feel either specifically feminine or specifically masculine and there was a third option and that third option also included children as well so it was kind of like that funloving the fool you know the fool card and the Tarot deck you know you're just taking that leap and and and and moving forward with it and that was a great group but I I do feel that we were kind of a step ahead of society back then well even prior to that the men's Mysteries and the women's Mysteries you went to the one you were called to it did not have to match what you were born physically in you could go to whichever mystery you felt drawn to and there was no problem whatsoever we've said this in episodes before the very first May Queen the very first person drawn from the women's mysteries in that Community was a biological male and that was something that just kind of carried through they did not care where you went you know the most part about that was what's that nobody even questioned it they were like hurah yeah yeah yay May queen queen of the May woohooo and it was never an issue uh some people would go to one mystery one year and the next the next year and it has never been a problem in that particular community and that does seem to hold true for a lot of witches and a lot of pagans whether you're Wiccan or not we do talk a lot about god and goddess because again it's that polarity that Duality but that encompasses every single part of that range between the two of them that's kind of why I like the me personally like that kind of god or goddess line there because you know you've got the god and goddess the polarity the light the dark the Ying the Yang you know I don't want to say the good and the bad because it's not like that but like that polarizing the Opposites and take gender out of it and everything in this world kind of runs on opposites you know like we have to have that ying and yang in a lot of situations in our lives you have to have the day and the night you have to have the Sun and the Moon you know you have to have the summer and the winter yeah yeah you have to have these things and so that's how I look at it and that really goes towards how I perceive deity anyways which is very much a an animistic I guess point of view I feel that all of these energies are deity like the force of gravity the force of nature the the crazy chaos that created life on this planet all of those things to me that's what deity is and we give them names we give them backstories we give them characteristics and so they become kind of an archetype or an egregor but I don't necessarily feel that they are actual people I just feel that they're more like the forces of nature energies more than human personifications exactly and so because we are describing them in our image we come in all different shapes sizes gender Expressions everything and so too do the gods you know every way that we look and can be there is a deity for that there is a God can look and can be exactly and deity is us and it is all of these things all these forces around us of Nature and of life and we just give it a name and a face so that we can better understand it in my opinion kind of the it doesn't need a name we need a name yes oh I love that that's awesome need the name yes we do you're exactly right need the name we need the name we need the name so that we can better understand that energy and better relate it to ourselves and to our lives and and what we want to do with that energy but I do like the calling of that Duality within which for myself and that Duality can be you know two Warrior for all I care I I'm just looking for that Duality you know what I'm saying yes and and that's where a lot of that energy comes from you know maybe it's the two different sides of yourself whether you want to describe that as the masculine side of yourself or the feminine side of yourself whether it's your Shadow Self and your light self it's those parts of us that are different enough to constantly be a little bit battling but also complimentary enough to make them better than they are by themselves let them EB and flow into the universe succinctly the idea of the God and the goddess these archetypes are supposed to be better together they supposed to Encompass the all together you know fit the different parts it says it right in the freaking for what one lacks the other shall provide right it says it right in the the great right yeah the great right you know for what one lacks the other shall provide for together they are greater than I don't know no one is greater than the other for one for what one lacks the other shall provide right a I don't remember yeah but anyways it's about being better together just like us we're better together too we are our version of the great right we compliment each other and and so those energies can come from anywhere in the 90s especially the idea of having a goddess be not just equal to and out there with a God but maybe slightly even cooler than the God that was so empowering at the time I was like hell yes the goddess is here she's the Earth she's the moon she's all these cool things yes well I think that had a lot to do with where we were in life then because yeah you know I've actually been I've been looking into this not to to left turn here for a second but you know people keep talking about this Resurgence in witchcraft or Resurgence in spirituality I kind of look at it as the Next Generation has left the founded religions yes it's like every generation gets to a point where they leave the founded religions and go to earth-based religions back when we did it our our kind of uprising of Witchcraft and and paganism our our time it was a big time to focus on the goddess as a backlash like you were saying to that patriarchal Christian male dominated everything it was a big backlash to that and I think that's why that the focus was so much on the goddess back then not so much that she was more important than the god per se but because we were just pissed and finally able to put something above quote unquote God and because we could we would and we were finally able to say there is Magic and Power in creating life there's magic and Power in feminine energy however it's expressed and that everyone can claim that everyone can claim that feminine energy it should not be less than and I just think a lot of people think that they've spent so much of their life either wanting to or being forced to focus on quote unquote God that they're kind of over it for now and want to focus on just the goddess yeah especially in the 90s it was very much that but now we've kind of moved past the need to have god goddess and we again talk more about the universal energies that are behind them well because we've evolved to the Next Generation who is shedding their founded religions which is evolving the verbage and all of that that that we're used to absolutely and I love it because I do love claiming all sides of myself I do love that the people that I know that don't have a womb to represent the Chalice of the Goddess don't need to feel left out when we talk about these energies you know and I don't want to be I don't want to be broken down to just my reproductive capabilities there's more to me than that you know maybe especially now as we are leaving the mother stage of the you know the maiden mother Crone oh right there's got to be more to it than that like the dudes get what is it the son the warrior and the sage I think there should be like more of a universal thing like that because I am more than a maiden a mother and a crone what if I never wanted to be a mother and that is why you and I are fans of the fourth face of the Goddess Maiden mother Warrior Crone we are in our Warrior phase things are evolving past the need to describe everything by your reproductive capabilities or lack thereof you know there's more to us than that and I love that we are embracing these energies of deity of god and goddess as more than just their gender you know there's so much they're the energies there's this life you know if you want to be wild and free and more connected to the Earth you can call konos you know the the horned god of the wood and you can feel more of that energy it doesn't matter what kind of god or goddess you need you're looking to the energy behind them the energy that empowers them you're you're looking for their attributes not their specific gender so the polarity is great but like shell said you can have you know two badass goddesses have polarity you know maybe you have you have two badass gods have polarity exactly you know maybe you're looking to you know maybe you're in college or maybe you you know your job is very cerebral and you you need one God to give you this you know I can focus and be creative and and do this type of work and then another God that's very forceful and I can be strong and outspoken in meetings you know you can you still have that Duality I see a pan and konos ritual coming now that sounds like a good time right right but yeah so you know you're looking to the energies you don't so much have to have a God and a goddess if you're looking for that balance you can find that balance in the energies that they represent gender doesn't have to enter into it at all and I think that's maybe the biggest point we want folks to take away from from this today is that it isn't just because they're called gods and they're called goddesses doesn't necessarily mean they have to fit into that gender box you know it it it's like we always say take what works for you and roll with it and there are people that believe these energies are truly energies embodied in some type of celestial being you know that is the way that some people perceive them that's how they they come through to certain witches and magical people they've been called upon and worked with so much these energies that it almost feels like I guess iggor is the best way it's like a creation like we've created it because we all believe in this energy in in these attributes it almost becomes a an entity of its own like an energy of its own do you know what I'm saying like Kate comes to you it's she's an energy but she's definitely feels like a person right a being right yeah but at the same time that you say that do you believe that somewhere out there is a hak hanging out and doing her own thing okay so remember when my kids used to watch nothing but Disney movies yes oh gosh you had the best Disney library of anyone I've ever met but since his VHS it's all junk now so I want to say it might have been Pocahontas that this was in so it was like grandmother willow remember grandmother willow from pocon so like they this whole thing was lit up with fireflies and the fireflies kind of formed one shape and then I don't remember what happened that was a long time ago either a bird chirped or something happened and the fireflies all scattered and it went from what looked like one being one shape to millions and that's almost kind of how I look at deity is almost like all these things come back together and create one thing and then splits into a gazillion pieces as we need those attributes you know what I'm saying does that make sense the visual does in my head it's perfect I absolutely love how you explained that because that's exactly how I believe it as well I believe that when we call upon these deities these archetypes these energies say I'm I want to talk to ranan for example say you're calling upon ranan she's the the goddess of the horses she's the goddess of the PLS and and running I don't know all I can fig was Stevie Nicks she's the goddess of Stevie Nicks people there you go okay so you call upon the goddess of Stevie Nicks and you call her into your circle and you're calling these energies just like sh I love the metaphor shell of all these pieces all these things that make up what rean and is to you come together to form that entity to form that the technical term is egregor it's a something that you have created a being that you have created out of your idea so you create this deity as you call on them for each person that deity will be different those fireflies all those individual pieces that you pull together to shape that deity is going to be different based on your understanding but if you're looking for for that piece about horses and rebirth and fertility you're going to get that little ranan Firefly coming at you absolutely because these archetypes are around for a reason these energies are there you know they they appear in the same that's why in in cultures these different deities are so much the same they have different names and slightly different backstories but their attributes and their ideas can be so very very similar because these energies exist you know the the idea of love and creating life the idea of war and hatred and and Magic exist and so interestingly enough the deities that we have created around them are very very similar in a lot of cultures so as much as I just told you my whole Firefly analogy there still is a piece of me that I don't know you know I'm a weirdo and have such weird thoughts but I I do sometimes think that there are deities maybe not everyone but there are deities that were real people in real life at one time that kind of got that status and I'll give you a good example not that this person is a deity or to me anyway but there are some people that look at Mother Teresa is a deity I get it I'm with you I'm on board but I also she did some kind of bad stuff too don't they all yeah they she was a real person you know what I mean but people whether we like her or go for it or not is is irrelevant but people some people have elevated her to that status the whole idea of sainthood in the Catholic faith right I mean how many people pray to St Michael when they lose is that the one you pray to when you lose I don't know it might be but um that was a person you know what I mean so I think that there are some deities that were people at one point in history that Society kind of elev ated to deity status does that make sense I think that gets into a lot of of uh ancestor veneration I don't necessarily believe in the Catholic version of saints but I do believe that there are people whose Souls maybe or whose energy is very very good and or very strong I mean some people have amazing connections with their ancestors and when they pray to their ancestors for things to happen it happens exactly that because they have such a strong connection and they're ancestors are such strong Souls they're able to work their will with that ancestor's help I don't necessarily know if that ancestor has become a God but like you're saying say Mother Teresa who I don't love example Gandhi would be another example Gandhi would be something that somebody that would be put to deity status I would think that's because everyone knows these names these names are known around the world it's not just a family or a person that knows them that's how a lot of these gods and goddesses I think possibly got created in the first place maybe it was you see what I'm saying at some point in time I think some maybe not all but I think some of these deities were real people in history that that Society kind of elevated for one reason or another whether I believe it or not and and I just think that like Mother Teresa and Gandhi are the best examples of like actual human beings that I know that are that are potentially being elevated to that status that's an interesting concept because when you talk about these ideas of energies becoming like we want to say thank you for babies being born so we we create a deity around childb birth and and we talk about them maybe some of that gets mixed up with maybe there was a great Midwife that you know helped bir hundreds and hundreds of babies and so the concept of this lifegiving uh birthing goddess gets mixed up with this very real person person yeah yeah and so that energy can get mixed up with the universal energy of life creation and that gets a name and a face put on it you know I think a lot of deity probably did come that way a lot of this the folk stories you know a lot of these deity stories started as Folk stories exactly and that that's definitely along the lines of how I think about deity I just I just think that there are some that were kind of created by Society nothing wrong with that nothing wrong I think that's perfectly legitimate but I feel that we are all part of deity I think that we are all part of this Universal amazing energy just being alive is magical and the idea that we have thought and sentience and we became creatures that exist on this planet is  magical and I think we are all part of that life force that deity I think we are all part of god goddess everything you know it's in the grass it's in the animals it's in the crystals it's in the herbs it's in it's in each of us so I think that really kind of wraps up my views on deity is there anything else that you want to put out there to folks if you want to learn a little bit more about The Duality uh of god and goddess there's a couple books I do recommend I love Jack chik's queen of all witcheries oh I love that book fantastic if you want to get a deep dive into goddess and Jason Mankey is the horned god of the witches and that will give you a good overall grounding in the god side of it do your research Leila put those books
