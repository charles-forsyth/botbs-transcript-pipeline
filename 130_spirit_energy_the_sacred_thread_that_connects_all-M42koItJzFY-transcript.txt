wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  I am welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and this is the fifth of our five-part Elemental Series in this episode will be talking about Spirit Akasha ether the element that connects all the other elements and I'm show and you know I'm almost said that this this little mini series is coming to an end but ending with spirit and ding with that the Kasha energy it's exciting but I'm sad wrap up the series it is wonderful to reminisce about old thoughts old Deeds I'm how we viewed things how maybe those views have changed are still ons in my opinion but the opportunity to seek out some new content and material in the form of books and information and kind of get different thoughts and perspectives about elements that  thought of in the past and I do really just want a quick mention this book because it was really Kick-Ass obviously going back through I don't know what I have 56 old books of Shadows you know Reminiscing on that but I got a hand on Karen Michelle's love the name by the way here and Michelle's Elemental witchcraft a guide To Living a magical life through the elements fabulous book this is not a sponsored book actually paid for this and it was Kick-Ass and helped me with this deep dive into the elements I see all the notes we want to go get it so I am also getting a copy of that book to check out again not a sponsor but I'm so glad that you mentioned books and going down memory lane because I actually have a listener question that I'd like to bring up before we go any further with this episode now this is a question that I get a lot of questions  before but again we get a spit a lot so I'm going to answer it yet again back in some of our earlier episodes we mentioned one book repeatedly and we said this book was called 10000 goddesses and we talked about it quite often that we always would refer to this book when looking up goddesses around the world this is a perfect example of a Mandela effect it is because you and I are both absolutely 100% sure it was called Ten Thousand see the cover of it in my head and very clearly it says 10,000 goddesses that book does not exist dammit Mandela effect at all in the alternate universe where Michelle and I both had this book that's where it exists but it's an amalgamation of two books that we both had it that time do which is goddess by Janet and Stewart Farrar and also  book of goddesses and heroines by Patricia Monaghan so those two books which neither one of them has $10,000 in it but those two books other ones that we kind of somehow put together in our heads to create 10,000 goddesses know you're wrong there wasn't called that I just did it's been wiped from like the internet and like it's just been wiped I don't know why you do my logical brain knows that that book does not exist I know this however my memory and my subconscious beg to differ they are insistent that the book is real and I just haven't found it yet and sometimes you and I have both lost our copies of it mine must have been lost in the flood that you must have lost your son to move it I don't know but in my mind when I think of the two books 10,000 goddesses in ten thousand Gods I am thinking of the covers of the witches God in the sky  okay if it's interesting because 10,000 goddesses to me has the car goddesses and heroines really yeah same title different cover so I guess it really is just an amalgamation of all of thousands and thousands of goddesses and gods that information on them lots of good information in those books and goddesses it's just us and our terrible memories no speaking of books that are fabulous and fabulous witchy book stores that you can get them at I'm probably going to get that Elemental book when I come visit you in Salem at the shop where you got it now speaking of visiting me in Salem and coming in contact with me at the shop I work at I saw  first murder in the bayou very cool I was so excited when you mentioned that you were just so thrilled that a listener had found you I literally texted you while I was still there so I don't know who is more excited you or them probably both of us but we do have a public service announcement we do I want to thank everybody who does go to Salem and have a good time there's so much to see and do their shell and I will definitely help you with our favorites with what we

know sometimes you're just drawn to people and he was looking at me and he was looking at me and you know I keep walking well I started talking to one of my co-workers I don't even know what I was saying blah blah blah blah blah and then it comes up to me and he goes I do have a question do you do a podcast cuz I have a distinctive voice shall I do you know I have allergies so that doesn't help either and he's a big fan you was visiting from  Orleans we did hugs we did a selfie it was fabulous actually he tagged Us in the selfie check it out online and it was such a wonderful interaction and I'm so glad you stopped in and said something you commented to me like immediately if I would like to buy it if I don't  I don't know who was more excited hit where I see it now that's a lovely and

until this podcast starts doing anything other than costing us money I need to work that's right we need to have regular jobs or two and please don't park downtown Salem you are coming to Salem and you are like I'm just going to park on the street no go to the MBTA train station parking ramp that's your best bet that's all I got for you love you see you soon yeah so parking is going to be absolute hell take some public transportation in to Salem save yourself and everyone else a headache wrinkled I'm all right so now we've gotten all that out of the way let's get into this really interesting topic of spirit know I had a thought and I think that sometimes  people might get a little bit confused with the element of spirit vs. deity okay yeah you know I have the same thought I figured I'd bring it up now because will spearhead off this the element of spirit making sure that we're making that clear line between spirit and deity with deity I look at it me personally almost kind of like different different faces of the same entity spirit I feel is more encompassing of that and everything yeah I agree I think spirit is everything spirit is the element that weaves all the other elements together it's the energy of life and Magic itself everything and everywhere but it has no shape or name of its own deity on the other hand is different videos much more personal gods and goddesses are Divine forces with names and stories and will  they embody big aspects of the world and life around us that we have trouble explaining any other way like love wisdom the moon or fertility but we give it an identity that you can call on that you can worship and build a relationship with so it's more personal that way so in my opinion you feel spirit in meditation and the magic in the world and in powerful things and moment and you talked to Daddy both our sacred Spirits the all the everything and deity is the space that we give two parts of spirit so that we can better understand it and so that we can better work with it and a lot of times people particularly if you have a Wiccan background or if you get into that kind of Elemental background people will call you in the spirit position we talked about North being Earth people will say Spirit the center position is d a d but they're not the same thing Spirit has different names in different cultures but they all describe  something that's extraordinary something precious and sacred the Greeks came up with ether because if the air that's high enough and special enough for the gods to breathe or sometimes people call it quintessence which literally means fifth element or a Kasha which is space because it was special it was this element that kind of wraps around everything that encompassed everything so if it's more than just I hate to say just eating so don't mean it like that but it but it's everything what I think of you know how when you was thinking your mind you know we've talked about visualizing each of these elements and you know what are you might visualize Cool Breeze or fire roaring fire you know water of a river and Ocean Creek a stream  with Spirit what I envisioned in my mind when I'm visualizing spirit is space space space like outer space the spiral nebula visualizing deity I have a face you know what I'm saying you know it's interesting because I like the idea of universe as everything to me when I talk about Universe are Universal energy I'm talking about exactly that Spirit the all the everything and it isn't a deity it but it is everything but it's all encompassing exactly they have a name they have a back story they have history behind them they are a face of spirits they are an aspect of spirit but they are not all of spirit so now let's talk about this.  now that we've talked about his spirit is not I think of it as this all-encompassing energy that kind of what I'm visualizing is it taking that earth air fire water my energy is swirly snow globe of wonderfulness spirit is kind of the all-knowing in my mind kind of the I don't want to say the end-all-be-all but kinda Kate of Kate and Frank Fame back in the day some of my first teachers okay okay we've all seen the pentacle right as a description of the elements and people will ascribe air fire water Earth to the different points of the pentacle and some people will say that the top point is Spirit correct I was taught that the top point is  spell and that spirit is the lines that make up the pentacle oh oh shit I like that I've never heard that actually isn't that beautiful because spirit is what makes it all spiritual connection all together I like that I love that it is between everything and it creates everything if you didn't have Spirit you wouldn't have that Pentacles I have the elements on it so you know as much as I love that in my mind I think maybe instead of self instead of self that could be where I would Place deity would be sure absolutely but I also think that deity is so I think that we are deity and so that fits for me that I could interchange those in my mind and in my belief system all life is Daddy your daddy I'm daddy Namaste the Divine Light Within Me recognizes the Divine Light Within you kind of thing will remember that photo where they equate the human body  do you know where the guy who spread out the point is his head like your knowledge your enter your enter your enter Divine so that's kind of what I was taught is that that's that's what spirit is you know it's a little hard to describe sometimes because it's that ineffable something that gives us life sometimes I described it as chaos and all right for all of your Puris out there I am not talking about the Austin Osman spare version of chaos magic I'm talking about chaos itself the chaos of nature the chaos of Life the chaos that somehow made some little organism crawl out of the ocean and become shell and I talking to you on these microphone that chaos that spark of wild random chance that chaos to me is spirit and so that's hard to describe as hard to pin down and that's why I was a little I was a little ants  see about this particular episode cuz I'm like how the hell do you describe Spirit 2 from the symbology touchdown as a little bit with it with a pentacle but there are a lot of symbols that people throughout time have used to depict Spirit and the sky in the universe have been and done some of those depictions and I think that is maybe where I get that thought of when I realized Spirit energy I'm kind of visualizing the stars out in space you know that idea of space to me something beyond what we can touch that magical fire that's out there a sort of Saint candles for example and you know how you have your symbol for fire you have your symbol for water so what I would I use for a symbol of spirit is actually the star I'm not  saying a pentacle purse say and sometimes used to represent spirit I color it in so it is distinctively not a pentacle because of that visualization of space being what works for me and so that that star is that Spirit energy and again I am distinguishing a star separate for optical eye like that and it's interesting because one of the symbols that I see a lot representing spirit is a circle but not the line of the circle the center of a circle the nothingness that's right there like an actual Circle itself sometimes will represent spirit and I think that's interesting because when we would call Spirit if we're doing say what we would think of as a traditional Circle we would call Deedee as a representative of spirit to fill the center of the circle right and I do see sometimes when you're talking about putting things on an altar  sometimes people will just leave the center of the altar empty to represent spirit because that's a place for Spirit to fill so you'll see is that sometimes it is an empty vessel or even just an empty space to represent space for that Spirit to come in to see now as far as altar set up I kind of look at the altar itself is Spirit holding up all the other elements so I look at the actual altar as the spirit tool holding up an encompassing all of the other tools and elements I love that idea could do that intentionally on the altar itself and as a representation of spirit put oils on it or rub in senses into it put it out under the moon or the sun to absorb energy to be that Spirit representation  Rochester my neighbors probably said shit like that on a regular basis crap out in the one of the other representations that I really love for spirit is the spiral absolutely absolutely viral just like Spirit represents Evolution it represents growth of the spirit it's a symbol of change and movement we've done something with spirals before I feel like we've done something not too long ago with spirals we did this Fool's Journey back in March at the Sacred Space conference down in Maryland so let's let's talk about how our Fool's Journey ritual kind of relates to this Spirit energy is that liminal space we talked about it being the lines itself of the pentacle and spirals are one of the oldest symbols of spirit energy spirit is the on  thread that connects and animates everything all of existence and spirals represent that energy either the path of Awakening the Journey of the soul may begin at the center with the self and a spiral outward to the universe or back inward towards your own self towards your personal Divine truth spirals represent that Spirit energy that flows through all things and that's kind of what we talked about when we did that ritual the full star knee was finding that spark within yourself wherever you happen to be on that spiral if you keep walking that you're going to come back to yourself at some point you know you're going to find that to you you within yourself that spiral represents the sacred is the first step of a journey you know it's the Fool's journey of that sacred self that sacred hero's journey that we all kind of go off and it's that liminal space where everything is possible that's what Spirit represents your spirit is that spark it's that pretend before the spa  exactly is everything and nothing could you do when I talked about my visualization of space in the universe the Stars you mentioned that even the Spice Girls if you know I said the Milky Way these are the same spirals is the Labyrinth or something similar you know they all kind of swirl around and in a do you think how does spiral doesn't just keep tightening self not necessarily labyrinths aren't excellent representation for spirit because much like a spiral they represent the Journey of the Soul just like life there's only one way in and one way out it's the same path spiraling in and out through Infinity walking the Labyrinth is my favorite way to get in touch with us. Energy the walking and switching directions is a really good for your brain and can be a meditative and hypnotic to Laswell perfect word spirit  looks like there's no beginning and no ending in the Funhouse looking through the window looking through those like back-to-back mirrors symbology the people had to represent the energy of deity or the energy of the ineffable and they would put it on goddesses they put it on Newgrange they put it on rocks and carve it into stone all over the place because this idea of the Spiral of deity is so magical the people it's a concept that has fascinated people for a very long time and another representation is back to one of your favorite shell is a mirror love both your own reflection and just the mirror itself as a liminal space I do like they do with that because it gives you that that Infinity all things are infinite means like facing each other  Xfinity Wi-Fi look at that too long at totally tripped me out that there is an Infinity to all things to live forever no but your spirit moves and we all Dust in the Wind but but I feel personally that we all continue to exist on sublevel so yeah Infinity it it it represents us crying and things like that or do you like to represent a liminal space that is spirit is if you take a very thin veil preferably something that you can see through and put that over a mirror because now you've got the duo representation of liminal spaces you've got a mirror and you've also got a veil over top of it if you shine the light on it and it's a nice then bail so you can just kind of see through to the mirror on the other side  I find it that's a really nice way if you can get yourself into an alpha meditative State and gaze into a mirror like that that's more of a representation of looking into Spirit looking into that liminal Spirit space I was going to say that gives me fives of like Crossing through the fail to having that connection with the spirit world when you do the veil over the beer that is like the greatest representation for Tiffany's we are talking about a spirit but I'll think of crossing the literal Veil yeah yeah and our brains love that our brains love when the physical representation matches the magical representation you put that mirror underneath the literal Vale your brain says who I'm crossing the veil to get to the information on the other side you are in the spirit Realm  that's spirit is more of a place that a place that I'm not a tight Circle and again it's that Circle hey this is a space out of space in the time out of time we are casting it to bring us into that realm that realm of magic that realm of other knowing and other beings into again is that Circle no beginning and no end then we cast that magical space to where we stand in the center again in that Spirit realm which does contain Spirits like ancestor Spirits land spirits but more by Spirit realm we mean magical space liminal space face of this is so hard to get really is because you know  my grandma is a spirit and I love her but when I am invoking Spirit my grandpa knows I'm not calling her he's not what I mean part of it everything is part of it but he's part of it like the all knowing all things all thing I mean all things like everything that the all of everything out of all five at like like what is what is the spark of life where did we come from where did knowledge come from how did we all of a sudden become sentient that spark is Spirit how did we go from ABE to human how do we have a podcast right at this very moment  if we can figure that out who is it are we I don't even know but if we could figure out what that Divine spark is what is that what is that stole that Center that everything that we could tell the people with Spirit more bucks oh yeah oh I love books this is the best explanation I can give you after 35 years that's all I know is going to hate this what what the best way to connect with spirit is stillness it's quiet in those Quiet Moments that was quiet you're supposed to be still how are you writing in a journal after you right after you have your quiet still moment and then you reflect on it and I really do  you should write it down you could just think it to yourself but it's going to be better if you write it down so that you don't forget right just key words right feelings but spirit is found in those moments that are hard to describe those those moments of pure perfection Spirits going to be found when you're carrying around that backpack full of journals that Layla make sure  write 50 pages a day right of page a day for every day of your life and you will find Enlightenment my child know I don't know where it is I don't know where that moment of Stillness of beautiful Perfection is but I found it I still Chase it but this one of those places where you can find spirit I really do feel that meditation and deep reflection is one of those places if your life to a place for Spirit 30 years ago isn't necessarily where I would have done 20 years ago which isn't necessarily right now so just as the world revolves our thoughts or ideas and in how we view things of Olives I was thinking about times when have I felt spirit and and we talked about times and ritual when we've invokes deity or when we've drawn down the moon or drawn down the goddess and those up  pretty special moments but I've also felt Beauty when I first met my husband that weird Divine amazingness there's been times I've been out in nature many so many thanks a lot, it's so perfect it's just so wonderful and that to me is also that Divine spark that Spirit you know it's funny that you make it sound so beautiful and romantic because not too long ago during this series actually right before we were doing the water episode we happen to have a hurricane go off the coast of Massachusetts and me and my sweet darling had to go down to the water cuz you know I love a good rager and I felt that same energy would high tide was  coming in and it was I mean the waves were bag but you know I'm from the woods so I thought they were big my sweet darling was like yeah that's amazing undeniable energy the wind the water I mean I understand that there wasn't a fire peace there but you can just it's almost like you fell everything in the universe in kind of a rage and you've got that moment of feeling Spirit it doesn't have to always be that perfect quiet moment right wild raging sometimes they're amazing moments and feeling that all that inspiration that is to me is also Spirit but sometimes standing out in the middle of wild raging storm or when the waves are crashing that can be pretty powerful and inspiring is  I can also say the same thing about when I popped out to kids so you know that was depending on you feel it at different moments in time in different ways absolutely absolutely well I said that so weird popped out two children I didn't mean that in a bad way I love them both Workaholics whatever you happen to do if you ever get into that flow state where everything just seems to be coming perfectly and it's working and and you're you're writing down everything and everything is coming together yes this is perfect for writing but yeah you do you get into that kind of that Perfection that feeling that is also spirit that feeling when everything is just right it's like the perfect storm is funny that I said that because that goes back to that can be that chaotic  The Perfect Storm can be good and bad this isn't always good energy of creation is also the most things spirit is everything it is it is the line that encompasses everything that connects all of us and everything good and bad and everything in between that's why I love that you described it as the lines of the pentacle because you see it is what creates it and I see it encompassing it all kinds of 10,000 goddesses it was a real book damn it I'm pretty sure it was that had two different covers somehow  it was such an atmosphere for our copper you just remembering that piece wrong but those two books The Witches goddess and the Book of goddesses and heroines are what we have been dismissed remembering as the book of 10000 goddesses or we fell into an alternate universe or Mandela effect or whatever but we have those two books and we will put pictures of them on our socials to try and help out but yeah I get that question a lot so I was sorry I'm sorry everybody that we had some weird Mandela effect that we've put you on like this Rabbit Hole looking for a book to exist because I can't tell you how many times I have had to type out I am so sorry Sal and I have memories like swiss cheese, we know it's just because we can't find it doesn't mean anything and just because we were having different covers doesn't mean  the last thirty years never up next will be at the Spirit meditation coming in a few days thank you guys all for your encouragement on that if you like the meditations
