it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 68 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends separated by way too many miles get together to smoke mass quantities of cannabis while telling each other the spookiest Tales of Cryptids ghost Ghouls and True Crime from across the US OFA coming to you today with ghosts and ghouls from the Grand Canyon I'm Lea and bringing some foreplay before episode 69 I'm shell oh I love it I can't wait to hear what you've got to say but first let's talk about our last episode and how Britney pointed out that we say a few words funny I'm editing the episode and I'm I get to the part where we're talking about documentary and Elementary yeah I'm like this is so weird to me I'm such a word nerd I have to look this up right so I go online and I start looking and I find a YouTube video two ways to say Elementary no there's not wait do you hear this Elementary and Elementary yeah but the the end of element Elementary it it doesn't end with t r e it's not element Tre like there's no tree in the word none of them are Elementary so I had to look a little further what elementary or Elementary those are it so I had to look further because that can't be right and apparently once I found some people who are into local dialects and accents that's where I found out that Upstate New York is the only place where people say documentary Elementary and sedimentary you kidding me no I'm not they're like the only people on the planet who said no wonder people in my my mundane day job laugh at me when I say things like that that's it some places in Pennsylvania some places on the East Coast a little bit but almost exclusively to Upstate New York so I was like if you doubted where we were from here now you know that's funny that is funny so I thought that was pretty hilarious and it was Britney was it Britney yes Britney told us about the Kappa and she's also the one Britney is also the one that said we say Elementary documentary and Oregon wrong all right Britney now did you look up Oregon what's the deal with Oregon for Oregon I'm going to pull one of the many emails that we got in regards to how weirdly we say words we actually got a bunch of emails about how weird we say words apparently people are laughing their asses off over us across the country and around the world because just Upstate New York says that that's how they're spelled damn it t a r y how else are you supposed to say Terry where do they get tree out of that I have a funny mundane World story for you real quick yesterday at my work Massachusetts has some weird Town names they even have like Tick Tock about how weird the names are understandable so I had to talk to a cooworker about another branch of our office in what I call Leo Minister and he's like hold on a second and I could tell he put me on speaker phone and see I was working from home and he was in the office that day and I could hear you turn me on speaker phone and he goes can you say that again I go Leo Minister and I could literally hear the whole freaking office bust out laughing at me apparently they pronounce it lemoner and I'm like then why isn't it spelled l e m o n s t r if you want to say lemonster lemon stir Leo minister is how it's spelled what is wrong with people it can't just be me you're laughing at me too I'm not laughing at you I'm laughing at Massachusetts because you are so right just look at freaking Worster I'm sorry that's not how it's spelled orchester right that's right so it's not us it's the rest of the world I'm telling you okay so how do you pronounce Oregon did you figure that out because I need to know because now I'm DED okay so in the landslide of emails that we got lovely Kelsey emailed us and she says hey guys I just want to say that I absolutely love your podcast and can't wait to listen to it every week at work where are you people working that we're okay to listen to but anyways while I smoke more of this joint I am also listening to your all's older podcast as well I from North Carolina and have been to Major Graham Mansions haunted raction several times so we're going to have to look that one up she says I always have such a blast there I personally have never seen anything there but while going through the quote unquote haunted house you definitely get vibes that there is something there besides you and the workers I have heard several stories of people seeing shadows there and always feel like someone is watching me then she says also I have never heard anyone else pronounce Elementary documentary in Oregon like y'all do if heard me you would definitely think I am the one with the accent my Southern way of saying these words are Elementary documentary and or Aon oron really oragon or that how people say it oron oron I guess so Elementary document AR and oron okay Elementary document doc wait I can do Elementary but is it document documentary uhuh like uh documentary okay so documentary or or aan Oran yeah o r ah gun or a gun or a gun but but it's not spelled g at the end I don't know or a gun like that's not how it's spelled I I know hey you know I'm not sure Oregon is that really it's called I'm telling you oron Trail man I play Oregon Trail it's the Oregon Trail my sixth grade teacher called it the Oregon Trail so I it has to be I don't know someone from Oregon has to weigh in here I need maybe they're talking about a different place maybe maybe there's a whole another state that we have not heard of yet possible it's possible I don't know anyway I think we need to start a movement where everything is spelled phonetically there you go I mean you'd think I mean my goodness what the heck my first question is why wouldn't you pronounce Elementary and documentary the same way because they're spelled the same way at the end of the word I'm so confused we're gonna have to start a whole new podcast trying to get to the bottom of why everyone else says these words wrong she finishes by saying I have a super southern accent and would love to hear y'all try to pronounce them like that on the podcast well there you go we tried thank you for making my work dayss a little better and keep on staying high and staying spooky Kelsey from North Carolina I love that people listen to us from while they're at work because I couldn't listen to us at work that'd be bad well thankfully I work from home so you know I'm a pretty lenient boss I could listen to me at work but the funny thing is and this is for Kelsey and all of our other Southern friends we might be from upstate New York but we actually do say y'all what are y'all doing oh everybody says y'all now y going it's like we say y'all but we also say Elementary we've got we've got listeners in in the UK um in Britain in England folks back me up here can someone who is a UK listener can you tell me please send us an email the stone Wich isour at G mail.com does the queen's English say Elementary I need to know this I don't understand why we're the only ones who say it the right way so since we're laughing about all this and are finding great humor in it I need to know what are you smoking to get you through these horrible spellings and and pronunciations well today I'm smoking two different things I'm smoking some Lemon Cherry gelato which I'm very much liking this is a actual hybrid I'd say this is a good 50% sativa 50% indicia citrusy I'm because the Lem the lemon okay yes this does also have a little bit of that Pine that you don't like but it has a really nice Citrus almost like that fresh green pine taste not not a musty green if that makes sense it's more fresh not that piny gassy taste no no this is really really good very tasty and it's got a 29% THC definitely got me nice and Stony and I'm also smoking a jack hair number two which I haven't had and uh this one's really good this one has a little bit of lower THC but I'm not really telling much of a difference supposedly this is between 22 and 25% but for whatever reason maybe it's the tarpine reactions I'm not sure but this one is also got a really nice spicy lemony taste and even though it's it's 22 to 25% THC it does feel very very Stony maybe it's because this is a sativa dominant and that tends to hit me a little more cerebrally and make me very talkative Maybe because of of its sativa nature that's kind of making me feel the THC a little harder not sure but I've got a nice Stone going on and I'm pretty excited about our story so what are you smoking today sh well today I got some GMO cookies going on oh yummy this is only a 28% but let me tell you it makes you hungry as you as you noticed I had right before we started recording I had had a mound of spaghetti from smoking this stuff for a couple hours so you can't smoke this stuff when you've got no food source close to you there you go it's no fun to be stoned and hangry no no no no no no you know it kind of get gives you that uppity chatty but hungry Vibe definitely not a couch sucker um so this is not something you're going to want to put you to sleep by no stretch of the imagination awesome well good because I've got some pretty scary stuff to tell you about today I'm pretty excited I kind of mine's weird I got a weird one for you today oh well mine got sparked because of a news article just this past week I saw that a woman hiking in the Grand Canyon saw a demon what yep so you know why because there's demon portals in the Grand Canyon duh probably so this woman says that um she was hiking with her boyfriend and they were at the about the rim on one of the rims of the trails and they were stargazing she says as they were getting ready to walk back the trail to go to their car her boyfriend was overcome with Dread you know sometimes you're kind of out and all of a sudden that feeling creeps over you that something is not right and he was really really scared and she said that he insisted on going back to the car as quickly as possible and it was Pitch Black she says in about a 20 minute walk and as they're going back that feeling that something was off just kept getting stronger and stronger and then they started to hear something whistling whistling whistling like a person she just says it was like an eerie strange whistling coming from the woods around them that's when you pick up the pace a little bit that's exactly what they did she said her boyfriend started to panic and they started to run but he started to run in the wrong direction it's almost like he got so scared he just took off running but more towards the sound and away from their car why why would you run towards the noise he's not sure she's just pretty sure that he was in a blind panic and she had to catch him and convince him to go the other way back to the car but she could tell that he was terrified she says just as she convinced him to turn around and they headed in the correct direction she could hear something running behind them and it was panting I will say this though now you got to think of the environment there there's a lot of [ __ ] there they have uh what the hell are they called mountain goats they have bison they have the mountain lions I mean when you're thinking about like animal activity Prime would I be afraid that there'd be a damn pan No not a panther but that there'd be like some mountain lion coming after me hell yeah like what made them think that it was something Supernatural of sorts and not necessarily something from the Animal Kingdom that you know what I'm saying about the environment out there and you hit exactly on what some people are saying is that there are mountain lions in that area and the running and the heavy breathing even possibly the whistling if it was making some type of breathing noise or sometimes the vocalizations that they make could possibly sound like whistling even the feeling of fear has been possibly attributed to we have a we all have like an animal brain right right and like your primitive brain could have picked up on the fact that there was a very large scary Predator with big big teeth nearby and yeah and that TR I'm not trying to debunk you from the GGO I'm just oh no anybody hearing your story their first thoughts going to be well there's some crazy animal kingdoms out there well you jumped in before I got to that part but yeah so they got to the car and and got in the car and got away and critics are saying that could possibly have been a mountain lion not attack but possibly they were being chased by by a mountain lion she insists that it was a demon because of the intense fear that he felt the way that the the temperature dropped and the Darkness got really really dark what did my ex-husband show up possibly she's just pretty sure it was not a mountain lion you know who knows but that's what kind of sparked my interest because in the story where they're talking about this possible demon possible mountain lion sighting they also mentioned that there's a woman in white Legend so you know I had to look in further oh you and this woman in white so how please tell me the correlation between a demon and the woman in white because they seem like Polar Opposites well I guess it would depend on what kind of demon and whether it's a w failing woman like LA yarona or a woman in white who's just a little more tragic these lady in whites kind of take one of two turns that's either the lady in white who usually dies in a romantic tragic way exactly and then the Wailing woman who's also a lady in white who usually dies in a in a more vicious way she's a little angry and vindictive at the moment exactly she's an angry vindictive woman who died or killed herself usually taking someone else with so this one is kind of of a combination of the two so I started looking into it I didn't realize that the Grand Canyon was haunted is it really really is Native American would be my guess it does have a huge Native American history obviously it has been around for a very very long time the Grand Canyon is located in Arizona United States it's 277 miles long 18 miles wide and is about a mile deep in some places and scorpions live there there's lots of Critters that live speaking of demons and it is absolutely stunningly gorgeous and like shell said it was home to Native American peoples for a very very long time there are still some of the Old Stone and peblo type buildings in the walls some of which is a a gift shop at this point that you can go in that gift shop is also haunted by two little boys oh my God I know that gr you know how I know the Grand Canyon is haunted I just thought of this this just popped in my brain because on an episode of the The Brady Bunch they backpacked into the Grand Canyon and had a paranormal experience go on The Brady Bunch yeah they went in on like horses and mules yeah it was a great episode you should look it up so on the south rim is a structure called hopy house which is one of the Adobe style structures that the people that lived there lived in and it is a gift shop today and it is haunted by two little boys that they call the brown boys a I always hate little I hate little kid Spirits CU that's it's so sad to me yeah my guess is they were probably children that lived there back when it was a dwelling after the the shop has closed at night when they come in the next day it's pretty common for them to find items that are broken that look like they have been thrown from where they were also electronic items will be turned off if there's a radio playing or or lights that are on they'll usually be turned off when the people come back in in the morning they've been referred to mainly as doing Poltergeist type activities so throwing things rearranging things and turning Electronics off is pretty much what they get up to and it's usually only at night when there's no one there kind of like mischievous kids would do basically exactly now this is located next to another haunted place that's called el toar which is a um a hotel it's a current day Modern Hotel or it was a hotel like way back no it's currently a hotel that you can stay in it's on a bluff on the south rim when it was built in the early 1900s it was fabulously luxurious it was like the place to go just a beautiful beautiful place and the height of luxury when you say it's on the rim you're talking about the top right not the bottom it's at the top of the canyon it's at the top of the canyon yep okay at the south rim this property is known to host quite a few different ghosts people often see shadow people and ghosts walking up and down the stairs and and down the hallways and they know that their ghosts because they often dressed in think of like something someone wear to a party in the early 1900 kind of still like that that Victorian age clothing the long dresses the long sleeves the high necks exactly you know sometimes the flapper type dresses and that type of thing right was there gold mining in that area I don't know I'm asking was there gold mining during the gold rush in that area because that could have contributed to some ghostly ghosties I do know that a lot of cowboys and cowgirls kind of passed through there but I don't know if they ever did any gold mining in the can itself the mo more seen ghosts is a gentleman who died before the Hotel was even built but because he died on the property and was so well known in the area it's believed that his ghost still haunts the hotel never wanted to leave never wanted to leave people will often see him dressed as if he's going to a party in a very fancy suit welcoming people into the ballroom on the third floor even though there's no party going on in particular there was a Christmas party I don't know what year it was but people often talk about this Christmas party where a very well-dressed man who was slightly old-fashioned was welcoming so many people in the front door um and he they were all commenting that he must be dressed in character because he looked so old-fashioned and he was so proper when he invited everyone in wasn't a character was it they couldn't find him he didn't exist he was he wasn't someone at the party it was the Ghost of Fred Harvey and people will still see him occasionally either Walking The Halls or inviting people into that room at least he's friendly all the ghosts here do seem to very friendly and they all seem ready for a party what's up with that maybe because it was such a a fancy destination for people back in the day and that's where all these ghosts seem to kind of come from one couple from Los Angeles in their room as they were walking by they caught a reflection in the TV but it didn't move it looked like it was a person and it looked just like an old man with a beard and they have a picture of what looks like maybe an old cowboy or something almost as if he was in the room being ref Ed in the television that's cool though that is kind that that's like one of those things I wish I could see like every day yeah me too other people report having their clothes tugged on in the middle of the night as if someone's trying to get their attention while they're sleeping there's another place called crash Canyon and unfortunately it gets that name because there were two crashes there the bigger crash was in 1956 there was a midair Collision but of two airplanes and 100 28 people passengers and crew perished in the canyon holy [ __ ] and people hiking through there will report hearing the sound of metal and the sound of the crash along with people screaming and crying out as they go through the oh that's so horrible is horrible now the story of the woman in white it's a little less well known and this centers around North Rim and she's sometimes called the wandering woman she's almost always seen wearing a white dress that has little blue flowers all over it and sometimes with a a cief over her hair and she's seen pretty frequently on something called the transcept trail and her story is that they say that it happened in the early 1900s and that she was there with her husband and her young son and they were there on vacation her husband and son decided to hike the transp trail and she stayed behind at the lodge unfortunately the weather changed very quickly as it can do sometimes in the Grand Canyon and it started to rain and they didn't come back from the trail oh once the weather cleared she searched the trail relentlessly trying to find them wandering up and down the trail looking for them is that why her ghost is called the wandering woman because she's looking for them basically possibly Unfortunately they were found dead at the bottom of the canyon they had slipped off the trail and Fallen to their deaths and they were found holding heat she couldn't handle it and and she continued to wander up and down the trail crying and then unfortunately she went back to the lodge and took her own life so people will see her sometimes in the lodge but mostly wandering up and down the trail and they can hear her crying in the lodge itself it said that if you leave a door open she'll slam it shut oh so they usually leave the door shut because if you leave them open she'll just slam them shut there is a thing though with ghosts and windows open and doors open that they don't seem to like yeah I'm not sure what that is on September 1st in 1932 the original Lodge burnt down and multiple people reported seeing the face of a young woman in the Flames so that's her story it's been over a hundred years that she's been seen uh since the early 1900s has there been any like recent sightings that you've heard of yes you said that place is still open right the place is still open even today people will still see her in the lodge or hear her crying on the trail and some people do report seeing a woman in a white dress with blue flowers and a scarf on her head wandering the transp trail she's usually crying but people very often particularly at night will hear her wailing in the distance crying out for her lost family so still happening today but yeah lots of ghosts all over the place I had no idea it is unfortunately the site of a lot of accidents and a lot of suicides so it does have have its fair share of tragedy but yeah you can go and stay at any of these lodges and see the ghost or hike the trails there's also I had to pass up a ton of missing people stories and you know there's a whole bunch of different Legends you know there's a lot there as much as I know that there are creepy animals there like scorpions and stuff I've actually never been there and I really would love to go because everything I've ever seen on it it looks like one of the most gorgeous places on Earth it is stunning it is absolutely gorgeous and I I highly recommend every everybody should go there stay if you can the wildlife the views there's a lot and haunted why not go see some ghosts while you're there do a little ghost hunting now I got a little something different for you today my friend what you got show we have had a longstanding tradition here at the stoned Witches Hour to keep it in America because well that's what we chose I am veering from that today we talked a little bit in the beginning about our friend Britney all I can think of is Britney now I'm going to think Britney and accents but Britney had a great tip for me Britney happens to know that I am a sucker for a crypted yes you are my crypted queen I am a sucker for a crypted who could not love Nessie well I'll have to do an episode one time on on lock NES monster that's probably my favorite non-american crypted and I never heard of this one and just from a couple of things I pulled up last week I was like I have to do this so I've done my research Brittney and we all know I can't pronounce [ __ ] right refer to the beginning of this episode I think they're called the the Kappa the Kappa the Kappa I think it's the Kappa and the Kappa is a crypted that actually hails from Japan well we covered one in the Kasha House of Kaimuki oh yeah yeah yeah covered the Kasha which is another demon now this is like so if you're looking at a map of Japan um the ca actually originates from like the southern part of Japan kind of near like Nagasaki and I know we have some listeners in Toyo for all all of our uh listeners in Japan if you have had any experience with this please please email us because I got to know even though it originates from what's called The Saga region in Japan there are stories mythical stories about it being pretty much everywhere in Japan and this thing like Leila this is like a crypted lovers dream come true all I remember about this crypted is Britney said it liked cucumbers it likes cucumbers but there's something else about it that is just the funniest thing ever oh great funnier than liking cucumbers I mean come on a crypted that has a taste for cucumbers how funny is that no no th this this totally outdoes the Cucumber thing so it likes cucumbers but this son of a [ __ ] I don't even know if you're allowed to say that any here we're allowed to say anything we have no producers this thing is a crypted the Sumo wrestles it lik sumo wrestling that's adorable I love that but it kind of looks like a ninja turtle no way you're [ __ ] me it's a Ninja Turtle cucumber eating Sumo wrest yes that's fantastic how can I not about this all right you're allowed to go out of the US that's too fun so first of all too fun Britney you made my damn day with this one because this one is his I don't know if I want to go to Japan and meet it or if I am scared of it I don't know I don't know but there is a reason to be frightened um actually the Kaa remember the movie Alien aie Weaver yeah right yeah you know how on alien the alien had like that big elongated like thing like weird head thing yeah so this has kind of something like that and it's like it's got like a dip in it and it almost like a dish looks like it's got a plate on its head okay so that thing has water in it are we talking about a bong headed crypted no oh my God are you sure so it's got this water like this this like we'll call call it a plate for lack of a better word I'm sure there's a better description for it but I'm GNA call it a plate so it's got this like thing on its head and it's filled with water and if that runs dry it will die oh okay a couple of stories I read said it'll die if there's no water in it and another said it would lose its Supernatural Powers if the water ran dry in its head it's reminding me a little bit of what are those those redc cap trolls or redc cap fairies they replenish it with blood and they have to keep it wet with blood on their head it's reminded me a little of that so aside from the fact that he's a cucumber e and Summa wrestler that's so cool they're not real nice okay a no you want to consider this like a part Land part aquatic creature okay makes sense the whole Ninja Turtle look that makes sense so that's that's how it can survive out of the water because of that quote unquote plate of water on its head but like I said if it loses the water [ __ ] gets bad so we love that it likes cucumbers and Suma wrestling absolutely I need you to hold my beer for a second because there's one more piece to this little monster they're often accused of of assaulting humans in the water and removing a mythical organ now I got to see if I can pronounce this right which we know I'm going to butcher this okay so removing a mythical organ called the sherod dama Leila do you know what a shirama is is that where your soul is kept or something it is but do you know where your shirad dama is located probably don't want to know where in your butt it's in your anus it really is though it really is in your butt so basically they're trying to remove your soul out your ass from your butt that's like the short story while you're in the water yeah the short story is they're going to pull your soul out your [ __ ] while you're swimming and then try to Sumo wrestle you and then offer you a cucumber like where are you supposed to put the Cucumber I don't know if you put your cucumber in your anus so that they don't steal your soul I don't know is it to replace your Shar kadama oh my God I hope no one's listening to this at work let me go back to Britney you're my hero this week Britney is my hero for getting me on to this how do they get it out of your anus they pull it out like do they reach their whole hand up in there oh my goodness they're fisting oh no no they're going fisting for your soul no that's terrible could they at least like do it gently I don't know I don't know people know obviously you have to know if your sharama has been pulled out your ass because that sounds like something you would notice now I think we need to do a whole separate episode on whether this mythical organ is really there or not because now I'm scared I don't know if I want it in my butt why is it in my butt this is why I need I I desperately need for anybody in Tokyo or anywhere in Japan if you are a fan of shells in any way shape or form I need more info because my butt hurts just thinking about this thing oh my gosh so now remember I said that it was was mainly a legend and being seen Around The Saga region of Japan the reason that the legend is kind of spread throughout all of Japan is because they believe that parents used it as a way to deter children from going swimming unattended in the rivers because if the children went swimming unattended in the river then you're going to have to Sumo wrestle someone so they don't steal your soul out of your butt that would prevent me from swimming in a river yes that's they do think that other regions of Japan kind of sucked up this Legend to kind of words sh I mean there's better ways to get that soul out that's all I'm saying are they fisting are they sucking I need I need I need I need knowledge on this please if you're gonna be stealing someone Sher kadama do it with consent I mean it's much better that way I'm just saying even if you're gonna do it without consent could you find a different entry point no no that sounds even scarier like where are they gonna go through to get it then I don't know like I just I just got talked to Britney again for a second Britney I am too high for this this is so funny so what are people doing to prevent this anal Shir Kodama stealing they're staying out of the water and having some cucumbers handy because that's actually what they would say that's what that what part of the legend was was that if you were going to be in a watery environment by yourself have a cucumber handy because you know how like you know how if a dog is attacking you I'm not necessarily a dog person you know that but you know how if a dog is attacking you you can like throw a bone and they'll just go chase the bone distract them yeah right so you know if if the cop is coming you Chuck a cucumber and it's like a dog off into the distance okay all right I could see that but they're not entirely antagonistic to human beings they just want your ass we got kind kind of get a bit of of credit where credits do so are you saying they might take me out to dinner first before they try to reach up in my butt no they actually um will assist and befriend some of the Japanese farmers and they will perform some tasks for the humans such as helping Farmers irrigate their land and sometimes they leave fresh fish on the banks of the rivers what are the farmers doing in return for this that's what I want to know well yeah but they also have a history of being good at medicine so we've got like do Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle here part of the folklore with these things is that they actually taught humans um ancient Japanese folk that they taught humans the art of bone setting they also if they have befriend a human they will actually save that human from drowning as opposed to assisting and ripping your soul out of your [ __ ] so they don't want you to die they just want your butt oh none of these none of these stories and legends have anything to do they don't kill anybody they don't kill you they just want they just want your soul and they want a Sumo wrestle and they want a cucumber they want a cucumber I want to know what they're doing with a cucumber because this is just going crazy I don't want to know I don't but I'm not sure if I'm thrilled that I now know about the Kappa or if I really wish I had never heard this ever I want you to see this picture um I'm going to share my screen with you is he farting to defeat the Kappa is that what's going on in this picture that is one wrinkly old man butt I don't know or if he just shot a cucumber out of his ass I'm not sure I'm not sure sure this old wrinkly behind is bent over towards the Kappa is the Kappa holding his nose it's got to be a fart I think but I want you to read what the what the caption of the picture says defense against Kappa repelling with flatulence it is a fart apparently you can fart at them I fart at thee and and then they're gone like I don't know if that that keeps your soul intact like I don't know like there Britney what have you done to my brain I'm pretty sure it's impossible to fart underwater so if you're underwater and the C is going up in there to try and get your soul you might be kind of screwed or you better hope you have a cucumber down there I'll be honest with you like I don't mean to shame anybody but I'm pretty sure my one-year-old grandson has farted underwater I just want to put that out there I'm so proud he'll never have to worry about kaas you a you must be so proud my little boy yeah I I but but isn't this just like the craziest crazy I EST thing pretty wonderful actually but I I do I do want to just quick just share my screen with you one more time um and for all of our listeners please Google Kaa but see how it kind of looks like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle it does it does and it's got this weird Nest Bowl thing on its head that keeps water in it almost like um Larry curlyy and mo this Three Stooges he's got like a three stoes haircut and you can repel him with farting so yeah I see where that came from farting or sumo wrestling I don't know or cucumber I mean if you're a good sumo wrestler you can save your soul but if you don't got what it takes if he wins throw a cucumber get the butt treatment man he's going straight for the butt every time well I know some people that are going to go swimming in uh lakes and rivers a lot this year I know and and and what makes this even more hysterical is that it doesn't really really detour people from going in the water except children what they do is um just like you would with with any deity gods or goddesses what have you even the Fay they do the Japanese folk will leave offerings of cucumbers along the water because remember I said if you're their friend they will help you they will do good deeds blah blah blah they won't but rape you they won't butt rape you for your soul so they do leave offerings of cucumbers on the Riverbanks just to say we would leave offerings out for deity or or for the Fay you're laughing I I I can honestly say I have never left an offering with the express purpose of keeping my anal region intact and I'm I'm a little disappointed that I didn't know about this sooner and I still want to know I I think I do what's the aftermath of this like has someone ever had had this happen do you know do you feel it Britney suggested this Britney have you been to Japan have you have you had some the Copa treatment like what you still have your soul inquiring minds want to know we we need to know here I mean that makes me want to just go chill with the Jersey Devil butt raping me Lord making the puck WGY look kind of friendly man I'm gonna I'm gonna go have dinner with the puck after this might go catch a movie with Sasquatch Lord I'm surprised actually that the cppa has not made it to the United States because I'm pretty sure there's places he'd be very welcome I also think that he would find a lot of of nourishment here are you sure are you sure well so note to self I am never going in the water in Japan unless I have duct tape over the Chocolate Starfish well I'm certainly not putting a cucumber down my bikini bottom so I think I also am going to go the duct tape route if I ever wow and I've been wanting to I want to go to Japan I've hear about all these onsens you know the the hot water the [ __ ] out of the water man now I don't want to do it that's scary oh my this is probably the most hysterical crypted I have ever looked into ever like ever I I don't even have words for how I feel about the COA I'm really surprised that there is not like a 50 Shades of Gray fanfic about the COA already you know not a line to meet the ca cucumbers butt Souls you know water sports they're getting into all sorts of stuff here okay maybe not water sports but there that's you know that's pretty impressive I Japan you have outdone yourselves I love it this is awesome Japan has beat every single crypted that the whole of North America has and I I'm not even just saying the United States North America because that outdoes Sasquatch and chuper Cobra and your best defense is a fart I mean farting on it is how to get it to go away this means everybody's grandpa is safe basically I just wonder if they eat a lot of beans in Japan dying I love it I love it that's pretty awesome Crypton I I'm to the point now where I've laughed myself into stomach pains I'm so high I might eat another plate of spaghetti I I think it's a wrap I need to go recover from this like S&M crypted that you brought me I'm I feel a little violated here I need I need a few more bowls maybe a joint my lovely husband came in and we have two Gams of this delicious Plain Jane batter o look at
