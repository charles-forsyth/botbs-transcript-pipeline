tell truish Tales of paranormal events ghoulish crimes and Things That Go Bump in the night hi I'm Leila and welcome to a special stoned Witches Hour today we have a guest host and I'd like to introduce you all to a past guest that we've had one of our most popular guests and episodes of all time Lisa an from the YouTube channel EMP power with flower hi Lisa an hi everybody so today we're going to have Lisa an talk with us about what she's smoking and some of the spooky things that happen in Northern California why don't you tell us a little bit about your YouTube channel and what we can find on it I would love to first I'd kind of like to tell you what I'm gonna smoke right now I have a nice bong full of wedding tree have have you had wedding tree before I've had wedding cake I've had blue wedding I've had a couple different weddings I've never had wedding tree I'm intrigued so this is wedding tree it's a midlevel you know how I do ask mid high it's a midlevel sativa U it's kind of low for Shell but good for you and me it's about 26% oh very nice that's a good daytime smoke yeah it's it's good it gets me energized and creative and also it's it's nice relaxing in the body we do like that you and I both like that kind of daytime creative and yet also relaxing kind of focus smoke that's whereas Michelle likes the couch lock I'm out for the day done with everything She Wants to be completely medicated and and so that's not always what you want every single day um but that sounds delicious how does it taste it is it's I'm kind of on the shell side of that like like I'm not at at into tpin and I I've learned about it and I trained myself and the Entourage effect but man my you know my hun will tell you all about the taste but I'm just like give me the effects and that kind of leads to my my YouTube channel Empower with flower you know I started it because I was having so many great benefits and effects from smoking cannabis which I had always thought was bad and I was real wary about it and once I got the real information and informed myself I was having so many benefits I just felt really called with kind of empathetic calling to hey tell us tell put this out there and as many people that see it maybe they can find it too and that's what that's my whole thing behind Empower with flow is just come on guys come get these amazing benefits mentally and physically that's actually what I love about your channel and one of the things that Drew me to you when I I found you through a Reddit post and went to your channel and absolutely fell in love with you it just you're so happy about you're you're excited to share cannabis with people like me you like to get into some of the science behind it and and you really present that to people in a way that's understandable and fun and interesting and and I just love your channel for that it's visually beautiful and you just always give great information so definitely check out Empower with flower on YouTube check it out yeah I enjoy making them like I you know I kind of do two things I do how-to so just like you I you know on your scary stories I do some research and find what's poignant to me and and I like those howtos because they were things that I I couldn't find when I was trying to learn or I couldn't find one that I related to or I couldn't find one that wasn't so overs spoken with the personality or the promos or the things that you that you know and the media information was way in there right so I try to just jump right in and give the media information but I I do really love Leila waking up in the morning and having that creative feeling and hitting a bowl and then just talking about something in the high seses you know and it's and it's usually something I'm struggling with so I just made one on like um you know managing overwhelm I have one in the can that's about human Unity through cannabis oh I'm interested in that it's in the can I just I just really believe that cannabis is one of the keys to being authentic your authentic self it has been for me and I'm a human and I don't see other people doing it and so except people that are stoners or counterculture you know or or you even professionals that use cannabis you know they just seem more authentic and kind of happy and that's what it's done for me plus a million other things so I love the how-tos of cannabis and the research but I also love just sharing the mind that it's given me and the thoughts that it's opened up to me it's such a balance with those things and I think I kind of have found that with cannabis I can I can be the Earth mother goddess put my hands in the dirt grow this beautiful plant and and smoke it and have all these existential High thoughts but I can also smoke this plant and be realistic and down to earth and study the science and get my work done and do my research and do the things that I need to do and one of the things I love about it is that balance is you can you can find so many things within yourself that this plant can bring out of you and and it can help you find peace within yourself for all those different parts kind of help you feel more settled within yourself and maybe that's why we can connect better with other people because I think once we're more comfortable in our own skin and more comfortable in our own head and our own space then we're we're more able to accept other people into that space and to kind of bring that togetherness back around you know and and I think cannabis can really help us do that yeah I think it would bring empathy you know one of the things that I didn't have and you know people would point this out to me before you know in my life um you know and and that I just was kind of not empathetic and and couldn't really put myself in other people's shoes because my mind was all cut up you know about me me me and I man I've never felt so much empathy for everyone um since I just started really exploring that more elevated mind space because when you're high you don't think about the silly stuff that we waste our time thinking about true you know if you steer at the right way and you have the right intention you know you can really you know turn it psychedelic and really get rid of a lot of B I've gotten rid of so much baggage and everything so I just want to share share share it's an organic thing I get up in the morning and I go I feel like I want to share and I hit a bowl and just talk and I have gotten just one or two people already that have personally contacted me and said this really helped me make a decision or this is exactly what I needed to hear so I'm happy with those two people I'm good I'm going to keep just to know that I helped a stranger you know it's just it's just great so it's very fulfilling I you know shell and I have had a lot of fun with this for the a lot of the same reasons just the different people that we have reached and have reached out to us for all sorts of different reasons that's really nice and and you know it's really like you know I would want everyone to make these kind of videos because I'm just expressing myself in a way it's therapy for me I've done a lot of progress in my thoughts as I'm making the videos as I'm doing the high sesses so it's therapy for me and I think a lot of people yeah I would love it if a lot of people would feel more free to just go hey I'm Joe and here's all the things that are crowding my mind today I'm just putting it out there in case somebody you know here's what I figured out because it's kind of like just uh you know we're helping each other but I really think cannabis has to be integrated into the future of health and mental wellness and of course you know the other thing I want to do is dispel myths you know the myths I I see the myth Lea all the time and I'm sure you and shelle just get you know it's a whole podcast like you say but you know even now intelligent people are saying these things that you just shouldn't be saying anymore just like we call people the correct pronouns and we're you know every the whole world is getting on track with being more kind and more inclusive right and then you hear somebody say these myths about cannabis and it it can really get me angry so I have a list of of a video about those too because we just have to stop perpetuating it that is so true myths around cannabis for some reason seem to hang around do you have a top pet peeve myth you know what's your top myth that you really hate to hear the you know I probably my my biggest pet peeve is the addiction myth because um we do it every day like you know two bong minimum and then when we go on a trip and and we go where where we can't take it we can be gone for a week and we don't think about it but on the plane home I'll go oh tonight we get to hit a bong yeah but but there's no physical difference there's no mental difference maybe we're a little less groovy you know but but we don't think about it when we're away from it that is not addiction that is so so true I smoke quite a bit more than that I've smoked for a very long time since my since my late teens and and I am very much a heavy daily smoker we also travel quite a bit and there are different places that you go to where you cannot bring anything with you not a vape not an edible you really just shouldn't bring anything it's just safer that way and or for work you know there's times when we go to work conventions where it's just dumb I don't you know we're staying at a hotel paid for by work you that type of thing you know you just don't want to take the risk of going to a state where con Vengeance being held where it's not legal it it's just you just don't I mean two bongs for us is before breakfast so but you're also using it for analgesic you're using it for pain relief you're using it for for um like I am too for for things I used to take medication for correct right I used to take ADHD medication I used to take pain medication and I very much use it for that that's correct but we can be gone a week or more and the same thing the O the only side effect I possibly would notice is we do tend to spend more time unwinding in different ways we'll do yoga we'll meditate we'll go for hikes a little bit more than we would otherwise because smoking close to that yeah exactly because smoking is one of our ways of relaxing and coming down and so if you take that away you have to replace it with something else and so for us again if if we start to get a little cranky we're like oh well I need a bath or I need to go for a little walk or I need to you know we need to go play a video game or something we'll do something else that's healthy to take the place of that but for the most part we don't notice it and and again like you guys when we get home we're like yeah we get to hit a bong when we get home hell yeah or I have been known and I'm not going to say what airport but there have been more than one occasion where I have left a joint in the glove box of my car in the long-term parking just so that we'll have something for the ride home yeah that's perfect so it's not a addictive and and you and I are just two people and and we're just honest nice people right and we're just saying like if if tomorrow we couldn't do it we would be sad um but we wouldn't have withdrawal symptoms we would go on with our lives and we'd fine y you know the worst person I ever saw have what you might call even close to a withdrawal symptom is um my husband's father who he had Ms and one of his doctors told him under the table back in the day I really think you should try marijuana and and he didn't for a while and the MS progressed to the point where he was in a wheelchair he could barely walk he couldn't feed himself he needed help going to the bathroom and he started taking cannabis and he started smoking regularly and when I met him that man was one of the strongest men I knew zero problems we started growing together and those were some of the best memories I have is working on our at the time illegal Garden together to make sure he could have his medication because when he didn't when he wasn't able to get cannabis he would start to shake and he wouldn't be able to hold things and he would have trouble with words and this Titan of a man this strong gigantic pick up my kids on his shoulder run around the yard man would be reduced to someone trembling on a couch and it was Cannabis that kept him from that and and it just it blew my mind and so he would have not I guess it I guess it wasn't withdrawal symptoms but I guess it was more the MS coming out you know and and he would get cranky he would be a little bit cranky and more than likely because his symptoms were getting bad and that would make anybody upset so I guess that not even that is withdrawal symptoms but if anyone could be of said to have had them I I suppose maybe he could yeah not addictive no withdrawal symptoms and you know that really gets my like my heart rate is is going up and I can feel my heart beating because you know and weal we were talking about pet peeves and myths and things you know in what [ __ ] Universe do we have this plant that's been around for millions of years that is that can alleviate so much suffering and change people's chemistries to get rid of all that that greed and that and and and and it's it's not just growing everywhere like it makes me so angry Leila because he suffered more and now yeah and now PE you watch people are gonna start because the because the research and develop because the stuff's happening people are going to start faking making [ __ ] money off of profiting and and and and the same people who wouldn't let him happen are going to be making you know anyway that you know and that's not even the the medical Injustice of it doesn't even begin to touch the social injustice of it the people making money off of it now while other black and brown people are in jail over the exact same thing and it's completely ridiculous the the way that it has been structured and the the social injustice and the the racism the the money grubbing the medical fraud all of it is just it's historically very sad different podcast it is but if all if all the PE if everyone had been smoking cannabis from the beginning all that would not even be happening and I think that's a big part of why they didn't want anyone to smoke it was because people did feel that sense of connection and Collective sure yeah how farther Off the Grid you know we've always been kind of counter to culture but how how much farther hugely farther are we now from um you know capitalism or the norm since cannabis well hugely right we're weirdo freak people that live weirdly and it's like they don't want everyone doing that right because we we can live on very little we're we're you know very minimal and and you know zero waste and all that they don't want that no there's the tiny house movement the van life movement the Cannabis movement I want to leave this part of us on a on a positive note I feel it out there changing I I feel it with the legalization but also with just the fact that I can wear a weed um T-shirt or hat or whatever and you know everyone's smiling and kind of nodding at me you know before so you know I do feel it I do feel it just the fact that we are two women here middle-aged women we are not kids we are not teenagers we are not 20-some we are women who have had careers we have done all we've had children we've done all these things yeah and now we are having a podcast and now granted yours is I feel more informative I love that about your site you give a lot of information in a very personal way we need your entertainment we friendly right and I think exactly and so I we try to come at it from an accessible funny interesting way to show people that there are lots of different ways to look at cannabis and it doesn't have to be from that Stoner dude it's all types it's people from all different walks of life and it might even be the lady next door that looks like she bakes great cookies and grow roses in her backyard that's me by the way TI it's the perfect time I my retirement happened right you know soon after finding cannabis about a year and a half after that and then I could smoke every day I mean it's perfect you know and I kind of get mad that I wasn't allowed or didn't ever before this okay I didn't find Cannabis till till my mid-50s but uh you know the ladies if you're sitting at home retired and what like I'm telling you change your life just transform it all into Bliss and contentment with cannabis you just you know the Reddit board that you showed me the an wives board that we're both part of I adore those women shout out to ant wives everywhere I love that board I love seeing women show their true selves their colorful selves their happy joyous sad going through itself every part of being a human on this planet and they're putting it out there along inside their cannabis and it's helping them to connect with that and just the Beauty and the joy and The Sisterhood I love that ant wives was the you know when I went there I couldn't believe what I was looking at I go is this really a a Reddit subreddit of women smoking pot gloriously joyously and openly and and I just if I ever you know I have down days of course too we all do and and that is one place I will go is witches versus patriarchy and wives on Reddit it just really lifts my spirit and says hang in there girl you know because you know there's others out there like you fighting the good fight you know we are worshiping the same weed we're looking for the same Justice and I notice on there that I have it easy because a lot of people have obstacles in the way of getting their cannabis or using their cannabis or people who aren't accepting of their use um you know or people who can't get it at all um you know so when I go on there I I find My Tribe and then I feel really grateful to be a privileged member of the tribe because you know a lot of people have obstacles um you know that I don't have and that you and you and that you and I both don't have so I'm that's right right with the way the world is right now some days we need that Sisterhood that's the only thing that can just keep you going sometimes right now speaking of Sisterhood my stories today involve women of the night and now my personal feelings on strippers and prostitution I'm for it I think women should do whatever as long as it's of your own volition and that's what you want to do go for it why not with you yes yeah I have zero problems with that so I'm gonna put that out as a disclaimer right now and my H and I have been to strip clubs and we have children who tell us about their experience at strip clubs so we're very open in our family quite a few years ago maybe 10 years ago uh we were down in New Orleans for some big it conference was November so it was cooler and it was just beautiful weather down there and it's just a gorgeous Old City walking along Bourbon Street and it's again November so not a lot going on it was relatively quiet but there was everything was still open the bars the strip clubs and quite often there'd be people in the middle of the street kind of barkers I guess you might call them asking you to come in to the different establishments and one gentleman in particular kind of dressed up like a what you might consider like a voodoo zombie almost really really interesting character really fun guy convinced us to go to the strip club that he was advertising had been in byy Bean or anything before this invitation we were smoking quite a bit I mean there are people smoking cigars down the street so our pot smoke didn't really nobody really noticed and uh but we thought okay let's go see a strip show it was only it was early it was like 9 or 10 o'clock at night we go into this dimly lit bar it was just a door I wouldn't even have known it was a a club of any kind it was just a black door and a black wall and we go in through this little hallway and we come out into a bigger room and there's a bar in one corner just a small bar with a lady behind it and one guy sitting at at the bar and the rest of the room was empty it was a Runway with like a round stage and then a bunch of chairs all around it it was completely empty just us the bartender like am I supposed to strip right I'm like what's going on here yeah there's a stage this is kind of interesting like so we got a drink you we got a little picture of drinks we go sit right up by the stage and we had been told that this was kind of more of a burlesque show rather than so much of a strip just straight stripping and it was absolutely phenomenal there were three different acts the first girl came out and I don't remember what she was dressed as but they all had gorgeous costumes one of them was a witch that's all I remember but they all had these beautiful elaborate costumes and they danced again more burlesque show than strip club and it was just us sitting at the stage and so you know we threw our dollars and you know gave them compliments we had so much fun and the women were a lot of fun and um it was just a beautiful show and after the second act you know there was a little bit of time between each one and I had to pee I'd been drinking Mojitos and I had to get up and go to the bathroom so I get out and I go to the bathroom and as I come back I see a woman going into they have like a curtained off area in the back there's like a hallway with the bathrooms and like a curtained off thing that I assumed where the dancers went like a dressing room or or something like that but I saw a woman come from the hallway and basically all I saw of her was pink feathered headdress and like a pink boa I remember seeing feathers and sequins as she walked in through the curtains as I was walking out and uh one of the previous performers came over and was talking to us a little bit and I said oh I know the third girl coming at is going to be what is she a flamingo cuz she had all pink feathers and she looked at me all confused and she she's like no no one's in pink and I said yeah I saw her go into the dressing room she was wearing a pink boa and had like a a tall pink feathered hat and she just kind of stared at me and she said no and then the music started and the witch girl came out and did her act and I was very very confused and the previous performer went over and was talking to the bartender and after the witch burlesque show which was again a lot of fun all of them the bartender and the three girls descend on us after the witch had picked up all the money that we had thrown for her they go off and talk and come back and they say tell me again what you saw it sounds familiar to them maybe and I'm like this I'm a little freaked out because I don't like being a center of attention and it it was weird enough being the only patrons watching you know these strip teas acts because I felt like a lot of attention was on us rather than on the performers it was still fun but as an introvert it was a little much for me and so these women beautiful women descending on me and asking me and I was very confused and I said I came out of the bathroom and I saw a woman as she was going into the curtains and she had a a pink boa and like a pink tall headdress that's all I saw and I thought she was the next performer and they said no you saw the ghost and I'm like what and supposedly several patrons and a few of the people that have worked there have seen this woman usually in something pink and feathery and she's seen often going into the dressing rooms and apparently I saw this ghost have no idea what the bar was named I don't remember I could probably point it out if we went on Bourbon Street again again black door and a black wall should have to look for it it was a lot of fun and I the dances were so much fun we had such a good time and everyone was so nice and the burlesque shows were very sexy very beautiful very Sultry and entertaining and I saw a ghost in a pink boa wow so I have two questions I'm curious about things my my first question is is there a you know is there more of a a history of her like you know how sometimes I I've learned this just from your podcast that it can be someone who had an untimely death or was wronged there and my second question is are you more do you are you someone who's more who who's going to see these things more because of something about you actually excellent questions the first one I wish I knew the only thing that they told me was that this is something that other people had seen going back quite a few years and that none of them had seen her but they had talked to a patron before me that had and had heard of other girls who had seen her before but no one knew her history she was an urban myth in that building that's correct in that building she had been seen in times that people knew of her but no one knew why she was there if anyone had died and they at the time didn't have any speculation and I wasn't doing you know research or looking up stories at the time so I didn't know recently because I knew I was going to be talking about it I tried to find the bar or the place and and I couldn't find any mention of it online so I'd probably have to go back and see if I could find the patrons there and talk to them again and see if we could figure out what happened when you saw her what did it feel like and and again you know my same thing of do you have something about you that that the ghost that that you're going to have that experience more so than someone else at the time it didn't feel like anything at all I I legitimately thought she was the next performer she was dressed elaborately enough I just thought I had caught a glimpse of the third of the third woman who was going to come out and perform you know there was no cold spots no electricity or tingling and as far as ghosts go I have had a lot of experiences I did grow up in a haunted house but I wouldn't say that I'm particularly sensitive to ghosts I've read tarot cards since I was very young my grandmother taught me uh my grandmother who lived originally lived in that haunted house was very much into the Paranormal and she gave me my first deck of tarot cards when I was quite young and taught me how to read them so you've learned to be sensitive to it and to be open to it my personal opinion is that everyone is sensitive and open to it depending on how much you allow yourself as children children see ghosts much more often than adults do because they haven't been taught yet that those things those Supernatural things or those glimpses of the future that they see they haven't been taught that that's wrong or or fake and so they're much more open to the idea until someone repeatedly tells them no you can't know that your aunt is coming over to visit you know that's not possible embarass or shame them right of other people laugh at them yeah but we all are everyone has that ability and when I do tarot part is one of the things I I like to uh mention to people is is that have you ever felt someone stare at you or have you ever stared at someone to get them to turn around of course I've done both those things how does that work that's this that's our psychic ability that's everyone has that everyone has a has had the experience of feeling someone stare at them or staring at someone to get them to look at you we accept that as just a thing that we do yes wow you know that's that's so that's we all have psychic ability we all have the ability to see and to feel these things it's just a lot of times we're taught or shamed to kind of hide that and cannabis is another thing that can kind of come into play when people's inhibitions are down or they're more relaxed you know having a little bit of cannabis can help you be a little more open to that maybe allow those perceptions you know the doors of perception to kind of be open a little bit wider exactly and and it's not really about you know what's scientifically a fact it's about be Whimsical and play in your mind like you did when you were a kid let yourself have that because that'll transfer over into to your relationships and and your decisions and everything so don't be so you know black and white about it have fun with it and play around you'll really discover a lot about yourself exactly exactly I think that's one of the things that is so freeing about smoking cannabis is it does allow you to kind of let go of those barriers and be a little more childlike I guess a little more open to things than you would otherwise be and you know as someone else who tends to I get uptight I I have my lists I kind of get crazy about things and get running around and doing too much stuff and too much in my head it's it's nice to be able to sit down with a bowl and just kind of put all those things in their place refocused and and get right back into what I need to get done for the day and that's that's the key to my whole philosophy just the very briefly you when you're a kid everybody dictates your time and your thoughts and everything right but when you get older you have to be responsible for yourself everybody knows that our childhoods screw us up everyone knows that no one no one no one's immune no one gets out alive no one gets out alive so when you're a little older and and you know that it's everywhere um you see it in every everything you have to take the responsibility for yourself and say I'm going to carve out some downtime for myself and during that downtime I'm going to think for myself and talk to myself and journal and and what do I truly feel about these issues that everybody's talking about and why and if you add cannabis to that downtime you'll actually start cracking away this programmed mind and you won't be up in your head all the time you'll start looking at issues and people things more from a a heart mind kind of a thing and that's when you know cannabis does this it lets you be more minimalist and relax and not be so caught up and you know slow down and really enjoy every day this is why I adore you Lisa an you heart mind self-care all of that yes yes yes yes we nurturers those of the feminine persuasion we don't do self-care very often we're not good at it we we take care of other people we take care of everyone else and and for some of us nurturing our self takes practice and it takes intent and so being able to to smoke cannabis I I can't tell you how much I love to go in my garden with a joint and just listen to some great music smoke my pot and not have to worry about the dishes or the errands or my project deadline or any of that and just take some time for me and do the things that I love and it doesn't have to be gardening in a joint it could be it could be going for a walk it could be watching your favorite show it could be reading a book right playing video playing video games to relax you know oh gosh yes how much better would that be on cannabis playing some kind of a groovy video game come on be great oh it is I I do it on the regular and giving yourself permission to take that downtime for yourself you know have a bath with a joint it will change your life I guarantee women don't have time for self-care because we are judged On The Fringe of the bell curve for women where men are judged on the fat part of the bell curve so they don't have to try very hard right but the things we're told to achieve are things that we can't achieve and that's what we spend all our time and money on but when you start you know when you when you get out of that with cannabis then now you have time for downtime because I'm not you know my routine I have nothing on my schedule I don't do appointments and I used to do all that fancy lady stuff so it's it's a personal responsibility to make downtime for yourself I love that I'm over here nodding my head I'm just sitting here nodding my head the whole time you're talking I'm like yes Lisa an preach it the wedding tree talking it's not me I think I just challeng tree do you know what the do you know now obviously wedding cake is one of the parents because that that's usually how it goes where does the tree come in do you know what the other part of that uh Heritage is I want to say lemon tree off the top of my head but I don't know I'd have to I'd have to look it up oh so so like a nice sativa dominant yeah and it's hting right here like you know how you can feel it um uh it's just really uh really groovy you know and and uh it totally opens up my mind to all kinds of things when I'm on cannabis to ideas and I say words I didn't know I knew and it's just really mind expanding it's def it definitely doesn't kill your brain cells and make you stupid no no it does not the opposite of that now I know so many people that's again you know we were talking about myths a little bit earlier and that's one of those pervasive myths is that it it kills brain cells which is really weird to me because alcohol is the one that kills brain cells yeah let's not go on that but but cannabis cannabis actually gives you neurogenesis you're making new neural connections that you've never made before right new Pathways you're making new Pathways but you know don't get me started it's in my videos this is one thing I want to do I want somebody to start a website and say Hey or a Reddit and say hey list here something bad that happens because of cannabis you know and and if I put alcohol in there oh my gosh that you'd have everyone of the world has a bad negative alcohol story everyone in the world has a bad negative you know uh cocaine story or or whatever right but where is the bad the harm done to others or self from Cannabis you're exactly right and why the f is it on schedule one you know you get really angry about it right but we again that this is how I calm myself down I go I'm doing the good thing of personal responsibility of think thinking with my own mind through cannabis and living my truth and and then of course you feel empathetic and you feel called to share it but even every one person that decides to do that makes a big difference I agree I absolutely agree and the more we can get the word out the the the more people will be able to fight these stereotypes because if you see so many of us so many of us have hidden it for so long because because of work because of relationships family whatever now we're coming out of the shadows and able to see more than just that stone or stereotype and I I think the more of us that have YouTube channels or have podcasts or or or just you know when you go to your doctor say yes I smoke cannabis and be be safe to do so I think I think that's going to really help people a lot because it it is such a great plant for people and

I'm so it takes a lot for for me to get hit too and if I take a if I have a light day I can go back to getting hit but I'm the same way being a small person but really having a high tolerance for cannabis you know Lisa an you bring up a very good point there in the fact that everyone is different just because this this bako gelato hits me super hard and hits me in the face and right up in my head it'll hit someone else differently you know it might give them a different experience or a different effect for the most part the Turin are going to determine the taste and the and the effects but every person is still different your it's your mindset that's true too very much so it's your intention too if if you're down in the dumps and and you're just hating yourself and you go hit you

candles you know sit in your favorite room like you put on your favorite music change things a little bit and see if that changes the effect for you because it really can make a big difference all right so let's see if we can get into a little bit of stories I told you one of my personal ghost stories you said you had a personal story as well something that happened something super spooky that happened to you yes it's it's not a very long story but let me tell you Leila and this is the scariest thing that's ever happened to me and even through all these years it it still really scares me so here's what happened I'm a a at home by myself I'm an adult I think I'm in my 30s and I had been having and and by the way shout out to anybody who's a psychologist or you're studying psychology or Psychiatry I want somebody to write to me and say this is why this happened to you this is what was going on in your mind right or whatever their opinion is because I would really if someone can listen and afterwards have an explanation please I think it would help a lot of people because we have memories that scare us for so long right so I'm at home I'm by myself I'm in my apartment and I had been working on helping a child kind of find their place in the world okay and so I was doing some reading and and this is an exceptional um child very you know different not the norm exceptional amazing and I I wasn't equipped to help this amazing child but I wanted to try to be and so I went to the library and I was reading books to help and one one of the books I happen to get and my child is not a genius or a savant but I got a book about ancient Savant children so think about like the 1600s 1700s there's this child who comes out of the mother's womb and he's speaking German those kind of stories and those are good creepy stories on their own just what these children would come out and speaking great truths right when they were when they were infants or one years old it's creepy but there's this all this documentation for it so I was reading about these Savant children and I was had this book in my lap and I had a movie on Leila called Phenomenon with John Travolta Robert Duval Kira Sedwick Forest Whitaker other people are in it can't remember everybody I've seen that movie seen that movie right and it's just a you know a bee movie I watched it because John Travolta was in it and he's from you know he's one of the idols from my era and in the movie he gets you know knocked over by something and when he wakes up he's a genius and he knows everything and he can play chess and he can make his plants grow and he can give everybody suggestions on what they should do to get the most out of their crops because he's in this like farmer town and he can he knows math and and calculus and and and part of the movie is him helping a boy because he learns Portuguese on the way to where the boy is hurt so he can communicate with him you know they get him a Portuguese book and he learns it you know so my scary story revolves around this so picture this you're at home you're reading a book there's a movie on the television it's plain as I'm reading the book sitting on the couch because when I'm home alone I want more sound so I'm in the book and I'm reading and I start to read a sentence and as I'm reading the sentence Robert Duval on the screen has a book in his hand and he reads the exact same sentence out loud that I am reading in my head on the page no [ __ ] I threw that book so hard across the room like I'm getting creeped out right now I'm creeped out oh my goodness okay so I'm I'm creeped out I'm home alone my heart rate's going like it is now I'm I'm I'm really really creeped out and I just kind of sit there and then I don't know how long I sat there but a child came home through the door and I didn't reiterate it to the child because I was really freaked out and I'm the mom and I'm not you're not supposed to freak out your children right and I just felt altered for days for for I I'm not g to lie here when I think about it I I feel altered now so this is almost 30 years ago it's like a glitch in The Matrix type event I told so many people you know after a glass of wine i' go hey do you guys want to hear this story and I would tell it and and I would have this reaction and the rea and the reaction that that you're having so here's what I want to talk to the psychologists and psychiatrists and and home uh psychologists that have no training because some of you are probably smarter than the ones with training but just last month I reiterated this story to my hun and he goes let's let let watch the movie so we put this phenomenon movie in I I told him the story and he goes well let's watch the movie again he'd never seen the movie it's a 990s movie so Leila I watched the movie from beginning to end waiting for the thing and he only reads out loud once in the movie and it's not anything to do with child Sant or what I was reading what and there's absolutely no way that the experience was real because in the unless they clipped this out you know but it it never happens so what so for over 25 years I've reiterated this story with full truth it it's still affects me now it happened that is so I believe you I believe it happened what in the world and what I'm saying is now I know I'm I'm a you know I'm a I'm a science person um I so now I understand that it did not happen I can accept that and I know and I've I I actually have studied and taking classes on sociology and I I remember hearing about a little girl who suffered her whole life because she saw her mother drowned and then one day she's an older adult and the aunt goes you weren't even there you didn't see it and so it goes along with that kind of phenomenon but it's it's so real that it happened and it's the scariest thing that's ever happened to me it also sounds a little to me like the Mandela effect and Quantum reality the Mandela effect is is when a group of people remember something that never happened and one of the most common things that people talk about is the baron Steen versus the baron stain Bears um how the that name is spelled I am one of the people there's a whole group of us that remember the name of the barenstein Bears being spelled with an extra I and apparently it never was there's also a movie that quite a few people remember being made I believe it was um so back in the 80s there's a lot of people that believes there was a movie that was made called Shazam and it starred um gosh that sounds familiar to me yeah so there's a bunch of people that think that there was a movie that happened in the80s starring do you remember the comedian Sinbad he was in a lot of movies in the 90s there's a lot of people that think that he was in a movie where he played a genie and the movie was called Shazam and people will insist that they saw this movie when they were a kid the only problem is that movie never existed and and it's not just one person it's it's a whole bunch of gen xers if you ask them if it's Baron Stein or Baron stein bears or if the movie Shazam existed you can get people into arguments over whether it happened or not because this this false memory is so pervasive um and and it's it's interesting there's a whole bunch of them if you look up Mandela effect you can find a whole a bunch of interesting things that people are pretty darn sure happened that never really did wow and it makes you think you know mine was a scary thing but what about someone who who's actually having PTSD from something that just wasn't explained to them or they weren't taught how to healthfully process the emotion and so they've made it worse and and and and gosh if somebody would just come along with a video and say no no it was just this that they would have so much relief right can can do that for you I you know another another podcast I'm so sorry but you know deep deep deep seated baggage that that is awful you can eliminate and I've done it with cannabis for me one of the things I really love was when I was studying hypnosis um being able to meditate or or go to a hypnotherapist and particularly with cannabis I I absolutely love cannabis and hypnotherapy as something to really help people get in touch with you know your inner child you know obviously not to replace counselors and therapy and doctors definitely have their place but I would love if they would consider cannabis and alternative therapies as part of the Arsenal to help people with with everything that's going on you know in their life absolutely and just something legal like HC which which I said you know my research shows gets you about a third as high some says half as high but imagine if you could have a couple puffs on an hhc before you before your therapist started in because we know you know the first 15 minutes you're paying your good dollar for is just getting settled in and getting rid of your day I mean if you puff in the in the reception area I mean please yeah break down those barriers before you even get in and start getting charged for your hour your growth in therapy would be exponential because you're that place they have to spend time getting you to you walk in the door ready to share and be right there ready to say everything all right so let's see here I do want to get into I have a story today I wanted to talk to you about a haunted brothel oh that sounds amazing I'm going to switch my bowl out from wedding tree I have a prepacked uh Bowl here of Durban Poison oh yummy that's another good one I smoked that when I first moved out here to California that was one of the first cultivars that I smoked here was Durban Poison yummy stuff I learned it from you I said I got to get that and I tried it and now it's one of our go-tos so thank you for that so it's so Menthol and yummy it is yummy I I and I do like I do like things that are yummy I like them to have a great taste think I said yeah shell wants to go straight for that 32 plus THC and and I want a little more of a flavor give me F now you helped her out because of the Lesser then when she hits the garlic cookies or whatever you know the 35 you know crazy stuff that her and I like uh that Everyone likes um she's gonna feel it more and I I think I heard her say that on air you know thank you this is helping me yeah she's getting save her money too oh I think so too she's definitely getting a little more sophisticated in in picking different cultivars for different time times of day and different things that she would like to do rather than going straight for that heavy hitting you know make everything better really fast you know cultivar so she's she's doing really good and I definitely think she's enjoying it so we're going to um swing over and to but Montana and we're going to talk about some ladies of the night over there and we'll see if I can get you creeped out with a little story of of well I guess it's a little sad too maybe more than creepy but you know I definit I'm going to take this whole bowl of Durban Poison and listen because I know I'm going to be sad and scared there you go all right so while you enjoy that I want you to picture but Montana in the 1870s the height of the mining era during that time in Colorado and in Montana copper was one of the big metals that they found up there and in but they had it in Spades there was so much so they're mining copper and other lucrative Metals around the clock and these little towns would spring up everywhere that a mine would come and they would start with tents and little shanties and as the money started coming in from these mines the towns would grow bigger and actual proper buildings would come in and that's where a lot of these towns originated was a they'd start out as mining towns really rough places and but had a reputation they were notorious for the amount of gambling drinking prostitution and fighting that happened there and of course for all the money that happened so everybody came miners came people looking for a quick Buck people looking to make money off of minors everybody and as you know whenever a group of men particularly back in the day in the west gathered women would also come to ply their trade and these women started out when it was just a tent city and they would go up and down the tents and became known as the ladies of the line as they would walk up and down the lines of tents offering their services to the miners now in the beginning they didn't really have a place to go and the town was super Rough and Tumble and as the money came in and more and more respectable people came in now the speculators and the people looking to make money came and these two brothers uh French Canadian brothers Joseph and Arthur NATO I hope I'm saying their last name right NATO um in 1888 they purchased a plot of land on like the main street in the what was at the time a red light district along what was called Mercury Street and they built the the city's first two-story brick building and interestingly enough I've seen a lot of people refer to the style of this building as Victorian brothel or American Bordello style and now I don't know architecture a secret way like if it has this kind of molding on the front yes go in there I guess so and I'm pretty sure it's the way right I think it's the way the windows were but I looked up architectural Styles and I couldn't really find any reference to American Bordello or Victorian brothel so I think those were made up by various websites I don't know but what they're referring to is um when you think of victoriia you think ornate and this is not it's a relatively flat brickfront building and it's two stories and on either side of the center door are these very long tall floor to ceiling Windows two and two on either side and then again up on the second floor two and two windows and they were big and tall like that so that the women could stand in them all scantily clad in their little outfits and exactly advertise their wees and be there so that as people are walking down the street they see these eight huge well-lit windows with gorgeous women in each window so basically advertising what's going on inside so I guess Victorian what window dressing exactly so I guess Victorian brothel just means big windows so you can see the ladies I don't know but so they built it like this and they called it a hotel and they put in the name of Joseph's wife deia Dumis so they called it the Dumis Hotel it definitely was not a hotel it was designed to attract miners to the very wealthy and so they had different levels depending on what type of woman you could afford when you went in the front door if you went directly into the building you went into a large parlor that had a lot of rooms off of it that could be either open to one great room or closed off into smaller rooms around the Parlor and that was where your average priced woman would be and you'd go into the Parlor and kind of pick out which woman you wanted and go off and close the doors or if you were one of the wealthier patrons you might be frequenting the women who were upstairs if you look upstairs from The Parlor it's all open to the second floor and it's like an open balcony the rooms on the second floor go to a balcony that kind of look down to the first floor and upstairs would be the woman women hanging over the balcony looking down into the Parlor and they would be better dressed they're more expensive a little more spend a little more and come up here spend a little more come up to the second floor you know you have that's where you get a little bit more action the club they're like come on for another 40 bucks I can give you 10 more minuts come back to the Champaign room little extra cash and you could go to the second floor and they had rooms and Suites up there and that's also where the Madam had and the first Madam was Joseph's wife deia Madam dilia and she had her quarters upstairs as well now also when you first look at the building instead of going in the front door there's a basement door and you could go down to the basement where the very small very inexpensive rooms were you can see pictures of the the hotel online and these literally look like a dungeon the stone walls or brick very plain only big enough for a small twin bed and maybe a stand with like a water basin next to it but very very small and they were called cribs and that's kind of where the the term crib for place where you live comes from cuz they were really little just a little place to sleep or well in this case not sleep but that's where the a lot of the miners would go was to these rooms down in the basement the hotel had 42 or 43 depending on who you ask rooms and they were filled all the time the mines were an Around the Clock business 24 hours three shifts and so someone was always getting off work and wanting to go have a drink or have a girl and and have a good time and they made a ton of money this whole red light district was packed wall toall with women and gambling and any Vice you could ask for was there wow of course of course of course now behind the Dumis they did so much work that they built an extra an Annex with eight more rooms on it so that they could serve even more customers Keepers came to town that's right and this whole Alleyway was called Venus alley because it had all the beautiful women kind of picture like Amsterdam you know that very closed in with all the W the the windows with the women in it like right next to you just down this entire alley called Venus alley and the whole town is just full of alcohol drugs prostitution people shooting each other the place is just Rife with riches and misery depending on who you were and the women that were here most of them didn't have a good life the the NATO Brothers grabbed various girls from different brothel they went to different dance halls and they kind of poached these girls from different places and most of them had either been prostitutes their entire life or were born into it or didn't just didn't have any other choice and in the beginning they would charge 50 cents to a dollar depending on what you wanted and which level of woman you were able to afford and the women themselves were only able to keep a small fraction of that money and very often had to pay to be there pay for their food and so there was no Escape for these women prostitution today in some areas is legal and those women have a choice they're making good money they can do it they can leave they can do what they want to do these women didn't have that choice yeah and what what you're describing Leila sounds so you I know this was a long time ago but it sounds so similar to the way they portray it sometimes even now in in you know in media so it doesn't sound that much different I thought wow this sounds like a modern setup I saw in a movie you know so it's crazy that it's been around so long now interesting that you say that Lisa Anne because this is the longest running brothel in the United States it didn't close until 1985 wow so it ran from 1890 until 1985 the the NATO brothers sold uh the early 50s the brothers sold it to a woman named Elanor not and she became the next Madam of of the Dumas Hotel this is the original tragedy because the the working women back in the time A lot of times they were young teenagers they were just young girls and the conditions were bad they had drug use was rampant amongst them if they got pregnant it was practically a death sentence whether they wanted to keep the child or whether they tried to have an abortion that the life for the child if they did have it and they did survive the pregnancy sometimes that child was sold into prostitution and and so the the misery within those walls is on the outside it looked like a fun time but you know ins inside the walls where these women were working it it was pretty much a horror story and it got a little better I think it sounds like at least um when Elanor not became the owner she's said to have been a fair Madam if such a thing could have existed back in the early 50s the I guess in the 40s prostitution kind of became illegal then I didn't realize it had been at least tolerated until World War II and they thought that um they thought that the service men were going to get too many diseases and so they started cracking down on on prostitution and whouses and and so the Dumas brothel kind of went underground but it stayed a brothel they just pretended they were a boarding house at that point what did they always try to take away our pleasurable things rock roll at that time in the 40s the price at that time was $2 wow and if you paid $5 you could get one of the girls in the upper floors and have a really good time when Elanor in the 50s took over the price was $5 but Elanor had tragedy of her own her husband died young and she fell fell in love with a married man and supposedly he was going to come pick her up and she had her bags packed and was ready to go and when he didn't show up she overdosed on pills and alcohol and committed suicide there's a couple different versions to the story now this hotel has been covered by several different paranormal investigators and I've heard a few different things about what may have happened to Ellen or not one I heard that her lover actually did come for her and died in a motor cycle crash on the way there the other rumor that I've heard that I'm unable to corroborate is that her death wasn't suicide but was a heart attack so depending on what story regardless she died in the basement of the house whether it was suicide over a broken heart or whether it was a heart attack I I wasn't able to find but her ghost is said to roam the Halls carrying her packed bags and quite a few people even in the 0s the women that worked there would see her walking with her packed bags going down into the basement W so after she passed away it changed hands several times and then the last Madam of the house preferred to be called a land lady and her name I just know her as land lady Ruby ran the Dumas from 1971 to 1982 and she'd had a reputation as quite the Helen prior to becoming the Madam of the Dumas in 1959 she walked into a bar where her husband was gambling at a table calmly walked over to that [ __ ] and shot him five times point blank killing him despite the fact that a whole bar full of people saw her do this no one knew who it was she had been beaten so badly by by her common law husband that she was unrecognizable her face was so bruised and so swollen not one person in that bar could identify who had shot him wow he had apparently been abusing her for years and she finally had enough and decided to end it the courts kind of had sympathy for her too she was convicted of manslaughter and was sentenced to four years in jail she only served 9 months when was this was in 1959 59 okay she did that in 1959 and then in 1971 she took over the Dumis and she was apparently a very fair Madam and took very good care of all the women that worked there and made sure that they were treated fairly wanted everyone to be taken care of and would not tolerate anyone to abuse any of the women in her care and at that time in the 80s when it closed do you want to guess how much you could get laid for at the doomis in the 80s uh $35 oh very close Lisa an what don't we know about you it was $20 $20 so you would have been going to the Upper Floor Lisa an no no cheap girls for you you're you the top sh of money that's all that shows you just want the top shelf that's all don't blame you don't blame you but um so yeah it was $20 when they closed in 1982 and it closed mostly because of uh tax evasion apparently no taxes had been paid in years and so that was the end of the longest running brothel but since then people have tried to restore it it was so um Madam Ruby or land lady Ruby sold it to a gentleman on condition that it be uh repaired and restored to its original state because these rooms A lot of them are still in the exact original state that they were in when it stopped working and also Ruby and the the first owner after it was a brothel opened up some boarded rooms in the basement and found all those cribs that had been boarded for a few decades since the early 40s and 50s and they hadn't been touched you can still see the we marks in the floor there's still cigarettes with lipstick on them sitting by the window that looks out into the alleyway and you can the hotel they've tried to turn it into a museum and they have old sex AIDS they have old dildos they have antique things that people would use to kind of get their groove on back in the day maybe some whips and some corsets and I didn't see any whips I did see corsets and and all sorts of different types of lingerie and that type of thing but in the basement um where the one Madam had committed suicide there's a lot of activity there and there have been so many paranormal investigations there have been a few shows because the activity is from top to bottom and you can imagine just with the tragedy and the sorrow that this building has seen people go in there and immediately in some of the rooms feel a sense of dread they there's pictures of orbs there's a dark shadow in the basement that makes people sick if you see it and there's a one investigation I saw a video of where two of the people actually got physically ill after being in the basement and encountering you know they'll walk through and there'll be a substance on the floor that hadn't been there before there's a a few different ghosts of particular people like I said they see Eleanor who walks through and with her bags and she's easily recognized there's a few other entities one of them is called Sarah and she is a woman was probably a prostitute in the basement in those smaller cribs in the on the basement floor back was murdered she might have been one of The Cribs apparently when they opened up that sealed off section were able to open these rooms that hadn't been opened in decades one of them the door itself you could tell had been broken in and the door jam was broken and and it was all someone had repaired enough so you could shut the door but you could see the door had been forced in and you could see the kick marks on the door and inside the room was a bloody handprint on the wall oh my gosh there's things happening there's been some people taken too soon or abruptly or violently down there exactly and it said that there was a a makeshift Hospital down there to treat all the different diseases and things that happened to the women and usually by someone who didn't know what they were doing there have been a lot of EVP recordings here um with people saying what are you doing here what do you want different women's voices in the air there's quite a few entities that have been caught one a male who's very malevolent and people aren't sure if he was an owner or if he was possibly one of the men who would come in um but he touches people and and leaves marks a few of the owners have done paranormal tours with people and they'll come out with scratches unexplained scratches on their back oh my God the entities here are not happy they have it open you can do tours as a museum and I believe you can also go there and do paranorm investigations and it's just interesting to me that how many people see the Shadows of the women walking from room to room or they'll see the the dark man in the basement and different psychics have gone there and have had a lot of the same experiences where they'll see the one Madam Elanor going through and have been able to name her even without knowing the history or the story oh wow so it's kind of interesting just being able to look through the pictures honestly when you look at the pictures it looks like someone's really cheesy 80s version of what a prostitute's bedroom might look like you know throw up some cheap paneling a lot of of red cheap red Sil oh no Madonna wouldn't even be this tacky but you know and of course it's got the sink in the corner so you can wash up afterwards so there's no doubt what these rooms are so all these rooms have Windows next to the door so the girls in the room would stand in the window like you're in a little barie box exactly exactly they put these women in these little in these little Windows to you know try and entice customers and there's no doubt what these rooms were used for it's a bed a sink and a window so you can look in it's pretty obvious but they the manifestations that go through there again one of them I guess one of the nicer ones is either Sarah or Sandra and people will hear her talk and sometimes they'll feel caresses on their face or on their shoulder from her if you go on the tour there's you'll see a refrigerator it's just a small oldtime refrigerator but it was built with a false back and one of the prostitutes that was there um was very famous and very popular they I guess they had stolen her from some other house of ill repute and when the the brothel would get raided she was little enough that she would fit into this special secret compartment in the back of this refrigerator and that's where she would hide so that they couldn't find her when the raids would happen and they'll show you the secret compartment in the refrigerator where she kind of like that that's kind of groovy actually I like that and the there's other secrets to this building as well down in the basement where the smaller cribs were there's also holes that are Remnant from the tunnels again if there was a raid going to happen the girls could jump down these little holes and go through the tunnels that were underneath Venus Avenue that went to various other buildings and bars in the city one of them was rumored to even go to City Hall oh well that would surprise us at all would it not at all so people prominent people love them all yeah the you know all the the Upper Crust people who would never do any of these things could walk the secret tunnel over to their favorite brothel in the red light district but the ghosts of those women and some of the men are still there and you know I've seen a bunch of videos on YouTube i' I've read some people's firsthand accounts of going there and everyone sees the orbs and the figures and hears voices it just seems the place has from top to bottom wow what what's what was the city again it's in but Montana but Montana oh W I believe it's on Mercury Avenue and it's it's called the Dumis hotel or the Dumis brothel it's open on and off it is in a state of disrepair it it looks terrible I'm a little sad about the whole thing because it it's changed hands a few times since the 80s and I believe the current owners just like the owners before them are trying to restore it and turn it into a museum BNB paranormal investigation kind of place and I wish them the best but the the building is crumbling it needs they need they need someone who hears you today to be a donor that's right because you know I mean there's possibilities that some of these Spirits can find their peace you know somehow if we get some attention on them too so but that would be great to have it restored back to how it used to be and yeah just the history of the building the fact that it's the longest running brothel in the US that it it has all these things that have been there the the rooms and the beds and the dildos that have been there since day one it all started from miners needing to get off yeah everybody everybody needs a little you know if you're working a job like that you need a little downtime man who doesn't need to relax all day you you know you gota and I don't know they were saving all the hemp to write the Constitution or something back then but I don't know if they had access to cannabis I have I would be very curious to see what if cannabis was in the wild west or in back when people were doing these in these mining towns you know like the Gold Rush here or in Colorado in Montana you hear about alcohol was anybody smoking pot I don't know I'm curious that's a really good question and and it's also a beautiful transition into my story if you want to go there I do want to go there yes yours your story was about my miners in in Montana and beautiful transition and you said well you know did they have weed back in the in the mining camps or the logging camps you know well my story just comes down and West a little bit to to Northern California and uh my story I'm GNA call it uh stoned Sasquatch murder whoa I am really intrigued now I'm I'm I just made that up and it's just I want to say that it's just a tiny Sasquatch slice because I'm leaving that whole territory to you to do justice but this is just one story where stone stone being a stoner and a Sasquatch happened at the same time I love this I am so intrigued and we do since we're the West Coast since we're the West Coast witches we can talk about Sasquatches so you go right ahead I love that we have that Sasquatch territory the one here so don't tell me about a sasquatching on the East Coast I don't want to hear about it all right so Stone Sasquatch murders I am super intrigued I I got my blue dream packed I'm sitting down I am comfortable and ready to go hit me what do we got if I scare myself I might need some more dering poison so I have always had a thing for Bigfoot um you know I was a young girl in the 70s and I remember going to the the library and getting all the Sasquatch books that I was able to understand at age like 9 101 and the pictures and the things that I did see reminded me of the place I went every summer for Camp so I would go for like a week some when I got older I'd go two weeks three weeks San Bernardino Mountains and it just oh gosh how nice was that it was really nice yeah I I kind of grew up there and and uh in the Summers and and so I would read the sasquash books and I felt like he he was my friend and when I was at Camp sometimes I would you know see him little girl right and I such a witch you are such a witch I I would just smile and go well he would be friendly to me but I can't go play with him right now because you know everyone would you know think that was weird but I had a I had kind of a crush on Sasquatch I knew that he would be protective of me and fun and and would be nice and if he's ever been mean to anyone well it was their fault they provoked him or whatever so I had this kind of young girl Sasquatch Lisa an you witchy thing you is that a witchy sign whether Sasquatch or the spirit of the wood you connected with that male Forest energy you were feeling that God of the wood the Green Man konos the the Lord of of the horned god of the wood running through the forest and however that presented to you whether through Sasquatch it was that it was that wild energy that wild man Forest God energy that you kind of connected with there and had had a special feeling with and I think that's kind of that energy was calling to you as a child and and I love that you witchy thing well and what you just said makes makes um gosh I'm such a I'm such an emotional girl it it makes really it hits really home and it makes sense to me because at that time in my life I would have been looking for this friendly male who was protective right right makes that's real I'll think about that later I'm gonna I'm gonna file that back I I have chills I love that he was there for you he knew that that's the side of him that you needed and and that that God of the wood came to you in that protector Forest guys I love that right and and at that time it wasn't Sasquatch was you know I think there's popular cartoons um um Harry and the Henderson or something you know it wasn't that this was back in the 70s where there was sightings and and up in the Redwoods up here in Northern California and and um so my story goes to weed because so up in those forests up there um is the Emerald Triangle uh which is where my weed is grown the the we the Cannabis I get from Flower company that's where it's grown so best wheed in the world y so Sasquatch is a childhood thing and now cannabis is my kind of grown-up childhood thing and they're coming together in this story there was um a young kid in 1993 who was working for a grower just you know people would come and just go hey you know they probably weren't making much money but they just wanted to get away young kids you know story is oldest time go to the nearest hippie Town go to the place that Fred said about where he made some money and he didn't have to work for the man or whatever right so they gravitate up there and he's there and this this story is kind of on the internet this part of it so people will know about it but he's there and as he's there as a worker somebody runs in and says really frantically and says oh my gosh that three of the men that that were guarding the the plants you know was a cannabis farm you know they've been murdered by Bigfoot what I saw it big I saw these three murdered by Bigfoot and and the journal this man who's telling the story later who's the journalist on David Hol house um he says at that age at 23 it scared the [ __ ] out of him because he knew about Bigfoot in this area and Sasquatch and and he had been there just a short while but had already been warned you know don't go out on your own be careful there's been sightings there was all these these cement casts that people had made of these giant 17in by 7 inch flat-footed prints that they would find I thought big I was going to find Bigfoot kind of like quicksand around any Corner in the woods why were we why were we into quicksand and so Afra quicksand back and Bigfoot too I remember there was constantly plaster casts of feet and sightings and people I was absolutely sure Bigfoot Sasquatch was going to be around the next tree at any second so sorry to interrupt but it was it was everywhere then but that just means it was in the I mean I was in LA county at that time so where what county you I was in New York I was in Ontario County New York New York State this was in the ethos it was out there in the colle Consciousness this this I knew that the Redwoods were a hot bed of Sasquatch activity when I was a kid it was common knowledge everybody knew Sasquatch redwoods they're all up there well I remember my parents doing the you know station wagon California Brady Bunch road trip and we we drove through that tree there's a redwood you can and I was looking for bigfoot everywhere I knew I would see my friend you know and and and I probably you know I don't remember but I probably saw him a couple of times you know and kind of winked at him I don't know I was very Whimsical but but anyway so so this this David kid he's 23 years old 1993 is there just relaxing surely smoking pot but actually sees the encounter where the other worker comes in and says these three men their bodies have been torn apart they've been murdered the the crop is ruined there's blood everywhere um oh wow and just freak totally terrified like yeah the man was terrified you know he was a young kid so the grower and the terrified worker you know and they go out and they talk and he's just sitting there trying he's a young kid he's just trying to take in what he saw he's probably high right so Bigfoot definitely killed these men this was the report at the time no plants taken just destroyed and that's why they knew it wasn't um uh because there was a lot of crime up there as far as other black market Growers which is what these people were you know competition and right right if it was competition they would have taken it yeah and it was a theft yeah it would be $150,000 I think they said if somebody had taken this that was back in the 70s that's a lot yeah and and so so that they knew it wasn't that so this is his his memory um and this is a a journalist his his name is David HH housee again that that has been reporting on monsters and and that came from his childhood abuse that's his story it's very poignant you have to listen to it so he he gets drawn in his journalism to monsters well he remember he actually experienced hearing that Bigfoot killed these three men and it was announced right in front of him and it always freaked him out really scared him stayed with him his whole life and now it's 20121 and he's done uh come back to to say hey I'm gonna go investigate what I heard when I was 23 years old very cool a long time later so here here's the story um and firstly I want to say if you haven't been to that area if you and they he he's the one I learned this from and I've seen this too if you get at an airplane or a helicopter and you take off from like you know Sacramento and you fly to Alaska you're gonna see for hours and hours thousands and thousands and thousands of miles of forest so oh yeah this is stuff that is so dense and so old it's it's got the oldest trees on the planet you know these trees can be up to 2,000 years old this is dense old archaic land where you could easily disappear and no one would ever find you um it's just so people don't understand well if there's a bunch of Sasquatch there how come you don't understand go fly over it go on Google Earth whatever it's just vast you can't even conceive how vast and and dense and Tall um the trees are so tall that if you you were in there you'd have no sunlight in the middle of the day so this is dense dense dense it's foggy it's rainy um it's um you know that's where the Emerald Triangle is and what happens there well plants grow really nicely um there's a lot of things that they don't have to to deal with there and you would know more about that being a cultiv our but a bunch of sasquat could easily hide and I think they're there but in the 1800s the Gold Rush came and this goes into to kind of the era that you were talking about and they came in and and we know it's horrible um that's another podcast you know but the indigenous people were plundered the these Gold Rush people um he he actually says this in his thing he goes they weren't the brightest Bunch they were the kind of people that would come for quick getrich quick things right these these weren't people with an established education and career W sending their best they were able to just leave wherever they were and go disappear and search for gold and and so he said they they it's very obvious and documented that they butcher they butchered women children old that's Terri and I'm just setting the foundation for like this land is is is a war zone you know already it was because of uh the founding of America but then this is now a gold rush you know there's something on this land we want we're going to kill everything that was there before and people are more than willing to commit atrocities in the name of the almighty dollar it's happening as we speak and so so this land's already blood soaked several several times and then in 1849 the mining camp camps came so the Gold Rush was was there and then these mining camps came and people came with dreams to like make a lot of money but they found this harsh reality loneliness homesickness isolation Danger from wildlife and and you know you can kill somebody out in these woods and leave their body don't even bury it no one's ever going to find it it's right around the same time that that but was being founded for the same reasons The Mining and and and because they come so quickly there's no law there there's no government no law in your case it's so remote that everyone rushes there before civilization catches up to them and so a lot happens until civilization gets there right and and and we're still not there but there's there's there's you know and so they they had bad food there was illness of course people were were um dying from disease everywhere from from um bad cuts from falling off ladders slipping off of rocks um there was a silica dust involved in the process that they would inhale they didn't that's awful for people mercury poisoning lead poisoning arsenic poisoning they didn't know what they were doing there was no regulations or someone testing the water or the soil right they were just trying to make as much money as they could and they didn't really care how exactly and that just added another layer of blood to this area you know up there and then 1945 to Speedway forward 1955 logging camps came these trees and this is you know 30 feet diameter trees 400 feet high trees over a thousand years old and they're just oh my goodness they're just raising wondering them oh my goodness the hardest thing on this planet is humans right the the most harsh thing on mother is nature is humans but they're making railroads they're making um you know houses there're you know there's all these reasons why they they need this this Lumber and they had uh you know there's failing these trees and there's pictures online that just you know break your heart and I I really want to go up there and do that again now as an adult um so and then railroads came in the in in and everything but then again these the same thing you know we had the the miners we had the uh um the uh I'm a little bit High sorry no worries no worries but anyway we came and we have these login camps now and they had Lumberjacks and they had Lumber jills so there was male and female and they worked six days a week and they lived in these tightly packed shacks and they were fed and paid uh well but it was uh it was and is still one of the most deadliest uh occupations so it's just you know the natives were wiped out the the Gold Rush people the miners the it's just it's just so what's the next layer of blood G to be well the next layer is hippies so wait wait wait hippies they're not a tragedy hold on tragedy after tragedy after tragedy hippies wait a minute but we're getting to Sasquatch and weeds so we're getting closer so so hippies came they were back to the Landers it's the 70s they want to get away from the man a lot of them are are you know it's after the Vietnam War they're really just anti- everything and they go out there and they had a certain dream and you know you can read many books on this but a lot of them did well for quite a while and then the things that happen within relationships and and having groups of people together and oh by the way we have children now we need to go back to the city because of this or too many love triangles or just somebody not being able to live that rough lifestyle or or contribute equally yes it's the end stage of every coven and and self-planned Community ever basically exactly and this is what happened and so there was a lot of um hippie blood in a way uh you know definitely you know I've read some stories of murder over you know cannabis things and things like that but basically what happened I I heard is that kind of a Hell's Angel group came in and black market Growers and they would make it very scary for a lot of these people to be able to afford to keep growing because if your crop gets burned down right before Harvest and you lose your income 300,000 for the whole year to share with all these people and pay all your bills you know and pretty soon they just even though that very well intentioned and everything it just um got taken over a lot by these more criminal Hell's Angel and that's kind of where our our Sasquatch murder comes in so um in 1993 like I said David H house overheard this and the town presented it because it's a uh the kind of town it is with crime at that time in 1993 there's a more criminal black market growth going on that's very that has the finances to keep themselves safe and with with dogs and technology and drones and you know just all kinds of things um that only the Mom and Pops were as well-funded as as the illegal Enterprises right I know it it's isn't that such a quandry we have to deal with even every day like I would love to go get this Jam at a mom and pop but you know well today the part of the Hell's Angels is played by the United States government with all their pay us money or we'll punish you schemes and you know give us all their rules and regulations that you have to follow not a lot of it's necessary so the thugs today is the government but anyway back to your story oh no and something that something else I just wanted to to touch on that I learned about from him was a a a government agency I didn't know existed it's called Camp campaign against marijuana planting founded in 1983 nobody knows about this multi- agency law enforcement to erad eradicate illegal cannabis I already hate them okay Leila this is I I was so shook up when you talked about spilling your shake or your teeth out of the okay it was a sad moment this is worse than that guys come and cut down Acres of our lovely female and throw her in a ditch and burn her I mean this is burning women stuff no a lot of times it's the smaller Farms you know it's the it's the mom and pop family that have been growing it's the hippie family that have been growing since the 70s and somebody like Camp comes in and cuts down all their stuff and oh it just makes me so angry is what happened is and and Camp it was founded in 1983 but I Googled them this morning they're still there and and so they came in kind of with the War on Drugs right oh yeah and we all know now you know that the War on Drugs caused the War cost so much money and did nothing it it did nothing it it brought opiates thank you thank you now thanks now we have the epidemic thank you anyway back to Bigfoot and and oh right right off track a lot of people were saying at the time hey you guys are getting too close into H into this Sasquatch area SAS Bigfoot is coming out to warn you stay away from our territory and so these men were dismembered and the hold on wait I'm sorry so they told Hell's Angels that they can't go further because Sasquatch is in there I I can just imagine a hippie hey dude dude in the leather jacket and chains come here man come here hold on hold on hold on don't go too far in the wood Bigfoot's going to get you I think the hills kitchen well anyway I don't want to go to the end of the story but this grower that this happened to the journalist found out later that he was a like a tweaker and the guy who came and announced the big oh I saw the murder he was also a tweaker so at the time he didn't know that he didn't know how to recognize that right as an adult he was 26 when he heard about this murder as an adult he goes back to the Emerald Triangle in his documentary um which is called Sasquatch on Hulu this is how I kind of found tidbits from him so he goes back and finds out he wants to know do do I know about a murder that's unsolved and so he goes to the sheriff there in that Emerald Triangle which is like mesino uh humble and Trinity counties I think are the three the sheriff there says you don't understand in the United States we have the most missing person accounts we have the most unsolved murders wow inerd really really yes because wow yes because illegal cannabis and because if you dumped a body there or or you wanted somebody to disappear they're they're never gonna find them they're never I see okay the Dark Side of cannabis and and you can watch the documentary but what happens to this journalist is that he starts hitting walls of people who go oh that's what you want to talk about click you know really no one will talk to him about it did you mention click or some people who would talk to him had to be blurred out and their voices changed but they were also telling him if I tell you this you are now on the list of people who are in danger wow you know and and also at the same time there's people trying to prove to him that it was Sasquatch so I think one of the reasons you and I were so into Bigfoot was because in 1967 there was these brothers I think it's called gimlin Patterson the gimlin Patterson film and it's the only film of Sasquatch walking through the forest and if you saw it you'll go oh I remember that from my childhood because I remember it and and there he is okay so there there what happened was they knew they had seen Sasquatch and there was SAS Sasquatch around there so for 20 days they drove all day long looking for him and they had a video camera so back then and it's pretty good video so it was like a news camera I mean think about back then how big and heavy that would have been yeah they went and looked and looked and on the 20th day they spotted him and were able to set up their cameras and you can watch the video of him walking very humanlike uh but very Bigfoot and sasquatchy you know um these these uh Sasquatch are um 9 feet tall up to a th000 pounds with these eight 17 by S inch feet and you have a video of it and that's when everybody said well this is there it is and then there was proof there was proof and then there's a anthrop anthropology Professor from the University of Idaho who collects the casts and he has he has child Sasquatch flat-footed giant casts he has he has the female he has the giant you know male Sasquatch and he goes to the Emerald Triangle all the time to to study this that's so cool we have film proof that SC SAS SAS watch was there and you can go online and find out about that gimin Patterson film and you can decide what you believe I believe it I'll put a link to it I'll see if I can find it and put a link to it one of the things that that everyone talks about in the Emerald Triangle is is you'll know it's a Sasquatch because he'll throw huge logs or rocks that a human couldn't pick up and they'll land 10 feet away from you really with a heavy thud you'll hear growling you'll be Bluff charged so it feels like something's running at you and then it's not and all the people are saying yes he's very stinky it's this horrific smell that will make you nauseous he's very heard that there's a Banshee scream um it's the only time I've ever been that scared in my whole life up there you hear this all the time so you know we kind of know that that it's that that's the territory so what does he find out about our murderous sasquat I got to know so was it Bigfoot or was it greedy Black Market H's Angel Growers what was it well the if not Sasquatch they have a name of an alleged killer oh who no one will talk about or go on camera and talk about and they won't go on camera and talk about the guy who hired him supposedly and so as the journalist moved closer to wanting to prove that it was s Sasquatch he he wanted to you know that would be he'd be okay with that too right just tell the truth started getting these less Sasquatch information and more people going 1993 three Mexican men murdered in and the and no robbery oh oh I don't want to talk to you anymore oh so he was getting too close to a conspiracy of some kind in his search for stoned Sasquatch he uncovered and actually ended up speaking to people who clarified it for him which kind of goes back to my my memory right he had a he had a memory and thought he had witnessed you know been almost witnessed to a murder but I believe Sasquatch was framed it sounds like it maybe to cover up a a gang related murder or a rival murder the tweaker spread the story I think greed and prohibition killed them of course and you know leave Sasquatch alone I'm going to play Shell's part here and I'm going to say it was definitely Sasquatch they were mad because they were destroying the land sometimes these illegal grows have they use terrible pesticides and fertilizers and they're horrible for the land and the Lum Lumber lumberjacking all of this all of it together and the Sasquatch just couldn't take it anymore and took out their anger on those gardeners and that Garden so I know if shell was here she would definitely say Sasquatch did it I'm on Sasquatch thank you for bringing some shell perspective to this because I you know I'm going to be cynical right but this this I'm totally there leave them alone we've destroyed enough they'll you know they'll be here long after we're gone I hope they're immune to whatever we do to ourselves and just leave them alone yep that's right the the environment like you said it had been plundered and ripped up from the miners and the loggers and now you know even the hippies are guilty of not being good stewards of the land sometimes when it comes to cannabis Gardens so that's I'm saying the indigenous people the land didn't get her love anymore you know never and I think the Sasquatch is the defender of the land and in this case I'm I'm Sasquatch side may as West Coast people we go to we gotta stay on the Sasquatch side I think he's our he's our territory that's right that is a great story a stone Sasquatch killed a couple of illegal gardeners I would love some more Sasquatch from youa because they're so you know there's scarier Sasquatch stories there are there's so much I'm definitely going to have to do like a three-part series on Sasquatch because there there's so many different stories from super scary Coast versus East Coast Sasquatch because I read about one in North Carolina or somewhere and the real one so you could say viewers which is the real sasquatch that's right or maybe you know they migrate possibly from I I hear they migrate on the East Coast down south so maybe they migrate all over the whole country we'll have to I'm not I'm not a Bigfoot expert but we'll have to we'll have to see if any of our Sasquatch experts want to weigh in on whether they're different species or if it's like one big tribe that moves around or something and buy Le legal cannabis from the Emerald Triangle guys buy it's there it's legal buy it from Flower Company yes get legal cannabis oh my gosh or buy it from your local you know middle-aged chick down the street who grows fire in her garage that's M and popway thank you that's the best way we need to patronize good companies companies that treat us well that treat their Growers well flow companies Sasquatch weed I mean and Sasquatch weed Sasquatch could have peed on my weed that's amazing I would have smoked Sasquatch weed you know Bigfoot really honestly if they want to take care of the garden they could have an organic line of their own I would pay money for Sasquatch weed and smoke it buy a label called sashwat weed if it was from the Emerald Triangle it would be a great hit that I think it would be a huge hit and I would absolutely do it have my motto sasquash peed on your weed I I would I would buy it just for the for that slogan do that yeah there you go credit to Lisa Anne for that idea if you decide to take it but thank you Lisa Anne so much for joining us today so much fun trying to fill Shell's uh witchy coiny shoes well she's definitely missed but we very much appreciate your perspective and your stories I I
