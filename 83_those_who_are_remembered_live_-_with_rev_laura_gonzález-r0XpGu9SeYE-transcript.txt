welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I am very happy to introduce today's guest the Reverend Laura Gonzalez aka the blue witch Laura is a minister of Circle Sanctuary and a spiritual and Community healer whose practice beautifully weaves together traditional Mexican folk magic native philosophies North American paganism within the goddess tradition Reverend Laura is a writer and you might know some of her work from books like dream Witchery by Elohim Lear which we actually reviewed in a Solarium episode she's also the incredible voice behind the podcast lunatic mes and paganos St Mundo one of the many things that I love about Laura is how she intertwines her spiritual practice with Community activism she's a fierce advocate for indigenous Pagan and lgbtqia communities and she's deeply passionate about women's rights Suicide Prevention and diversity inclusion she's also been reading tarot professionally for for over 12 years and leads both iners in online goddess circles and classes shell and I are very happy to welcome Laura Gonzalez to the show welcome thank you so much for such beautiful introduction and I have to say the first comment is like it feels so weird to be on this side but it's also so cool to be on this side you know to to be able to talk about all the things and we appreciate you taking the time because you are a busy lady is the season everybody's really busy right now but we want to start with how Lea met you um Lea met you at the world parliament of religions let's talk about that for a quick second because I wasn't there unfortunately I did meet you at the parliament of world religions you gave the most beautiful opening prayer you gave the opening the first blessing making history as the first woman and the first Pagan to open the proceedings loved it you gave um a a chant a prayer to the goddess tonaton and you then you also did a an opening prayer in both Spanish and English that was absolutely beautiful yes but then I got to participate in a workshop that you presented with Selena Fox and ker Greenman about podcasting about being podcasters but what was it like to be at the parliament of world religions and present the opening prayer tell us a little bit about that first so first first I I would like to as much so I would like to take all that credit um it's been set up straight the record has been set up straight I was not the first Pagan on stepping on the main stage there was another gentleman who was a very young person in 1992 in Spain he's the son of an elder whose name of course I'm forgetting right now because why would I remember future ilila will pop in with the information no problem oh I've summoned future Lea here according to the wild Hunt editors the blue witch is correct the first Pagan to speak at an open plenary at the parliament was Donovan arthan and this happened in Barcelona in 2004 he was 16 at the time future Lea out but I I'm indeed the first Pagan women indigenous who was and where the confusion began is because not only at the first Pagan indigenous woman at parliament of 2023 but I was the first woman period on the stage after it was men after men after men after W okay for the first I think 45 minutes so what my friend oh I get I'm getting those bmps my friends were very excited and I'm not name dropping but she's my friend uh Byron Ballard is the one that CAU the fact that I was the the first woman speaking and then she worded like oh this is the first woman indigenous Pagan la la la and then it cut on on like first ever but she meant first you know Byron Ballard Phyllis kirat they say things we listen we do we do and and the thing uh Leila and Michelle when that cut up and people started saying you're the first La I was just telling people I'm the first Laura Gonzalez that you know like I I was standing there with all the intersections that hold me back and I'm speaking first person here right being indigenous being Pagan being immigrant being Brown being fat being vegan being witch being woman all of those things are all these intersections I am like a Viaduct yes yes you're like a beautiful gordian not right and and so it was a moment of extreme spiritual and at the same time of course of stream pride and then how it all came to be though that is that is what is the magical thing because I had like everybody else who is a speaker at Parliament you know I had applied I had uh submitted my work uh you know workshops and topics of conversation and uh group panels and single panels and this and that and waiting for acceptance oh my God the the you know like biting your nails and like are they we know we know and then it's like and then you have to pay to get in which and I will say I mean this show is all going to be political if you don't like political pagans then I guess you're on the wrong show I'm sorry but I hope you stay listen but people of color don't have the same access that other folks do so it's it becomes pricey you know even with the group this that we have as members of circle centry it's kind of pricey but it was such an historical thing so I'm like I don't care I'm save money I'm GNA do it so I did it and then about two weeks before Parliament I get an email as one those from philis Crut or her team I I'm I I can't recall but I think it was her team I would have stared at the computer for 10 minutes before I even opened it but then it was her later because they said um it was her because she said I want you on the opening ceremony don't faint I want you to speak blah blah blah and then I remember that I reply fainted I'm back with two weeks notice with two weeks notice wow and then she said to me I want to invite you to do a got's blessing and then it just occurred to me you know let chant which is to her great mother so it's not a one a one particular goddess but it's you know the concept of of our great mother and it's a mentry chant it's not like you know 500 year old chant you can Google it you can find it but to perform it live in front of whatever many people at Parliament me and then uh the prayer and she was telling me come up with a prayer and I have a friend my dear friend and colleague Christian Ortiz with whom I've been walking this path for over decade he wrote this beautiful prayer for the goddess and I asked him you know do you love me can you allow me to use it I've translated that way way before because I've shared it before on other spaces so what I told Phil is well I have do this and that and she's like I want you to do nowat and then which is the language of our people one of the many languages of the many peoples in Mexico so the chant is in naat modern modern naat uh and then the prayer was as it was originally written in Spanish and then in English and it was to say to you that that was a magical moment just to plan on doing it but then uh I asked philis do you want me on regalia or do you want me and she's like no no no regalia and I'm like okay so you know I do my thing my my regalia particularly my face painting is black and the dress is white so it's very striking Don't touch don't move don't sweat don't laugh don't scratch your nose because the lines go over your forehead right over your nose and then under your chin and these are the mirrors of the scalpa they were perfect you must not have touched a thing cuz those lines were sharp but real quickly you you called those those lines something specific does that makeup have meaning yes if they are the lines so oh how much time do we have there are four main forces of nature on the on one of the traditions of our people the one that I follow obviously and these four forces of nature are called talipa so they are four the white talipa the blue talipa the red talipa and the black talipa the other three have a alternative name so these are these are famous you've heard this before he shipot and with silop Poley these guys are like super wellknown or most people you you hear it and you're like I've heard that before but talipa is not as well known and people who know the name talipa they think about the way the colonizers depicted as um a demon a devil an entity that is there to control you what the scalpa is I could not finish tell you what the scalpa is in a life time but my responsibility with my people is to summarize in a way that is easy to grasp I'm the mirror right so my job is to be the mirror and to help right to help people to go deep into themselves to help people recognize themselves to do Shadow work you know the words have been so watered down but the true Shadow work that is looking into the mirror and so the lines represent sent pieces of obsidian or obsidian mirrors okay and the other talipa people that have those responsibilities within the community they will do the lines in different colors so like red blue and um yellow and mine is black so I happen to be the one with the black lines and um they're supposed to be black with a gray outline but I did not did the outline because like it was very striking you looked amazing powerful thank you beautiful and I got chills I mean even rewatching it you can watch this on YouTube I will put links to all of this for everyone if you want to go check out this absolutely gorgeous invocation I mean I I got chills when you started with the Rattle and then did the chant I I did not understand the language but I understood you know yeah I truly believe that's what happened with a lot of people that there is a lot of extractivism in our cultures right um indigenous cultures and it's a conversation that a lot of people don't want to have the extractivism that happens with indigenous cultures within the Pagan community and so the chant for tonin is again it's a little ear war that a lot of people may or may not be familiar with but it's it's been uh taken out of context a lot and the silver light and if there is one is that a lot of people kind of get familiar and I also think Lea there is cellular memory you know yeah there is a lot of that memory that shared history that you know you go back in DNA and sure I mean the drum is the heartbeat but the best part of it all that a lot of people don't know so this is like I've said it before but it's like exclusive so I've been told right by philis gr like w do come with your regalia come here early da da da uh we all remember the snafus with registration the very first day Nightmare and I'm there with my smoke and my push Comet and my things and I'm ready to go and then I'm like where do I line up where do I line up and then of course twia York finds out for me where do I need to be and what do I need to do and there's a person with a clipboard and a headset right and the person with a clipboard comes to me and she's like okay what you looking for and I'm like where do we line up for the for the procession okay what's your name and I say Laura Gonzalez and she goes oh okay so she goes first and everybody else lined up behind her I would have been Panic stricken Panic stricken and I was like come again yeah and and it was like that so indigenous PS at the at the first line which in this case it was me and then the African drummers right behind me and then so on and so forth uh all indigenous peoples of the of the of the world and then um I have please forgive me I forget his name the man who is a leaan of indigenous affairs with parliament of the world religious I for life of me can never remember his name I don't know I was just a lowly volunteer no one told me anything he came to me and he said walk slow right before entering the the place a couple of women are going to join us and I'm like okay so here I am here comes Phyllis and I'm told to light up the smoke medicine you know we call it poet and it's not saging we call it just smoking this is with Cal you know traditional resling from trees in Mexico and here comes Phyllis and she starts taking medicine and I'm like may I and you know and I start doing the thing and I it's so surreal because I hear like a million uh camera flashes where are those photos I need those photos yeah the whole the whole time at Parliament was such an amazing amazing experience and they I've heard before that when you go to Parliament you're never the same and it has been true for me and I I think it's been true for you as well I mean I saw you at that Workshop about podcasting and I had just been doing this podcast for a couple months and now here we are and and you you are just busy busy busy doing so many things you're teaching online goddess circles and uh you had a series decolonizing The Goddess which was absolutely wonderful are you continuing those as well yes I I have to agree definitely transformative the experience of par Parliament not only because you get to connect with all these folks right like I get to walk alongside uh grandmother uh Mary Lions right to to come into like why like somebody pitched me but the transformative aspect of You Meet A lot of people you make a lot of friends you bond with those friends because you're having the exact same experience but you're also doing something impactful for this community as well and the way that I called the Divine goddess the way that the goddess came at me after Parliament it was like I need you whole I don't claim the goddess talks to me and has me on a rotary phone this has been a lot of downloads yeah after many many like sessions of you know introspection and Etc and the message that I'm telling you which is now put put together right but it took a bunch of time is um I'm tired of you doing the Pagan thing here and the indigenous stay here I need you all and because I have a very clear knowledge of where Pagan ends and where indigenous begins and she wants me to do that work and she wants me to do it for our people there's a whole bunch of Mexican-American folks that are orphaned spiritually they live in a Lial space which is they're not American from the United States they are American they're just not from the United States as people would put it that way uh and they're also not Mexican can ask people who put it that way they're both but for some people they're neither and Lial spaces are not easy they're not easy I like I say with all my beautiful asterisk of things that intersect me I also live in a linum space so a lot of changes after par Parliament and the main one very very clear it was you're done with markets and festivals and doing T readings you're not a t reader and and I'm not saying this by any means in a derogatory way I've been making the way in this planet by reading tarot for over a decade right getting paid and I still do I still see people privately but my main thing is education and she wants me teaching and I want to be teaching so teaching sometimes pays and sometimes it doesn't pay and in our communities we have like a fetish for published authors which I love and adore a lot of my friends who are I mean a lot of my friends that publish authors but if you don't have a solo book author by you it's like you don't get a whole lot of opportunities to teach that's a damn good point we definitely do I see that in Pagan communities if you have a book you're now the you're quote unquote a higher authority and and and you know Lea and I have several author friends we love you all but there is a line in the sand between if you're an author and not an author I would agree with that wholeheartedly yeah the thing is because Academia will have it that way is still it it is a Coler concept right it's Academia concert and the thing is uh friends what about the lived experience right right and I'm not saying that for example I don't know mat Orin or F CR or El like they have live experience but they do have the time that resources the ability to write a book right exactly and a lot and not everybody does I cannot stop working period full stop right right and and I don't have the time to say okay I'm gonna disappear for a month and a half and I'm gonna go write a book the other thing is like what do I write the book about like where do we pinpoint you know there's so many things that I know whereas I can stand up and do an hour hour and a half Workshop in front of 50 75 people and convey my knowledge that way that I can do yeah but I can't necessarily take a two-year sabatical from my mundane day job that pays my bills to write a book and and the other part of it is I come from a tradition of oral tradition we we are oral people we share our knowledge orally so when there is this pressure of write WR book it's almost hypocritical to write it down into a book if that's what you were taught you know and and like people ask me you know why don't you write about Day of the Dead like you are the expert on Day of the Dead I like because the holiday keeps evolving every year what it is now is a very modern thing could you tell us a little bit about I know you teach a class on this so don't go too much into it but just tell us a little bit about Day of the Dead for anyone who doesn't know Day of the Dead comes from like all of us nowadays Mexican people we are called Mexican people right um but we're different diverse indigenous peoples who uh have this unfortunate influence of the colonizers and etc etc and it's funny because colonizers will be like you're a brand new race like how like you know your ancestors but you're not one of us You're Something Different which is just a it's uh it's emotional warfare that's emotional Warfare and there's a huge wound for all of us indigenous people of Mexico there but back to Day of the Dead so Day of the Dead uh do you guys like day of the de I do what I understand of it which is I guess a very Americanized version of it as a time to celebrate the lives of people that uh in my family people that I love uh setting up on alter and ofenda and putting out marigolds different flowers candies foods that they enjoyed and just celebrating their life that's what I understand it right around November 2nd yeah that is exactly the B go ahead sh this isn't necessarily my understanding of it because I don't understand it very much to be completely honest with you and and here here is where my question to you comes so I don't know much about about it I am not of Mexican descent so if I were to celebrate the Day of the Dead is that considered appreciation or appropriation because there's a fine line and I want to know your opinion on that because there's a lot of appropriation going on right now that's not appreciation and you know let's just say that might be something you know I would want to look into you know I obviously want to to honor my ancestors you know ancestor altars and all of that but is it appreciation or appropriation because that I think people need to know the difference they love our culture they love the colorful Day of the Dead they love our food they love our music they love our women they love our language they love tacos they love Day of the Dead and the sugar skulls they love the altars they love the guacamole and they put it on everything they love Oris seen they really really love they of the dead and all the Traditions that are attached to it they love to go to Mexico and vacation and they love to go to the beaches and they really love how we welcome them whether we welcome them in Mexico or we welcome them here when they come to our spaces they really love our culture like nobody's business they just don't love us and that's the problem you know I don't my mind set I can't wrap my head around on that but I I see what you're saying but that's just horrible and so to answer your question first I'm first I want to ask Lea question and then I will answer your sh sure sure um the the Day of the Dead is uh and I ask you if you liked it because uh the original Day of the Dead holidays were 20 days each so it was a 40 day period oh we celebrate and we honor The Departed first the little kids and then the elderly adults and elderly folks and fruits merry gold and dancings and uh burning smoke and all of that then when the colonizers came to what is now Mexico they bring their traditions of All Saints Day and All Souls day and those Traditions were already very much infused with Pagan traditions and so Day of the Dead modern now 2024 Day of the Dead is an amalgamation of Indo European Pagan Traditions dressed as Catholic Traditions plus Central Mexico holidays for the dead that have evolved and now they're intertwine into this one thing that we call day of the de uh part of humans Heritage of the world so by the United Nations and a beautiful beautiful Festival which is indeed to celebrate and to honor those who have lived and as I said before it's not a one thing because we are not a monolith people don't realize Mexico is also Continental just like the United States and Mexicans are not only in Mexico the Border crossed us here in the United States but then we also have moved throughout the planet and now they are Day of the Dead celebrations throughout the planet that they take their own little flavor but in the Continental Mexico it's also celebrated differently so that is also why a book a full book of the that cannot exist because it's like each little town has their own Traditions but that said I don't speak for all Mexicans so I cannot say hands off don't touch it I can't because I I don't rep I'm not the representative of all Mexicans who celebrate the of the Dead what I can say and I will say until my face is blue is do you want to learn about these Traditions go to Mexican people go to indigenous people do you want to be part of the celebration go where it's celebrated by Mexican and Indigenous people do you want to set up an altar go to where weer or altars do you want to get in touch with your ancestors find the traditions of your people because I guarantee you there are traditions of your people of your ancestors that are are just as beautiful they might not be as colorful because for us death is about flowers it's about food it's about singing and dancing and celebration you know it's it's very unique and uh there is a meme that is going around and of course they start going around this time of the year what it says till that do a part does not apply to Mexicans and that kind of summarizes all for us we cry when our loved ones died but there is a certainty that they come back and there are people in Mexico whom are Christian Catholic atheist Pagan indigenous or otherwise it doesn't matter everybody believes that they come back on November 1st and 2nd and then you have the indigenous people that still practice like us and they it just ended you know it's like uh mid August to early September are the time for the de and we honor them and we do this and all of that and they come they come they come because they come they do and it's just beautiful this time of year I know that they're not the same but there are a lot of in different cultures this fall time of year we all start talking about our dead and our ancestors and that's a very common beautiful theme that we have to share and there's a couple different sayings like he who is remembered lives and they say that you die twice the first time is your physical death and the second time is the last time someone says your name and I always think about those when people talk about Dia deos muos because that's what it's all about is remembering their name remembering who they are yeah is is there any particular tradition um that that you wouldn't mind sharing that you love that's particularly dear to you this time of year I really love and um and I want to uh put an addendum there for shelle who asked about appropriation to be very very clear folks we don't want you to not be part of it we don't want you to not come around come around come and join us but really really consume from Mexican people Mexican American indous people yes yes the the Mattel Barbie Day of the Dead Doll is beautiful Mattel don't need your money you know who need your money my friend Mika who creates art for Day of the Dead and is a single mom and sells it to support her daughters and herself so that that's the that's the reality if you're interested in it immerse yourself into that culture learn from the people from that culture and educate yourself from that culture absolutely sh absolutely and that applies to any culture absolutely absolutely because I'm not going to go to when Stefan to ask about uh Hindu culture you know I know I show my age right there so one tradition that I particularly love about Day of the Dead is the setting up of the Altar and I have a grandson by love and my grandson never met my mother and my mother is in Mexico and my mother knew of my grandson got to see photographs and got to see got to know about him but they never met right person in person so when we're setting up the altar uh unfortunately my stepson my my grandson's father passed away in 2011 so we really set up a very nice Altar for my mother and his father and I try to make sure that I have my grandson those days and when we setting up the altar I will tell them you know we put the coffee because uh my mama like black coffee just like your daddy like black coffee and we put the Domino's because both your M your dad and my mom like to play Domino's and cards and then uh there's this ritual that I do for my mother every year that I open a bag of potato chips and I have to find the foldy ones you know the ones that fold over yes yeah because my mother will pick those out of the bag because the crunchy of them so I make sure I put a big bowl of potato chips but it's only the fly ones only the ones that are I love that and sharing that with my grandson do I miss my mom of course who doesn't but sharing that with my grandson so now he's 16 now which is incredible and sharing that with him and and the little things that I know about his dad you know I was around his dad's life for nine years so you know what I remember which is helping you're helping create memories of people that he didn't have enough time with yeah in the real in the real face tace yeah absolutely and I think not because that's my favorite part but I think that is the core of the celebration and then of course is the what I think is very um healthy for us as humans is giving ourself permission to mourn right mourning is something that is so hid in on the culture here in the United States when a person cries a lot for someone who died you're told to get over it the fact that people say get over it I'm like I will never I will never I still cry for my mommy I mean not every day but you know come day of the day or come Christmas oh I hate Christmas I don't hate Christmas I hate Christmas music because it reminds me of my mom so much you know and it makes me very weepy but it's part of the love that you have for them and and we believe believe we Mexican people indigenous people we believe that the relationship don't end it just is is is just different it just changed they can't talk back at you anymore well tell that to in an episode just a couple weeks ago chel was talking about one of her traditions on Halloween on S is she and her children would leave pieces of candy from trick or treating on their ancestor Altar for a particular grandmother I had a grandmother who Halloween was like it for her it was like her Christmas she dressed up every year uh up until she was 83 and passed away and we always went to her house no matter where we lived always packed up the kids uh went to her house saw her on Halloween and she happened to pass away three days before Halloween her costume was already laid out in the guest bedroom so at first first what we did for several years my grandmother was big on coke and cigarettes so every Halloween Coke the drink by the way people don't get any bad thoughts here you know me the kids and I we we'd crack open a can of soda um they would leave out a piece of candy because my house happened to be just a few doors down from the house that she passed away in sometimes they would leave candy out in the front yard of that house it just because I I don't know if it was the fact that that she died so close she died on the 28th or if it was because that was like the most important holiday to her but it's almost like the phone rings on that day you know what I mean that that spiritual phone is always ringing on that day and now that I have a grandson even my daughter has said that when she gets him ready for going out trick-or-treating in costume she said one time she felt like she heard my grandmother laughing in the background and I'm like that's cuz Gigi was there and she liked the C costume and she approved and you know I like to keep things out like she had a cauldron pin that she always wore on Halloween I keep that out you know just kind of remembering things that she liked or things that I have that were hers um kind of make them more prominent around that time my pictures a lot of them are in storage right now but up until recently I would put out like pictures it's just like I said it might be because it was like her favorite time of year and she passed away at that time but it's like I said it's like that spiritual phone like Rings you're not gonna believe this and these are the beautiful Mysteries right of of the Divine my mother who does not like to be called or named or anything she died she's done she's gone and she made it very clear when I'm done I'm done goodbye but my mom was the old lady that will give out candy on Day of the Dead and she will go all out you know for all the kids on the on the on the Block because in Mexico City yes children go not treat trick-or-treating is different but they go and they get candy and so that was one of my the favorite season you know because for us is like the Mexican holidays Independence on September and then October a lot of people in the city are already celebrating Halloween just like in the United States and then they other the de on November and then of course it's Christmas in December and the whole holidays fall winter holidays my mom will be like the happiest but Day of the Dead was like you know the big one from her the fact that I'm obsessed with Day of the Dead is not you know a coincidence I learned that and my mother passed away on October 27 oh jeez goodness oh geez you know the two of them are somewhere in the universe conspiring to hand out candy my grandma was all about full-size chocolate bars she did not do minis she was not about the mini life yeah and and my mom same you know she will go to the point that when I was very very young I will get jealous you know like why are you giving all this candy to all these kids like it's my candy you know but I was a kid and of course I was jealous see now because I was the grandchild I would go and then when I would take my kids as the great-grandchildren and we had pre-made bags set aside for us waiting when we got there so cool so cool but when you say October 26 I was like wait a minute what a coincidence now I don't want to keep you too terribly much longer Laura I know you are very very busy which you also have in addition to your classes your online classes which we will put links to all of those in person in Chicago which I love your city by the way big Pagan presence there I've never been there I gotta go now you moved there 20 some odd years ago 25 and 26 now and the fun fact is I have existed longer in Chicago than I ever did in Mexico City so it's funny because now when people ask me where you're from I just naturally stay from Chicago and the truth is I'm from Mexico City but yeah we have an amazing community so my offerings are I will continue with the de deiz and the goddess classes online we have we we're going to finish the first season which is all 2024 there's 11 classes and you can buy those on demand if you cannot make it to the classes you can buy them on theand and it's all on my website blue wi.org so the first series the first year is all like the female powerhouses uh our second year we're going to be doing our female and our queer powerhouses but we're still going to call it the colonized and the goddess and the idea is that by 2026 we start tapping into the male powerhouses so there's going to be the colonizing the goddess classes for a long while and those are online and you can sign up for them or you can buy them on demand but we're also doing um speaking about how parliament of the world religions changed my life and how I was told no more MDS no more festivals no more just tarot it was taking a toll on my health it was taking a toll on my wet and people want to learn from me and I want to teach cuz I love teaching more than anything in the planet and so we've been doing workshops we're doing the workshops roughly every six to eight weeks and they are long workshops I started three-hour workshops another four hour workshops and next year we're going to do a one full day workshop wow because we're going to do a sweat lotch at mascali that's on the works so if you are from out of town and I know things blue because I really want to have people experience that but in the way that like the way we do it and it takes a lot of time it's a whole day ordeal so we're going to learn about what is on the works is learn about da and then going into the tamas Cali but that is 2025 right now next month I'm going to be doing one on Fortuna's Embrace healing our relationship with wealth because it's very important for people of color and otherwise people people people my offerings are more geared towards of course the black and brown indigenous Pagan Community B Puck because racist people will be racist without knowing they said to me now that you identify as bip I'm like I was born bip I mean now it's racist people but anyway um so yeah I'm not saying my offerings are not for all kinds of people but I'm prioritizing the disenfranchise and the so-called disenfranchise is just there's not a whole lot of opportunities for us so we are prioritizing that the people that want the knowledge gets to come so a lot of my offerings have like a sliding scale I was going to mention that that that's one of the things I I love when I go to your workshops online you do have a sliding scale for people so that there is you know if you can pay full price please do but if you can't you need a little discount you have that offered there and I I thought that was really really nice and Laura on behalf of folks all around the world that don't always have the funds required thank you for offering the sliding scale because that makes a difference to some people and that can really make the difference between whether they're able to attend or not so thank you for that thank you and and know that I'm one of those people I'm one of those people that I would like to go like there are offers online for like psychological training or like psychological magic this and that and who's got thousands of dollars because none of the three of us do they are thousands and thousands of thousands yeah I'm like yeah no so we're going to keep it real and we're going to keep this lighting skill so the colonizing the goddess is a fixed price right but the online goddess circles that are still going those are sliding and online godess circles evolved from women's circles because the online community I I started doing a lot of work first in 2009 2015 like from 2009 to 2015 most of my Ministry was online so a lot of people is still seeking that and the goddess circles the women circles evolve into goddess circles because I have people of all genders and I don't believe that the goddess is only for people bu aula and I'm not checking genitals at the door thank you thank you it's just like this is the 21st century can you join us here so we have a wonderful community of our online GAA circles those are a sliding scale and we're continue building a community for the workshops we just did one uh few weeks ago called chly or sacred Waters and it was a beautiful transformative experience because we go with this indigenous goddess and what her message is and we tap into like Eco activism and emotional or Emotional Self and Shadow work and community and it's just beautiful and then we do ritual within the worship there is a ritual and I'm going to keep offering those like I say next month we're going to do the Fortuna one but I'm also going to be teaching this month here in Chicago so if you're local to Chicago go to MSA shop on historic 18th Street in pilson I will be teaching origin and traditions of the

socials blue.org blue witch. RG we don't do that come because it wasn't available and because we're special we're very well organized no blue wi.org and all the things blue witch are there on the man Club es new offerings workshops in person online la la la the best place to go find me everywhere is to go to Blue wi.org before I go I know I'm already because you invited a talker to the to your show so I'm gonna talk good because I still have two questions all right beautiful but let me shout out to Andrea Fernanda my business manager and to S wani my personal assistance and to Lisa Chavis who are now the blue witch team I'm so jealous you have a team you know what I must so awesome for you I must have done something incredible in this lifetime because these three people are keeping me sane keeping me afloat and I wouldn't be able to do half of the things there's 12 events for yes we need you to be able to teach and to share and then of course my husband so you know it's like gu five people on the team see I look at Lila and I as we're our team and the husbands are like the backup dancers there you go I like that real quick before I let you go I just have two silly little questions the first one is on your YouTube uh you do oracles for the week and you use quite a few different decks from what I've seen you don't stick to one particular deck do you have a favorite Oracle or Tarot deck that you have used absolutely so that is the coffee breaks that we've been doing since 2018 and um usually Monday Wednesday Friday but sometimes I can't do it because busy busy my favorite favorite Tarot deck about a decades old Legacy of the Divine by S marquetti oh do you have that one good one I do and anything by S maretti I like I am just mesmerized by his art because it's like mix it's like manual and computer so I really like it and when it comes to tarot decks I really like his work specifically Legacy of the Divine but he has like two or three that I like and when it come to oracles I really love Stacy DeMarco I watched one of your episodes recently where you had like six of her decks yes and I keep telling the people that come to the coffee break like do you guys recommend other oracles should we go buy stuff like like and everybody's like no you have a relationship with with with Stacy cuz I know her I bought her Dex and then I found her online and then I invit her to my podcast so we have we're not besties we don't have coffee once a month but we have a good relationship right so I feel certainly a personal connection with the person that wrote the oracles and I was just recently shopping online like which ones she came out with new ones that I don't have CU I want to go buy them so anything by Stacy dearco is a really good Oracle and the way she writes puts like a rhyme or like a little spell on every one of the oracles and I really like that she's very talented and she's a no holes bar witch from I don't want to mistakenly say I think Australia but I might be mistaken hey no holds bar is our kind of witch we like that my last question is going to be for you in particular Laura but also shell you and I should also answer this it's a little irreverent but considering that you know this is the Season of the Witch it's the spooky season we're honoring ancestors across the globe and all sorts of different cultures and food seems to be pretty common when people talk about honoring their ancestors we all talk about food so since you said recently in one of your YouTubes Laura that we don't all live forever and since we don't don't live forever when you have gone what food will be used to call you for your your descendants how will they call you as an ancestor what food the answers go surprise everybody because it's the most nut Mexican food in the planet I want a mountain of french fries with a gallon of ranch dressing which will not abser my stomach because I'm dead because I'm vegan I'm vegan vegetarian and buried underneath the french fries I won like 10 pieces of chicken tenders they have to now mind you I've been vegan for five years now so your ghost doesn't have to be a vegan though no when when I'm dead it can be real chicken tunders french fry you know I I'm gonna have to do the exact opposite and and and my children will back me up on this tacos and queso tacos and queso in a gallon of lemon iced tea you want to get you want to bring me back get the turkey hill tea and a damn Taco and I'm here there you go awesome how about you mine would be anything spicy the spicier the better and a big old plate of oatmeal raisin cookies although all of these french fries with the chicken tenders tacos it's a feast in 50 years if you're really hungry having the munchies you need to summon me Leila and Laura because it'll be a damn Feast there you go absolutely and I keep telling people jokingly obviously you know but can you imagine I've talked people about Day of the Dead so many time Here There and Everywhere and like you need to put me on your altar if I'm dead and I don't have my photograph in like 20 altars I'm gonna be upset gon be haunting some people people are going to have to answer to a very angry ghosty Laura I hope not you've touched a lot of people Laura and and when I see people react to you on these YouTube You're so friendly and open and you have such great insight for people so I am not surprised that you are a minister to your community because you you definitely have that spirit so thank you for sharing that with us thank you thank you so much and thank you for having me it's been my pleasure to meet you shell and to reconnect with you Leila you and all the blessings that we have in life right we can choose go down and cry and feel sorry about ourselves or
