welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I am shell So today we're talking about a Hot Topic here this is like all over the online world people have pretty strong feelings about this one way or another they really do there's like no in between with this which is so funny because I'm so in between with this today we're going to talk about the rule of three and we're going to touch on some Karma the rule of three is a Wiccan concept that's sometimes called the three-fold law or the law of return I think it's important to point out exactly what you just said it is a wiced concept and I think that there's a misconception that all witches and all pagans all follow the rule of three only if you're Wicked and not everybody's Wick so not everybody follows the rule of three because it's not a part of their thing their belief their Jive exactly exactly yes this concept actually comes from most likely Gerald Gardner he's the first person that we can find a record of uh that talks about anything remotely like the rule of three so basically it's a it's a phrase the modern version of it comes from a comment by Dorian Valente in 1964 she said in a public speech eight words the wick and read fulfill and it harm none do what ye will I mean it sounds great but it's not like some ancient thing no no this was in 1964 and then there are later poems that were published one called the wiccan read published in the spring 1974 issue of a magazine called earth religion news and then one later in the green egg magazine which I love and this was published by a woman named lady Gwen Thompson and she called it Reed of the wick wi CC AE and she said that it was um from her grandmother Adriana Porter who was from a long line of witches now the problem with that is a lot of Scholars researched these poems and found that the language used originated with gardener and it's not really accurate Old English or anything like that so it looks to be a modern thing coupled together so like you said not an ancient law yeah and you know and there's there's also different variations of it too so it's not like even the the verbage is set in stone because I've even heard it as mind the three-fold law you should three times bad three times good again it sounds beautiful I love it it has a good rhyme and Jive to it but the concept is not to be tagged with everyone who identifies as a witch or a pagan that's correct and the line that you mentioned is actually another line from the full poem the wick and read is actually a 26 couplet rhyming line poem yeah it's 26 lines I'm just going to read three of them the biggest three that you'll hear are the first line by ye Wiccan laws ye must in perfect love and perfect trust another line later in the poem is the three-fold law ye should three times bad and three times good and then the last line is these eight words the wicked read fulfill and ye harm none do what ye will so these are all part of a greater 26 line poem called The Wicked read again that's ascribed to a couple different people but they're mostly sure that it came from Dorene valiente's work Gerald Gardner's work and so that's where this concept came from the idea is is that everything you put out there comes back to you three-fold so if you're putting out good good shit's coming back times three and if you put out bad bad shit's coming back times three but the problem is sometimes just happens exactly sometimes someone can do as many good things as they possibly can and life still shits on them right sometimes people can be the biggest jerk in the world do the worst things and and it's all sunshine and Roses exactly the universe is kind of a sometimes and we don't know why we try to to contain it do magic and control it as best we can but it doesn't always work and that's why I think that maybe like in my opinion I I'm gray on it I'm not going to lie you know I i' I've sometimes put out less than Stellar fully knowing what I'm putting out there and been okay with that but I I kind of Link this with the concept of Karma for good or bad I think a lot of people do what goes around comes around man if you're a shitty person somehow someway that will come back to you might not be today might not be tomorrow tomorrow but somehow some way your is going to come back to you like a boomerang Karma has a lot of different meanings I mean the Hindu philosophy ascribes a lot of different meanings to it other cultures ascribe different meanings to it it's a difficult concept to pin down exactly but basically the idea is that what you do in this lifetime determines what kind of Lifetime you will be reborn into into the next one if you do good in this lifetime in your next lifetime you'll be born at a higher station other people believe that that energy comes back to you in this direct Lifetime and that's more of the western thought that gets kind of linked with the law of three the idea that whatever you do you know the idea of like attracts like if you think good thoughts or you put good energy out all of it will come back to you that's kind of where those two ideas get squished together and unfortunately I feel like I'm G to find myself doing this this a lot this episode for all of our Swifty fans out there we can give you Taylor's version too for Taylor Karma was a relaxing thought aren't you envious that it's not like that for you that's actually a really good point the three-fold law has some good sides to it as well for one it's a good tool to keep you in check to kind of keep you in check you know if you think if in your mind you're like man whatever I do is going to come back to me times three good or bad that might steer your your your mind to be a Kinder gentler person absolutely and and it also I mean it goes to a lot of human thought I mean there's the the Golden Rule right which is kind of to others as you would have others do unto you right kind of the same thing yeah they're they're not really universal laws so much as they areal good ideas yeah moral Cod call moral codes I like that it's it's a way of being in the world and so if you think about your actions all actions have consequences magical actions have consequences as well I feel like there's there's a saying and I can't think of it like all actions have a equal and opposite reaction what what is this this is a scientific quote and I yes it is you know what I'm getting at that's one of Newton's theories that's uh Newton's law of motion and it's considered a universal law yeah I thought you just said there was no universal law damn you well I just meant with the three-fold law that kind of the same thing just with different words they are but as we stated before it doesn't always work perfectly this is not a perfect beautiful system well nothing is but I think we've even said this in in another episode actions have consequences if you're mad at someone and you cast a spell at them whether they deserve it or not let's not get into that you're mad you're angry you cast a spell at someone I believe that that is effectively the same thing as swinging a punch directly at their face well sometimes we all do stupid yeah and sometimes people need to be punched in the face if you do either of those actions something will happen back to you we are not advocating violence here folks we are not saying you should punch anyone in the face what I'm saying is if you do punch someone in the face either with a spell or with your fist you should expect some type of reaction yeah but you know what the problem with your theory and Society people know that there's a a reaction to that people don't always realize there's there's consequences to spellwork that's right and maybe because they can't see it whereas they can see a fist being swung directly at them maybe because they can't see it they don't realize that those energies will have some type of rebound but as we've seen in life sometimes there are people who can punch someone in the nose and have absolutely no consequences or there's people that can take the high road and still get gut punched in return exactly exactly this car is a it is but most of the time if someone gets punched in the nose you know if they deserved it the person doing the punching does not usually get punished oftentimes they might get praised but it's still a reaction so we just have to be conscious of that when you're doing spell work maybe it's not going to come back to you perfectly times three but there will be consequences and you should weigh those before you perform any kind of spell work and you know people have there's we we've had this conversation previously where we've been asked by listeners and and just people in general have you ever cursed someone or hexed someone or or done you know negative magic towards someone you know I ain't going to sit here and lie to you yes I have but the thing is it's something that I save for special occasions and I go into it knowing full well that I'm doing some shady and if I get shady back at me I only got myself to blame right so I go into it with eyes wide open yeah and that's and that's exactly what we have to do if you're casting a spell for Success you need to understand that sometimes success doesn't always look the way that you want it to success could mean you get fired from your job to pave the path to a better newer greater job exactly it just don't feel that way when you're getting fired and it might not be the most convenient time to get fired and start a brand new job so but you're still in the end getting what you wish for but you're getting what you wish for so I guess that old adage of of being careful what you wish for kind of comes into play as well you know if you want someone to get punished and do a spell to punish them and then find out later that you were wrong you know what then what are you going to do then right so you got to think about that you have to think about all possible consequences of your actions but all these things all tie in together you know the three-fold rule Karma the universal rule care for what you wish for rule like like these all they're really all kind of the same concept just looked at from different angles yes whereas it originally sounds like something that you tell a newbie you know watch out for the three-fold law everything you do will come back to you 3 * 3 and that's that's a good thing to tell a newbie because they really should be thinking over every single thing that they do that's a great training guideline rather than a law but as you advance in the craft and you advance in your magic you're going to come upon times where you're like well times three be damned I'm willing to take the consequences of my actions and you go forward preach it right so you start to question that law right but it also doesn't make you judge and jury either don't don't take it that way because because we're definitely not telling you that being judge and jury is okay either because that's not what we're saying no we're saying quite the opposite actually is is that before you do anything um before you become judge and jury I guess you need to research your case if we're using the same analogy I don't know guess you need analogies yeah I don't know but yeah you need to do the work first and research it you know before you do any spell you need to check it out and find out how it's going to affect you which is actually kind of a cool interpretation of the the rule of three I believe I saw in an article by Patty wigington love her I've been following her for freaking years no Years Years awesome article but um yeah uh in there she talked about what she called quote one of the most sensible interpretations of the rule of three states that the rule of three doesn't mean it's going to come back to you three times it's talking about three different levels of magic basically that your actions are going to affect you in three different spheres physical emotional and spiritual which is actually kind of a very cool way I like that concept I do too I do too and it it makes a lot more sense of the idea of taking ownership of your actions and taking ownership of the consequences of those actions and I think that that's really kind of more the point that I like to drive home with folks is because again you know I've I have thrown caution to the wind and said you know consequences be damned I'm doing it so I I think really the concept to drive home to newer folks is everything has consequences good bad and different extreme gentle consequences but all things have consequences and you just have to determined on what level of consequences are you willing to take I also like to look at it as a very beautiful way of living with people you know some of the original ideas go back to alist Crowley who I know is very problematic but his original statement was um the law of thma which was do what thou Wilt shall be the whole of the law love is the law love under will and that sometimes is said to be where Dorian bente and Gerald Gardner got the idea for for their Wiccan read well like you said Crowley little problematic kind of guy happens he did have some really solid thoughts and this was one of them yeah yeah well we do have to acknowledge where our history comes from whether we like those people or not that's where some of these things came from hopefully we have learned and grow from those people but um that's from the book of law which was published like in 1904 it continues now with the idea of and it harm none do what ye will and as a young witchling I really liked that it was a very freeing idea instead of this whole idea of you can't do anything everything good and fun is bad and you're bad if you like them so I'm coming from a background of that to this idea of harm none do what thou will right that's that's amazingly freeing and wonderful that you know all these things that I enjoy as long as I'm not harming anyone or myself because Anna harm none is to not harm you as well none means none so the idea of doing things as long as no one got hurt that was incredibly freeing you could dance you could sing you could have sex you could have relationships you can read all the books learn all the things nothing is forbidden as long as it doesn't hurt anyone and so that's kind of a great way to be in the world and and you know and that's why I I I think it is a good concept whether you are totally into it or a little more on the gray side it definitely is something that you want to kind of keep in the back of your mind because if nothing else it's going to kind of keep you in check mentally you know okay rule of three am I really just pissed off and angry and up right now I need to think this through or are you just shooting from the hip here which could have really not so nice consequences depending on on what you're doing you know it gives you kind of that little angel on your shoulder kind of thing you know or a little devil like okay so I'm going to get some consequences but they're not going to be that bad you know you got the little angel kitty cat on your shoulder going don't forget about Karma and the three-fold law and then you got the little other devil Kitty on your shoulder saying throw caution to the wind let's roll they deserve it just do it right right all I can think of is Tom and Jerry with the little kitties on his shoulder the devil and the angel you know sometimes he would listen to the the good kitty and sometimes he would listen to The Bad Kitty and sometimes it worked out and sometimes he got Anvil to his head that's right I'm G to use that with my students next time you know the way that you just put it as a moment to think a moment of self-reflection it's not a universal law we should not look at this as this is an ancient proverb from our grandmother's grandmother's grandmother and it was passed down unchanged for Millennia you know it's it's not that you make that sound so believable though right it sounds so good like that but but it's it isn't that it's still a very cool idea to help you stop and think about your actions and what you're doing and do you really want this and the consequences of this and then how you perceive from there is totally up to you completely up to you I mean you have to use your own discretion there's going to be times when you do want to do that abundance and prosperity spell and the stability be damned and there's going to be times when you do think someone needs to get their comeuppance and consequences to yourself be damned and hex and our exes that's right sometimes xes need hexen just saying that's right but you also need to be prepared to accept those consequences right right and you need to fully think it through before you do it so if the three-fold law allows you to do that gives you that moment to be like all right take that moment of pause yeah then then I think it's a great thing so universal law not so much but good advice sure I find it interesting that people are like in like these crazy heated conversations about this online you would think they're fighting for their life on this one I have seen groups blow up and die over the threefold law yeah which makes no sense to me arguing about it I that's like saying I'm mad at you because your favorite color is red you can either ascribe to the three-fold law as something that you follow as a hard and fast rule or not but I don't think we need to get into the prizz that some religions do we don't need to say my way is the only way because it there's proof that the three-fold law does not universally work and for it to be a universal law science tells us it has to work every time in every situation exactly the same for every person and it just doesn't well and I also I also think that you know the thing that draws people to Witchcraft and and draws people to paganism and all of the things that come under both of those umbrellas is the fact that you can kind of tailor this whole thing to you personally it's not like Christianity where we have this Bible and everything has to be done exactly how it says in the Bible this isn't like that so why as a spiritual group as a religious group and as a witchcraft practicing group do we feel the need to try to do the same thing and say you know you can do what you want and tailor it to your own life except for the rule of three like what's with that do it your own we we have said this from literally episode one do it how you want what feels right for you the way you want to do it and if that includes the rule of three great and if it doesn't great great great we're all for people sharing their experiences please do tell us about times when the rule of three worked perfectly for you do you remember when people used to invoke the rule of three on someone they wouldn't hex them that they would just be like I call three three by3 on you or something to that effect yeah because I remember at one point it got Twisted into 8 by8 and I'm like yeah 9 by9 and oh my goodness what are we doing here folks math is not my strong point but if it works for you that's wonderful and and I think that we should share those things we should definitely share when something works or doesn't work for us but we shouldn't condemn the people that it doesn't work for exactly and and I think in this particular case it's very easily provable where it came from when it was started who wrote it how all the different versions and that it's not a universal law but I think maybe where that whole universal law thought comes in is the fact that it does seem that throughout the ages multiple religions multiple multiple spiritual faiths multiple societies have had some sort of similar thing so they feel like it's Universal but put in different words and I think that's why it worked for so long I mean there was a period in the 80s when we were told this is ancient knowledge this and we were also told we were also told that Aquanet was good for our hair oh that's true but we were told and even our you know all the books even said it at the time when when you started to do research that's what you found was this is ancient knowledge that came down from the ancient Knowledge Tree in all these old parts of the world and these are true universal laws and because they mashed so well with other cultures and with other religious ideas we accepted it God we were gullible well I think we were all just starting out and we continued to learn I think gullible is when you just stay there you know information was not as plentiful back in our day as it is now and you almost had to like CLA scrape for info CLA scrape for books to find people we didn't have the worldwide web in 1989 thank you um you know the limited information that we had access to we believed every stinking word of it and it was wonderful at the time absolutely absolutely how many years ago and we are still students we are still learning that's what this belief system is it is an Ever growing ever learning ever evolving practice and idea you have to honor where someone else is because we as a collective are all kind of forming this and learning this at the same time but we're all at different stages of our journey yeah and and you have to say Okay at the time this is what I knew I got more information and I know better now and that's that's great that's fine and I think that's kind of where we are with the rule of three so many people are talking about it and having ideas and conversations and engaging in excellent discussions that we have got a more nuanced look at it now I think than we ever did but some people are still stuck in the past and want it to be a universal magical ancient law it does sound good I'll be honest kind of sounds good we'll put up a um I'll either put it in the show notes or up on our website but I will definitely have a link to the full Wiccan read so you can read the whole thing it's kind of cool there's some neat stuff in there I have it I have it handwritten in my book of shadows and and and I am proud of that because it is it's an important piece of text that everyone should be exposed to and know of but that doesn't mean it's like the freaking C word of the law of the land it's definitely something that you should know and be acquainted with but like you don't need to be living by every line of it either exactly kind of like the words to live by that you had written in your new book of shadows back in the day that you spoke about in our last episode this is filled the wiccan read is filled with really cool little tidbits like right right um let's see here's here's a good one with a fool no season spend nor be counted as his friend merry meat and merry part write the cheek and warm the heart so basically don't spend your time on fools do not give them the time of day and that's good advice and and here's a line that I actually like a really short line um when Misfortune is an now where the blue star on thy brow and that just makes me think and this might not even be the meaning it just makes me think if if times are down and you're feeling shitty man and you know some shit's coming the goddess is there with you don't forget that I've always liked that line as well and I've always thought of the blue star on my third eye Y and that that line always makes me think that not only is the goddess with me but the goddess is within me that my knowledge is the one that's going to help me my higher knowledge is going to help me through this difficult time and I I always love that line so it's definitely something that that you should be aware of and that you should know of and and you know take good stock in it but you know Jesus this ain't the gospel but no no this is this is definitely not the gospel Jesus but it is definitely good advice and so it is it is and like I said it it's a good thing to to keep right with your moral compass but you know sometimes even with moral compasses we all have to take a sharp left everyone now and again and it is a Wiccan concept like we said at the beginning it comes from wiah which is a religion which is Rule bound it's a whole different thing and so they have their way of doing things which is great and it's beautiful and like I've said before I have Wiccan DNA because that's pretty much where we started yeah that's where we started so you don't have to follow it not everybody's Wiccan if you're not Wiccan why are you following Wiccan Concepts good point it's similar to condemning someone for not believing what you believe correct but I also think that if you're a witch you should be really aware of your actions and how they affect you on all three levels oh absolutely emotional physical and spirit ual and you should also be aware I mean we're aware of the currents of energy that flow through Us and other people you have to know that things rebound and that what you do changes things so being aware of it as a concept is definitely something I think all witches should do boomerangs are real things you know yes and punching someone in the nose will have consequences of some type and I believe that very strongly and hexing your ex will have consequences of some type you just usually for the you you you just have to decide if those consequences are worth it to you that's right you have to decide if the consequences are worth it to you so and you should pay attention to that in everything we're not just always talking about hexes we're talking about good magic too are you prepared for that success are you prepared to move you know if you're doing most people are more prepared for the than they are for the good just put that out there statistically people are not prepared for good things to happen to them that's a good point you know that if you ask for friendship and companionship and you start getting bombarded with invitations are you ready for that are you in a good place to accept these things before you do the spell to get them right sometimes people aren't necessarily always mentally prepared for the good just as much as people aren't always mentally prepared for the bad but you forget that piece of the puzzle you forget that good can be scary and different and you know who likes change yeah so I'm not sitting here after I do any type of working expecting some big Universal Daddy to come down and smack me upside the head because I did it wrong but I am prepared to accept the consequences of a universal daddy well who else is gonna punish you I mean come on but that just gave me a bad visual that had nothing to do with punishment just gave me a good visual that had ever anyway but it's not that kind of podcast showell so whereas that I don't expect that punishment to happen from the Universe I do expect that because I did a hot foot spell so that my coworker will find a new job and get out of here don't be bitching if that if you get the hot foot spell too don't be bitching if it boomerangs back on me which unfortunately hot foot always does what's up with that it always boomerangs on me but sometimes it's worth it it is but be prepared that you might be working by yourself until you find a replacement for that so I am prepared for the consequences of my actions I don't think the universal Sky daddy is going to punish me for them three times I just I'm dying over this Universal Sky damn like I just got I just got this like Zeus looking kind of guy pictured in my head spanking me oh sh okay on that note on that note thank you all so much for listening before we close out I just want to say it has almost our one year anniversary we have just a few episodes to go
