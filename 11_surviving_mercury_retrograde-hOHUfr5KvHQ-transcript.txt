welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hey I'm your host Lea and I am living the Mayhem of retrograde as shell and Mayhem it is indeed Mercury retrograde has brought the pain I just thought since both of us are getting our asses whooped by this Mercury retrograde that maybe we should have a little convo about it today yeah Mercury retrograde has definitely entered the Lexicon in the last few years you know it's all over it's all over to to it's all over Instagram it's all over Facebook and you know all these new baby witchlings are like oh it's Mercury retrograde oh this sounds cool it is not cool people not cool okay like this is whooping me this go around Mercury retrograde is actually a period of time that happens three to four times a year and it is when Mercury the planet which is named for the Roman messenger god like he's the god of communications he's the god of travel Transportation talking contract all of that God of  that's what it Mercury is very fast this planet only takes 88 days to go around the Sun compared to our 365 so there are a few times of year where it's going so fast and we're going so slow that it looks like it's moving backwards the only thing I can think of to kind of explain it a little bit is have you ever been sitting in a parked car and the car next to you moves and you feel like you're moving you're moving yes you're not really that's kind of what's happening with Mercury it doesn't really go backwards it's just because of the speed difference it looks to us like it's moving backwards in the sky and so this is the time of miscommunication travel problems uh problems with the written word the spoken word problems getting into anything and this particular retrograde is occurring in the astrological sign of Taurus which hits us all in the home and in the pocketbook the two places that I am in no mood to be hit right now nobody is are we ever ready to be hit you know in the wallet or in the house no it can also due to and and obviously these are kind of maybe offshoots of communication you know you experience like that hesitation and kind of like blah that like blah I don't even know how to explain it exhaustion ain't the right word tired ain't the right word like you're just like and like things can break down they can break down because of communication or or financially it is H Mercury nowadays doesn't just govern communication and travel it's all about technology computers our phones our work anything to do with anything communication so all of these things all of these systems in our lives you know our calendars and in my case my car is having the world's most mysterious electrical problem well you know like you know how like anecdotes and metaphors so because things have that air of moving backwards there's a lot of symbolism in that of things returning to us going back to things you know what I'm saying oh and karma coming back to us yeah Mercury retrograde isn't really what's causing this I mean we like to blame because that's who we are as a society it's basically Karma saying you didn't sort your out in the first place and because you didn't sort your  out in the first place here we are that happens a lot particularly again because this Mercury retrograde is in Taurus that has a lot to do with Going Back to Basics you know rebuilding kind of you better be stable because when things go backwards if you're not stable you're going to fall over you know it's kind of like you said a little bit karmic kind of that chance to see if you're on Solid Ground see if if where you're at is stable enough to withstand these kind of backwards winds that's a good explanation backwards wins yeah trying to push you backwards right yeah you nailed it backwards wins damn sure and and again it's not literally going backwards but this is a good time to if you're gonna if you're going to get through a Mercury retrograde this is a good time to go back to basics find what makes you feel secure what makes you feel like you're at home when do you feel like you are safe and you feel good and you're grounded this is a good time to look into all of those things and make sure that they they can withstand that type of storm now I did find a good article that I thought it gave some interesting perspective in my opinion and it took apart every zodiac sign and it gave you for your zodiac sign because that's the rage nowadays you know it gave you what could be the magic of this particular retrograde versus what could be the Mayhem of this particular retrograde for you and your as rological sign oh I'm curious so not that I'm going to go through all of them obviously well you're going to go through ours I was to say I am gonna I'm gonna touch on yours and mine for any of you Geminis out there first of all I feel you it hurts right now I know we're in this together but the Mayhem part for Geminis for this particular one we are sharp-minded people and we are scattered as right now so it is best for folks like us to focus on one thing at a time time don't put major plans in motion right now come on Geminis we know there's a time in place this is not the time nor the place we need to go over our intentions and and and definitely pay extra attention to money human error happens especially with money and facts and figures when do we not have to pay attention to money I mean come on more so now more so now more so now Lord but for you and your beautiful Aquarian Folk [Laughter] let's see now I do have to say I'm I am hopeful I was hopeful going into this that it wouldn't be too bad of a Mercury retrograde for me seeing as my beloved is a Taurus and so I was kind of hopeful that this would just be a you know reconnecting to Hearth and Home maybe doing a bunch of spring cleaning you know kind of settling in and taking care of that aspect but no no it has been nothing but electrical problems and communication problems and terrible terrible news left and right listen to the Mayhem for the Aquarius folk and I kind of laugh at this because the when I'm reading this all I can think of is poor Lila oh my god oh no be careful of expecting too much from people and becoming resentful when they don't meet your expectations or rise to your standards damn damn sounds like I'm going to be a little yeah right you are going to try to overwork yourself and take on too much oh surprise and you need to force yourself to take a break to recuperate also surprise that's why I said I feel bad because this is like so you and and again something you're not good at you need to play it safe during this retrograde I don't even know what that means I know you need to not forget to have a life balance in part of your chaotic life right now you're doing too much you're doing too too much working in the office a long time and partying till dawn for a long time both can take their toll and you need to find the balance I would like to have that partying till dawn part you know I think that the working all hours has been a little bit much so finding the balance is going to be hard I I would like that and the and the final piece of Mayhem for our dear Aquarius folk is don't get yourself all wound up and worrying about things that you probably don't even have any control of that's all we do we worry about everything that we don't have control of because I'm pretty sure we have control of everything there is a flip side the St Al Doom and Gloom you know just because Mercury's retrograde doesn't mean like your life is over there is a magical aspect and there is a positive aspect so as much as I I'm giving you your Downer dose of Mayhem the Aquarius magic part is actually really good teamwork is favorable right now for Aquarius folk during this retrograde and hey Teamwork Makes the Dream workor man you do have the ability in this period to understand other people's positions and viewpoints so that's not a bad thing um because in turn that builds strong relationships how can that be bad anything that is creative or artistic you're going to give extra energy to in this period they say but you do need to re-evaluate your daily routine and include things that enhance your mind body and spirit I love that you said re-evaluate because Jake register in the cosm said something that I really liked they said you need to review rework and redo those areas of life that are ruled by that planet so Mercury controlling communication travel and Tech you know we really need to work on that so like you were saying this is a good time to revisit those things and and really kind of sit with your finances you know sit with your relationships are you spending too much money on Amazon are you going out to eat too often you know are you trying to save for something and you've lost sight of that you know use this time to kind of go over those things again and and really be careful because you kind of have to look at things twice when Mercury is in retrograde because you it's so easy to make a mistake so now's a time to remember remember to go slow and to just really look at those things twice you know revisit resit you know those it's funny you say that because I was going to go to the magic part of of the retrograde for Geminis and that is exactly everything you just said for the Gemini folk the Magic's in the money if us Geminis are feeling bogged down or confused by our finances now is the time to review make Corrections and change your plan get  in order it's a good time to you know review how you're spending and saving your cash do some self-awareness work it's funny because for Geminis it's all about refocusing your financial Affairs really the retrograde can kind of affect people differently it really can depending on what sign it's in and what sign you are you know I believe this retrograde in Taurus affects Taurus aquarians uh Scorpio everybody well affects those four the most um but it does affect everybody but it does affect different signs differently at different times of the year so you kind of got to pay attention to that a little bit I've always looked at retrogrades as a time to just go slower I've always kind of bouncing from thing to thing and it's good for me to have a reminder to sit with things a little bit longer to look at them more than once to pay a little bit closer attention to things so it doesn't always have to be this everything is breaking down and everything is going bad it can be an excellent time to reflect to kind of go a little slower and pay attention to whatever that particular season is in this case it's Taurus so it's home and finances you know take your time with that and and just spend each retro grade kind of reflecting on you know that particular retrogrades meaning you know and use it thankfully I don't think the next one's like August so so we have a little time to recover So I myself am having a wild retrograde moment and I don't know how to explain it other than to say that it's Mercury retrograde but I drove my car driving beautifully almost brand new car and it wouldn't start wasn't a battery problem it wasn't an anything problem got it taken to the G communication problem the people that towed it and the first place that took it lost my information and had the wrong phone number and then they gave my information to the new garage who then lost all that information until I finally called them who then lost my information again until they were called by the first garage I can't even follow this story it's so convoluted and difficult only to find out yeah only to find out that now my car does start but it's got some weird electrical issues issue that they've never seen and have no idea what it is and are having a hard time tracing it down so I'm very hopeful that this gets resolved quickly but it's one of those kind of mysterious things that just popped up and has had nothing but communication issues on something that you'd think is very straightforward and in this case it's just a can of worms of miscommunication and Tech difficulties I'm on a roller coaster ride that I didn't get in line for sign up for or buy a ticket for you too that's where I'm at that's right I I didn't sign up for this ride folks but I did want to make a point that there has been some jabber on the internet people were wondering and theorizing about if this retrograde was adversely affected by the solar eclipse that happened what was that like April 19th April 20th um right around the time we went right into retrograde no is probably my my best answer and I'm sure you know you ask a 100 people you might get a 100 different answers but my opinion on that is that the solar eclipse just yeah there was there was a close proximity but I I think they're irrelevant of one another there is solar eclipse energy in and of itself I will give you that but retrogrades are their own Beast I don't think there's a correlation do you have an opinion on that I am not an astrologist so I don't really know if the solar eclipse would affect that in any way I would personally think that a solar eclipse you know would have an effect on people just like a retrograde would have an effect on people but I don't honestly know if they would affect each other so I would have to ask an astrologist that unfortunately I don't know if we have any astrologists that are listening if you have an opinion I'd like to know because I I don't think so but you know who am I I'm just shell I had seen a couple things on Instagram or people thought that it was more intense that this retrograde was more intense because of that solar eclipse because the solar eclipse was in the southern hemisphere for those who don't know we did not get blessed with seeing that here in the northern hemisphere April whatever 1920 there was a a solar eclipse in the Southern Hemisphere and Mercury went retrograde on April 21st right after that right now yeah they were like a day or so apart I do think that they both have their own energy but I don't necessarily think they correlate because this retrograde was anticipated to be a show from the get-go it's the first one of 2023 right and it's one that hits you hard and in you know home and finances ouch no one likes that exactly that's big for everybody so and and it affects everybody there's nobody who isn't affected by home and finance so I don't know I could be wrong but I don't think there's a correlation but people just thought because there was only a day or two gap between the two that there was some one affecting the other I think I'm with you I would have to say that I don't know enough to have a real opinion but I know that they both affect people is it possible that they could affect each other it's possible but I don't know so please anyone who's an astrologist let us know yeah back on the broomstick gmail.com send us in any information and if you have a Mercury retrograde story of your own send it to us and let us know back on the broomstick gmail.com if someone put you in line for the roller coaster and you didn't buy a ticket we feel you CA shell is there she is right there with you right now Lord but you know as with anything honestly it's what you make of it it's what you make of it and if you want to make it if you want to let it turn into some epic show then it's going to and if you want to kind of find that silver lining and just roll with the punches it'll be less painful and sometimes that that's hard I get it trust me especially right now I do think there is a sense of it's all what you make of it too it really can be and there's also sometimes when you have absolutely zero control over it I would say from the moment that mercury went retrograde for me this year April 21st through now the end of April beginning of May it has been nothing but for me I have had nothing but bad news bad news bad news bad luck bad luck bad luck Tech problems with my car problems with my computers everything is just going wrong and so knowing this knowing that all of this is in Taurus and in home I've made a conscious effort to pamper the out of myself I have decided that my self-care my magical routine for this Mercury retrograde is going to be nesting I'm going to wear my fluffiest robe around the house I'm going to make my altar beautiful and Sparkle and Lush and and I'm going to bring in flowers and I'm going to do all the things financially responsible you know I'm going to do a little thrifting I'm going to do things that make me happy I'm going to spoil myself responsibly and I'm going to take care of myself because I know that this is a shitty time of year until May 14th when this retrograde is over and so I'm going to take extra special time to take care of myself and the people that I love I got a haircut that's how I tried to do it self-care I think that is the magic that we all need right now to kind of counteract all the crap that's going on with Mercury retrograde in Taurus we need to reclaim that Taurus energy that go a little bit slower pay a little bit more attention smell the flowers you know literally it is Springtime take a moment and smell the flowers take care of yourself if you're having a shitty time like shell and I are right now I mean the blows just keep coming like every time my phone rings I just want to vomit yeah I Flinch every time I don't want to hear any more bad news I'm over it and so because of that I need to take a little bit more time with myself with my children with my spouse and make sure that we're taking care of ourselves emotionally and physically and so magically I'm doing more meditations I'm doing more sitting out in nature and trying to breathe and to connect because those are the ways I mean literal grounding we're talking Taurus here people sit on the ground under a tree do it but I think the flip side of that and where I'm kind of finding myself is like this one this one's bad and it's hard to grab hold of the rains and get under control and like I can't even get it together when the bow takes off it's very stubborn and hard to control can get their together to meditate right now like come on like I I I'm trying I had a hard enough time getting my together to record today yeah so it's not even just like regular day to day that's in chaos it's like even my magical life is in chaos and like I'm just I'm just I'm just trying to grab hold of them rains man I'm just trying to maintain you ever been drunk at a country bar riding the mechanical bull that's oddly specific shell I feel like I know right I feel like right now this Mercury retrograde is like riding a mechanical bull it really feels like that our asses are just hanging on for dear life yep all we can do is try to take care of ourselves as best that we can and when we fall and we will fall yeah hard yeah so I'm trying to make that Landing softer and then when I get back up on the bowl my nails are nicer for when I'm gripping onto the back of it right right right you're gonna come back up on that bowl after this retrograde period of beauty queen well I wouldn't go that far but I am trying to take care of myself a little bit because you have to you know you have to go slower go slower right now watch your finances and take care of yourself be a little gentler with yourself just remember this too shall pass as my mother would say it really would and I've noticed that you know as I'm cleaning my magical tools and kind of redoing my Altar for this time of year it's very Crystal Centric it's very Rock Centric earthy very earthy yeah I think I need that grounding and spending time with that has been really nice holding those crystals the heaviness and you know this actually goes back to a point from our last episode about belane about how talked about this was the first time our community would be outside the first time the first time your bare feet on the ground and in the grass and that first like physical connection with the Earth again for the year I'm very excited for that that will be coming up right after this episode so I can't wait for future me to go be enjoying that I need that I need that connection I can't wait for future me to be enjoying this retrograde being done oh I'm so looking forward to this being done I I think it'll be interesting going back to that old Pagan Community for belan during this retrograde you know that Community is currently having a Resurgence of Revival much like paganism itself is having a Revival and you know I'm kind of curious to see what that means I myself am back after a long period of not being here the community's renewal it's a lot of renewal in one place it could be really great it could go poor so we shall see I'm I'm heavily leaning towards the it's I'm a poana anyway but i'm heavily leaning towards the it's going to go wonderfully side well my hope and my goal is that I will be able to meet you there but as you know my retrograde has been booting me in the beeh to the point where I might be rolling into town a second too late but I'm gonna try I'm gonna try I love that so we will definitely do a bunch of that so yeah pamper yourself don't go over board with this money spending but pamper yourself right now and take things into perspective take things into perspective and review renew you know all those r words we used yeah and if you don't have time or are not in the headp space to meditate like shell said at least breathe go sit against a tree sit on a rock redo your altar make it a little Crystal and Earth heavy and take that minute to yourself and breathe if you can you know that's the best way to align yourself and connect and Center yourself we all need that right now this retrograde is kicking a lot of people's asses if it's going great for you more power to you may it continue may we all learn your secrets but if it's not we are with you sister I'm here we you and I hope we all get through it better people on the other end hopefully lord I can't get any worse oh don't say that knock on wood don't temp face I'm not knocking on wood for all I'm worth over here so folks just just remember May 14th we can make it I'm going to make it you're going to make it we're all going to make it and we don't even have to think about it again until August oh yes and then let the summer begin so so here's to all of us making it through to May 14th we will see you next Friday for back on the broomstick when we are more of the way through and hopefully things will be looking up we hopefully see the light at the end of the Mercury retrograde time by that point I was going to say hopefully we're on the last flipping tunnel of this roller coaster R I don't like this roller coaster I want to get off so please if you have any ideas for things that you would like us to talk about if you have any questions any tips um send them in to back onthe broomstick gmail.com and uh we look forward to hearing from you thank you everyone who has sent us in saying how much you like the show we
