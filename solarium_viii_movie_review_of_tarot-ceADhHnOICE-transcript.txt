all right one two three play okay why does every horror movie start with a campfire it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi and welcome to the solarium shell and 's Moonlight filed herb garden where we put away our Dusty Grims Stow our scrying mirrors and put our cauldrons to good use growing delicious tea and popping popcorn the nights are getting chillier and a little bit longer the spooky season is almost upon us it's the perfect time of year to turn our attention to cloaks hot cocoa and spooky stories this was super super fun what we did is we had a we had a zoom date with Netflix involved we watched and are going to talk about today tarot now tarot is a brand new 20124 supernatural horror film directed by Spencer Cohen and Anna halberg now apparently this is based on a 1992 novel horror horror scope I didn't realize that until today but yeah a listener had mentioned to us a while back when this was in theaters that this movie was coming out and it was based on tarot cards and we had a few people write in and say you guys should watch this and tell us if it's going to be absolutely crappy if it's going to do tarot dirty should we go see it and do we need to be mad so we tried to stay away from any spoilers and go into it clean Sate actually we did we did pretty good actually it's because we were both super busy yeah and behind on everything so I'm going to give a little disclaimer right here I am about a month and a half behind on everything same so if you have messaged us on Instagram or Facebook or send us an email and you have not heard back from us if I owe you a tarot reading if I'm supposed to mail you something I'm behind and I'm getting there I promise we just have been we've been having like crazy it's been a month it really has it has and we're getting back on on track with responses so hang tight we're going to get back to you just be patient with us we're on it it's just us two yeah seasonal disclaimer that this whole thing is put on just by shell and I we do everything so it's a lot we're a staff of two we're a staff of two and we're giving ourselves bonuses I swear no I don't know anyway give you I'll give I'll give you a raise if you give me a raise all right yes all right so a 10% raise of zero dollars is is zero so anyway this movie I you know I feel like I watched too many horror movies so I kind of was like uh another horror movie based on tarot and I kind of went into this thinking what are they going to do to make tarot evil once again maybe that's me being biased but that was kind of that was what I went into it with I went in I've never seen a movie where tarot was part of the plot or especially not even the main part of the plot I've seen I mean a million and one different Ouija board horror movies but I don't think I've ever seen one where tarot cards were part of it so this was new for me so I was curious first of all to see what deck they were going to use and secondly if they were going to get anything right at all okay let's start with the deck because let's just get that right out of the way right from the get go so we haven't gotten into any spoilers yet but we're just going to tell you right now that this whole episode is going to be spoiler filled so if you don't want to have tarot spoiled for you turn this off stop now so the Tarot deck this is not an actual deck this was created specifically for the movie The main cards that you see were created by an artist named Richard Wells who goes by slippery Jack on social media now I have a feeling let's just put this out there I have a feeling this will end up being a deck people are asking for it all over people are already asking for it so you know I am sure that that will be coming down the pike but today as of right now this is not currently a deck very maab deck it looks hand drawn hand painted on Old Paper and it's it's a little twisted think slightly abstract like an abstract painting you know they're not exactly proportionate they don't line up like the people's bodies aren't they're little contorted and odd places it gives it a very disconcerting and unsettling feeling lots of skeletony type people yeah very very scary scary deck my first response to you was I want to get my hands on that deck for my collection same because that's just you know that's just my addiction so I'm sure if it comes out I will get it but I think that it would be an interesting deck for the right person if it were a real deck and I do imagine it will at some point in time in the future be a real deck in this movie they right away start out with combining tarot and astrology and they do explain it the main character Haley played by Harriet Slater yeah Haley is the reader everyone in this friend group seems to know that she's the one that knows how to read tarot cards she starts out saying that she combines tarot and astrology and conveniently enough there is a large astrology reading cloth that she can use to lay the tarot cards down on okay I like the fact that portions of mixing the tarot and astrology that I thought were pretty kickass loved it spot on let's do this absolutely well we were just talking to Dave Zilla about his tarot of The Unexplained where he has astrological symbols in quite a few of the cards but especially in the major Arcana and we talked about how there's a generally accepted Golden Dawn version of of what cards go with which astrological signs and people have different views but it's generally accepted that they kind of do mix a little bit in some symbology so that part of it made sense to me but I'm going to read your stars by using the cards was just a little far and when somebody took out the deck and said read our horoscopes I I cringed so hard I just about fell off my chair I mean just I couldn't I couldn't I was like what the holy it was so cheesy I mean okay maybe what they were doing seemed pretty good and and quote unquote authentic but like their verbage and how they were describing it I was like sweet baby Jesus what is going on here they obviously did not have like a witch or like any sort of knowing person on set giving them any sort of like background slippery Jack the guy that created the deck seems to kind of at least know a little bit what he was doing he does have a folklore book out so I'm guessing he had a little bit of an idea behind the cards that he created but it really seemed seems like they did not consult any type of witch or Pagan tarot reader at all hey witches future Lea here actually the producers of the movie tarot did consult with a Tarot reader SL astrologer and her name is Angie biki Angie beni's bio says that she's a high-profile entertainment publicist turned tarot card reader to the Stars what started as a hobby is now a full-time job and lifestyle she has a website I'm not sure how much of her advice The Producers did or did not take so do with that information what you will future Lea out now you and I both when Haley first put the cloth down actually she first said a dumb line that I do not want to get picked up by Tik Tok and repeated she said it's kind of an unspoken rule that you don't read with someone else's deck and they've made this line to be like some magical mystical wisdom of the ages and that's just like you don't touch other people's [ __ ] like just general knowledge that's not some esoteric Proclamation it's no metaphysical Manifesto just like you don't touch my Tarot deck you don't freaking touch my wallet or you know you don't you don't grab someone's computer without asking or their phone either you know why is it different because it's a Tarot deck yeah I'm G to be just as pissed off if you take my phone like what exactly ex so there's no like Mystic thing here it's just generally accepted you shouldn't it's Bad Manners might not work for you and if there's a curse on it it's always a bad idea don't touch other people [ __ ] period no matter what it is there you go then then it's not a problem now I just wanted to point out that conveniently they find this deck in like a Airbnb esque type house yeah you know you got you got this group of friends let's back up a second you got this group of friends they go away for the weekend they're in like this Airbnb esque type place in the cat SKS of New York shocking I feel like every movie in the cat skills people end up dying luckily they find this Tarot deck and happen to have a Tarot reader in the friend group and there's happens to be an astrology cloth around it now what are your thoughts on if you found a box with symbols all over it on opening it so you see this box a wooden box and it's got a pentacle on it with symbols all around it do you open it or do you not open it let's let's let's throw out the window are we being honest yeah we are being honest [ __ ] maybe I guess it would really depend I'm probably on the maybe fence too not I'm on the maybe fence because if it was at your house or an obviously witchy house [ __ ] no I'm not going near that I'm not touching that that's their [ __ ] I I don't not without reading The Energy first or at all if it's just like some random house like maybe okay here's my head Cannon they're in a big huge house in the cat skills it looked like somebody's Rich summer house right because it was stocked and and it looked like obviously a house like lived in it did not look like a hotel right right so it's obviously some rich person's summer house there's a room marked private do not enter and it's padlocked and they of course break the door down and go in well yeah wouldn't you no that I would not do I'm too much of a goody to shoes I'm not breaking down any doors looking for alcohol of all [ __ ] things they had weed the stoner guy Paxton had weed anyway I'm getting ahead of my oh by the way there was also the token Stoner in the movie that was spot on there was and I'm like the stoner better live you literally that the whole movie I know people don't like Jacob batalon who played Paxton some people do some don't I'm in the camp of I think he's adorable I love him as Ned and Spider-Man whatever I don't care hate me whatever um but I think he's great and I I wanted the stoner to live so they're looking for alcohol even though they have weed whatever they break in this door and in this normal house in this locked room looks like this person is a collector of weird and unusual things there's like a like a madam Zar type thing I think I I think I literally said it looked like an antique store bedroom yeah it looks like somebody just collects esoteric [ __ ] stop talking about my house like that if it was in the Thousand Islands I would totally believe it was your house so the stoner of course is the one that finds the box with all the symbols on it now if this was the case if we if my friend had broken in this room and I of course you know oh no we shouldn't be doing this and go in anyway and we're looking around and it just looks like a bunch of collector junk yeah I think I'd open it I'd be like that looks like a Tarot box and that's got some Vibes coming off of it however and here's your witchy tip listeners maybe they should have checked the energy of that box right like wouldn't you do that would you at the very least have picked that up and like this feels wrong right the energy feels off so the tip is check the Vibes of any type of magical tool before you use it right you know maybe it needs a cleansing or maybe it's not for you right right trust that instinct like there was one point where Haley opened the box and like a breeze blew through the room and you could tell everyone was visibly uncomfortable that's your clue people that's your red flag right there maybe we shouldn't [ __ ] with this like I understand there's [ __ ] around and find out but then there's naive man yeah exactly so yeah if the Vibes are off no I wouldn't open it but if I just found some random tarot box yeah I probably would open it now there's the third Factor it was the stoner who found it you've been high before you know sometimes you just are like hey let me do this and then you're like oh I shouldn't have done that are you trying to say that as a stone person I might grab that deck and use it maybe it's possible but that reminds me that I want to get into the stoner character Paxton because while this movie was a lot of fun it had so many plot holes still fun don't get me wrong but they could have done it way better and one of the ways is with the character Paxton like they practically wrote it into the movie and just did nothing with it okay let me explain spoiler the tarot cards are possessed by a woman who had been an astrologer tarot reader hundreds of years ago and she tells a fortune that comes true in a horrible way and so the person that she told it about gets revenge on her in a horrible way and she curses the cards kills herself and possesses them so now anyone who uses these cards or rather anyone who gets their cards read not anyone who uses them who gets their cards red is cursed to die now in this particular next scene the the main character uh Haley the tarot reader person they open the deck they find its tarot so she decides she wants to give everybody what she calls a hor horoscope reading yeah she's gonna read their horoscopes with the cards because it's the one girl's birthday El saying it's my birthday right so she lays down this beautiful cloth you know actually I wish I had one not going to lie and and does kind of this wheel of the year or astrological spread at first when we first got into the movie we saw that it was 12 cards and we were like is that like a wheel of the Year spread right so she You Know She lays out for basically each sign in the Zodiac and then in the center she put a significator card basically that's where things get twisty turny for each of these people in the friend group who gets the reading is the significator card is the card that kind of attaches to them so you have aise whose birthday it was she gets the high priestess Lucas the ex-boyfriend gets the hermit meline gets the hangedman Paige the magician Paxton the fool Grant the devil and Haley did a reading for herself and she gets the death card so yes they all had 13 cards but it's the significator card that comes into play for each of these people she said what each person's zodiac sign was and I think she started their wheel on their sign I think so yeah and then went counterclockwise around the Zodiac wheel so you got to see quite a few of the cards not the whole deck but you got to see quite a few of the cards and they're very scary looking you know they're definitely very on the dark side I want it just saying oh yeah that and the cloth so screen gems alloy entertainment Sony Pictures we're telling you right now the deck and the cloth please put it out do it just do it people would buy it just because it's interesting a lot of decks especially lately seem to be very fluffy and fairy and light and beautiful and and I love them I think they're great but you know there's something to be too yeah especially this time of year we're all looking for a little bit of that you know hallow season for dark tarot yeah so why not I have been okay tangent I have been kind of addicted to looking at Kickstarter tarot decks lately oh do tell there are some gorgeous and interesting things out there and I'm super excited I have to be very careful because I'm just going to be like funding all of them I already have six on a watch list that I think are fantastic but anyway you know as she was reading everybody's cards you and I both were popping up with that means they're going to die this way and this means they're going to die that way this is where the movie became every other horror movie you know in your life where you have a group of friends they're all doing something and all of a sudden everybody starts getting picked off one by one but I liked the interesting ways that like they made those tarot cards kind of come to life yes that was so much fun The Hermit card even I was like w loved that you know the particular way each of those little vignettes of the how the people were killed by their their major Arina Spirit were fantastic yeah the hermit was so good I had two that I thought were very clearly the spookiest okay do tell don't say it out loud yet but can you think of the two you think were the spookiest yeah yeah all right so I'm GNA tell you my two and then you tell me if that kind of compares to yours okay so the first one I thought was super [ __ ] spooky was the fool just because I thought like this is a creepy clown and he just kept kind of shadowing Paxton and showing up it's that kind of blink he's closer blink he's closer you know the door is Clos and it was that creepy laugh every time so I just thought that that was very well done and very creepy but the scariest one by far to me was the magician and the magician killed Paige who was played by the actress avona Paige's death at the hands of the magician was gory it was scary it was awful it was a horrible way to die that was just bad so how about you what were your two scariest okay I again I'm going to agree with you on the fool it was unsettling very it it was like all I could think of remember back in the day when I had that wonderfully awesome kitty cat Salem remember how he would like kind of he wouldn't kill the mouse but he would like wound it and then like almost bat it around and toy with it and watch it suffer but not really let it die that's how I felt that the fool was in here like he was batting Paxton around like a wounded Mouse with a cat yeah but the hermit Shook Me The Hermit was scary I felt like he was hurting that guy I felt like he was controlling the darkness to almost suffocate his existence it was like I don't know the hermit shook me just you know how like in that that tunnel where everything just went dark dark dark dark dark dark dark oh that hallway when when he first saw him and he came there and and then each light in the hallway got dark that creeped me out so bad that dark was just like coming after him yeah the hermit was definitely the one for me because it was like the darkness itself was the hermit even though the lantern was even a little further away but the darkness itself and it was like he's coming coming coming coming coming coming coming and I just ah I was sh yeah no very scary they did an excellent job they were very fun it reminded me of old school jump scare horror with some really good creepy factors in there and and in that vein they really brought those particular cards to life in a very awesome Bravo kind of way yeah I would not say that they got the meanings of the cards correct like if you listen to Haley in the beginning when she's doing the readings she doesn't exactly get the meanings of the cards right she doesn't even exactly get the astrology right and I'm no astrologer and I caught some of that so even if the cards aren't exactly accurate the characters were creepy they were interesting the death scenes were scary I think they did a good job with at least that part of it you know like we both agreed on at the beginning of this they definitely did not have any sort of expert whatsoever like on the set giving assistance future Leila popping in to remind you that yes oddly yes they did it's a horror movie you know they don't they don't get anything right they don't get Ouija boards right they don't Catholicism right I mean I didn't go into this expecting them to get it right right but they did it right enough that it was kind of believable right it was interesting how they had combined the tarot and the astrology together that wasn't made up for this film that's been around for a very long time there have even been astrological spreads like the one that they used in the movie that have been in use for decades at least however you are absolutely required to swallow down a few times the plot holes the leaps of faith that they take the the [ __ ] your skepticism you have to right because you're like really really a couple times you just have to be like all right fine I'm gonna go with it because it's more fun that way right but like some of the things I'm talking about is something that you and your beloved mentioned right at the very beginning you're like is this Boston where are all the people I'm like I on that bridge not too long ago man is this like Boston after an apocalypse or something pretty much there was quite a few comments looking for where the crowds were like how is this so empty because everything was empty there were no people anywhere in this movie it's like they had to have filmed that in like downtown Boston Christmas Day when everybody was like opening their gifts at 8:00 a.m. or something because otherwise I don't know how you did it people Bravo or it was AI so part of what they had to do why they had to do that I think is because the tarot Spirits could not get you if someone else was there and if the lights were on I I grew up thinking that about ghosts right we all kind of believe that it's like a very childlike idea of ghost but it works right but to do so they had to like completely empty out Boston but again back to Paxton which I think is a thread that they should have followed and they didn't in the beginning when everybody is getting their cards read he is the only person to say no and not get his cards read Haley says hey you want your card red PA in and he's like I'm going to go and he leaves and goes to the bathroom and then he opens the front door and sees the spirit of the astrologer he's the first person to see her before his cards ever get read and he turns the light on and she's gone and so he doesn't think anything of it but Paxton found the cards Paxton first saw the ghost Paxton's one of the few people that Haley doesn't know his sign she seems to know all of her friends as I mean I know you're a Gemini so I guess it's not that far-fetched but he also was the one that kind of had to get peer pressured into a reading but you know that's your karma dude you found the box and brought it out don't know what to tellou right maybe and he got the fool he got the fool reversed the first card in the deck I don't know I just think there's something there with him and big spoiler big big big spoiler here I'm just telling you right now people big spoiler at the end the only people to live are Haley her boyfriend uh Grant played by Aiden Bradley and Paxton who manages to survive the fool how does he survive the fool show so this part was kind of upsetting to me because you know everybody has a major fear in their life and my fear is plunging to my death so spoiler alert Piston's in this elevator and the fool is [ __ ] with him and I'm like this kid is going this elevator's going to [ __ ] just go and he's going to plunge and ah we were convinced we were convinced that that's how he was going to die but they don't show you that they just show you like you know that Stoner cow he's like laying on the floor curled up in the corner screaming for for everything he's got in him and then it moves on to the next story plot WRA back around when he shows back up remember these Spirits can't be around if another person's around and his friend opened the door and The Light Came his roommate uh yeah his roommate so because his friend showed up and there was actual lights back on it kind of banished the fool so to say temporarily and he was able to get away while his friends then did what Leila like everybody does at the end of a movie while his friends managed to figure out how to break the curse on these cards and she's able to go off and be in the afterlife and now the cards are just cards yeah her spirit was able to move on the curse was lifted did only three friends make it out at the end a lot better than a Friday the 13th movie though yeah instead of just the one it was a three but of course it was the two lovers and the stoner you got your wish made it I got my wish I was very happy but we called those three you know the stoner granted was just a wish on my part but we called them right from the beginning right very very predictable movie absolutely but as far as the way tarot was depicted there were times where I was just like are you [ __ ] kidding me but overall I'd have to give it a relatively positive I'm not saying accurate don't confuse positive with accurate but it overall I think my view of how tarot was portrayed was was relatively positive for a horror movie where the major Arcana come kill you agreed I don't think they ever portrayed it as the tarot itself as being evil that was never never seemed to be playing on the the hot ticket of cursing yeah there was a curse and this is the problem so that being said shell you and I and a bunch of our friends rent a house in the cat skills we go looking for weed and whiskey in the basement and manage to find an old Tarot deck are you kidding me do you even have to ask me this question so of course we do readings for everyone and each other now to break a curse what are some things that we could have or they could have done you know say you do want to read these cards what are some things we could do like let's go there okay now first things first if you and I were together in a house and found a Tarot deck like that even if we agreed to use them which we probably would unless there was a super negative vibe going on you and I would cast a circle do that whole create a a Sacred Space sort of thing I don't know if we'd cleanse the cards or not I think that I'd like to say we would but we probably that would be situational I'm going to air on side of no but I think you and I would at least create some sacred safe space so that if we did unleash some demonic hell upon ourselves or the Earth we at least had some Sacred Circle cast then try to deal with it I don't know you know you [ __ ] around and find out but at least you got a plan for how to how to how tole your mess up you know you have a container and I like how you said that because that reminds me in the movie they do again willing suspension of disbelief here they managed to find the one astrologer tarot reader in the world who has dealt with these cards in the past and she knows how to yeah she is the person who read the cards for a bunch of people who died and the only reason she lived is because she didn't read them for herself just for everyone else and they all died so she's now spent decades studying magic and these cards blah blah blah you do see her in circles she's like there's three circles and symbols so she at least does that part right right and so they do show that and what a circle can do for you if you're working with negative energies is it becomes a container right I know we talk about Practical Magic you remembering that you remember that part where everybody all the women have their brooms right and they put the circle up yes and then the bad Spirit runs into this invisible wall and bounces back because they've created a circle they've created a container and that's why the woman Alma astrum played by olwin Fu the tarot astrologer woman that they just happened to find she tells them not to cross the circle because once you cross it you've broken it so she's created the Sacred Space to keep that energy inside to try and deal with it and so that's exactly something that we would do as well yeah that's where shell would start to break out the high magic and we'd start to like act write stuff on the floor and get serious about this [ __ ] I like okay we're going to [ __ ] around and find out but can we at least do it like a semi- propop way right you know that's when you're going to want your black salt that's when you're going to want your protective herbs you're going to want to get your grimoire or your book out that's got protection magic and protection spells in it you know you're going to want these things around so yeah this is when you're going to want to break out the real deal protection stuff going on but yeah I do it just in a proper manner yeah so here you go say we find a deck and The Vibes aren't too bad but we're like you know what let's let's cast a circle and let's cleanse this deck and see what happens I have a smokable spell for you shell to do that okay do tell take cannabis because that is an excellent way to purify anything and to impart some sacredness to it not to mention we generally have it on us when we're out and about like that that's right it's generally an herb I have in abundance and on me regularly which is always a benefit but I would say get one that is high in the turpy of lemon and pinene because those two tpes are known for being uplifting cleansing uh they can help you get into meditative or magical space they're very good for banishing and creating Sacred Space think lemons and pine lemon is like the lemon one right and lemon and citrus definitely help with Clarity with Focus uh with cleansing you know that's something that can help with cleansing and pining uh is very reminiscent of Pine and Pine Needles and pine can be used in cleansing hex breaking getting rid of ghost uh lemon cello is a cannabis cultivar that is high in both of those tpin so if you do that and then if you throw in a little bit of Rosemary which is good for hex breaking and getting rid of ghosts a little bit of clove a little bit of mug wart again both of those are great for cleansing and mug wart is really good to help open your psychic abilities so if you mix all that together in a bowl or in a joint and you know inhale that with the intention of imbuing your own power and your own energy and cleansing out anything that's already on those cards or that object so smoke that in mix that spell in your lungs and then breathe that energy out onto the cards and do that three times or seven times and that is a really good way to cleanse the cards and to help start to attune them to you and then shuffle them bad boys then Shuffle those [ __ ] right now your third eyes open you're all awakened anyways got some good sacred cleanse space going on go for it but honestly those cars if that was a hex like that was upon the cars not that I've ever encountered anything like that in real life but a hex like that I would imagine would have a pretty heavy negative energy to it yeah and if if we were feeling that kind of thing we'd be like huh maybe we should set that right B back where we found it yeah I think so too be like you know that one doesn't feel quite right and you know that's like when we were hanging out in Salem we went to Oldtown Salem and visited a lot of the old sites most of it as you and I were walking through we could feel the weight of History you know it was interesting but there were very few things where we actually felt like energy or Spirit or anything like that but when we did we both felt it at the same time and the one I'm thinking of in particular was the doll the puppet that was that was that was an object in one of the historical homes that we both had you could feel The Vibes coming off of it and so if you can feel something so much so that other people are feeling the same thing you are then that's something you might want to pay attention to and you know work accordingly I guess no touchy no touchy no touchy yeah that's not a doll I'd play with overall would you say worth your time watching was it a good movie would you recom overall would you say this was a good movie would you recommend it what's your thoughts oh um well I would say that it was a fun watch it was not a good movie it was very formulaic after we watched it I read a couple reviews where people said they thought like the opening scene was written by Ai and honestly I could almost kind of see it it was very predictable and there was at least half a dozen times where you had to just be like that could never okay I'm G to go with it this is what I like to call hokey horror it was fun though I liked it and I I did like it and I had a good time watching it I was happy with the Death Scenes I guess they were they were interesting they were different how about you what did you think hokey horror it was very a very hokey movie but I've seen worse horror movies how about that yeah there were worse I've seen worse acting I've seen worse plot holes but I wouldn't put this on the level of the freaking original Exorcist by any stretch but you know I I'd give it a if you're looking for a fun horror movie the plus side for me is there wasn't a lot of blood and guts like I don't I don't need to see your blood and guts splattered I don't I'm not that person and that pleased me so if you don't like blood and guts good movie but you're not going to get scared it's not like you're not going to sleep at night light horror yeah it was fun interesting good jump scares creepy enough that I covered my eyes a couple times but not so bad that like you said you couldn't sleep at night or you know it was more interesting the ending I think almost ruined it for me because it was just a little too unbelievable you were just happy that the stoner lived I was happy the stoner lived but the whole Paxton storyline had a lot of plot holes from the very beginning but also a lot of interesting side tangents that I don't think that they explored or if they had explored would have made for a better movie and it would have also made the ending more believable and a little scarier to be honest all right I see the look on your face shell let me explain if they had made it where Paxton had set this whole thing up I would have bought that and it would have been a cooler ending Paxton is the one that's into all these horror and crime podcasts Paxton is the one who suggested they search the house Paxton is the one that found the tarot cards and suggested they use it Paxton is the first one to see the ghost Paxon is the only person in the history of these [ __ ] cards to live and somehow Paxton made the 4our and 11 minute drive back to get them super fast I'm not sure how that worked out but anyway are you right in like a part two to this like what are you doing I almost wish they had because you know as I was rewatching it trying to get like pictures of the cards and stuff there's so much with Paxton that they did not develop and I'm going to show you something else that I thought was really cool I caught this the first time we watched it when Paxton went back to his dorm room did you catch they lingered on the billboard did you catch that billboard at all no I remember seeing it but I don't remember I remember you making a comment but I remember see being like I don't know what she's talking about the bulletin board in his dorm room is covered with things that suggest Taurus the fool you're dead take the bull by the horns it's just like related stuff so related it's because he's the one who found the box even more interesting than the fact that this bulletin board has so much stuff about the fool and Taurus and Death on it it also foreshadows that he's going to live if you look here you see it says looking for a roommate need help here for you I got you help haunted murder musical take the bll by the horns astrology lecture yeah is my roommate a fool there's the [ __ ] Fool's face right there okay here it is again here it is again so they actually suggest right here on this bulletin board that his roommate is going to help him right you catch weird things I would never have that isn't that funny so I'll post this picture on the thing but yeah so I don't know I just just thought that there was this whole Pax and thing that could have been something different I don't know so we definitely want the Tarot deck we also want the um astrology mat yeah so they need to make that that about covers it so I think it was good how about rewatchability would you be able to rewatch this movie I'd rewatch it if I didn't have anything else compelling on Netflix sure yeah I would probably rewatch it just to see some of the details that are in there and just because like I said that bulletin board that I saw for Paxton with all the little details in it made me want to kind of go back and look through it plus I really wanted to get a closer look at at the deck itself so I'm very much hoping that someone publishes one that would be very cool I have a feeling we're going to see this deck I just I got to I do too and we have done uh wheel of the Year spreads before right astrology spreads are nothing new they've been around for literal decades after seeing this movie would you try one hell yeah would you be scared if you tried it no you wouldn't be creeped out at all you wouldn't be like this is like the movie I feel a little freaked out right now okay I might not do it if I had that deck I might not do it if I had that deck oh you do it with a different deck though yeah yeah I can see that like my my catac corn deck that's all cat unicorns oh that would be cute one of the kickstarter decks I saw is a creepy cat deck it's adorable it's so cute anyway so I think that's it thank you guys so much for listening to this so olium if you liked our show please give us some Stars rate US review us give us a like tell your
