if anybody's looking to get us Christmas gifts by the way I take a size [Laughter] ounce I love it one size fits all it's witchcraft [Laughter] [Music] hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 47 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends on opposite coast of the USA get together to smoke copious amounts of cannabis and tell each other spooky Tales from across America representing the west coast and all things wild witchy and weedy I'm Lea and before I tell you who I am 47 is my lucky number right now no [ __ ] really well Happy Lucky Number episode so for Lucky 47 I'm shell from the East Coast the best coast the cold Coast pretty chilly over there e getting some snow Lord it has only just begun I feel you know I just said this the other day I was I was born and raised in essentially the Northeast roughly New England area my DNA would suggest I was born in Hawaii for God's sakes you can cannot handle the cold you never have been able to you would think I was born in the cold like for the love of the Lord like I cannot for the life of me ever ever ever acclimate to this weather I can't as long as I've known you in the winter time you usually wear at least three pairs of pants long johns some other type of loose pant and then like a fluffy pant over top of that several shirts and a blanket and big big fluffy socks story but you know what what makes that all hysterical is that I still wear flipflops in the winter that's true that's true you do with the big socks I do but yeah you know my DNA would suggest I I was born in Hawaii but here I am it's getting cold and that brings us to our Christmasy stuff that's right this is the first of our three Christmas Ule what is it Chris chrism Quanah Hanukah I don't know it's this is the season of lights all the the Festival of Lights so many holidays revolving around light and togetherness this time of year I I think it's chrisma kaan Chris kaan yeah that sounds pretty good actually that kind of encompasses a little bit of everything yeah for our end of our first year of podcasting and for this holiday season we have decided to do three episodes in the Dickens in the theme of di dick Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol we are doing three episodes Ghost of Christmas Past Ghost of Christmas present and Ghost of Christmas future and today for episode 47 we are on the Ghost of Christmas Past I would just like to warn all of our listeners that I think collectively we're only like a quarter sober you or both of us together or that's I said collectively collectively collectively we're only about a quarter sober yeah that's a good point because actually I have some fun weed today I have a funny weed story for you it was a funny shopping story that like so worked out in my favor well while I'm over here coughing my lungs out why don't you tell us your funny weed story so you know how I'm always out for a hot deal because you know they charge more than necessary oh yeah nobody wants to pay these prices so I took a little stroll to my favorite place the old Happy Valley you know funny I haven't been there in a couple weeks if you recall the last few episodes we've talked I actually went somewhere else but so I Circle back to Happy Valley this week and I was hot for a deal and I figured it's December and people are Christmas shopping they're going to have badass deals you'd think because you know let's be realistic even one of my adult children has asked for something for Happy Valley for their stocking hey we all need a little green this time of year I have to say stress relief relaxation it was a peppermint it was a peppermint chocolate edible oh yummy so yeah anyway I'm getting sidetracked deal so I go up there and you know usually I'm trying to get like the five8 deal or the eight for eight right so so and I always get eths I'm in that mindset I kind of bulk by who has time to go every day gez yeah so the problem is is I was a little high when I went uhoh it's like going shopping hungry you shouldn't be super high when you go shopping for weed cuz you're going to buy everything no that wasn't the problem what happened the problem was is I was getting confused oh okay you know you know how if you're kind of high and like there's too much seriousness going on oh yeah sure yeah especially if you're not expecting it and everything's going so fast too yeah so I go in there and usually usually there's a line and in the line they have signs posted of the deals so I'm used to being able to casually walk in and stand in line and read the deals on the sign before I get to the counter okay sure as [ __ ] nobody's in line so I get in there and I get called right up to the counter and oh before you've had a chance to peruse the list right so they always you know they ask for your ID when you walk in the building but then they ask for it again when you get up there so I give them my ID and I start looking at the signs right there well this guy is like I don't know he must have had like eight Red Bulls or something I am on like super slow speed and he was on like super high speed and he's like and I'm like and he's like this steal I thought it was eighths uh oh oh no sh what did you do well luckily I still got flower but it was pre-rolls I thought the deal was it said five for 30 so I thought you could 58 for $30 each okay that sounds like that sounds reasonable I mean expensive as [ __ ] but reasonable not necessarily 58s for 150 bucks compared to 58s for normally 60 I'm thinking that's half price right right so I'm thinking I'm buying 58s for $30 each because I'm high I'm high and he's talking fast and I'm panicked and I'm feeling rushed you know that feeling yeah I mean were there people waiting behind you why was he in such a rush I think he had five Red Bulls yeah there you go it was a personality thing I think he needed to smoke a little more I had never seen him before he might have been new and excited about his job I don't know I ended up with five one gr pre-rolls but here's the thing and why I wasn't upset about it because it was five one G pre-rolls for a total that's still a deal for a total of $30 I think that's still a really good deal oh yeah it's endgame [ __ ] yeah oh you love endgame oh my God so I got five grams for 30 bucks hell of a deal but then you know how I get socially anyway and I'm high and I'm panicked and I'm rushed so of course I'm not going to say wait I want eights so I walk out of the store with five one gram pre-rolls for 30 bucks you know what I do when I get home I slice those [ __ ] open and dump them all in a Ziploc bag and it's like I have five grams of ground up weed hey nice very nice and you don't even have to smoke it in a joint if you don't want to well I you know how I prefer my pipes you you do yeah I sliced them open dumped them in a bag and now I have five grams of of already groundup weed of endgame love it and it only cost me 30 bucks so it was kind of a semi disaster but I got a good deal but I was you know how I get yeah it's no problem and honestly if I'm not going to smoke a whole joint I don't like smoking that's half smoked joint later because it just it has taste I love it I mean if I'm smoking the whole joint straight through I don't really notice it as much like if I'm camping or something that's one thing but on the regular I don't want to be smoking pre-smoked joints so yeah that's why part of the reason I sliced it open put it in the bag put it in the pipe smoke it yeah yeah got to be efficient I love it I Got High made a mistake and made it work do you think that this endgame in the joint is older maybe or stale or I'll tell shake it all it it tastes more citrusy I know that interesting I wonder why I I feel almost like it tastes better no [ __ ] strange I feel like I get that citrusy hop more on the green hits okay well that's pretty interesting maybe it's something to do with it being so finely ground maybe it's because they do it and I don't I don't know but yeah no actually feel like I like the taste better that's pretty cool at the same time they could have potentially been two different batches you know it's not like I'm smoking the same batch Time After Time After Time you know this batch could just be a tastier batch I don't know that's very true you're the grower tell me I can tell you right now that they've started to do tests on different cultivars across the country and they're finding unfortunately not a lot of correlation you know if you test something that's called say purple punch in New York and then you test something called purple punch in California there's a very small chance that they'll be the same genetically I believe they've been conducting tests on these and they found that some are we being lied to yes some cultivars are more consistent than others but honestly you have all these different Growers growing in different states different countries all over the place illegally and on the down low who's to [ __ ] say I mean if someone came to me 20 years ago and said this is Sour Diesel and there was a bunch of seeds in it and then I grew it I'm going to tell you that it's Sour Diesel but that guy could have totally [ __ ] lied to me and then the sour diesel that you're smoking in a different state may be something entirely different and so that's kind of what people are waking up to now is that most of the time unless you're getting it from the same breeder consistently what is Jack har here might not be the same as a jack hair there which is legitimately a problem I've run into I've had a couple Jack hairs that were the best thing I have ever smoked spicy pungent delicious sticky beautiful and every time I've seen a Jack herrer or a Jack combination I've bought it and tried it and I have never found the same one again it has never been quite that good I'm still chasing that cultivar and I know I might not ever find it again because we've been lied to well I guess the bottom line the takeaway here folks shell has a takeaway and that is as long as you're high no [ __ ] given zero [ __ ] given what does it matter as we get more knowledge I do feel that we're going to leave the Indica sativa hybrid nomenclature and go more on a tpine profile they might still use those names but less of trying to say that that's what kind of plant it is because even those have kind of lost meaning as these different land races have evolved and been bred and hybrid into other things they might say you know this is an indicia type plant and and and then they'll tell you the turpine profile they'll tell you how many CBDs and how much CBG is in it and and if it's a lemine or a pinene dominant and and then people will be able to make choices that way I think it's just going to change that sounds super complex I'm not g to lie I think it's actually no more complex than what we have right now they're just going to slightly change the names to be more accurate and you'll find you'll flow into it shell without any problem I mean what did we used to have shell dirt weed Hydro brick weed um the goods remember we call it the goods yes I remember but but and now it's all different now it's Inda it's sativa it's it's hybrid it's dominant everything you're saying to me sounds so much like Federal Regulation and that's yucky no not Federal Regulation shelle knowledge science this is giving us the this is going to give us all the goods this is going to give us the what's good for a headache what's good for cramps what's good for back pain what's good for sleep what's good for weight loss this is going to give us all the wonderful benefits that this plant can provide and and give us a better way to get to it but the only way to make sure that the white wedding in California and the white wedding wed in Massachusetts or the same white wedding is to regulate yeah that's true and as a grower I kind of want that I mean there's a fine but once there's regulation you won't be able to be a grower don't you see what I'm saying that's why we have to be careful with the types of regulations and and I completely agree with you it's a fine line I want regulations that will help me to say these white widow seeds are genetically similar to these white widow seeds but I don't want regulation that says these white widow seeds have been genetically modified to only grow with our specific nutrients and only in our specific soil and only if you use our specific pesticides and have a license you know I I don't want that I don't want it to get that far so we need to have people active like you in it who are active for hom Growers who are saying keep the regulations as small as possible and people like me who are Growers that say we need some regulations to keep things safe and fair for everybody but don't go too far but you have to remember you are in America you cannot have your cake and eat it too I know I know I want I'm a polyana you know me I want the best out of everything you can't have free regulation that's not the American way right I I want just enough regulation to give the end user and the grower the best possible product they they can possibly have I want to use use the science and the regulation to know as much about this plan as we can get you know if if the federal government ends up doing what they normally do so let's create a department of marijuana and have Lila be the Secretary of marijuana somebody they should have somebody who's an advocate and a passionate lover of the plant be in charge of that if they're going to do it the list the list is long and distinguished [Laughter] so that's the depressing part of what shell is smoking but here's a fun thing about being able to name your weed whatever the [ __ ] you want to I am currently smoking something named after one of my current favorite shows I have been watching Cobra Kai have you seen any of this shell oh my god I've watched that once it drops so I've seen every season on the day it's been released I've watched I'm already I've been I Yay huge fan over here too love love love that show such a Nostalgia hit oh my gosh so freaking much fun have you seen them have you seen every episode or every season already yes I have okay thank God so I love Johnny oh my gosh is he not the worst and also the best I feel like he got a bad rap back when we were kids when we were teenagers got a bad rap before even these shows came out I saw a couple things where people had put stuff together that said that Johnny got a bad rap and that the bad guy was actually Danny and it might have kind of been he was kind of a bully yeah yeah you know it's it's different you know there's always two sides to every story man that's right and I do really appreciate a lot of shows in particular Cobra Kai showing us that no one is all good no one is all bad there's always nuance and more to the story than you might think there is and can I tell you why it works so well why is that show because because it is as many of the original cast as humanly possible and that literally is how they pulled it off completely agree I love they could not they could have not they couldn't have done that with different actors every time they bring back another character I gasp and I'm so excited oh my God all over again so much fun but what I am smoking today I found at a little shop up in Riverside that I had never been to before for this is from a farm called ball Family Farms and it's called Daniel laruso wasn't that set in her near Riverside okay so they they move from Newark New Jersey to Rita Los Angeles California so Riverside is very very near to Los Ang it's basically like a suburb of of La I got just outside of it and ra is is much closer to La so they're so he lived in LA and it was filmed in a bunch of different locations I don't believe any of the filming locations were in Riverside but they were in in Arizona and around Southern California so this is a it's a Daniel laruso by ball Family Farms and their description is waxon wax off Daniel Daniel laruso is a high potency hybrid strain that can floor even experienced smokers it has an ACD Aroma that will turn heads leaving everyone asking who's holding the fire it is said to taste like herbs fruit and pepper and guess what its THC is sh you're never going to guess it's 38.3% so basically when you smoke the Daniel Luso you feel like you got crank kicked that's right right to the head I love it it's fantastic and it really does taste peppery which is something I adore in a smoke it's got a delicious taste I really wish you could mail that to me right I could I wish I could too so yeah I've been crane kicked straight to the head by Danny and uh yeah it's pretty good stuff I um my eyes are all getting heavy and I'm feeling very talkative so I'm liking it I'm liking it it's definitely got a thumbs up still expensive 60 bucks for an e hate that but you know my homegrown is kicking the dry stuff all right it's still overdried and crappy but it smokes nice and I have more things drying right now as we speak so it's getting better well you know honestly I don't think we can complain about our weed no I do not complain we've smoked worse that's right and I consider myself very lucky to smoke as much as I do so so don't we have don't we have some spookiness to talk about tonight we do indeed we do so we're talking about Ghost of Christmas Past and this evening when I talk about my story I'm going to be talking about the Fort Worth Trio which is a group of young girls who went missing on Christmas Eve in Fort Worth Texas in 1974 oo how about you what are you talking about this evening shell so the only part I really kind of followed on our Ghost of Christmas Past is that this happened a little bit ago okay that's fine interpret that [ __ ] however you want shell I'm not gonna judge and it was during Christmas time perfect actually you know how I get about stuff and it's your fault it always is it is you sent me an article oh no about a Bigfoot sighting near the town that we've come from so okay and it because it happened around the Christmas season I was compelled so we are GNA talk about a Bigfoot sighting in tyoga County Pennsylvania the queen of Cryptids is back for Christmas I love it yes and it's list f so it didn't happen today so obviously it's in the past so yeah that's how I interpreted Christmas Past that works yeah I went back and forth on a couple different ways to do it so I thought about revisiting some old stories and talking about some ghost stories that we've already covered and maybe adding new details I wasn't sure but I found this one and it it's really creepy and spooky and interesting so interesting yeah so tell me a little about your cryptic sh so there was this family and this actually ironically was just last year that's that's what makes me love it you know they always say that Bigfoot is is usually a Northwest thing yeah as a teenager there were sightings in Upstate New York of Bigfoot I actually still to this day have the news articles I was always a huge proponent of Bigfoot was not just a Northwest thing no he does seem to be seen pretty much all over the country including I believe you've talked before about a like an East Coast Corridor almost it seems like a like a migratory Corridor possibly on the East Coast right right coming down from Canada kind of thing yeah we are from the a close proximity to where this sighting is so this this was in tyoga County Pennsylvania and this was last December uh December 2nd 2021 so you're familiar with rural North Pennsylvania yes I am very densely wooded okay I feel like New York and Pennsylvania is nothing but trees so this family they're going down a cut down a Christmas tree and they're going down this road that the way I read it and what make what it makes me think of kind of knowing the area is that they were probably on Pennsylvania state gamelands and going down one of those like dirt roads through the woods it's like a the government keeps up the road but it's dirt it's not paved and there's nothing but woods so they find this tree whatever they stop to cut it and they're kind of doing their thing and they feel like a tree branch just kind of falls out of nowhere maybe 10 feet away startling but it happens sometimes in the woods I mean so here they are this family you know you're cutting down a tree maybe the tree knocked something above that could have loosened and already broken branch and cause it to move and fall sure or heavy snow or something can break a dead Branch down over time right right the thing was is that then two of the family members felt like they saw something like like almost like being thrown oh okay like being thrown sideways but maybe about 15 to 20 feet away from them and not necessarily in their Direction so almost like someone was throwing something in their vicinity but not necessarily at them right almost like trying to get their attention maybe maybe so they thought you know being in that area there's animals there's deer too and they're thinking you know either we knocked something maybe we saw something whatever so as they're walking down this hill they're dragging their tree they got their tree everything's all copacetic and out of the corner of the eye somebody thinks they see like a like a figure oh okay so now maybe someone's [ __ ] with them like there's someone else in the woods that they see right cuz the person was described they kind of described it let's see about 7 feet tall because at first they thought it was bear but then they realized that bears don't really get more especi in that area anyway um about 150 to 200 pounds because there are black bears in that area and I don't think a black bear is going to be seven feet tall when they stand up right so they kind of saw it like almost like if it was like running away from them off into the distance so the dad kind of goes in that direction from like where they saw it initially okay and you know beginning of December Northern Pennsylvania snowy it's cold he finds a footprint and like a boot no but like a footprint that no [ __ ] kind of described similar to a human barefoot but but like five times the size oh wow okay that's creepy so like essentially what you have come to know in all your life Bigfoot imprint your stereotypical Bigfoot imprint they come over little looking at the thing they hear something fly over their head they see a branch landing on top of the hill over to the side um which is only like a little ways away they look in the direction it came from and see something some something like retreating down the hill into the brush they got a better glimpse of it and noticed okay I'm high and you know this I don't understand what this word means explain this to me they describe them as bip pedal does that mean on two feet Yes okay big and tall and hairy they were surprised at how fast it made it to the top of the hill because they thought it made it to the top of the hill in seconds oh wow so really fast kind of when you look at something you kind of know my fat ass couldn't do that that you know they knew not something they could have necessarily done and that so like it moved really fast and was really big two feet hairy they run to the car because the car was only about 20 yards away or so and they said you know everybody's yelling you know what' you see what was that oh my God and they're like they're not sure but they know that there's something down there throwing things at them okay now this is where I get kind of confused these are supposed to be elusive okay why would they throw things at people this isn't the first time I've heard of Bigfoots big feet squatches Sasquatches first time I've heard of sasquatches throwing things at people it seems to be a common thing I've heard them throwing poo I've heard them throwing rotten food I've heard of them throwing pine cones so this seems to be something that they do maybe it's when you get too close to something I don't know but this is not the first story where I've heard of a of a Bigfoot throwing things at people notice me don't notice me notice me don't notice me yeah I I'm not sure it's not a common story but it's common enough that I've heard quite a few of them basically they get all freaked out jump in the car dad's like let's get the hell out of here so they're on their way out they're driving down the road okay so they're about two miles down down the road and a pickup truck comes flying up behind them and won't back off first of all I hate when that happens especially at night first of all when you're in that part of Pennsylvania be afraid it's probably a couple of good old boys out to cause trouble my personal belief if you're not from around there tread lightly um so anyway so pick up coming up behind and won't back off so they pull over and they assumed that the truck would pass them it didn't truck pulls up next to him yeah rolls down the window a [ __ ] they're in big trouble now it ended up being a guy that knew the father of this family oh well there you go your two options in rur PA is it's going to be someone who's going to give you a hard time or it's someone who knows someone that you're related to right much or that you're related to exactly so he rolls down the window and he ended up being and somebody knew and the guy's like freaking out terrified like they they described the guy as terrified and the guy started screaming get your ass out of here I just saw Bigfoot no [ __ ] the truck driver well it wasn't a truck driver it's like a pickup truck right the pickup truck guy that came up driving behind them was all freaked out over the big butt so the family of four sees it has stuff thrown at him the pickup truck driver sees it did they say no [ __ ] we saw it too that wasn't a part of the information okay so they you know they're talking to the guy for a minute and they asked them you know where did you see Bigfoot and I guess there would were other people um not too far away that were also up there cutting a tree for Christmas um and saw it basically standing on the side of the road I did find out at the very end of my my stuff that this was actually on the how they label these is weird but it was Pennsylvania state G gamelands number 208 it was off Route 349 2 miles north of gains PA wow and they saw this last year this was December 2nd 2021 and so you now have five people plus this didn't even this didn't even have any sort of interview or story or backing about the other group that was supposedly you know the pickup truck driver said other people saw it when they were cutting down a tree there was I I never found anything about them or any story about them so there was at least five if not more people that had a Bigfoot sighting in that area really two separate sightings about two miles apart the pickup truck driver again was about 2 miles away from where the family had been cutting down their tree initially and saw it that's very intriguing to have that many different groups of people all see the same thing at the same time or around on the same date rather I believe in Bigfoot people laugh at me sometimes and and you know people pick on me but damn it Sasquatch is real and the these stories just they they reiterate my point we find new species all the time there are more things on this planet that we have not yet discovered particularly in the Deep oceans but also in the forests and so who's to say that there's not something out there some very rare species that we have only caught glimpses of I'm not going to deny that there's a Bigfoot or a Sasquatch because I don't have enough information I definitely think there is a possibility it could be out there well here's my theory considering as a teenager there was a Bigfoot sighting well actually there was multiple it kind of went on every day for like a week yeah you said you have the newspaper clipping there were sightings and some of these sightings were literally within a mile of my childhood home and the proximity of where I grew up to where this story is okay we're talking a few decades Gap but it is not out of the realm possibility that that could be a corridor passageway um um um part of their Trail or track I don't know what you'd call it their herd line I don't know it very well could be their migration path whatever the [ __ ] you call it but it's not the first sighting in a relatively close proximity over a long period of time I did find that New York ranks the fifth in Bigfoot sightings in the country no [ __ ] no [ __ ] are they are they one of the top states on the East Coast just curious I I don't know the thing only said it's the fifth I don't have the whole list oh okay I actually found I found it so let's see let me pull this up I am not seeing like a big huge article per se but what I am finding is that in the winter actually there's a couple this is actually kind of weird I looked up broom County New York MH cuz I was looking to see if I could find what I was specifically looking for so this was in they're saying it just says uh 1985 or 86 so that's pretty close right right to what I was saying I said like mid 80s it just says this occurred while someone was standing enjoying the view of the woods not far from their house they had a dog with them they weren't actually in the woods themselves but across the creek from the woods so they saw something that was bipedal they saw from the waist down the rest was hidden by leaves and trees the legs that they saw were stocky not bet in any way the hair was quite long they they estimated that the hair was about four to five inches long and it was like a golden reddish brown they saw it slowly turn take a few steps and disappear in the underbrush I love how all the all the Sasquatches can do that like two steps in the woods and they like disappear just like almost any other creature like you see a rabbit or a deer they can do that too so can a Bigfoot so like I said that was that was um mid 80s but I actually found another one in the same in the same county in 1995 uh and uh another one in 1998 in the winter again must be something about fall and winter on the East Coast maybe again something to do with that migratory pattern I know right the person's report says that um it was after a big snowstorm it had been snowing for a long time there was about a foot or two of snow on the ground and at about 11 p.m. they had gone out to shovel snow and they distinctly felt like they were being watched it is someone who was used to being in the area because again we're from a very like kind of wooded area yeah but felt like they were being watched and got very creeped out um had a dog with him again but the guy just like definitely was very he definitely felt like he was being watched the dog then all of a sudden acted freaked out and was trying to get like kind of wanting to go into the house when normally the dog liked being out in the snow apparently that's always a bad sign right so um he opened the door uh to his porch and the dog flew in and like cowed so it kind of made the guy like scared to go and like kind of ran into the house he turned around and looked out the door and he said he saw these glowing eyes he looked straight ahead in the direction of his driveway and saw the eyes looking at him they were glowing like an animal's eyes Wood high in the air um like a person standing he said it felt like they made like eye contact basically oh creepy he couldn't in his mind figure out what it was he knew it wasn't a deer because it was standing upright um but he knew it wasn't a person and he knew it wasn't a bear and it had the long hair um and it was you know dark in color because it was 11 o'clock at night yeah he said he was just overtook by Terror because he couldn't you know for life of him compute what he was seeing wow but he said it was only about 25t away from him standing on his porch he heard strange knocking noises which again is something that is um yeah that we've heard that before in regards to yeah he said it sounded like someone was knocking on a hollow tree wasn't there someone who even thought that they had had like a knocking conversation with a big fot yeah and then basically his son I didn't catch an age on it um was out feeding the chickens the next day and heard high-pitch screaming type sounds oh very creepy and they weren't animal like or humanik and all he can just basically he just for the life of him and even still years after that he still hears um on occasion strange knockings and screamings in the woods so maybe something kind of lives there goes through there right and on and on occasion he feels like he's being watched and on occasion the dogs freak out creepy certainly sounds like there's something in that part of New York State and he is also from a a wooded hilly kind of mountainous area of there so you know it is definitely the the environment but I'm telling you big foot he comes and chills out in Upstate New York in Northern Pennsylvania just saying I guess so who knew you would have such a close and personal relationship with such an elusive Cryptid so it just almost it seems like there's a story like every 10 or 15 years so maybe it is just a migratory thing oh yeah maybe it's a generational migration maybe they just go every decade or something because you figure 85 95 and 98 there happen to be a couple and then 2021 not too far away I mean okay maybe that second Gap was big but you know it's not like it's every season is what I'm saying right exactly so I don't know any crypto zoologists in the house email us let us know is this a migratory pattern do they have some type of breeding cycle or travel cycle I don't know every five years every 10 years I'm curious I'm on Bigfoot to come to Massachusetts I bet there have been Bigfoot sightings in Massachusetts another episode yeah we'll have to look into that and see so that happened while they were going to get a Christmas tree last year just last year I know crazy you know I always think that like Bigfoot sightings are going to be you know 10 years ago 50 years ago but no they're happening right now all over the place Bigfoot's in the house man so for our second Ghost of Christmas Past story I'm going to tell you a ghost story about three young women who went missing on December 24th well technically December 23rd of 1974 can I just point out I have some weird thing with Cryptids and you have some weird thing with missing women right missing people man it kind of sucks so so what town what state what city where's this from all right we're going to Fort Worth Texas okay the morning of December 23rd 1974 the day before the night before Christmas that's right Christmas Eve Eve on this day 17-year-old Rachel Arnold whose married name let that sink in is ter Lisa so Rachel terisa wanted to pick something up that she had on layaway at a local um army navy store do you remember layaway I do do that anymore take that hit girl suck it down that good old end game all right well I'm going to take a hit too then I can't help it it's so fruity and citrusy and tasty it's so good you have like Fruity citrusy and I have like peppery spicy and loving it so you're not GNA say anything about the fact that she's 17 and married I'm still stuck on the fact that she was doing layway I mean okay I mean not that I'm saying that's right and I agree but I am fully aware that there are some states that do condone 17 being the legal AG of consent and that is not something we're going to argue here so I hear you I hear you but I'm stuck on L away man lay away it was also 1974 and you weren't even a twinkle yet I know right so Rachel charisa was going to pick up something from layaway and also hoping to do some Christmas shopping for her 2-year-old stepson at the local mall called Seminary South she had asked her sister Deborah to go with her but Deborah had stayed up really late playing Canasta on what do you know how to play Canasta what is that I'm not it's a card game but beyond that I have no idea no clue so she' stayed up too late I'm not going now there's weird things about Deborah too can we just say this because Rachel's married to Tommy terisa they got married like the day after her 17th birthday he's 20 been married before has a 2-year-old kid red FL oh there's more red flag shell he was at one time engaged to Deborah Rachel's older sister and and Deborah says that engagement was just kind of frivolous they weren't really together it was just not a serious relationship at all but they got engaged and now that Rachel and Tommy are married guess who lives in the same house with them debah so are so anyway are we talking like Sister Wives here I don't know I'm not really sure there's a lot going on and I really think possibly what was going on there is that Rachel and Deborah did not have the best childhood there are a lot of rumors there was quite a bit of abuse going on in that household including that their father sexually abused them so the fact that they both jumped to get engaged to someone and then moved out of the house into his home speaks to the fact that there might be some truth to those rumors but that's a different story and we'll get into that a little more later Rachel asked her sister to go with her and Deborah doesn't want to go she's too tired so Rachel asked her her close friend Renee Wilson who's 14 and Rachel and Renee kind of grew up together whenever Renee would go visit her grandmother it was very close to Rachel's house and so they kind of grew up as kids together and we're very close friends Deborah was probably getting busy with the husband just saying keep going it's entirely possible so Renee Wilson says yes she would love to go to the mall she also wants to get some presents for Rachel's 2-year-old stepson now Rene's boyfriend Terry Mosley is coming over before Renee leaves with Rachel to go to the mall and Terry gives her her Christmas gift early and it's a promise ring oh what a sweetheart a that so sweet they were so in love and and she was ecstatic over the moon for her sweet little promise ring Renee asked Terry to go with her and Rachel to the mall and he wanted to but he said he had promised his friend that he'd go with him to the hospital and so he couldn't go his little sister Julianne Mosley who's nine overhears this conversation and decides she wants to tag along with the older girls and she begs and begs and begs her mother if she can go normally uh Mrs Mosley would say no but there's a lot of [ __ ] going on she doesn't want to deal with a nagging little girl just lets her go just says okay fine especially when she finds out that Renee was planning on being back to get ready for a party that was going to be starting at 4:00 so she knew the girls would be home early and she told julieanne to be home by 6 p.m. at the latest and it should be no problem she knew Renee and Rachel were going to be home by 4 so no big deal get her out of her hair so the little 9-year-old goes with 14-year-old Renee and 17-year-old Rachel they head to the local Army Navy Surplus Store and Rachel picks up her layaway which was a really nice pair of hip hugger jeans she immediately changed out of her old leggings and puts on the jeans and puts the old leggings in the trunk of the car this is roughly around noon or so and it's the last confirmed time that anyone saw those three girls they then leave the surplus store and they go to the Seminary South mall and Rachel Parks the car on the upper side you know how sometimes malls are built they're not really two levels but it might be kind of built into a hill so part of it's so she parked on the upper side near the Sears in the Sears parking lot lot and around 4:00 Renee doesn't show up for the party and people start to get worried and then by 6:00 p.m. when Julianne Mosley's not home her parents start to get worried the families go to the mall and start looking for the girls they find Rachel's 1972 Oldsmobile 98 in the Sears parking lot with all the doors locked on the floor of the back seat is a wrapped Christmas present the girls are nowhere to be found Rachel's mother and her her 11-year-old brother Rusty go through the mall up and down the mall asking if anyone has seen the girls Renee was wearing kind of a a very distinctive outfit from what I hear she was wearing kind of purplish bluish colored hip hugger bell bottoms along with like a lime yellow green top that said um sweet honesty on it in the on the front and so people remembered them because it was three pretty young girls in the mall and also that bright distinctive sweet honesty sweatshirt that Renee was wearing so they'd seen them throughout the day at the mall in several places there are reports some that happened at the time and some later that a couple people remembered seeing a man possibly a security guard with the girls and that maybe they saw them in the truck of a security guard in the parking lot but there's still no sight of the girls and in 1974 there's no cameras anywhere exactly so at this time they notify the Fort Worth Police and the case was handed over to the youth division of the Fort Worth Police Department's missing person's Bureau the police also questioned people at the mall and they get a little more information of uh one woman said she saw three girls being kind of hustled or pushed into a pickup truck by a man who may or may not have been a security guard another person said that they saw the girls in the company of someone who looked like a security guard and that they went they got into his truck but these eyewitnesses couldn't be found again and these reports could not be corroborated and nobody had a license play of course nothing there was there was nothing these eyewitness accounts did not make it into any of the official police reports because the the people could not be found again uh couldn't be corroborated I guess so since there was no sign of Foul Play There's there was nothing to indicate what had happened to the girls the police just presumed that they were runaways which happened a lot at that time any teenager any young person in the 70s and 80s that disappeared you were [ __ ] because they were just like oh it's a runaway yeah and until these kids started turning up dead they would pretty much just close the case and assume it was a runaway so they did that here as well Richard Wilson who was Rene's father and also Rachel's father along with a neighbor grabbed some shotguns and climbed up on top of a um a car dealership or a car repair shop that was across the street from the mall and had clear line of sight to the Sears parking lot and they could see the old mobile from that position and they staked it out the entire night hoping that someone would come back to the car either preferably the girls or possibly a perpetrator who might know what happened to the girls I feel like that's a tad dramatic just saying yeah odds of something being found there are a little you know slim to none I'm thinking more of the shotguns on the roof right I mean yeah what did they think was going to happen but unfortunately they saw nothing so the next morning Tommy Rachel's husband got a letter in the mail it was an envelope written in pencil it was addressed to Thomas a terisha instead of Tommy as he was mostly known by in the return address area of the envelope all it said was Rachel the letter inside was very big it was obviously a piece of paper that wasn't meant to go in like that envelope and that was written in pen and it said I know I'm going to catch it but we had to get away we're going to Houston see you in about a week the car is in Sear's upper lot love Rachel now the Rachel that it was sign the letter was signed with instead of ending eel like her name it was ended e e and the last e was overwritten to make it an L so it looked like it had been written by someone who didn't know how to spell Rachel or some theorize possibly written under duress by Renee who would have normally signed her name with two e at the end the letter itself was given to the police and then later to the FBI and handwriting analysis was done on it but they couldn't determine if it was actually Rachel's handwriting or not to this day it's still inconclusive the letter did come through the mail and it did have a postmark on it an ink postmark it was postmarked with a zip code that was 76083 and the three on it looked like it was backwards like it was either applied backwards by a hand loaded stamp or possibly was an eight or something like that and so there was a lot of discussion as to where this letter had been dropped in the mail if it was 76038 that would be eliasville or 76088 which would be Weatherford which were very far away not really near Fort Worth and so this kind of muddied the waters quite a bit where did this letter come from when could it have been put in the mail if it was received by Tommy the very next morning after the girls disappeared I did find some facts on that by someone who worked in the post office back in the 7s and they said in 1974 the way postmarks worked weren't exactly like zip codes are today the first three numbers the seven six and the zero stand for different things the seven is the code for Texas Six is for tarant County and zero is for the city of Fort Worth and then the next two digits are actually a number and a letter and in this case it's 3B like boy which is a code for the machine that processed that mail and at that time period people have also shown us 7601 a 3A and in this case it's 3B so that means that this was actually processed in Fort Worth by the post office what people now think um Richard Wilson again Rene's father says that there's a a little satellite Post Office you know how some malls have like those little small post office where you can drop things off yeah so there was a little satellite Post Office at one end the opposite end of Seminary South from where r had parked so at the opposite end of the mall there's this little post office and it's it's theorized that that's where the girls dropped this letter off whether under their own will or under duress but they're pretty sure that's where it was dropped off that day and then it was able to be delivered the very next day so who wrote it and why where did these girls go and did Rachel write it and why did she misspell her own name and why would she address it to Thomas and not Tommy some people think that because Rachel was the oldest one and it was her car she's the one with a driver's license that maybe it was addressed to her home because you know if she had a driver's license there someone else could have used that to address the letter rather than she her addressing it herself the families did not feel that the girls could possibly be runaways no 9-year-old kid is going to run away two days before Christmas and Renee was just had got a promise ring from her boyfriend she was looking forward to a party Rachel was by all accounts a newlywed she'd been married for 6 months things seemed to be fine there nobody knew what had happened to these girls they questioned people the family hired a private detective named John swam in 1975 because they've had no answers in years he called press conference after press conference he reopened investigations he contacted all sorts of eyewitnesses he followed up on all sorts of tips and covered nothing he worked the case for about 3 years and he's credited with getting the police to get more actively involved in the search for the missing girls but he wasn't able to uncover much information mysteriously in 1979 John Swain killed himself with a drug overdose and left a note stating that all of his files on every case he's ever worked should be destroyed and they were so they don't even have any information on what happened happen on what he uncovered about these girls so there have been numerous theories as to what happened to them maybe they ran away but again why would they there was a a 28-year-old man in the area that had been making obscene phone calls and he worked at a store where Rachel had applied and it was found that he had been making obscene phone calls to her and to other girls that had applied to that store nothing came out of that lead he wasn't found to have anything to do with it so in the area at the same time that these girls went missing was a serial killer named James macalin now keep in mind he's been known to not be a reliable narrator but he was with a young woman that went by several names one of which was Mercedes and he ended up killing her and she was for a long time called the El Dorado Jane do until they determined that he had murdered her and her name was Mercedes but he says that Mercedes when she grew up had grown up in like the slave trade like the the slave trade oh yeah and that that she grew up in captivity with these three girls who had been kidnapped from a Fort Worth mall and that that they had been forced into child prostitution for years and then voluntarily as they grew up stayed there and that the youngest girl uh died giving birth oh [ __ ] whether this is true or not I mean he said stuff like quote these girls were like sisters to Mercedes we used to visit them they grew up in captivity in the Dallas Fort Worth area sometimes in the same town where their parents were by the time they were adults they were willing members of the stable the younger girl died giving birth to a child it's also rumored that Rachel still visits Fort Worth and goes close to her family's home every Christmas and that she's been cited there multiple times again these are all very unreliable James mcalphin is a known liar and and if Rachel has been seen coming to Fort Worth every Christmas why doesn't she come forward now it's been 40 plus years 50 years why doesn't she talk to her family hard to admit that you agreed to stay yeah so it's just so mysterious and so strange why would these girls go to the mall to go Christmas shopping and then suddenly decide to go to Houston Renee and Julianne weren't even planning on going they were asked if the last minute I mean what the hell happened to these girls they had to have been kidnapped they had to but how do you kidnap three girls my theory is that I agree with you I think they were kidnapped too and I I'm pretty sure that all these vague reports of the girls being seen with someone who is a security guard I think that if you wanted to kidnap someone in the 1970s all you had to do is pretend to be an authority figure right right walk up to them and be like I saw that little one shoplifting you girls better come with me or you're all going to get in trouble if that was the case why have them write a letter like who wrote the letter I just don't understand it's it's very strange they might have been stalked and targeted it could have been but there at least Rachel could have been targeted and it just so happened the others were kind of collateral damage that is entirely possible and and it is rumored that Rachel was pregnant by her father at the time of her disappearance and there's even some rumors that her father was in trouble with the IRS or possibly with had some gambling debts and owed some money to some very bad people and so there is one rumor that says that he sold those three girls into slavery but again no one really knew that Renee and Julianne were going to go so that doesn't make sense like I said collateral damage they very well could have been when you got a crazy mofo who's got a plan sometimes when the plan doesn't go as planned you accommodate you think you're kidnapping one and well plan's changed you're taking all three that very well could have been Now or Never Now or Never because this is my plan super creepy and a few times they've reopened this case and they've gone back and questioned a lot of the old Witnesses Rusty the brother of of Rachel has not let this go he's written a song he's given interview after interview ran a Facebook page at one time a few years ago he spearheaded a an initiative and they ended up dredging a local Lake and pulling up three different vehicles I believe two of them helped solve other cold cases but unfortunately not the one involving his sister but he's very dogged um I also just recently learned that one of the last surviving parents passed away oh wow you know they're all everyone unfortunately they're they're passing away without ever getting any information on what happened to their daughters no closure there's no closure here but a lot of the um the people the witnesses that are being reined again the this whole security guard thing is popping up on multiple occasions and people describe different cars like one person said a truck another person said a van someone I believe said a a yellow truck but they all talk about some type of of vehicle like a security vehicle and a security guard so it's it's almost possible that that you know your idea of an abduction and my idea that maybe someone pretending to be an authority figure kind of hustled them away and then forced them to write the note or maybe forced Renee to write the note or it was premeditated and they had the note ready that's possible too maybe someone not related to the maybe none of the girls wrote the note and the kidnapper wrote the note I don't know I do know there was some Killers going around that time like the the BTK and Ted Bundy and a few of them would talk about uh taking people's pictures like they'd be like hey you could be a model why don't you come to Houston with me and we'll take your picture but I don't know just so creepy right around Christmas to have these three kids just disappear and to have no reason and no explanation for why so sad I've Got The Chronic ghost of I don't know cough to get off man that's right Christmas coffin um so creepy I I just the reason this case gets me is it's just these girls disappeared Into Thin Air and because the police labeled as a runaway in the beginning the car was released to Rachel's husband Tommy the very next day Christmas Eve he drove that car home they didn't dust it for Prince they didn't check the car out nothing it was also the 70s though it was they thought it one time that the girls had made it back to the car at some point during their shopping trip because of that present on the floor in the back seat but that turned out to have been a present that Renee had given to Rachel before they even left it was a present to Rachel's 2-year-old stepson from Renee and in the back in the trunk they found the pants that Rachel had changed out of when she put on the pants she'd gotten off of lay away but nothing else really but it's just the letter coming the very next day I mean post offices worked pretty quickly back in that in those days but who wrote it I'm going with premeditated you think it was someone that was stalking Rachel she was a very pretty girl I mean maybe it was a dad maybe it was a stalker I don't know what to say about that but I'm going with premeditated do you think they were kidnapped and sold into the sex slave trade or do you think that they were killed do you think someone was out to kill Rachel maybe the dad you know if she was pregnant with his child you have unreliable people tell stories but those stories do kind of coincide that's the thing that's what struck me is that even though the witnesses didn't really have a lot to say there was enough that corroborated the security guard I really think yeah I do think that someone pretended to even SE slave thing yep whether they were killed or kidnapped pretty much the only way you could get three girls to do what you want to do is to be an authority figure and have them be scared right so my guess is they I don't think you could get them to like go to Houston to take pictures and be models with a 9-year-old who wants to go home for Christmas but if they were scared because one of them had maybe gotten caught shoplifting or maybe implied that they were shoplifting and going to get in trouble then you could force them to go quietly along with an authority figure who then could then kill them or kidnap them at their Leisure I just think that back then there was a lot of killers and kidnappers ERS and stuff like that going on that just went unresolved unfortunately I think so too they just didn't have the type of things that we do now in order to be able to connect things particularly a lot of people got caught but a lot of people got away with it exactly people got caught because they confessed or they happened to be there or someone saw them but pretty much if no one saw you do it and you didn't leave some big clue behind it wasn't DNA and [ __ ] they couldn't even talk to each other if you committed a crime in Fort Worth Texas and then went to Arizona to kidnap somebody you could do it exactly the same way and they would never talk to each other you know we had talked before when we did the dueling axe murderers episode we talked about the all across the country around that same time there were people particularly near railroads who were axed to death you know they were killed by Axe and this happened enough that I think there's even a book about the murders at that time somebody now theorizes there may have been some type of transient person transient serial killer going around on these trains murdering people by axe but back in the day no technology no communication nothing exactly so they could get away with a lot more wow wasn't that just a Christmas Downer story just saying aren't we all just looking forward to going shopping now so put an Apple Air tag on your kids before you let them go but you know the other thing that really bugs me is this whole Tommy terisa what the hell is up with that I mean 20-year-old married had been previously married enough to have a two-year-old divorced engaged to Deborah broke off the engagement oh my God maybe him and Deborah did it maybe Rusty seems to think so and there are people that seem to think Deborah has more that she should say but I don't know I've read a few things by her I don't get the vibe that she had anything to do with it it just seems a little odd because Tommy less than two years after Rachel disappeared he had her um he got a divorce based on abandonment then December 15th 1976 he married Josephine Beck who's also 17 years old and then by June of 1978 they got divorced and three months later he married 23-year-old Ruby Fox so I don't know Tommy seemed to have some issues with women check him out gez right I don't know but he had an alibi I don't know and one of the private investigators I believe it was John swam or possibly one of the later ones found that Rachel was pregnant at the time of her disappearance and it is rumored to have been by her own father so but he had stage for cancer and he passed away just six months after they went missing so I have a hard time thinking that a sick guy could be raping his 17-year-old daughter I don't know maybe her husband killed her cuz he knew maybe I don't know Rachel's mother did say that when her father passed away I thought this was kind of sweet before I found out about the rumors that he hadd been abusing her but he said when he passed away he said that he was going to go find his daughter a yeah but no answers for any of them unfortunately yeah so who knows kind of creepy so yeah those are our ghosts of Christmas Past stories and next week we'll be talking about the winter solstice because our episode comes out right on Wednesday the winter solstice and we'll
