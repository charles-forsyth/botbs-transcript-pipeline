it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft welcome witches pagans heathens and magical souls to the solarium shell and Lea's sunlit herb filled Sanctuary where we put our boms down hang up our pointy hats and sometimes shell puts her curs finger away we spend our time sipping tea toking herbs and reading books if we're lucky today we have a lot of books actually today we're doing like a I'm calling these The Fab Four man oh the folklore Fab Four I love it the folklore Fab Four I'm really excited about this because the Fab Four books we're talking about today literally covers all of the Americas folk magic right now is such a big topic we wanted to kind of dive into do some offerings from both Luellen and wiser books we are going to do an episode at some point here coming up on folk magic and this is kind of separate in aart this we're talking about four specific books and first of all shout out to lellan shout out to wiser red wheel we appreciate you guys sending us some good stuff to look through and let's talk folk Magic Woman because this is the hottest thing online right now now everybody on Tik Tok everybody on Instagram wherever you're from you're into folk magic and these are really some awesome books folk magic is basically magic of the people and if we go by one of the books we have here is Luellen's Complete Book of North American folk magic and in that book they give a definition of folk magic basically folk being of the people and Magic if you go with Alistair Crawley's definition is to summarize it it's basically creating change through your will wait a second okay so folk magic are you telling me is the magic of the people then what the hell else is there is it all magic magic of the people like what is there magic of the nonp people okay I'm confused doesn't that mean everything is folk magic and it just depends on where you're from pretty much yes haha that's why folk magic is popular because that's it's all folk magic folks sort of yeah I guess it kind of is all folk magic because it all does derive from the people but folk magic the term specifically refers to types of magic that are regional types of magic that are intimately tied to the land and to the people that live on that land folk magic comes from pretty much everywhere it comes from people having needs it comes from practical reasons you know back in the day people needed help with something they called upon what they had the herbs the animals the spirits the Saints the religions that they they had in their community and in their area so it's intimately tied to different places most of this was not written down because these people again were folk people they were typically lower class and would not have known how to read or write so these are oral tradition Magics and what one person does here is going to be very different from what someone does in a different Community because the blend of cultures religions and local flora fauna and Spirits are going to be different from place to place so that's what people refer to as Folk magic it's very family specific and area specific but yeah I guess technically like everything's folk magic because it's all of the people but you know what I loved about this book in particular The Complete Book of North American folk Magic first of all this was kind of I don't know what the word is put together edited what have you by Corey Thomas Hutchinson but this thing there's like what 25 28 contributors it really is a compend it really is and I mean it isn't just about Appalachian folk magic or Pennsylvania you know powow magic it is like very encompassing of literally every I don't even know the word for it North America every part of the United States Canada's included in this this is like an encyclopedia and I'm in love with this book damn it I am in love with this book folk magic is so diverse that what you practice here in your neck of the woods could be you know a mile away could be very different because you know how you know how you like Spirit of place yes this is like magic of place exactly oh that's a great way to put it you know the the people that were here in the Americas first and then all the people from different places that came here everybody's beliefs and ideas melded with the land with the place that they were in and became very personal very magical Regional is a good word very Regional and and a lot of these books mention that in particular the the North American folk magic it it goes by region and area because folk magic is so personal to place now whoa whoa whoa I have to stop you in your tracks because I was getting ready to go a little too deep right here from the get-go you're starting to go a little deep from the get-go we need to talk about some tea and some token before we go any further on folk magic SOA what are you drinking what are you smoking everybody needs to know well one of the other books that we recently talked about on social media was a te witches grimoire by SM harlo  I love that book too I know this book is great I love having it like a recipe book it's right there whenever I have an idea for a tea that I want I can just check this out it has tea for everything including one for ostara that I just had to try because it looked so delicious what's in it tell us so this is the Spring Equinox tea I I put in about a teaspoon of white tea a teaspoon of Jasmine a teaspoon of rose and then two teaspoons of dried raspberries this is so delicious it's fantastic I feel like you should put sweet cream creamer in that you and your cream I put honey in it and just a little bit of lemon maybe it's that like British DNA or that that Welsh DNA I got that says put cream in it but I put cream in some of them and this probably would be good with cream but honey and just a tiny bit of lemon and it's very delicious so I decided to smoke something just as delicious you know me and chelatos oh my God you love them I do that flavor profile is so so good so I got some silky gelato from one of the local shops and I mixed in with it a little bit of raspberry leaf and some rose petal along with my favorite Mullen so yeah it's very nice feel like you you smoke Mullen with everything I do I do I think everybody should smoke Mullen with everything it's pretty mellow has a good full smoke and it doesn't have too harsh of a taste I kind of like it the rose isn't too strong no the stronger the rose the better I don't know if you can get too strong to be honest I am such a basic when it comes to Rose love rose petals in everything in my tea in my smoke I don't care I will put it in everything the more like a rose it tastes the more I like it I love it so much it's delicious now you you are so not a basic by the way we're we're we're going to talk about some basic  here tonight I had to go with store-bought tea I am drinking my my favorite store-bought iced tea tonight Turkey Hill love them you do I think in our other podcast the stoned Witches Hour I think one episode you devoted like the entire intro of the episode to your love to Turkey Hill tea yeah so shout out to Turkey Hill they're a company in Pennsylvania people know they're ice cream but damn it they have good tea so I'm drinking that i i dub it my cracked tea and I am smoking the most fabulous what have you got so remember I told you I I found that place that I've been going to recently that you know has great prices great deals well guess who started growing their own this company they used to basically you know order wholesale from Growers well they're still getting other people's  at their store basically but now have their own grow so this stuff this is one of their grows Mandarin Skittles with a z my friends and you know how I am I'll give you one guess what is the THC level at least 32% oh my God you're so close 3.24 this is good man I love it tasty but it is very aromatic we'll call it that very aromatic you're not opening this and hiding it from anybody no no same thing with this gelato as soon as you open it my goodness it smells so good yeah but you know I'm just kind of loving the dispensaries around here because I feel like the competition is kicking up so the quality is kicking up because of the competition every one of these damn places want your business well give me something to make me choose your store over another I mean you've you've been here you know that there's five stores within five miles but yet I choose to go a little further because they have good price good quality I just want the good weed for a decent price one of my favorite things in this area is that every month or so they have a craft Market where they'll have local Growers all get together to sell their cannabis to sell their other weed products you know their cookies their candies different things like that tinctures didn't you go to a weed festival yeah here and in California which blew my mind when I first moved to California from an illegal state to a legal State festivals were one of my favorite things to go to but yeah here in New York state cannabis is legal going to some of these farmers markets where they have weed there has been really fun and I've been getting some some great cultivars that way I'm not going to lie if someone gave me a bag of dirt weed right now I might smoke it just for nostalgic purposes whoops did I say that so still not a pot snob will I you're the pot snob in this Duo here friend you know that always have been it's true but Mandarin Skittles good sounds delicious it does not taste like Mandarin oranges I wish it did no doesn't have any Citrus taste at all um a little a little but it has that just that damn good weed taste and smell like I can't explain it other than damn good weed taste and smell Shell's rule number 56 is that thou shalt not name a weed after a fruit or food unless the weed tastes like that fruit or food so obviously they have broken your rule why would they do that to me I don't know that's terrible if you call it grape that better tastees like grape Bubblegum seriously you know if they tell me it's Lemon Haze it tastes like lemon those don't lie to me I'm just saying usually the lemons are pretty good about it that's true but we've decided especially on our our old podcast we've talked about how people just get high and make up these names there's no Rhyme or Reason pretty sure and they I still think they should hire us because we would come up with some excellent names right all right so before we get too high shell I do want to go over these books now we have talked about this Complete Book of North American folk Magic by Cory Thomas Hutchinson but like shell said earlier this is a compendium of a group of people and it's fantastic and actually I realized there is a little I don't know if you want to call it a chapter or a section on Appalachian folk magic Pennsylvania Dutch is in there as well it is but I just wanted to point out one of the books we are talking about tonight as well is um small Magics by H Byron Ballard and Byron Ballard actually did the section on Appalachian folk magic in the North American folk magic book yes that was a lot of damn words by the way she will actually be at the Sacred Space conference with us super excited to hear her talk super excited me too she is very well known as a folk magic practitioner and this book North American folk magic it's put together kind of like a road map and he says he did that on purpose we're going to talk a lot this episode about spirits of place and about magic of place like shell said and that they recognized that these different blends of magic came to be because of the place if you lived in a valley or a holler or up on a mountain that was the magic you knew those were the people you trusted and so that's what you learned some of the authors say in this book you know that they learn to to tie their knots a certain way or to make their teas a specific way or say a charm a certain way and just you know one Valley over it could be entirely different so they map it out very nicely in this book and they really give you a great way to look at the United States and all the different folk magic practices across the country what they actually did was they took the whole of North America not just the United States but Mexico and Canada as well and they kind of broke it up into eight different sections of folk magic and I was surprised you know I'm currently in Salem and there is a New England in Maritime folk magic section I was like wow this shit's cool and I was also surprised to find out that New York this was weird to me the New York section where it falls into was called New Holland and oh my God you know how I'm bad with pron iation de Sher de Sher help me out here Lea yeah I don't know how to pronounce that either we're gonna call it just New Holland I just was surprised at how many different types of folk magic were practiced in the United States Canada and Mexico aside from the fact obviously that what you do a neighbor a mile down the road might do slightly different I loved reading from each person's different perspective I really liked going through through and reading some of these personal stories they were very rich they had a lot of information in them Stephanie rosebird in this book wrote a solitary nature my hoodoo story and I I want to be her friend like I I related so much to everything that she said here you know as we've talked about a bunch in the past and as you know my family did a lot of the Pennsylvania Dutch thing and they go into the German powow magic uh of Pennsylvania in this and you don't see that brought up a lot which is weird to me maybe it's just cuz I lived it but you don't see a lot of books written about it or a lot of sections of books written about it and I thought they did an amazing job I just kind of really like how it was a lot of different people that practice folk magic in their own way kind of coming together this is to me more of a reference book than something you're going to read once cover to cover and be done with you know what I mean I feel that you could read it cover to cover once because each person's stories are so rich but I I agree with you that it it it works very well as a as a reference book absolutely read it cover to cover but I just see myself as well as others kind of going back to it a lot oh yeah there's so much information here each section is just full of history of the area how that magic came to be and all the different types of practices and belief systems very well done one thing I didn't know a lot about and I thought was interesting they go into that Florida swamp magic very cool very cool I don't know I I definitely think that this is this is a good resource I absolutely agree good for cover to cover but a good resource book in my opinion at first I was afraid that it was going to be a little bit too much like a list you know like here's what this means and here's what that means I I think it was opposite of that oh it was but that was my first impression when I first looked at the book and then when I opened it up and started reading the stories I was so happy to find that it it was less textbook than I thought it was going to be it read very much like stories and interesting convers you know interesting information I think the reason it worked that way is because it was a collaboration of so many different people just like folk magic is it it was very much a melding of different people to make it great don't be afraid of it it's a big book it looks kind of like a textbook but it reads it's so interesting to read and you can jump around you could read it straight through you can just keep it as a reference book let's be honest you could take that book and knock someone out with it yeah you absolutely could it's huge yeah full of information it's it's what like regular standard paper size eight and a half by 11 it's it's a hefty book oh yeah but don't be intimidated it's really interesting now I I want to kind of take that thought and springboard right into our next book dream witchery and the reason I I I want to springboard right to that is because that is almost the same concept this is going over kind of like dream folk magic throughout all of South America so you got North American folk magic that kind of covers North America and then this dream witchery basically does the same thing and is also a collaboration of multiple people people sh what I love you why I just get a transition man that was perfect I totally love you man because I had written in my notes like almost word for word what you just said exact same thing I feel the same way I really liked this book so we're talking about dream witchery folk magic recipes and spells from South America for witches and brewhas by Elohim Lea leafar and I really like this book I was worried about this for me personally because you know that sometimes if something isn't necessarily my jam I have a hard time mustering through for whatever reason I I just I haven't gotten into South American magic so I was worried about this one but you know what to me this was just the South American version of the book we just talked about I think the reason it worked so well is the collaboration you know like I said about the other book The collaboration of multip mle views and opinions and experiences this one has some pretty badass spells in it to be honest with you this one I would say is more of a collection of spells more so than the North American folk magic yeah that that is kind of like information and this is like a spell spell book and it really is about dreams there are dream meanings dream interpretations there are different sections where different people would go in and talk about a spell that they have or a recipe that they wanted to share there is kind of tasks in here too I I'm not calling it a workbook but there are to-dos in here which you know I love a good book with to-dos it's got some exercises yeah little mini rituals or or meditations this is a good book for that yeah I liked on the dream communication chapter there's a section about um visualization exercises you know it talks about what moon phase you can do it in incenses that you can use and you know different exercises you can do to help with your visualization I was digging the part um where they they went over astral travel too when you first crack open this book I was reading in the beginning and I one of the things I really loved about it is they talk about the fact that this is not a Wiccan based system folk magic is older than wi of folk magic Blends a lot of different local religions and systems so one of the things that Lear talks about is the fact of in more North American witchcraft you know with our Wiccan DNA or whatever we usually talk about not doing magic on someone without their consent right it's good practice you don't always have to but we like to so he talks about how in this South American folk magic that's kind of silly because doing spells is as simple to them as breathing pretty much and if someone needs help they're going to do a spell for them to help and he Likens it to something like um if someone's drowning you're not going to stop and ask them if they want help and wait for them to give you permission you're just going to reach out and help pull them to Shore and so that's how he talks about doing magic for other people that's more their belief system you just do the magic to help someone you don't ask them if they need it you just do it grab on to your broomstick witches back after these messages hey all you witches pagans heathens and magical Souls shell and I want to give a big thank you to all of our donating patrons and we want to remind you that if you become a donating Patron before April 8th we'll be doing a drawing for a tarot reading by shell during the solar eclipse all you need to do is sign up to donate to the show by April 8th thank you so much to everyone who's Dona to back on the broomstick it really helps out the show keep it witchy right and you know you and I actually talked about this the other night and when you told me that I was like you know you know what you're freaking on to something you know obviously with anything there is a line in the sand but you can be on the good side of that line and still be doing spells to help people without their quote unquote permission but you know there's always a line don't cross it and it's a good reminder that things can be very very different from one belief system to another that doesn't make it bad that just means it comes from a different Viewpoint just like this one does I see this Viewpoint and I I really appreciate it and I like it and honestly you and I have never done well with the you know an it harm none do what you will and a little bit to don't do magic on someone without their permission but there are times when we have done magic because someone really needed that help what we're good at Lea what we're good at is when our consequences oh I'm just going to let that one sit there for a minute because that was good but you know even though I find Dream Magic hard part of it is because you know that as much as I am the Scribe of the world with books of Shadows you know I technically hate journaling you do I do a lot of dream workor kind of is based around journaling that so as you can imagine not my forte and and it's not something I'm going to practice for me personally but I did think it was a very good informative book that is very useful for a lot of folks just not my personal jam and actually and I hope she's listening and she'll have it by the time this airs I am actually gifting this book after we record this episode to my high priestess and my coven because I know it's her Jam yeah everything doesn't always have to click with you perfectly but Elohim Lear does have a chapter on the dream journal right in this book you know I and I saw that and I was like man he must be friends with ilila because everything goes back to journaling and meditation it does though it does they talk about it in this book too but I am going to put out there for people that dream interpretation is highly personal while you can look at a book like this dream witchery and get an idea of what different symbols and things mean dreams they are so personal it's not even funny there's archetypes and things that will carry over like we've talked about before the idea of Santa Claus if you say that to pretty much anyone in the world we're all going to come up with pretty similar ideas but it's still a personal thing it's just like you know like you like the bone throwing thing that is highly personal because you pick your own charms and Bones you know tarot I might see something in a card that you see something totally different you know it's all what you make of it a snake in a dream to me is going to signify wisdom it's going to be magic it's going to be subconscious whereas I'm going to be like we're all gonna die a snake exactly exactly very very different things so a snake for Shell would mean danger and warnings and be a bad thing whereas a snake for me would mean wisdom very very different things so you have to when you're doing dream interpretation journaling is key because you really have to write down how you felt when you saw those things in your dream you're the one making up the interpretations not a book that's right the book can help give you pointers and guide you in directions but you really have to listen to yourself and your subconscious when you're doing dream interpretation so fabulous book by Elohim Lear for Dream Magic it is packed full of spells rituals exercises recipes and information it's a good read I really liked it six brooms six brooms just a reminder that the broom rating system is completely arbitrary made up means nothing and is subject to change if we change our minds but we stand by it wholeheartedly 100% back it completely now book number three I have a new author I am in love with and his name is Jake Richards okay so good OMG Backwoods witchcraft conjure and folk Magic from Appalachia by Jake Richards I love his style of writing I feel kind of like I'm having a conversation as opposed to maybe a lecture I love the stories about the great grandma and the grandma and it's just very relatable and I like how it's kind of like well this is what my family did and six miles down the road Joe Blow did it different I really like I don't know everything about this book I really do you know I'm so glad that we have these last two together just like the first two because Backwoods witchcraft was well written Rich information lot of stories and it made it all very relatable right just like Byron Ballard's book I feel like these two books go together so well it's the same kind of magic it's that same kind of appachan folk magic I feel like they're talking about I don't want to say the same but different but you got you know small Magics H Byron Ballard this is about Appalachian folk magic Backwoods witchcraft Jake Richards also about Appalachian folk magic but they're not the same book no and I love that and they're both written in a very conversational this is your friend right I could practically hear Byron talking when I read her book I heard it in her voice like you're being talked to yeah yes and you're just right there with both of them you feel like you're in an intimate conversation with someone who is steeped in this aalan folklore magic information and you know with Jake's book I like how there's kind of again that try it there's some you know howtos uh give this a try here's how this ritual how we do it how I do it how my family does it and I like the quote unquote household magic this is what me and my grandmother and my great-grandmother did but I can't tell you what the neighbor did because the neighbor probably did something different but this is what we did in our house I want to take it back for just a minute here you and I grew up you grew up very much in a Pennsylvania Dutch Christian religious but with all this folk magic those people are practicing powow magic I don't care what they told me growing up that's what it was that's what it was and my Ames Appalachian Mountain Hill people we had rituals they did things when a baby was born they talked about people who had the site they talked about people who could help cure you I wasn't allowed to wear white shoes after Labor Day what I don't even know why but my grandma said no or bad things would happen bad things would happen there you go you weren't supposed to whistle in the house you know there was things in the woods that you weren't supposed to talk to if you saw if you drop a knife you can't use it different signs and symbols and a lot of them wrapped up in Christian symbology much like in elohim's book a lot of the South American folk magic has Christian themes running through it again it's a blending of things of Family Folk magic with very strong Christian streak through it I don't know about you shell but I think I kind of pushed a lot of that away when I left and went into witchcraft I was like well I'm leaving that folk Christian magic behind as you know because you've known me for as you know I never was able to kick uh Pennsylvania Dutch hex sign oh those are awesome I grew up with them my Grandma had him in the kitchen my mother had him in our kitchen I ended up having a set and as much as I did kind of buck all of that the one thing I never was able to to kick was the the hex sign love and I think that I turned I turned away from it because of its association with Christianity and it hasn't been until you know the last five seven years that I've started to you know I can hear my grandmother when I'm cooking or making fires cider or you know putting incense or something together I hear her advice a lot and so I think the remembering the folk magic part of it that part that's you know very old and connects us with our ancestors I think a lot of us across the country are incorporating that even if we we don't take all of it you know well I I remember telling you when we first got these books the first thing that made me want to do was go to my storage unit and yank out all of my pennsylvania. hech signs and hang them up this kind of struck a cord and what I like about the theme of kind of all four of these books is this is what I do or this is what we do but I'm not negating what you do and what you do is equally is awesome and right and respected but this is what we do but it's different two houses down yeah this is my fire recipe from my family I enjoy your fires cider recipe but I know it's different you know they're still the same thing the thing with a lot of this folk magic is there is a lot of quote unquote the same but different yeah and it really depends on the blend of who your people were who were the people that settled that land that you're living on we're not even going to get into the Native American influences because there were so many different tribes particularly up through the New England area where we live and you know all over this country that for good or for bad talk about post colonized yeah they left their Mark as well and they were so different and then you have the Irish and the Scottish people you have the Dutch people the Germans and you know people came from all over and they're still coming from all over and I think that's the best part of the US is when things kind of blend like this well you know as an adult looking back I kind of laugh at my family at least my mother's side if anybody on my mother's side is listening I apologize but I laugh because even though they ended up in my generation in the Southern Tier of New York state that part of my family is actually from like mid Pennsylvania and you know these people came to America the ones that went to Pennsylvania specifically to kind of start their own religious movement because they were trying to get away from religious persecution in Europe and that kind of in a roundabout way is where the Pennsylvania Dutch thing came came from but yet they just basically in my opinion they just mixed witchcraft in like Methodist SL Baptist beliefs and one big freaking happy ball and call damn Pennsylvania powow like I love these hex signs but you know what they really are in my opinion they're spells made with pictures they're basically like sigils literal sigils Math Magic Shell they are sigils they're they're mathematical beautiful geometric sigils they are magic absolutely yeah there's a marriage one there's a a love one there's a happiness one you see them on barns a lot yeah there's some to encourage fertility there's some to encourage safy exactly they're absolutely spells oh I'm gonna have to do we're gonna have to do a whole episode on paow Magic because but but my point my point is is that I love that how all of these books kind of show you the diversity of what folk magic really is because you know when you're talking about certain Traditions you know like alexandrian for example not a lot of diversity there's a certain way it is that's the way it is you follow that way with this it's whatever floats your boat man you know we talk about that all the time do what makes you happy and that's almost the basis of folk magic and we also are big on tradition and doing things this way because you know it feels good and you have the backing of it's been done this way by your family and there is power in that there's magic in that you know it's okay to change that too um and do it your own way so I think that's that's kind of why folk magic is having a Resurgence right now it's one thing to say some ancient Yahoo from God knows where doing God knows what did this is different than my great grandma did it my grandma did it my mother did it my father did it my grandfather did it like it's different right this is my granny's recipe for unhexing oil you know that hits different I got a Pennsylvania folk magic thing for you that my grandma my great grandma did and I have to share this with you guys because this is so ridiculous I think it's ridiculous if you didn't feel good you know what they made you eat what's that tomato soup with a big old fat pad of butter melted on it who the hell eats tomato soup with butter my family that was their like freaking folk remedy if you didn't feel good you had to have tomato soup with butter on it nowadays I'm like no wonder everybody had cholesterol issues but hey for them that was some superstitious freaking mid Pennsylvania remedy and if you told my grandma you were sick you were having damn tomato soup with a paded butter in it well mine it was garlic and peppers pretty much so yeah I'd rather the garlic and peppers so granny recipes are definitely a lot of fun but these books I enjoyed reading them the last two very conversational very interesting they cover a lot of ground you know I want to quote a line from H Byron bad's book on the back because this is like the damn truth it's as you're having a face-to-face lesson with her on her porch that is exactly how this book reads legit but I say the same thing about Backwoods witchcraft it's like sitting and and having a convo love it I agree they were great I actually recommend all four of these books even though dream witchery is not my vibe it is a really good book all four of these five man yeah fantastic they were all really great I agree I recommend all of them if you're looking for spells in particular dream witchery has it heavily Christian flavored heavily South American magic flavored yeah and that is why probably it's not my vibe but if that's your thing man this is the book for you I will say that the North American folk magic is not a textbook it is actually a very good read with lots of information in it and substitutes as a weapon no I'm just kidding I kidding I'm kidding no she's not it's huge it's thick it is thick though but you know small Magics love I cannot wait by the way I know you said this the beginning but I can't wait to say it again I cannot wait to meet H Byron Ballard at Sacred Space I'm just saying that and if she listens to our podcast she probably doesn't because she's way cooler than us but if she does I can't wait to meet you and what it says on the back of that book that it's just like sitting with her it literally is she's just she's awesome she's the cutest but like I said also when it comes to folk magic uh info Jake Richards my new fave gotta say it my new fave love how he writes loves love his style love his message love what he's got to say excellent books so my tea is empty though shell I drank all my tea and I'll be honest with you I smoked all my pipe too and mine's empty as well so we want to thank you all for joining us yet again in the solarium next time we'll make
