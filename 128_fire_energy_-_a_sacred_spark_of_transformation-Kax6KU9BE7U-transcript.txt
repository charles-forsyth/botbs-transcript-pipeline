back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and welcome to part three of our five-part Elemental Series this episode focuses on the elements of fire fire is bold passionate transformative and working with the energy of fire can help give your practice that extra energy boost you may have been looking for and getting super excited about the fire the passion and I just can't help it and Layla I would like to talk and open this episode with a brief conversation about the moon for a minute so we can talk about the movie can absolutely talk about the moon for minute I'm glad you brought up the moon because I have an interesting coincidence coming up in my life involving the upcoming new moon actually now before you tell me about your coincidence funny you mention the new moon so prior to a skidding on you mentioned something that I've never heard of and I would like to talk about this with the people  so people we're going to discuss what is a black moon all right so I was on the old Reddit and actually later in the episode I have a question that someone on the back on the broomstick subreddit ass and we'll talk about that but I saw a bunch of people asking what are you going to be doing for the black moon right now because I'm feeling old because I'm not sure what's going on so I was confused myself I thought you know Black Moon Dark Moon new moon maybe they're just talking about the new moon and I was kind of right they are talking about the new moon so Black Moon explain this to me because I'm having a wrapping my head around it and I had to look this up because I never heard of a black movie actress sure why so if any of my astrology friends out there know if this actually doesn't see you that make this new moon kind of special email us actually  if you happen to know when astrology guy and he happens to be a little sooner so I'm going to hit hit my my buddy Tim up and ask him and on earthsky.org I did find that black moon is a relatively new term this came up probably in the 1980s and it may have started as a Wiccan wait we were wiccans in the 90s and I still never heard of a black moon the gasses that possibly wiccans in the eighties coin Black Moods mean the second new moon in a month much like a blue moon you heard of a blue moon good ones and a right once in a blue moon is when there is thirteen full moons within the 12-month period and that  13th moon is the Blue Moon yes that is one definition of a blue moon and it was also misrepresented back in the 40s 1940s I believe it was mistakenly thought to be the second full moon in a month so now sometimes people will say a blue moon is the second full moon in a month so their does colloquially what people say a word but that's not what this particular Black Moon is one of the other definitions is a seasonal Black Moon which happens about every thirty-three months according to earth guy they say that it's the third of 4 new moons in a season only happens every 33 months and that's the one that's happening this particular August 23rd so I'm not sure if there's any  Titian all magical oomph to this is what we're saying the same qualities as any new things sometimes that can be when you send stuff off to the void particularly if you got that moment of the Darkmoon exactly sometimes it's great to meet to do that so maybe the special event just means that that energy has Amplified similar to a blue moon so I guess I would treat it is the Blue Moon of dark Moon's maybe special maybe it's not you'll have to go out on that night or around that night and feel that energy for yourself and see if it feels any extra specially to you I know I'll be out checking it out she has just always special to be honest now what I found my new bestie Shannon and I are starting the community in Corning New York  our meet-and-greet day as August 23rd and it just so happens to be the day that a local group is doing a pagan pipe Moonlight Oddities Market in the area and it's the black moon we're kind of excited about that I think that just means auspicious beginnings and I'm very excited to start something new on the new moon now you had to say it so I just want you to Quick tell people's where and how they can be a part of this group we have started this is going to be a learning Class A meet-and-greet if he can get together the first Saturday of every month although in September we're starting the 2nd Saturday but the first meeting is August 23rd and it's just kind of a meet-and-greet get to know people and it'll be at the southeast Steuben County Library in Corning I will also be having rituals sabots and SP  at The UU Church in Big Flats as well so we're going to be doing all sorts of things are some local businesses that might get involved shell might get involved were going to have all sorts of workshops were going to be doing some great things in the area but I have a feeling I'll make a surprise appearance now and again you better I will you know I will it wouldn't be the same without you and you'll be posting stuff on our socials so if folks are looking to catch that in person please do Cuz I'm super jelly that I can and definitely send the message if you want to reach out to Layla or the Crystal City Circle book group if you are in the area and want to join that as well so it's pretty cool I'm excited new things are happening I'm seeing red I'm seeing Orange what's that mean  and fire is fabulous for this topic because you know it's that fire under your ass because you're going right it's that fire of determination it's the passion to start new things so how fitting you know actually now that you say that that his damn fit in there itself has been something that people have reached for for literally thousands of years by your head came to people we learned how to cook food with every time and days we learned that it kept the scary things in the nighttime away we could use it to defend our homes we could use it to defend our families we could use it to keep ourselves warm in the winter time so that Memaw doesn't freeze to death and it made a difference and it was magical that difference was so big it was magical to people with powerful  Life by your is life and fire was protection and it banished evil and it was very clear to see that this magical creature this creation that breathes and eats and grows would protect me if I was careful with it and that's the other cool thing about fire is out of the four basic elements fire is the only one that will hurt you if you touch it it can also protect you it can also cleanse you it's kind of a go to and the other thing with fire is it's the only one that's not easily found in nature are is everywhere water Earth everywhere fire requires something special it requires lightning it requires friction it requires something extra and that's why there's a lot of myths involved with fire as well all the stories about how people got fire involve tricking a god usually or some type of theft  Prometheus yeah isn't that wild Prometheus in Greek myths he stole it from the gods he was kind of mad at them anyways cuz I think they killed all those family or something and so he brought it to humans even though he was punished greatly for Fraternity for bring you fire to humanity there's a lot of Native American legends in Cherokee Legends grandmother spider I think a couple other creatures try to steal fire but grandmother spider is able to steal it and puts in a clay pot and brings it down to people and give it to them so that they can be warm through the winter if it's all over the world there are so many but they're all involved fact trickery of some kind but you had to take fire because Fire doesn't just exist if you get lucky each of people might have stumbled across tree that had been struck by lightning that had fire but you don't usually just stumble across fire its special it's magical  is beneath our feet you know we've talked about are aerosol around us it's what we fire is something we must seek out we must obtain it's not just there and in your condition in your coven tradition is Celtic and they they do things in threes it's the sky the Sea and the land and all the fyre festival well you know fire is still super super important even in that tradition extremely important and every tradition but I think maybe different Traditions as they should kind of put different emphasis on what is what is there priority might not be the right way to say we're going through at the time you know you you look at what the Native Americans were going through isn't necessarily the same is say what the Vikings were going through different climate you know different  a different landscape so there are going to be more focus on one or two or three more so than another one or two or three differences they all still have similar stories of someone feeding fire from the gods to bring the people I think that's really cool but that's a Common Thread instead of stealing fire when we talked about working with fire so this is why fire has been so fascinating to people they used it for protection it has protective qualities because you know if you light a candle in a dark room it immediately feels warmer and safer and and a little nicer but it also takes away the Shadows it takes stray so you get that warmth from it but you get that illumination from it you can do divination with it there's there's a lot to be garnered from fire  I was thinking you know when we we had talked about fire was our next topic I was like cheese you know where am I going to take this conversation was fired because I always start with candle magic candle magic with fire is so accessible and it's so potent there's someone so much you can do with it well when I think the thing I liked about fire magic the most and you you hit the nail on the head with a accessible you know I know we have a lot of folks that are still inside the broom closet they have to be cognizant of who knows you know what they're doing and in in such and you can burn a candle and have it be very non witchy for an outsider to see and you can put a lot of intention into that you can add herbs you can put sigils on it you know whatever the case maybe you can do a lot of magic with a candle without someone in the outside world knowing what you're doing  so I find it to be super accessible as it is a means to connect with magic and connect with the fire element or just Elemental Magic and general firing candles to me is a really big go to a lot that we had mentioned earlier so passionate it's Drive its transformation which is a good one talk about Earth Transformers things too and it's fun and a lot of a lot of Wheels like Earth is north and fire is South like they're in balance with each other and they're both transformative elements the Earth transforms things really really slowly I was just going to say I think whichever you choose to use for transformation was going to depend on how quickly you need that transformation because is going to be the slow roll it slow painful roll  my opinion when you transfer with it some more gentle transformation where is when you transfer energies that should say the jobs going to get done in a quick like fashion you know sometimes you got to get burn to move forward and was holding it back and then New Growth can start again it is that destructive and creative Force it's a destructive cleansing and sometimes sometimes we all need a little destructive thing in our lives I think that sometimes fire is the most blunt element to work with you know you work with water it's very gentle Earth is very calm but are is very pointed and to the point and get the job done and you know no sugarcoating things no beating around the bush it's just point A to point B with nothing hold  back in the middle very pointed and it's one of those because that transformative purifying can switch to destruction yeah and painful in an instant if this control and the respect isn't there and you know ironically enough that's that's kind of part of the the association I give it when it comes to you know passion love and lust which can often times be associated with fire because passion love and lust can be the greatest in the worst have some we've all been there you can be so high and so happy and it can drop you to the depths of Despair so yeah I can bring it to your knees and soul out of your nostrils  are you been there but you know fire can also then is a part of that transformation kind of burn that stuff you need to shed that stuff you need to get behind you you need to get past that you need to move forward and that transformative fire can also as much as it can kind of burn you it can then like you said clear the way for bigger better and greater transformation is not always easy and it's not always slow and you don't have a deck of tarot cards you don't have your Oracle deck you don't have your rooms are whatever it is that you use  you can always fall back on fire as well as a form of divination and in I guess where my point in saying this is is I've sometimes looked at the element of fire is a gateway between this world and the other world and divination is a good way to utilize the element of fire to kind of crossover that Gateway and if you know as you would if you were doing a reading or he knows throwing ruins or whatever divination you use just as you and I know we've done episodes are we talked about Maris crying is crying and Flame is equally useful and effective and because of that fire is an element that I see is a bridge between the worlds I love that you called it a portal or Bridge because the fire is one of those things that it's very easy for people to get into an alpha State like how often have you caught yourself have you  someone stare into a fireplace or stare into a camp fire or a candle flame it's so easy to just kind of unfocused your case and get lost in the moment and zone out and send it to me before you know what you've been staring into that fire and just all these things are popping into your head just kind of softly here and there and you don't even know where your brain is going because it's so easy to get into that meditative State just buy softly gazing into a fire and you know what's funny you mentioned like the campfire cuz my mind wasn't thinking that in the moment but I can send back to many a time and I know you've been in the same mental state community and we're either sitting around that ritual fire or dancing around the fire or drumming around that ritual fire doing the same thing and it's almost like  because it was a ritual fire in the atmosphere that we created right that are round that fire but you stare into that fire long enough you do transport yourself to another place and all right I'm going to tell the story I was going to save this for some day when we had genital Andrew on the show to talk about avalani and magic for this is so fitting for here I got to tell her now back in the day when I was a young witchling I was the only witch that I knew for a long time and then I went to Salem Massachusetts and I met some other witches and I also managed to meet someone at my college she and I started working together and we decided we were going to do like a challenge before we dedicated ourselves and I had a friend who had some land and we hopped on a four-wheeler at night and we went driving across these fields now this was I don't know early summer I guess and we're going across these fields and a lot of them  separated by 3 line so we come through these trees into an open field and she'll I have never seen so many fireflies in my entire life as I saw that night it was thick you almost had to swim through the fireflies to get unfortunately we have a look at these fireflies it was so magical but we continued on and we got to the woods where we're going to spend the night and they had a little Treehouse that was there a little fire pit and everything and we went off into these little walks in the woods and then we came back and we have some bread and cheese and we built a little fire for the evening the evening by to open Avalon we wanted to open the gateway to Avalon I don't know what we were thinking we hadn't even planned this was like a spur-of-the-moment thing or just like  oh we did to all my goodness so we pulled in all these energies and we had this incense like those loose incense we had created and we tossed it in the fire as work opening this Gateway and it was just a handful of some herbs it wasn't even that much and it was very very Smokey up here have zero clue what actually happened I have no explanation for that so I'll get there hold on so the flame seem to get bigger like we have thrown extra Log on the Fire or something and the smoke started pouring out of the fire we kind of looked at each other and when we looked back through the Smoke on the other side of the fire I could see what look like 45 inch round lily pads it looks almost like lily pads to me glowing bright green  single-file going from where the path was just beyond our fire pit curving off in between two trees where it disappeared my jaw dropped I had no idea what that could be I looked at her and I saw that she was looking in the same area I was now this friend was a little bit of a you know tend to exaggerate things but I was just going to say I actually now that the more you tell this I've actually heard this story and I heard it from the person you went with yeah and I've actually heard it almost word-for-word how you're saying it from her now I was not going to say anything because I wanted to know for sure that she was seeing what I was thinking she says are you seeing green glowing lily pads on the other side of the fire I was like holy shit yes I do and my first thought was owed am I going to follow them and then she goes I'm not going are you going  just right then I thought if I go I'm not coming back and I said no I'm not going exactly then they disappeared oh my God we ran over with our flashlights and could find nothing no Foxfire Moss no phosphorescent anything no paint no markings no nothing neither of us had any clue what it had been I still to this day other than maybe we did open a gateway to Avalon I do not know what happened because we actually have done that before us separate from this story so I do believe that you probably did that day when we did it I didn't see any green glowing lily pads and unfortunately I was like you know why didn't I go but yeah so that's one of those fires crying things did we put ourselves in a hypnotic State and happened to see the same thing maybe did we open a paw  to Avalon looking into flames by scrying in those flames you can get yourself into an alternate state of mind and get yourself very easily into a meditative Alpha state where then divination comes very very clear do you have any particular ways you like to do fire divination who what when where and why if I say out in the woods you know like we had been you're just kind of in a ritual fire and it just starts coming to you you just let it go there's been times where I have purposely okay let me see let me have a conversation with the flame here and you know more often than not if I'm doing that I'm doing a candle flame and a lot of it is just kind of feeling that energy of the fire you know I do I know it hurts but I generally if I'm going to do something I working with the element of  or I will put my hand where you're from and maybe put it on the flame a little bit kind of lick the flame I guess is the best way to say it let the flame lick you let the flame like me but just kind of getting in tune with that life force energy that he what does that heat mean are you bringing that heat to you know your love life we bring that heat to definition you know what are you bringing that into a kind of focusing in on that you don't have to visualize is match with fire I don't think you know what are you know obviously you know are is all around you but you're like my feeling it am I feeling it but with fire there something it's something that you can you can feel that he you can see that flicker you know you can't always feel that calmness and that you know solidarity of the Earth  you know you know there's dirt under your feet but that's about it you know you see that flicker of the fire and you feel all that energy emanating to use that our your spouse or or to power your divination if that's what you're doing I know you're going to hate this but I highly recommend any type of fluid and have something to write with right there or have your phone on to record because sometimes especially if I'm doing flame divination I find it very easy for me to go into trance with flame so I don't like to use fire for General divination because I tend to go too deep with fire it's super super easy for me to get very very close to that beta brainwave state where you're very much in a trance State I wouldn't be doing divination for others I'm just saying that because of being in that deeper trance State and that that can happen very easily for some people harder for me to remember what I said in a deeper to  I'm state so it's really nice to have someone record you or if you can write down or have someone else write down whatever you say cuz you might forget it's almost like a dream state and so those Visions can quickly go out of your mind afterwards so to having a way to record it as soon as you can either while you're in that trance day and getting those messages or mediately afterwards is vital because it's so easy to forget when you kind of get in that very deep fryer trance are you literally trying to tell the listeners to get ready now I'm telling you to double your journaling get a buddy to do it with you if you really that far deep into that into that trance state if you really do get very deep especially with something like fire divination you might not be able to write it down yourself you might be able to say it so having something like your phone or whatever to record you or to have someone else write it down  or you can be very helpful so yeah I guess I'm telling you to journal with a friend just so we don't so we don't forget to kind of mention this cuz we've talked about correspondences with all of the other elements that we've touched on so far so I just want to talk a few minutes correspondent says girl here so I like to think of my and a guy that's going to depend on what's my intent are we going rose petals and love are we going cayenne pepper says you kind of equate to the element of fire not necessarily flame fire but the element fire and peppers and he meant and pepper I like meant because it's there's a bite to it but it's not as sharp as if you want just a little bit of a little bit  little bit of passion you need a nudge Memphis good for that you know you don't want the burn of pepper but for Stones I like pyrite Fool's Gold is one of my favorites I love that partly because Pyromania pyrite I don't know if they really have the same basis but they sound the same so I like it plus it's sparkly and also Carnelian I love Carnelian is a firestone I have a cool little spell pause for you using a fire basically even though it's a stone so one of the things you can do have you ever been doing a spell where you have to burn a candle for a long time and you don't have time to burn it all the way down you can take a Carnelian and have it paused that spell for you in the way you do it is to take the Carnelian and you hold it up against the flame you don't have to touch the plane but hold it right next to the flame of the candle that you're  and say the flame be gone the spell lives on and then douse the flame with the Carnelian and just set the Carnelian there next to the candle and the Carnelian will hold the flame of the spell until you're able to come back and finish burning the spell I love that I actually love that and that great it's the stone is that right it's that slow it's going to hold it for you but it's still the flame Carnelian so I can hold that energy of fire so it'll pause that spell for you until you come back then just touch the stone to the candlewyck and thank the stone for holding a flame and say the spell carries on and then Spike the wiccan off Hugo know I also want to mention for me this is amazing you know on the altar Salinas firefighters firefighters South South is red flame fire South red  the maze in the South some people might like to have worms in the South I'd also don't mind I am a convert I have said in the past that I didn't like them but I am now convert to electric battery candles you know sometimes we got to do what we got to do and we've used them and they were I mean it's not a fire we get it but you know when you're trying to do a ritual and get a hotel conference battery operated they were fabulously and I've used them several times on altars and they are wonderful representation electricity is a form of the element of fire and the battery is creating electrical charge so I can see it like it's not the warmth in the flame that I'd like a lot of but like I got the whole battery how you can associate the battery piece to Fire and if you can't have a flame you can even bring up a fire on YouTube and I think that works perfectly fine  do what you gotta do  okay I have an exercise for people to work with fire energy to begin to feel by our energy and like a lot of these things this one involves another element again the breath so for this particular decided to recommend that you use a real candle in a real flame so make sure that you use all safety precautions but that and being a safe quiet place you might want the room to be a little damn or a little dark I mean we are working with a candle flame here and you want your focus to be directly on the Flames to buy lowering lights you can eliminate a lot of the visual distractions around you and it'll make it easier for you to keep your focus just on the flame so save your space with a candle in front of you with your lighter or matches and take a few deep breaths to settle yourself and then focus on the candle and just think about flame and the energy of fire is being the reason that you're there because deep studying breath in through your nose and imagine that are going to the fire in your belly the fire at the center of you  almost like a Bellows you know stoking that fire with it in a little bit and then breathe out through your mouth and feel how that cool air that came in through your nose has transformed a little bit In the Heat of your body and it's just ever so slightly warmer and once you feel centered at your lighter and light the candle you can say something if you want you don't need to it could just be I call to the spirit of fire I welcome you here in this teaching moment but you can say whatever you want or nothing at all Begin by looking at the flame just gently fix your Gaze on the flame don't stare hard as soft and steady or even allowed to but just look at the flame notice it notice the colors look for that study base that shall mention earlier look for the flickering blue the flickering orange watch How It's answers on the way I would Breathe  then as you notice the flame flickering and shifting pay attention to your breath and how close your breath is to that flame so this time as you inhale I want you to intentionally exhale or is the flame so as you're looking at this flickering flame inhale and imagine that the warmth of that plane is coming in and then as you exhale carefully you don't want to blow it out just gently carefully exhale and notice as the flame move in reaction to your breath  so the next time you do it do it with intention readin slowly about a four count so as you're breathing in read in the warmth of that flame the energy the creation the safety whatever energies you're feeling as you look at that plane free those positive energies in and watch and see if that affects the flame at all and then breathe out gently 6 7 or 8 count against don't blow the flame out but just gently breathe out in the direction of the flame and breathe out and release stagnation the doubt any negative energies that you're holding within them gently to the flame and then watch the flame Flicker and move as it burns away that negative energy or you can breathe in the positivity light radiant and then breathe out to that flame whatever you no longer need attention  exhaustion apathy year was let it go feed that to the flame you might begin to feel the flame at the core of your belly begin to warm up a little bit with this exercise begin to match the energy of the flame dancing on the candle in front of you once you start to feel that connection was you start to feel that warm as fries for a little bit with the candle just feel those energies that bond between you and the flame as you both breathe in and out and then just kind of left that go for a few minutes 35 minutes is fine and then sank the flame you can say whatever you want if nothing else fire loves boldness and honesty so be bold be honest they whatever you want you to the flame and thanks to Flame First Energy for its lesson for its light and put out the candle know some people have it too stinks ideas on how you should put out a candle some people say  you should never blow out a candle because that's disrespecting the flame with are they say you should always snuff it but then there's people that say you should never snuff a candle be cuz that's disrespecting the flame with her so maybe you should lick your fingers and snuff it but oh wait that's water so I say use whatever Implement will most safely but that flame go back to his Elemental energy whatever way you like works just fine so put out the candle and then journal or through Flex on how you felt on any insights or any thoughts that you have it or did you feel it up in any way that you feel ready to burn away something what projects or what new ideas are ready to ignite to put all that in the journal put it all down and this is a simple exercises you can do with a fire maybe you want to do it in the morning before you do your journaling or in the evening before you do your tarot pulse but it just a moment to work with the flame and to feel that fire energy so do you have any other  bells or anything like that that you like to do you spell work that I like to do is sometimes you just got to be done with stuff and I'm a fan of writing things down and burning of them maybe it's the Pyro in me I don't know but you know maybe you need to banish a thought or an idea or a person out of your life and writing that down on a piece of paper or a bay leaf or whatever the case may be and burning it in that fire you know there's something to be said for that even if it just soothes my soul watching it go up in Flames there is nothing faster than fire and it's usually permanent whereas if you want someone out of your life and you put them in the freezer for a freezer spell you know a son saw them and I still got to deal with them at some point cuz they're in your freezer but if you burn that paper that connection is severed could be a saw or an idea or a pattern that you want to kick or you know habits you're trying to get rid of you know we we know that I'm  smoker you know maybe I'm going to get to the point where I don't want to smoke anymore and I'll write that shit down and there's something in my mind to be said for burning of thought and idea whatever the case may be in having that flame released at 5 or that spell out into the universe and like you said it's like it's kind of like do this now you know a very permanent thing there's no going back so like I said I don't have like a phrase or anything to give folks but you know if you're looking to put something behind you to banish something to be rid of something I once taught and words into it speak to the candles speak to the universe talk about how you are looking to push this thing I thought idea person whatever the case may be out of your life and then burn that shit that's also something that if we're talking about getting rid of Spell components if you have put out an offering or if you have done a spell disposing of that spell  proper way that matches the intention of your spell is important and so sometimes at the end of the spell you might want to burn all of the components are the best way to release the spell is to burn that shit remember to burn things safely only burn things that you should be on one incident here people requires the which to pay attention it requires your respect it requires you to be careful it requires you to pay attention you know as much as we think of fire in circle or you know in a work as a component of our magic you know how I was raised I would be remiss if I did not say if you have permanent ritual space it might not hurt you to have a fire extinguisher on hand because you never know  my coven love these folks we have a fire blanket in our ritual area because you don't know fire is to be respected because fire decides what it cleanses sometime it's not you and we do not ever want to see any harm come to any folk so be safe people and I like to think that that transfers over to the magical realm as well as one of those energies that if you're not in control of it it will be in control of you so working with it can be very powerful it can bring you one of the places that can get you up off your butt it can give you that energy it can give you that full list that passion that drive take you down to burn you out if you're not careful if you put too much passion into a project you might not be able to finish it you might find that you put so much energy into it  it's not going anywhere or have you put all that energy into this project and now you don't have energy for anything else in a wire for anything else or to finish the project fire can quickly go from this amazing beautiful bonfire thing is out of control and consuming everything so what you're saying is you need a literal and a spiritual fire blanket with you that's right just like if you're going to be spending foyer at a festival or spending fire you always have a spotter you know all those good metaphors buddy oh gosh yes you need a fire buddy and a journaling buddy lots of buddies speaking of bodies I'm going to completely derail this and I'm going to go to a Reddit question for you lay it on me and our subreddit waxing moon 13 was talking about the elemental series that we've been doing here and they said that they were curious how we as to are  sign connect to each of the elements my first thought was to my element is a Taurus and he grounds my area perfectly and keeps me in Balance I do think I tend to work with Earth a lot more so even than are there I think I like the groundedness and the earthiness the centeredness of the element I work with that one pretty good but you do funny story so I'm an air sign you know are is probably the one I have the hardest time connecting with it's almost like I am like an alien to to my Association here and you know are is associated with east east is associated with yellow yellow is like my least favorite color or like somehow is  it's it's difficult for me it's difficult I feel like I was like my my Gemini twin was a fire sign first time I called an element in public was East are for the Pekin community that we both worked with and I thought that was very fitting and very cool but are to me seems almost too easy so I asked I also tend to avoid it a little bit just because it feels like eating this is easy I've always been a fan generally of either Earth in the North or West Water kind of that roots in the ground you know my feet are Doug and you know that solid that Oak Tree in the woods kind of thing my husband strongly because we need that groundedness I think that really helps to balance us and water you know I really I feel that I've been flow that that Evan flow I think of him  Landon me with such an emotional mess or I'm that conscious State of Trance head writer you know it's one of the other day I think you know I've always been okay with fire as well and in the South I just I've had a problem with East I always have we generally would call in familiars animal familiars and such as we called quarters like I would even have a hard time with like those associations with these feathered creatures scare me I just I don't know what my issue is with all things to East all right so I'm really easily for most people and I am no different emotions I think and the correspondences of fire are powerful and they're easy to see and feel emotions like anger are associated  with fire and anger is often the very first thing that we feel in a scary or frustrating situation because it's quick it's easy and sometimes in a dangerous situation that anger that quick action can see her life but those quick by your emotions are very often like a fire hose a literal flamethrower under Roofing volcano with no control and especially as an air sign I admit I'm a little angry sometimes so working with that fire in a productive way takes time and dedication so that you can pull in all the energy of that raging Inferno fine-tune it and direct it and make it a laser I agree but you know I think you'll recall a Time way back when I spent some time working with Pele and you know I am very very familiar with the explosive element that fighter bring into life and I think that sometimes with fire I almost look at it is the calm  send the chaos because fire can be very chaotic and when you look at a flame. Outside of that flame is dancing around chaotically but that inner white core is steady and steadfast in the middle will all of the rest is dancing around so sometimes there is some peace to be found in the chaos before fire to thrive it needs air so are in fire are always kind of I think closely associated because of that that piece of 41 to fully Thrive it does require the other it's also easy to raise energy for fire without using fire run you can dance you can get your heart rate up get a little sweaty if you can raise the heat on your body you raise the energy of fire just makes it very accessible that way and it's also easy visualization for a lot of people cuz a lot of people because  you heard that that fire in your belly you know that's a phrase people of her throughout life for a long time so they can I get what you're saying that so I think that sometimes visualizing fire without fire tends to be easier for people and you know your talk to respect it because it's dangerous but at the same time we have that ancient knowledge that is what keeps us safe and I think that's another reason why people can scry into a campfire so easily because that primitive brain says oh there's a fire here this fire will keep you safe and warm and protected and so it's easier to kind of slipped into that subconscious meditating brain is very very life and death  me to re Mansion we've got to love this coming spooky season we've decided to have a seasons of The Witch give away because we also love you just as much as anyone who sends US mail to our PO box that is postmarked between August 8th and October 1st will get an entry into our drawing what happens if there a benefactor Layla if their benefactor they are automatically entered and if your benefactor and you send in mail you can get two entries but only benefactors are allowed to have multiple entries everyone else can only enter one entry per person on October 10th we will take all of the eligible entries and we will do a random drawing and one lucky winner will win new seasons of The Witch Stalin Oracle so send us mail drop us a line  send us a letter send us a postcard you need to actually include your name and address because so we are going to need a clear name and address in case you are the winner Layla and I literally it's the two of us we do everything involving this show we are not taking your address and doing anything with it I promise you that it is for this purpose only but send us something and you know I love getting mail I love going to the PO box it's such a thrill when we get stuff this giveaway is void where prohibited and only eligible entries will be counted in the drawing for the full official rules please see our website back on the broomstick cam or click on the link in the show description of any of our Elemental series episodes and in the meantime we are going to continue with this Elemental series we have  coming up water and spirit and of course we will have the fire meditation coming out in a few days and eye out for that do you know I'm really excited because I think that  we're saving the best fun to for a last elements preference in its new tune in next week for one of shells favorites and in the meantime they wisest a wicked and don't get burned but keep it with qi
