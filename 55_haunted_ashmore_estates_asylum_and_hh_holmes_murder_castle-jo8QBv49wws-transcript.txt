several states of the USA tell each other true is Paranormal Tales of creepy ghosts elusive Cryptids and haunting True Crime all while smoking the dankest weed in the land telling the creepiest tales and bringing the sweetest herb I'm Lea and smoking whatever I can find I'm shell you got to start growing shell I've been telling you for years but you can't keep anything alive I can only keep cats and kids alive if it ain't kids and cats it comes to my house to die yeah if it's green she kills it it's pretty true but I'm almost positive I could get you to grow some really fine sticky icky weed I you know I'm so meticulous about certain things in my life and when it comes to plants all of that OCD goes out the window and I just can't [ __ ] alive as you know I've even tried to grow before and it was like the most heartbreaking epic fail that's true that's true despite your surprising best efforts usually you don't get as far as that with so the fact that you got it as big as you did I I I have to count that as win cats and kids man that's all I can do cats and kids so what are you smoking today shell since it's not homegrown obviously have you been back to Happy Valley lately you know I am actually going after we record today so I will be headed out there later this afternoon so I'm still at the moment still toking on some friend weed so I'll be wrapping up my friend weed later today and and and I'll be traveling up to Happy Valley and as you know last episode was my birthday it was it was and one of the things my wonderful husband got me was a couple grams of dabs I was just going to say I had to I just wanted to point out to our listeners I just noticed this so's talking with a torch in her hand and I'm got a torch it's a little mini torch it's about 6 in tall we're not talking any type of big blowtorch like your son-in-law was using there Lord no wonder you were afraid of dabs right talk about light your ass on fire if someone's pulling out a full-size blowtorch I would also be scared of dabs nope this is a little it's bigger than like a kitchen torch but smaller than a blowtorch my husband is here today he's going to be heating up our dab rig for me so you're going to hear the blowtorch in the background sounds like a rocket man you know I just got to tell you a real quick story everybody looks online we all love our little Instagram posts so I'm on Instagram I'm I'm scrolling through and there was this site and what caught my eye is it had tarot cards in the front and it looked like it had a crystal ball and this woman that's right up our alley right and this woman is like doing all this stuff in front of the crystal ball with her hands and has her nails done real pretty and I'm watching it I'm like oh look at the tarot cards look at the crystal ball and I look a little closer and she pulls her hands away it wasn't a crystal ball it was a bong oh awesome really right up our how fun is that no seriously it looked exactly like a crystal ball and it even had the base on it attached to the the glass part and then right on the edge it just had the little hitter piece and then on the other end of the ball it just had a little opening a little hole flush to the crystal ball and you sucked the smoke through the crystal ball I loved it I love that too that sounds amazing I want one you know me and glass I've always got to get the pretty glass but the fact that they made it look like a crystal ball it was perfect it was totally our thing we both should have one definitely so what kind of dabs are you smoking because you look like you're enjoying them a lot these are fantastic I have some Pink Sugar spelled with a z and some grapefruit sour o I love dabs because you really get the tpin the taste you know how sometimes when you you get weed and you you're like it's called you know grapefruit blah blah blah but it tastes nothing like grapefruit right A lot of times dabs will have some of that taste they'll will have some of that flavor whether added later as tpin or if you're lucky just fresh pressed right from the live plant I just want to be honest with everybody for a moment Leila is going to be cutting out some major coughing because she loves her dabs and she loves to cough to get off it's true and I also don't want you all to have to listen to me as I cough I'm just laughing but these are so so good and like we talked last time a lot of times the THC levels on these will be up in the 90% I wanted you were talking about tpin and I just wanted to say that I feel like dabs don't have that weedy Smoky flavor that they actually have flavor not to equate it to food but dabs have flavor we just sometimes it just tastes like weed you know like you can get the lemon strains that do taste citrusy and Lemony but weed tastes like weed smoke tastes like smoke but dabs have flavor oh they really do it is missing that combustion you don't get quite as much of that burnt taste or that smokey taste and the other thing I like about dabs is if you're not using a torch or if you get used to it when you are using a torch you can control the temperature there are even some what's called an e- nail which will heat up the dab rig for you and you can set it to specific temperatures why can't you use a big lighter on dabs because it won't get the the chamber that you're using to heat up the dab is basically it's a glass usually a quartz glass chamber kind of like a bowl on a bong and you heat that up and it holds the heat the glass in it and get actually red hot so you have to kind of know where that temperature is at the lower the temperature the more flavorful of a dab that you're going to get you those Turpin burn off at higher temperatures so a nice lower temperature is what they call sometimes a turp slurp because you're getting a you lose a lot of product it's a little bit product wasteful but it's very very tasty and you get all of the THC and all of the Tarpin is that why you can't really smoke Dabs and just like a regular glass pipe because it's just that's correct because yes it's you can smoke Dabs a lot of times my husband loves to make beautiful bowls I think the man was born to be a weed artist I swear he will take a bowl and he'll pack I I don't know he's such a mathematical guy but he packs these gorgeous artistic bowls he's like the weed Packer like the Starbucks guys who put the the pretty shapes into your foam he's like the weed Barista yeah the weed Barista yeah and then he'll put a little bit of resin and some hash on top and make it look all pretty you can put resin and dab different types of dabs on your bowl and smoke it that way your lighter will absolutely get you there it it'll burn it off and you'll get the THC and The Taste from it you just get more of it from a dab break the reason I ask and you know if you want more information on my thoughts and feelings on this particular product you're going to have to take yourselves way back to like episode three or four folks but one of the stores locally here to me did a thing last year for Valentine's Day and boy am I hoping that they are doing it this year for Valentine's Day because I'll be checking that out it's not Happy Valley but still this part particular product I'm in love I am on the lookout for rose petal joints man rose petal joints how'd you know I remember I'm so jealous they do use a rose petal paper on the insides what makes it super special is they actually put dabs in the weed when they roll it so you're getting like booster I mean yeah you're gonna pay $20 for a one gr pre roll but it's like doing a dab and smoking a joint Allin one and I do love the The Joint Artistry too and you can find them all over Instagram where someone will pack a cone joint and then wrap it with the wax and make beautiful designs on the outside of the paper so you can do it on the inside or the outside put it on your bowl put it in your joint it's an amazing booster with this for with this particular store they did it on the inside because the draw was the rose petal paper for Valentine's Day but yeah inside outside either way good [ __ ] so Char's going to be looking to obtain some of that here very quickly probably my favorite Vape of all time was when I first discovered Vapes it was a company in California called Mother Earth and they had a limited edition rose water flavor and I absolutely adored that flavor and they're gone the company is gone I can't find them anymore but rose petals as a joint it's such a delicate nice flavor that when Valentine's rolls around I'm going to buy out the rose petal joints of every single dispensary I can find because they're that good I love them I just I just like the I don't even know if it really had any difference in flavor do you think the rose petal paper really added flavor or anything other than Ambiance if it's just a pink paper no but if it's an actual rose petal paper with actual rose petals yeah this was yeah yeah this was I do there is a light Rose taste to it that I enjoy this was actual rose petal papers um I would say it was like more like a white like a clearish parchment papery type thing and it had rose petals imprinted on parts of the paper so it was more like paper that was created with shredded rose petals I'm looking for the on that are actual rose petals layers oh yeah you should look for those sh look for those it's a nice it's a lot of rose petal and it's a nice it's a nice flavor I think I what I remember from that Valentine's Day episode shell is that those joints hit you like a freaking truck they did and I'm actually I'm actually scrolling on their website right now to see if they have them I think the the selling point was when the bud tender told you oh be careful you should only get one because you're going to end up spending the entire night on the couch so you got three yeah yeah don't threaten me with a good time that's right I hope you can find those again let me know if you do I will I'll let everybody know if I can man I was loving those so despite getting really really high we are talking about some pretty amazing things tonight and it turns out we are both in the same state today you know actually I just want to say our friend Kay one of our listeners uh we talked about last episode she had inquired about us potentially chatting about the Ashmore Estates in Illinois so I'm going to Illinois too this is going to be an Illinois episode guys yeah I am going to Chicago Illinois to the very first serial killer in the United States o wow see when I think Chicago I think El Capone well yeah see I almost did a story on Al Capone but no so we're going actually to the murder house which is in Chicago Illinois or was well Ashmore Estates is in the town of Ashmore Illinois I don't know it's really weird because I found in one place it was called Ashmore Illinois then I found another place where it was called Charleston Township all I can really tell you is it's about an hour out of Chicago so what's going on with all these places that are right outside of Chicago because last week I did Bachelor's Grove Cemetery which is right outside of Chicago not only is the question what's going on with Illinois the question is why are we drawn to Illinois what is up with that so those of you in Illinois what's going on is there a Bigfoot convention there is the uaps UFOs all being there what is in Illinois I don't know maybe that spy balloon is floating over there at the moment maybe it's not a spy balloon maybe it's a bigf foot UFO thing you know I laugh I'm on the landing flight path and the takeoff flight path actually off Logan airport and so we'll see planes coming in at all different times of day and night different elevations and stuff I'll be outside having a cigarette and I'll see a weird light in the sky and I'll say to my boyfriend I'm like it doesn't look like a plane so it's got to be a UFO they're here I love that and he'll be like it is not a UFO I go does that look like a plane he's like not really and I'm like yep then UFO UFO 100% I don't understand how he does not see that logic exactly bad boyfriend exactly I mean come on it's obviously a UAP exactly exactly just like Bigfoot's real but you know he challenges me on that too different episode what do I need to come back out there and have a discussion with your man you might have to and you know um we actually we have a a follower on Instagram they follow us we follow them I'm Squatch watch and hey Squatch watch how's it going love you and so last night you know we're arguing about Bigfoot again and I'm using Squatch watch as my my defense because they were posting videos um of some there are videos boyfriend like and I told him I said look even Squatch watch has videos so there absolutely there are pictures and videos and we have told many many stories of sightings and examples and I told one where there were two two Sasquatch bodies were retrieved and taken away by Men In Black so obviously true the truth is out there the truth is out there so I just want to jump into this ashmar Estates asylums are right up your alley I hate those [ __ ] but they're so scary I feel like they're all the same it's you know I don't want to be like Debbie Downer about this but I feel like all of these stories have the same beginning middle and end um it's just the only difference is the location and maybe some specific type of activity going on let me see if I can sum it up beginning places created with the best of intentions that are actually horrific terrible things that people can do to each other check Place gets overcrowded and under bad management agement check so everything gos out of hand shuts down check after huge horrific things are discovered to have taken place there and becomes abandoned and then is rif with ghosts check what I you forgot in the middle of the whole grand reopening after the closing you forgot that second grand reopening where the story starts all over again that's true a lot of them did do that they had a second life as something else sometimes with just as shitty of an outcome before it became abandoned good point good point my bad yeah right I forgot that part asylums are your thing and you know as you can imagine as all of my Asylum stories start this one happened in the mid 1800s it's when it was built man not a good time to be alive my story is also in the mid 1800s it probably around the same time no [ __ ] so what you're telling me is the mid 1800s it was not cool to be living in Illinois no I would not have lived there if you had paid me at the time after you hear my story you would not want to be anywhere near there so this place was built like in 1850s and as a lot of these asylums started it was built as a poor farm like a lot of my other stories this kind of is the same thing it was built for where the government would house folks who didn't have anything right alms houses some some places were called alms houses actually this was referenced as an Alms House yes the college where we originally met on its grounds the nursing uh the nursing students they called Alms House those were originally had originally been alm's houses for the poor people in the area and now house the nursing students yep so this this was actually the same exact thing so from 1857 until 1869 it was actually a pore farm and it consisted of 260 Acres so as you can imagine this was a huge you know a huge Place yeah it had the railroad crossing it the Indianapolis and St Louis railroad crossed the property so that kind of that leads to some some of the ghosty things which I'll get to so they did have a guy that kind of ran the place and he was a jerk they were called inmates now at the alm's house so like the people that they were helping they referred to like they were jail prisoners correct oh wow so this guy that was running the thing during the time it was the poor farm the superintendent Oliver D Hawkins he kind of tried to run it like a regimented jail basically if you were too poor to take care of yourself then I am now the boss of you was a lot of times they thought people were poor because of a moral failing you know they were a bad person or so maybe he had the idea that if he just gave them the discipline that they needed right that kind of thing pull you up by your own bootstraps that was his attitude yeah um very strict like very drill Sergey kind of mentality okay like all of these places in that time did they had a small Cemetery for their burials on the north side of the grounds and in 1879 they had already recorded 32 deaths amongst the estimated 250 quote unquote inmates oh wow now you'd have to think a lot of that is prob they were malnourished maybe they were ill and untreated maybe they were old but a lot of those are probably deaths that just you know slipped through the cracks but then between 1870 and 1879 because it that guy was just a superintendent until until the it ended as a quote unquote poor farm in 69 do you think maybe he helped some of them kind of to be dead yeah I think he did but then it kind of turned into more of an asylum in 1870 between 1870 and 1879 they were able to find between 60 and 100 more graves in nine years correct wow now they had the commission of public Charities visit the place in 1902 they said that due to what the inmates suffered from heating by stove was sufficient now I've never been to Illinois I'm not gonna lie but they don't call Chicago the windy city because it's warm and sunny okay right we've all seen snowstorms in Chicago and like I said when you look at the map this looks like to be about an hour south of Chicago so like I can't imagine in the northern United States heating by stove in these Mass buildings not good like how you keep them warn what other than torture could that have been like what is the point of that due to who they are they only need gas stoves no that was the mentality that basically they weren't of a mental or physical class to really deserve it wow so then luckily uh like I said they said that the heating by the stove was sufficient it was okay to not have a regular system of ventilation as long as they opened windows and there was no plumbing and there was no fire protection so imagine you have 250 residents and no Plumbing wow like can we even talk about bathroom issues wow no bathrooms their ventilation is opening a window in the middle of winter their heat is a stove no fire protection were they trying to get this place to burn down and I don't know why they added this but it says As for the condition of the mentally ill they stated that there was no special Provisions for the insane none are locked up or restrained so they were just in general population with everybody else so you could have um an orphaned child housed with someone who is mentally and criminally insane yes or a a woman who just a widowed woman on the street with no means of income correct with every type of criminal with a rape criminally insane correct correct wow wow scary place that asylums in that time were so [ __ ] scary terrible terrible place I don't care if you call it a poror farm I don't care if you call it Asylum I don't care if you call it an Al's house they were [ __ ] holes okay total [ __ ] holes luckily by 1911 the State Board of Charities condemned the Alms House because it had verman infected walls rough floors small windows and improper ventilations and that flies swarmed everywhere and it was especially noticeable that the food that was prepared for the poor was especially swarmed with flies so not only are they e sh food but it's covered in flies so they were just giving them like the worst of the worst basically treating them like cattle yeah yeah in 1915 they were awarded Monies to basic basally construct new buildings and they create they built a new Alms House so they kind of were trying to you know how the story goes make good on it right basically they tore down all of the Rat infested [ __ ] and built new and started from scratch again well at least there's that at least they were trying to start fresh but then that's when they brought in more mentally insane criminally insane that's when it kind of trans positioned away from a PO house and more into like an asan asylum okay but let me just backtrack a second because I want to talk about one of the ghosts there while it was a poor farm during its Poor Farm days there was a a little girl her name was Elva Skinner and she was five years old because remember um they didn't have orphanages and stuff back then these orphans just went to the poor houses with the adult everybody went to the Al's house right so this 5-year-old girl Elvis Skinner woke up one morning is trying to get warmed by the fire and she's getting dressed next to the fire and because like I said you know some people had little fires in their room because there was really just that stove heating system well yeah I mean trying to stay warm was probably a full-time freaking job right who wouldn't have a little fire in their room to try and stay warm dangerous but it's either that or freeze to death so on the morning of February 15th in 1880 5-year-old Elvis Skinner woke up got out of bed started getting dressed by the fire and her clothing ignited oh no these people didn't have adults looking after them really no so they didn't probably have water anywhere nearby either right so Elvis Skinner burned to death oh in her room poor baby yeah my good so she is one of the ghosts that is pointed out that that is seen but I'll get to that in a few minutes a death like that would definitely make an imprint for sure but as you can imagine with the criminally insane and and and the mentally ill that they decided that that would also be a good testing facility they did a lot of testing the shock treatment and all that horrible horrible stuff it's terrible lobotomies and stuff and like with every story like that you know such horrific tragedy people live through some of that stuff they were doing testing apparently this was a place in 1968 it still had 49 residents and they were doing testing on people with epilepsy that's not even that long ago no I would imagine probably the folks that they were doing the epilepsy tests on that wasn't pretty either no I imagine not so as you can imagine people died there's some horrific deaths did they still bury them in that Cemetery in the north yep and then what they did was there were two cemeteries kind of right next to each other it wasn't that they expanded it they just kind of created a second Cemetery a little ways down so there's actually two but there are some thoughts of like some just Mass Graves just body dumping you know you got to figure a lot of these people didn't have any family they didn't have any friends when they died that was it so they were just dumped it it wasn't it was n you know they they would smoke their own bacon weren't a lot of those alms houses like mini farms where they like you they had chickens made their own butter you know they had cows they made their own bacon they they had the pig you know the whole work will set you free and make us money right but you know there's also people who died while they were doing things like smoking bacon and and smoking in the Ham House people died in like uh uh accidents with farming equipment yeah they didn't have OSHA that time no um there was a story of a little girl that fell in like a well type structure that died but here's where it gets a little weird they close the place down and then all of a sudden in 1990 okay okay thought 68 was recent so in 1990 they wanted to turn it into a mental health facility to treat teenage boys who were in The Justice System and actually that was rejected by the town they were like hell no so they were trying to utilize that building as a I don't want to say a mental health facility because that's giving it way too much credit yeah more like just some type of like halfway house for bad kids right troubled teens pretty much pretty much they had used it for a little while around the 90s um late 80s early 90s to teach motor skills to develop mentally disabled folks okay wow it's had a lot of different uses so in 1998 someone bought it and their intention was to renovate the buildings into private homes and as we know a lot of times when you start Renovations that's when pot man stiring the pot yeah you're stirring the pot that's when the ghost stories start so what started well they it just says that they abandoned their plans I wonder why and they only had to pay like 12,000 bucks for it so that was in 98 so then finally in 2006 Scott Kelly and his wife purchased the Ashmore Estates and they began renovating it now what they wanted to do is they wanted to create in what it is today we got to put this on our bucket list they wanted to create a commercial haunted house so they opened their commercial haunted house October 13th 2006 in the offseason they offer overnight stays in the building under a program called night of insanity oh and they bring in featured speakers they and they have guests such as psychic mediums there's some spooky [ __ ] though that goes on so that sounds like a lot of fun though I mean that could be kind of cool it does but I was watching this thing on YouTube and it it it was it was a little scary the title of it is the night that nearly ended the overnight Channel The Haunted Ashmore estate and like they interview like people that work on the property they interview the people who own it they do some you know people's experiences basically you can rent it intriguing I don't know if rent it the right word but you can stay there for like a 12-h hour overnight nice so you can go do your own ghost hunting you can only you can go do your own ghost hunting but there's some weird [ __ ] like this is probably more so than maybe some of the other ones we've talked about like you can get touched oh you can feel things whispering in your ear they say that a lot of women feel like they're getting their hair pulled interesting do not be touching my hair right people have walked out with scratches like actual scratches on their body I know you don't like it when people start getting touched I can see all of it I can hear all of it keep your paws off me keep your paws off me I don't care if you're real or invisible keep your paws off me right these are touchy feely ghosts this is the place where if you want interaction you need to go to this place because they're waiting to talk to you all you have to do is basically say is anybody there and they come flocking to you and you're gonna love it they have a whole floor that's just orbs all the time oo yes I would love it I want to go take pictures there oh how fun would that be but it's weird because it's like a three floor thing and the orbs are only on the top floor from what I've read isn't that weird that is weird well orbs are usually around areas of energy so that just might be the one area of energy here's the bad part and this may explain it they kept all the offices in the basement and they kept all of the worst people on the third floor so that when they were in their offices working they didn't hear the screams ew so I'm wondering is it because the people on the third floor were more tortured and tormented that that's why there's orbs more it's possible know I don't know it could be where the it could be where most of the haunting is localized so that might be where most of the energy is and you know so that's why the orbs show up more whose idea is it okay we're gonna hear them screaming and we got some work to do so why don't we put them way up here and we'll sit way down here so we just don't hear the screams God forbid you tend to their needs right why not try to fix it oh that's why I hate asylums they're so terrible so you get any you get the whole gamut you're getting children playing you're getting screams and cries um you're getting people that want to hurt you you're getting people that just want to interact with you because you're a physical body um you'll get people talking to you whispering in your ear yanking on you tugging you throwing [ __ ] at you one guy said one guy said he had rocks thrown at him like you're the gamut of experience here this sounds like a really physical place like a lot of places are sights or sounds you know you this get your EVPs this is like things happening stuff getting thrown at you getting touched getting scratched this is literally The Things That Go Bump in the night place oh scary and you know it's really not that expensive but like everybody's hey we could hit up a lot of different places when we when we go to Chicago man right um everybody's been here paranormal ghost hunters par the Paranormal Activity show like all the shows all of the shows you can think of have been here Ghost Adventures even has a whole episode on it which I actually washed it was like holy [ __ ] we need to go there wow but I definitely think that this is one that we should put on the bucket list I want to experience some of it kind of like I said it's the gamut of things you know it seems like on the first floor you're getting more of that childlike activity the balls being thrown down the rocking chairs rocking um hearing laughter hearing playing and then the second floor is where there's a lot of crying almost like crying at sadness crying at loss crying at pain but then it scary but on the third floor are more like the tormented screams wow scratching how interesting that it's it's segmented by like experience like that isn't that weird and I think it that's why I'm wondering if it was based on who was housed on those floors it sounds like it it very well could be it's almost like the higher up you get the more intense the physical interaction is I mean honestly that would make sense if they were trying to like keep their offices as far away from the screams they would house the more violent more likely to be loud people on the third floor more likely to scratch your ass but there is a high percentage of guests that can't make it through the night they just can't handle it there are people who can't sleep when they go there I don't know if i' want to sleep I'd want to experience it all there's been times where people have spent the night and smelled smoke and they think that that could be um residual from Elva Skinner burning to death oh wow yeah there was one person that described it as a fleshy smoke smell um like they could smell her burning there's been people who have described that they've seen a janitor Walking The Halls just mopping and all he does is just walk and mop and whistled up and down the hall um but then like I said you're getting the ones that you know they're they're horrifying terrifying screams and the banging and the Smashing there's talk that like outside you can hear like the screams of people being killed by farm equipment and stuff like wow so a lot of people I mean it sounds like a lot of people died here not just were tortured here but like died in terrible ways when it opened in the 1850s and it didn't even legit totally 100% closed until like 1990 you know this had 100 or more years like 140 years of activity there's bound to be people and then when when these people are tragically dying and being buried on site some of them in Mass Graves you've got to expect it you've got to expect it the only thing this place has missing at this point is an Indian bar ground wow I mean you know these stories are they're sad and unfortunately repetitive because this is just almost the only thing I really found different was really the scratching I mean the Shadows you know the light anomalies hearing the things you know you kind of hear that in all of these Asylum stories but this one there's a lot of touchy feely stuff that I think makes it different it's that physical aspect that really makes it really scary like downright frightening yeah and and that's I think what makes me want to go I knew you would want to go because of that this one is a little bit more on a different level than some of the other ones because of that danger Factor you might leave with a scratch or a bruise or having you know if a rock's thrown at you that's that's pretty scary let's let's call a spade a spade like the some of these ghosts do physically attack you yeah and that is kind of different than some of the other asylums around the country that we've talked about right getting an EVP that says your name is scary enough but how bad is it to like actually get a scratch on your back or be physically touched like that so I have a question for our listeners K I'm talking to you specifically have you been to the Ashmore Estates like what like I want to talk to somebody who's been there like what the hell is up with this place because I'm very intrigued by the physical interactions I'm very intrigued by the physical interactions I'm very scared by the physical interactions like just scared I'm just scared well and that's why you know I think that's why they specifically wrote on their on one of the sites I was reading about how uh there's a good percentage of people that pay for the overnight that can't make it through the overnight you know a lot of these places that's so true I mean it just happens like that if it's if stuff is really going on some of these places I think just the whole vibe there and the amount of activity that happens to scare even your biggest skeptic I'm not surprised that people just leave before it's over you know I have have to wonder though now you and I had a different conversation uh earlier today about commercialization of things and I half Wonder now imagine if you're a ghost you still kind of know what's going on because you're a ghost so wouldn't you be a little pissed off this place that you have made your Eternal home has been commercialized so people can gawk at you like a zoo animal I mean maybe these ghosts are just pissed that they're being sold out is that a thing could that probably I imagine for active ones like at Ashmore that's quite possibly true because they seem to be active hauntings whereas a lot of times most of the hauntings we seem to encounter are the taped ones where it doesn't it's not a sentient being so no matter what you do it's just going to the woman walking down the hall is just going to be the woman walking down the hall no matter what happens it's just a recording uh so it can't really get mad but the ones that are sentient I bet I bet they are I get I bet they are frustrated you know kind of that I'm not your dancing monkey yeah I don't want to play this game you know so I wonder how that if sometimes that's where the scratching comes in I don't know it's a theory is it acting more angry because there's so many people there you know is it or is it going to like some places we've seen kind of Fade Out over time because it's just too many people saturated yeah yeah so I think the moral of my story is I think this place is freaky as [ __ ] I want to go there I want to get scratched but I understand that not all ghosts wants to want to be my dancing monkey and it definitely sounds like these don't they don't want anyone anywhere near their space yeah I mean if someone if something random is just throwing rocks at me isn't that a sign of I don't want you here right exactly so yeah I think it's definitely a super creepy haunted place and I'm glad that pay um brought it to our attention because it was definitely cool but I just think that the ghosts in this particular place are annoyed with how they've been commercialized annoyed with something or they're just you know or they're just like super angry ghosts for whatever reason for sure yeah so we should go and find out bring a Ouija board [ __ ] around find out get some answers so speaking of Illinois no What's your deal with o What's your deal with I'm actually going to take us to in Chicago Illinois to a place that's called The Murder Castle wasn't originally called a murder castle like is it a castle for real it was a very large I believe it was a three or four story building that had a pharmacy on the bottom and had Office Buildings and apartments above originally and was then turned into a hotel and torture chamber ooh like in a SNM kind of way or in a I'm not like kind of way serial killer and murder kind of way if that's what you mean by SNM sure okay okay I just want to make sure I got this frame of mind in my okay okay so our killer was originally named Herman Webster mudget and he is America's first known serial killer never heard of him what year are we talking well you might have heard of him by the name he takes later so we'll get there a little bit later in 1861 he was born in New Hampshire okay and it said that he had a pretty typ childhood he didn't really have your typical serial killer markers there are rumors that he was a little obsessed with skeletons nothing that really stands out until he gets to college now he himself says that he was born with the very Devil in Me and he says that uh he had thoughts of killing people and torturing people from a very young age apparently he just hid it better than most serial killers do well and there probably wasn't a lot of people looking into that type of thing back then as far as anyone who has studied him is able to tell he had a relatively normal childhood then he went to college in Vermont and he studied anatomy and he particularly liked dissection oh Lord and this is about where his life as a con artist began and what he would do was he would steal the cadavers that were set for dissection and he'd take them out and he'd drown them in a pond or he'd set them on fire or he'd drop them from a building what the heck prior to doing that he would have taken out a life insurance policy on them with him as the recipient and then he would go and kill them you know quotequote kill them in an accident and then he would claim the life insurance policy and apparently in the 1860 whatever you could do get away with that right because it worked pretty well for him he was known to kind of do this in college and around that time he also got married and he was not a great husband he was rumored to be quite abusive to his wife and one day he just up and left his wife and young child and just took off he started a rumor that he knew would get back to her that he had been in an accident on a train and had Amnesia and that's why he wasn't coming home what a loser yeah a loser yeah it's just kind of weird that he got away with all of this stuff so he made his way around as a pharmacist and he was later connected to some missing people and murders that happened in a lot of the cities that he would live in including a young boy in New York state that disappeared and then he would just leave town he would basically go to places kind of do a scam or two work at the pharmacy people would disappear and then he'd leave they never really connected it to him at the time but later when he was convicted of of all these murders they looked into his history and think he might have been connected to all these people missing in those areas yeah yeah so he pulled this cadaver scam quite a few times in some of these different towns until the law kind of finally caught up with him and he did a little jail time and decided to change his name and he changed his name to Henry Howard Holmes also known as Dr Henry Howard Holmes or H H Holmes I got you okay now you recognize the name okay yeah HH Holmes in 1885 moved to Chicago Illinois and that's that's when the [ __ ] started to get real that's when it really got bad he married a woman there from a rich family now keep in mind he's still married to someone back home and has a baby so he marries this woman from a rich family and because he's such a a sweet talking guy he manages to convince Banks to give him loans to buy properties all over the city then when the loans would come due he'd take out loans against his prop his other properties with a different bank to pay back the first bank and he just kind of kept that going for a little while until that started to come toppling down well they didn't have the internet back then so they did not but he funded his lifestyle for quite a while and he ended up buying a building at 63 and Wallace streets that's the address of what became known as The Murder Castle so at the base of this was a pharmacy and he started out by working at the Pharmacy and he ended up taking over and buying the whole building while he was working at this Pharmacy he had a young woman as an assistant and she was married with a small child and he started an affair with her when her husband found out the husband took off I guess and disappeared and the woman and the child moved in with HH Holmes and then shortly disappeared and were never seen again shocking surprise surprise holes started Renovations on this building the top few floors and said that he was creating a hotel because the World's Fair was coming to Chicago okay so this was kind of connected to that time period when the fair okay that's right 1893 Chicago was going to host the World's Fair which is the an event that was to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus discovering America so everyone was coming and Holmes figured if he could get this as a hotel he would get a lot of people to stay there what he really wanted was a lot of people to stay there so he could kill them he needed some he needed some specimens that's right so to fund this he started selling Health Elixir and Magic water out of his shop now the magic water just came out of the tap in the back room and the health Elixir were everything you would expect at the time you know basically some type of syrup and cocaine and a little bit of gin and whatever you could put into a bottle right so bad dude so he's renovating this building now while he's renovating it he has a lot of strange requests and he starts going through construction Crews pretty rapidly he'd hire people have them do a little bit of work and then fire them and he's not paying these people and he's getting away with it by by putting the building into different people's names and then say oh well I can't pay you your contract was with the previous owners and so he was using like his mother-in-law he was making up fake names doing everything he could to prevent having to pay these Builders so he's really just like a very intense scam artist yes and the reason that he was hiring and firing so many contractors was so that he could keep secret the nature of what he was doing here this find out when I tell you what he had built into this hotel you'll know why he wanted to keep it secret even from the builders in this dastardly hotel where rooms that had shoots that went to the basement some of the rooms had secret hidey holes in the wall where he could hide saws and Claws and knives and handcuffs he had rooms that when you shut the door they were sealed literally airtight so basically he would fire the contractors after they built him something really demented right and so that they couldn't kind of connect the dots as to what was happening right so he built this torture chamber of of a hotel with hidey holes and secret rooms and he opened it at the World's Fair knowing that people would come from all over and then could just easily disappear so the hotel was Wired from top to bottom not only with booby traps but also with sensors he would have certain stairs censored and also every single door had a sensor on it that all went back to a bell in his room so that if somebody left their room he'd know about it and if somebody was moving down the hall or went down the stairs he'd know creeper right even back then this is in the 1800s I mean can you imagine if the dude had access to video cameras yeah right some of the rooms were fitted with locks that only opened from the outside and they also had air vents that were connected to a separate room so that he could pipe gas into it when someone would check in he'd lock them in and then pipe in a gas to either knock out or kill them holy [ __ ] and then he would go in and torture them in the room and drop their body parts or their whole body down a shoot from the room that went directly to this torture room that he had in the basement oh wow that's what well H why do people find Thrills in that he later admitted when he was caught to investigators that he had locked a woman in one of these rooms that had no exits and only locked from the outside and then just left left her there while she starved to death damn one of the rooms was entirely made with steel walls and steel floor why why steel and it had special holes in it so he could pipe in gas and light it on fire so were these people he knew or did he just like killing random people most of the time it was random people but he was also known to pick up women particularly young visitors to the city who were in need of you know inexpensive lodging he would lure them to the place and he was kind of a sweet talker he ended up I think at one time being married to four different women at one time so some were people that he lured in as a a friend or as a lover okay so once someone was in one of his airtight rooms he would knock them unconscious and drop their body down a shoot to the basement and in the basement torture room he had a torture rack that could stretch people a dissection table and Vats of quick lime and acid where he would dissolve body parts that's why he kept getting rid of contractors build me some crazy [ __ ] and then I got to get rid of you so you don't know what other crazy [ __ ] I already got he would put some people into these trapped rooms and get their bodies downstairs and then torture them dissect them and sell their organs on the black market he was also a well-known supplier of skeletons to a local College shouldn't we be concerned also that there was a market for that yes yes we should while he's doing all this murdering and torturing of many people inside this freaking murder maze place he married a third woman named Minnie Williams and he convinced her to sign over some of her properties to him under an alias at this time he also befriended a man named Benjamin F pittel and pitel helped Holmes Swindle Minnie Williams out of her money and her properties around the same time Minnie's sister living in another state is starting to get worried about this brand new husband who Minnie is signing all of her properties over to she gets all sorts of concerned and travels to Chicago to find out what's going on she's seen with her sister going into the hotel never seen coming out neither of them were ever seen again now a few years later in about 1894 Holmes is in trouble because he all these different schemes he's got of loans to pay back loans and ditching on his contractors are starting to come back and bite him in the ass and the police are looking into him you can only do that living in the same location for so long exactly so holes and pitel come up with an idea to get some money to kind of get homes out of this trouble pel's going to fake an identity get life insurance on himself and then with homes's help they're going to get a cadav and fake the death of this pretend identity of pitel before DNA however instead of getting a body Hol shows up at pel's house knocks him out with chloroform and kills him in order to collect on a $20,000 life insurance policy that he had taken out with himself as the recipient in pel's name [ __ ] her around to find out Holmes went to pel's house told the wife that Benjamin had gone to Europe to take care of some business things for homes over there and she believed it she did worse yet he killed her no no even worse Holmes said he was supposed to help take care of the family and so took her three smallest Children of the five that she had because you know five children is too much for a woman to care for while your husband is away in Europe I'll just take the three smallest with me to help you out yeah and they're probably l in rooms worse so once the children disappeared and Benjamin was you know not anywhere to be found and all this money is I think it was more the money than anything else that had them looking for homes they showed up at the house that Minnie his like third wife had signed over to him they find this house and search it and discover that he had been there and that's where he had taken the children they found a chest that was locked and when they opened it the two girls were inside oh my God later he confessed that he brought the children straight there forced the two little girls into the chest and locked it from the outside and then piped in gas to kill them from a small hole in the top of the chest the little boy all they found of him were his teeth and some hair and some small chopped up body parts stuffed up in the chimney oh my God God Holmes was caught and went to trial on October 28th 1895 and of course he represented himself they always do police when they went and searched the Mansion were absolutely disgusted by what they found in the Murder Castle the labyrinthine like passageways people could easily get lost in the murder rooms he just admitted to all of this he did he confessed to a lot of it officials estimated that he killed around 200 people he confessed to killing 27 and there is proof that he killed nine oh my God but because of the acid and this you know selling the skeletons there's only so much he is a known liar so I don't know if that 27 number is exaggerated or if it's you know minimized in some way because AB absolute liar amongst other terrible awful things he was found guilty and he was sentenced to death by hanging and on May 7th 1896 he was hung he did not die quickly his neck did not break that's good he like gurgled for about 15 minutes it's good he deserved it and he was pronounced dead about 21 minutes after he was initially Dropped In The Hangman's news Karma right reportedly his last words were about how he wanted to be buried he said he wanted to be buried very very deep and he wanted his body to be encased in concrete so that body thieves couldn't sell his organs on the black market nobody wants your [ __ ] buddy you know he didn't want to happen to him what he had done to so many other people actually there was a rumor at one time that he was possibly Jack the Ripper and that the body that was buried there wasn't his and that he had gone on you know that he was actually Jack the Ripper I guess this rumor was pervasive enough that they exuded his body and because it had been buried in concrete like he had asked that preserved his body extremely well and they were able to get DNA from the corpse and determine that that was actually HH Holmes and so the Jack the Ripper theory has been laid to rest but bad enough Serial Killer without that I think pretty creepy it is pretty creepy now the murder Mansion itself was renovated and was going to be an attraction and they named it Holmes's horror Castle but it burned to the ground shortly after after opening so pretty scary creepy place can you imagine being a young woman tourist in the windy city you know you're all excited you find this you know inexpensive place with this handsome Suave doctor and then you get in the room and you're like why are there no windows yeah why won't the door open why can't I breathe you know and then you wake up tied to a dissection table freaking creepy creepy creepy place or you're a little kid who thinks that someone's going to take care of you yeah that's that's so freaking sad you know so sad the whole thing just a creepy guy so yeah that's uh one of America's first serial killers wow that guy sucks just saying I agree but it's very interesting that I don't what's going on in in in the mid 1800s in Illinois I don't know I you know we just didn't know we didn't know what we were doing people were trying everything I guess no regulations there was no oversight people would just come up and be like hey I'm a doctor and I have a radical new way to treat people and everyone's like well I don't have a clue what to do with it go ahead okay yeah all right well we've tried the ice baths and the water baths and the leeches and the cocaine you know why don't you go ahead and what have you got electroshock therapy woohoo ice pick to the brain let's give that a try yeah yeah labotomy I'm all for it let's do this you know free rang criminals amongst your orphans and your drunks and your widowed sad women go for it yeah right yeah just just not a good time man it was a lot of experimentation I prefer the experimentation in the 60s and the 70s Peace Love drugs that experimentation yes labotomy ice baths and free range criminals no yeah not actually up to that but sex drugs rock and roll yes we're there we're there we're there we're there we're that kind of witches yeah yeah it's definitely interesting and it's definitely it's it's just really it's I don't know it's really neat that we find all these interesting stories that we would have never really across otherwise that's the best part oh yeah not only do we get to chitchat and hang out together but we also get to kind of come across things that we might not have otherwise exactly oh my gosh like I never would have heard of this and this is probably one of the creepiest things creepiest creepiest stories I have ever heard in my life so scary and like I said I think that this this is probably one of the creepier asylums for the physical touch Factor oh yeah anything that touches you is bad news I don't want to go anywhere near any of that yeah but I I do think it's interesting I do too so I think that we're going to wrap up for today folks thank you for joining
