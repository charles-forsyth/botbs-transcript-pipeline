wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a back on the broomstick I'm Layla and for this episode we've opened up the solarium to talk about our favorite herbs for a summer of spellcrafting these just aren't your basic T herbs we're going to tell you how to incorporate these into your practice for smokable sippable herbalicious spells so grab your mortar and pestle your favorite smoking apparatus and a teacup and join us on this magical herbal episode I'm show in Layla's making it awfully fancy because I'm going to route of we know that I have a Penance for killing things so we're going to talk about some herbs that I like that I can actually grow and keep alive so hey let's do this super excited to talk about Arabs and summer is here in the northeast of the USA and it feels to me like this is going to be in the summer of some serious spell-casting so we decided to grab what we think will be the five most used herbs or spell crafting and  summer of 2025 shell decided to go with herbs that she can grow which you know if she can grow them you know they're pretty resilient and I decided to focus on herbs that were useful not just an incense but also Inseparable and smokable sounds well you know what I kind of look at my five herbs as a try it too I have a history of growing / keeping things alive and not growing not keeping things alive exactly I'm going to talk about some things tonight that I actually me of all people can grow from seed all the way to plucking it for Magical purposes and for me that's like amazing things that you can grow things that you can Harvest yourself definitely have a strong connection and can be a very strong Ally in spellcraft however you can also buy herbs off the grocery store shelves are you can buy Gerbes that someone else crew it or someone else drive and they will work for you beautifully in your spellcraft as well  stop I have picked fire herbs and it was difficult I had a hard time narrowing it down because there's so many that I like especially when you start talkin about smokable spell but I picked five that I think are very summary and would be very useful in what I think are like witchy summer type spells enough for me for the past couple of years have been growing 5 / 6 so I'm going to talk about the five or six that I actually have physically grown myself kept alive when I originally started the use cuz some of them I've been growing year after year now I picked seeds that I knew that I would end up using for Magical purposes if that makes sense but I went with the idea of let me grow this so that I can then use it for Magical purposes ritualistic purposes that type of thing  I like having a magical garden and a kitchen Garden if I am able to not always able to so sometimes I'll just have herbs that do like Rosemary or culinary Sage or things like that things that I can use in cooking and in Magic a girl a couple of I use either dried for incense or have put in teas so multi-purpose saw the first on my list but I'm going to talk about is one of my favorites and it's actually invasive so I'm not even allowed to order cease if I want to try and grow it here and I know so many people who can find it growing in the ditch or growing in their backfield or something and I have not yet been lucky enough to find a reliable stash of it but the first on my list is mugwort it is actually in in Northeast in New York state in Pennsylvania I'm not sure where else but I know those two states is considered  invasive and you can't even order seeds for it it makes me sneeze I'm not going to lie it's absolutely my favorite because it's fabulous okay it's not exactly wonderful until you but the effects of it in TR great and it's also really good in in senses and magical working it's a nerve is associated with the possibly because they kind of silvery like the underside of the leaves and have like that silver and green look to it so that might be part of it but it says it's a very deeply feminine herb I think and it has a lot to do with dreaming and with DreamWork the liminal spaces it can help you with your psychic abilities it can enhance Clairvoyance clairaudience working with ancestors and with spirit is also excellent for banishing negative energies and for psychic protection it's just a really great which is Herb no Layla and I are by no means giving any sort of medical advice on any luck  so please don't ever take it as that but I have a problem with mugwort this is why I don't use it very often in any sort of spell work and in something people like might want to take know what I was I am actually allergic to mugwort and when I smell it breathed Amira touch it anything in my vicinity I can't breathe and I start sneezing my brains out and like there has been times when I've used it going into it knowing that I'm going to have a sneeze the van but overall I do try to avoid it just for the fact that it is something that if you're allergic to like everything outside mugwort might not be a good thing for you to be to be utilizing but again by no means after 2 Sunday my personal experience in our standard disclaimer here she'll and I are fabulous witches we are not very good doctors  that you're going to smoke make into a tea and just in any way you need to figure that out with your doctor research do all the things we're only here to tell you the key aspects I I see its purposes and it is it is very good I just personally am not a fan because it triggers me not being able to breathe out of my nose as long as you're not allergic to this is one of those things that I really love to make into smoke bundles I like to try and make a smoke bundle this makes fabulous cleansing bundles if you're going to be doing a ritual or spell were this opens up that liminal space this is going to connect you with your psychic abilities is going to enhance your intuition your Clairvoyance your inner sight so you can use this in a smoke bundle you can grind it up and add it to a smokable spell you can put it in your tea and a smokable it's a very full body smoke so it's  use that is the main ingredient although a little bit goes a long way and it has a very pleasant taste however in t sometimes it has a little bit more of a musty he has not the greatest and tea again a little bit goes a long way but if you use it especially before you go to sleep before you do any type of meditation or DreamWork mugwort is fabulous prophetic dreams for Clairvoyance actually used it in the past the few times I have used it I have blended it into a loose incense mixture and it's great for like virtual incense because it kind of takes what you've got and makes that super Smokey I don't know I think it's just super Smokey but like I said I tend to stay away from it but I have used to this like a base for loosen sense some people consider it to be a feminine herb and associated with the goddess Artemis in particular other people associated with the  an aspect of the Goddess it's more the dark side of the Goddess is when you want to go within and it can also be an ally for you if you're trying to maybe confront your dark side if you're doing Shadow work if you have things that are difficult that you need to see through mugwort can help you with that as well so if you don't want to ingest it you can use it in an incense you can use it in a smok stick you can put it in a dream pillow but it's a fantastic herb for that and I think summers are very good time for dreaming and dreaming of the future so that's why I put it in there so we're going to talk about my first herb here that is a tad invasive basically once you grow it is like I don't even know what like like a weed that I think I know what you're going to say so might my first one is going to be meant my first mint plant and  end of the season I didn't know I am like the last person who should really be planting anything in like the mulch Pile in between my house and the tile across the way let me just say that five years on shit tournament over there but did I learned my lesson so I had a friend who do you know that was pretty shity so I took these cuttings who would give me cuttings to like I know what I'm doing first of all but somehow this is why mince words out for me let's talk about resiliency here folks I just take these to whatever cutting shove them in some dirt cuz you know I don't know any better that shit has grown for the last 3 years  this year I saw a gun that it was dead and I was going to dump it out and I put another pot in that pot cuz I was going to dump them both out literally met his grown around it and it just like you ain't killing me woman no matter how hard you try I think meant works for me because of the resiliency so if you do not have a green thumb men is one of the things you need to do keep it in a pot don't grow it in the ground or it will take over seriously like I have more across the street then I need to but there's a lot of different uses for it I've been kind of trying to get away from Sage I will talk about in a minute as far as like a cleansing so men can be used for cleansing or protection the same as you know Sage could be  last summer when I had I was making men and Sage bundles which and I just smelled amazing we won't talk about the peppermint or spearmint we're just going to leave it at MIT and move on Prosperity I love men for Prosperity than cleansing for what else is there also amplifying your intentions you know everything is about intentions we want to always put intentions into all of our spells and rituals in this kind of will amplify that for you I'm not as big on the smoke a bowl since you are so generally I am doing like I said in the last summer I kind of got into making bundles loosen sentence in the t's and on a nice hot day minty can't beat it relate a lot  communication that relates that cooling sensation in your mouth or in your throat it could also sue the other things soothe tempers soothe play even such thing as with inside you like anxiety but it also has that fiery activation it's also very active like you said it will grow anywhere it'll take over so its abundance as well it has that strong energy of abundance of both in mint hurts so good with men yes apartments on my list as well for a lot of the same reason resiliency was like I was like man this is definitely for me cuz I can't kill it exactly exactly because meant when you eat it or you take it as a tea or even if you smoke it is very nice and a smokable also very cooling have a nice  waiver no matter how you take it if you smoke it if you eat it if you take it as a tea mint can be very good for your stomach so that can also help you ground that can be a wonderful way to Center and ground yourself is a little bit of minty and again with that fire and cooling aspect of it it's good for balance and balance in yourself and just like you were sitting with the mug or you can also put it in like a sachet under your pillow or drink it is to promote dreams or visions because I don't think it's you know how sometimes you like kind of a way we can kind of asleep Alpha State like a sleep as well as there are people that use this is part of love spells I never have but you know what you gotta do what you gotta do  well I guess I think it goes back to the balance it's the fiery B and the cooling qualities both in one plant so I think that can help you in a relationship to have balance and good things in a relationship I've never used it for that but again you do you mostly for joy happiness abundance success those types of things and I don't know why I like I like it and I think this is so ridiculous of me but you know how so I think of me sometimes as a cleanser know I love that it's perfect Association like I said I sometimes try to get away from the stage thing is is a cleanser is Oracle answer or or Spirit has definitely been something that I've tested and I feel like sometimes when people use Sage to cleanse  like bring a shit down but it almost like spring this like this or like bringing the level of excitement instead of a level of calm does that make sense now before we move our lovely peppermint I do have a story for you okay so there is a Greek myth about it and how it came to me and it has to do with our lovely goddess Persephone Persephone and Hades have been married for a while in this myth and hate much like the other men in his family is a horndog can't keep it in his pants and is running around and finds this by all accounts absolutely stunning gorgeous woman named meant he snatches her up they have a fling and somehow Persephone finds out that she turned her into a plant to get rid of her yes Persephone  not like her mother is an agricultural goddess and so she turned that's cheating woman into a place she should have turned into a plant I mean kind of like the soap operas of the 80s so this water nymph was turned into a plant by Persephone and Hades who felt awful if his part in this whole thing gave her the lovely fragrance and taste of mint and he must have made her resilient because I can't kill meant for nothing not even for Stephanie wanted to kill her just so I am going to use you and go right into my second one in in in cut you off like that was like the first thing I tried to  I plan to this plant I happen to have two pots now but this first pot I legit planted five years ago I am not joking you I will take a picture for you it is still outside and regrowing I this is another one I can't kill this I am I have amazed myself I left it out in the winter I didn't clean the leaves out of it mosque I have battered and bruised the sage probably more than any other plant and it just says bitch you ain't killing me again I like using 4 bundles I like using it for cleansing I don't drink so much because it's to me has a weird taste so many good uses for sage and it just really started out as a can I grow this I'm telling you resilient plant number to can't kill it for the life of me, nari sage and white sage that a lot of our  this might be familiar with our to do we personally prefer to do in a civil or a smoke a bowl this is more used in a bundle or loosen sense it just is very grounding it's very earthy culinary Sage is more for I would say in my personal opinion is more grounding is more for when you need to tell me energy down when you need to be settled and strong and standing strong so I guess in some ways it can be a cleansing Urban that way because you're bringing things back to basics whereas white sage but a lot of people are familiar with that's going to be more of us actually clearing out the negative energy it's also uplifting and it has a lot of spiritual significance for some need of people so it doesn't two different ways I would say different episode totally different between culinary sage and why you saying  good one to grow into have for that grounding and that Earth thing that's why I sometimes think and also it depends on what kind of digging for deeper was so I don't know why this particular breed of States makes me think down that path I think you sometimes it depends what I mix it with but I think that everybody if you're going to grow a little herb garden get the stage from the Home Depot it should be a staple in your in your garden and I I really like to add it to bundles because it does add that good strong solid base element base 4 bundles and it's a good base for loose incense  fantastic all right so my third I picked one that is very summery and very fun it's a tropical herb so maybe that's why you no kind of gives me that summer Vibe also it's magical and physical properties the kind of give you that summer feeling Adventure positive energy it's about Summer Romance and loving yourself you know what's that bright sunny happy it was all those wonderful luscious sensual feelings of Summertime with my dude at all the sudden get Practical Magic virus that's the Belladonna is in the bag and yes we have Belladonna not on this episode. Be careful with that everything all of these even the peppermint please be careful with all the people but yes. Research talk to your herbal list talk to your doctor talk to your pagan  Minister I don't know before you do any of these you could always use it and don't inhale but if you're me I was in hell because I really do have never smoked this what what is what's the taste like a smokeables taste kind of like a floral grassy sweet to me it smokes and tastes like a like an RV cannabis it's nice this plant is sun-loving it's beautiful yellow flowers you smoke the leaves and the flowers by the way now you just smoke this itself or in a mixture I smoked it almost always in a mixture but it can be smoked on its own it's very cannabis like as a smoked so it can act as a base and a mixture and Damiano all right so is Passion This is Love romantic love since you  quality burn in an incense have it in tea have it in your smokable definitely all about fire and son he bowled in ancient times it was used as an aphrodisiac oh yes we know that the Aztecs and the Mayans drink Damiana tea as an aphrodisiac and for love spells but I mostly smoke it more for its relaxation and and kind of mellow feel good qualities taste better if you steep it too long so again little goes a long way just in time so you can also take it as a tincture you can take it as a capsule if it's too high of a dose use caution because it can be a little bit of a hallucinogenic but when you smoke it it helps you to be relaxed a little euphoric you can kind of feel a little sensual a little happy I was going to say  the little blue pill if you do you know this is going to be for love potions self-love if you want to do glamour spells if you want to do a little romance ritual Damiano is going to be your go-to make that a big part of your incense or part of your smokable again you're going to want to blend it with other things in your smoke a bowl or in your teeth but you're going to be you know happy with that awakened that energy awakened that sensuality permission  and don't take that Liana unless you know what you doing but yeah go ahead use it as an incense it's it's just fabulous Earth for love so it really reminds me of Summer you know I think about summer romances and doing things with my love in the summertime so Damiana should be a staple for any type of Love magic in the summer with flowers with me. Matt has a summer thing now because it can also be like a euphoric and a hallucinogenic just can also help you get in touch with your psychic senses it's a little bit of a lemon herb so yes it's love and lust and sensuality but if you're doing it in a meditative space it can also be meditations very deep meditations on self-love deep meditation to heal yourself or to find that love within yourself if you don't have it so you can use it in a lot of dream walking very psychic  or you could just use it as part of an incense or an oil blends a candle dressing you don't have to ingest any of these in order to use them in your spot work okay what are you got next on your list this is another one this is again on the list of all I'm so glad you put that in there no this all started with me having cats and like I have so much like I don't even know like again I can't kill this for the life of me I've left it out in the snow and the cold and it grows back every year I don't know if but it's definitely not easily killed but again this is something that can be used for protection it can be used to enhance intentions love Magic Friendship  warding off negativity and you know obviously because my cat's left associated with me and my children loved for many many years and he was a lover and a hater but we love them and there's been times where when I burned it in an incense a feel like my my old Kitty Boys Around  that's so sweet maybe you remember the Lick Lick bite so I don't get in touch with that feline energy but that could just be me being crazy and trying to connect with my cat that has passed away and using this is means I don't know I don't see why it wouldn't work I mean you know if you can call and say things that they like why not a beloved Cat spirit but I will tell you this cuz I did test this Theory so you know how the catnip makes me kitty cats loopy right and I've given it to him fresh I've dried it out and saved you know piecemeal that to him over the winter so I thought you sent it to me because it makes the cats and stuff Damm it even though it's kind of a hallucinogenic to cats  did I utilize some loose and sent you can smoke catnip have smoke catnip smoking it also will not give you the cat woohoo it's a relaxing it's actually very calming and very relaxing this is one of those herbs that I would recommend that you mix with a base herb of some type Mullen usually cannabis if that's your bag but a little bit of catnip with other herbs is very nice. I like is the lone soldier is that there's different herbs will have a different tastes like a different mouthfeel the smoke from different herbs will be different so you want like a full body smoke to be the main part of your of your smoke and then you'll add your flavoring herbs and your support of hers after that so catnip would be more like a flavoring  I feel like we've kind of inadvertently got like all these protection of purifying things going on but this is definitely something that you could mix into a loose incense for protection magic for cleansing magic repelling negativity I've never used it with any sort of Love relations associate the association with love with catnip is because he obviously loved it if you want someone to go crazy for you like a cat goes the catnip or sometimes people will describe something that's super desirable as catnip do say oh that's like catnip to me chocolate is like catnip to me honestly I'm not sure if I would roll around on the ground and in bunny pop my belly with my feet over chocolate but there's like  looks like catnip  but yeah some people saved use that saying right so if there's someone that's like catnip to you that you want them or you want them to think of you that way I guess I could see using the herb that way but like I had had all these cut some of the leaves the other dryer get fresh to the cats right there I dropped like a handful of Leaves last summer here where I dropped that little pile there is actually catnip growing out between the Rocks this is again like super resilient so it's on my my top list of things to try fashion I got a couple catnip plants last year that I put in one of my garden and I don't know yet if they're coming up again this year cuz there's like twenty seven different things all growing in that part of the garden cuz it's a little neglected so maybe if you remember from last year when you just recently moved into the house you're in currently  remember when I walked up your stairs I walked up and under your first are no and I'm hoping it comes back this year I'm not sure if those are up yet either well if my cat nip gives any indication nothing will kill that shit and it'll be back what is your next one my next one is a little more fun like you said we had a lot of protection cleansing this one is joy and abundance light and attraction and it's all about happiness and confidence this is calendula also called Marigold I remember is a kid when it was like towards the end we would have to pick the heads off and my mother would make us pluck out the little flower petal things off to collect the seeds to drive for the next year  Ziploc bags full of little last year my dad brought me over it's really nice plants are full of a whole bunch of plants and marigolds and he made sure to tell me that as they died and is dried off Iris to pluck a pause and save them I did so I know those will be coming back that was a big part of my childhood from I refuse to acknowledge her witchy ways grandmother so Marigold calendula you can use that you can use them for protection you can use them to prevent evil from coming in you can also scatter the leaves in the ER the pedals under your bed for prophetic dreams they are associated with remembrance ceremonies with funerals with the deceased depending on your culture there are some cultures that use them for that part of that  is because of the sunnybright nature of these flowers they're so beautiful that they help you to remember the sweetness of Life the brightness of life so even when you're remembering someone who has passed they help you to remember the joy of that person's life you know it's so funny that you say that because when I was younger people still do this but not as much as back in the day you know we get dragged to the cemetery in the spring time to clean off every person I've ever been blood related to Evers grave Stone and my grandmother would literally everybody is Tombstone and I'm like why would you pick these flowers of all things now it's all making sense to me it's about remembrance but it's more about remembering the happy times it's about positivity enjoy so it's not remember your ancestors are the Dead with sadness that's why they're so bright and remind you of the sun because you're supposed to remember them and happiness and enjoy in better times  well they also growing Sunshine colors orange and yellow and so now in ritual there used a lot to connect with ancestors but they're also used for healing ritual more for like emotional healing for soothing a broken heart if you have Painful memories that you can't get over if you have regrets if you have problems in your life that you really want to soothe and move past colangelo's really good for that because I got it helps you to see the positive side of things that helps you to see that the sun will come up even after things have been difficult because honestly I'm not going to lie I never thought of marigolds for a magic purpose obviously obviously but like going in planting  would plant a garden she would always plant Marigold all around the perimeter of the garden and it's because there are natural pest repellent insect repellent because of that again this idea of sympathetic magic like-for-like magic because it for his past you can also use it to tutor negative energy I need past like energy you don't want to come into your house if you put up marigolds around the perimeter of your house that will help keep negativity from being able to come in my grandma wants to know which just ask her for your grandmother planting them as a remembrance for the dead it was to remember them with joy I'm not going to lie I just thought cuz they were cheap flowers at the grocery store I'm like you said they're yellow and orange so if you want to bring joy you want to sprinkle some sunshine in your life grab some of those pedals and use it in a spell in a smokable spell same thing it's uplifting it has a  very nice citrusy kind of taste taste like sunshine but again put it in with a with a base herb as a flavoring and with the intention to uplift bring joy into your life and vigor Grecian bring happiness you can use it for money the Golden Globe money so again that uplifting happy joy success all of those things you put that in your smokable spell do I find it funny that you diverted to kind of something a little flowery so my next one also happens to be floury to me this is like a staple chamomile need I say more  so sweet so so how I first fell in love with chamomile which is super funny is I absolutely love daisies I don't know why I got no Rhyme or Reason I think they remind me of my childhood my grandma used to freaking crocheted I don't know if we look the same and as I got older and kind of got into to herbalism little bit I learned or not be making like homemade tea trying to to make signatures and conjure my own little tea recipes I like how it grows cuz it's so pretty but I'm kind of promoting that positiveness like some of the other things we've talked about it can kind of repeal that negativeness and kind of that little protection balance  as with everything we've talked about you can use it for love but this is one of those thing is that there's something about a flower popping that brings you Joy you know I like growing sage in the man in the in the catnip but there's something about watching that flower pop maybe I'm a weirdo I don't know in New York and there was a couple of times that I would pick off the heads and Float the flower heads in my bath and take like a chamomile bath you want a relaxing bath and that's once I don't generally burn it a lot just because with chamomile chamomile in Mighty in just about any tea I can throw some chamomile I tend to get mine and big bags and it's it's dried and it's usually the head of the flower and I like to it's good for  dreaming that that sleeping that that deep inner Alpha / sleep work where I want to have a soothing slow gentle energy my only problem with smoking chamomile if you definitely need a grinder it's a pain those big flowers you got to grind them up like I said my go-to with chamomile his stuff that summer in a cup right there but also if you have problems sleeping or if you have anxiety about sleeping this can kind of get you into that relax and mellow sleepy mode actually what there is a 80 brand I can't remember which one it is but it's one of the top three brands they do one cup of Sleepytime  what is chamomile tea people and if you're going to be doing meditation if you're going to be doing dream work and you don't want to do something like Mug war or Damiana that's a little little more psychoactive a little stronger chamomile is a wonderful wonderful herb to use to assist you if you're going to be doing meditation work or dream work if you're like me and not allergic to the mugwort maybe you want to drink a cup of chamomile tea with like you said that's funny because that's going to bring in that Sunshine that summer energy before you do a tarot reading or before you do your Terrell drawers I've also mixed it with the meant that I grow to give you the energy that Clarity from the sunshine and that'll also give you the calmness and the connection to your psychic ability from the chamomile and so that just kind of helps you use into that meditation or into that psychic work that you're doing this one  it's definitely one of the top ones I like it because the smell is good to taste as good and again I can mix it with different things it mixes well with other things it plays well with others in the sandbox well I can mix this with I go and buy kind of loose teas ingredients for loose teas I can mix rose hips that I buy with the chamomile and kind of make my own little Laura Lee blend of tea I like to use it not just solely by itself but mixed with other things that mixes well with other flavors if you're doing the tea thing and didn't spell work adding chamomile to your spell in in whatever form incense to use multiple rings that subtle happiness that quiet Joy  brings a nice even Keel a nice even centeredness to whatever you're doing it's it's gentle it's nice it's calming and you can pretty much add that to any spell that you're doing to just bring a nice note into it to just bring that nice calming energy was something like chamomile exactly and not in a jarring way into some nice smooth way but it's also one of those things where it's nice to just kind of sit out on the deck on a summer evening and just drink some chamomile tea for the sake of it doesn't even have to be for Magical reasons it's good to just just drink and join me on Minton Road  now my last herb this one's my favorite and it's another one that I used to have growing in abundance in my yard and I wish I did now and you're probably going to laugh at me when I say it is stinging nettle what I love it it's perfect you are a weirdo I'll give you that magically health-wise stinging nettles are fantastic this herb has been used for thousands of years all over the place is stinging nettle for a reason I used to play with it when I was a kid in each other on purpose so I know all about did you know that if you pick stinging nettle from the bottom up you won't get stung if you touch a more from the top down you're going to get stung and it's going to react you worse really  L is for strength is for protection is all about by tality it's also good for boundaries if you're doing Shadow work or if you need to enforce your own boundaries or work with boundaries it's fabulous for that I've actually I do stinging nettle and put it on my window so this is like a like a like a ward of sorts now you can't eat it you can smoke it you can drink it cooking it will inactivate the chemical that's in this thing I've ever drank it what's that taste like green it's green it's not bad it's good but it's very good for you actually but it's also good for empowerment and resilience and smoke a blunt you can smoke it once you dry it in small I would only put it in small amounts doesn't really taste like much smoked don't really do much but it is good for grounding in a smokable spell it has been used in all sorts of rituals there are  rituals in ancient Greece it's one of the herbs that are in the Anglo-Saxon nine herbs charm for protection the Celts use stinging nettles and they felt that it would protect them from fairies and from elves people have used it to cleanse themselves people would actually take bundles of fresh Nettles and they'll beat themselves with it yeah and I have never done it but from what I've heard it's very invigorating it is kind of good for you and no kids it was not heard that before it's only going to hurt for a minute  when done by a practitioner it can help clear away negativity in your body and can help break hexes it can help you with Clarity renewal the Celts used to feed their cattle Metals so that they couldn't be hexed by witches weird have you ever heard of the seven swans think so it's one of my favorite mix and it has to do with Metals other than on The Twelve Days of Christmas seven swans a-swimming a king who had seven sons and a daughter and he married a new Queen and somehow a curse came weather from the queen or someone who came to the land I'm not sure depends on the tail and those seven sons were turned into Swan the daughter was banished and she found the queen of the fairies who told her that's a break the curse on her brother's she had to meet them each a shirt from Nettles now the stock of metals is very fibrous you can actually make fabric and rope things like  from the stalk of metals and so part of this was she couldn't speak the entire time I do feel like I didn't work out did not work out so she's Gathering all these stinging nettles at night and in graveyards trying to hide from the queen and she can't speak and the king from a neighboring country sees her out one night and she's Gathering these metals to knit shirts for her brothers and of course he falls in love with her I don't know why but anyway she can't talk to him so he brings her back to his castle but she continues to gather nettles in the graveyards at night she only has until the end of the year to finish the shirts and break the curse on her brother's so she keeps doing this in secret now trying to hide from the King until one night and adviser to the king sees her besides this is evil Witchcraft and tell the king that she's a witch and has to be burned and because she can't speak she can't defend herself so the date of her death is coming very soon and it's also wrong  the same time to her time limit for making these shirts for her brother's is coming so she's dating and knitting and knitting as she's being dragged to the steak and her brothers come in the form of swans and she throws the shirts over them just in the nick of time and she wasn't able to finish the last one there was one sleeve missing on the last one so one brother always had the wing of a swan but they were all able to come back she lives and was able to speak and declare her Innocent but she was knitting needles so it metals can help you break curses they can help protect you from Barry they can help to do boundaries and so that's kind of encapsulated a little bit in that story I don't know how  my best and final herb this is I know something that is kind of a Mainstay with you it just didn't make your top five list but we're going to talk a little bit about the historically wonderful Rosemary Rosemary for everything protection getting rid of negative energy like everything I feel like it everything that all the years we've talked about tonight or all about you can burn that you can smoke at you can drink it like what can't you use rosemary for this one is more of a I do better with the grocery store Rosemary I'm not going to lie don't judge me but I am trying this year to grow it we'll see how that works out I'll update you later but again this one can be like one thing that a tea can be used for  action during Dream Magic so again another good one too kind of combined with chamomile chamomile can get you there Rosemary I'll protect you from all the ugly book Ali's while you're there so it's Universal for cleansing warding off negative energy some people even use it again like you were saying with the marigold this can be one that folks used to kind of Honor ancestors honor the dead there's just so many uses for Rosemary it's like a it's like allspice it's like the allspice of things you can grow can you use allspice for everything you do I have don't judge it's a tool to have in every tool box because you can pull out Rosemary and use it in a pinch for anything you said it's like the clear quartz of our nervous because it is if you need to substitute for something and you don't know what to use use rosemary it's  one of those it's like the universal substitute like their cards it really is the Swiss army knife of herbs for sure cuz you can pretty much everything I mean I I can't think of anything I wouldn't use it for just because it is kind of universal and that could just be me making up my own definitions for Rosemary but again this is my first go at getting it from Wegmans so we'll see how that goes Rosemary is a typical smoke of mine I'll have to go back through my notes I can't think of the last time or when I ever tried it usually I use an incense has in a smoke bundle or an illusion sense if so good not as a main ingredient but it's a good like active ingredient in tea I wouldn't drink just Rosemary playing too cuz it's kind of not the greatest but it is something that you can use this kind of a little accent Woody with the phone  an acceptable or a smokable spell you don't have to just put it in the one I say we want to do some Dream Work and so we've decided we're going to make a chamomile tea with a little bit of and rosemary in it you don't need to put in a half a cup of Rosemary you can make a mainly chamomile tea as your main ingredients and if you'd like to just a little bit in spell work even a small amount even just a small amount of the herb carries the entire magical intent it doesn't have to be equal parts talk to that herb tell it your intention to hey Rosemary Swiss army knife clear quartz of herbs I would like you to focus on supporting me through my dream work and then to sprinkle tiny bit in your teeth their intentions can be done in just a small amount I guess is what I'm saying you don't need to have a ton of it a little goes a long way from a small point  so I think that maybe my take away with my five that I picked are those things that you think you can actually grow and if you're not going to grow this thing as you know maybe their things are going to buy at the store Put a Little Love in to him that seems to be working for me you know a little love goes a long way with plants I'm learning so between the two of us we definitely have a pretty good Apothecary for summer spell work I think I care and I I have one that you can use and abuse and they'll still grow, because I'm so damn proud of myself proud of you too that is exciting I know your outdoor plants tend to do better than your indoor plants but it's pretty impressive that you can grow anything  sorry. You know our five hours of summer is actually more like 10 or 11 herbs of Summer but hey you can never have too many and this definitely you know we both had a struggle keeping it down to this much there's there's so many more we could have covered so I wanted to talk about dandelions but next time next time that you can use for your summer of spells this year if you are looking for something to grow maybe we've inspired you maybe we've given you something that like me you can't kill no matter how hard you try maybe just something that you can buy at your local witch tea shop down the store the point is we want you to get into a groove of growing some herbs learning and some herbs keeping some herbs in your toolbox and loving them loving them like we love them whether it's smokeable or in an incense herbs add so much to your cell work I hope you  guys are having a wonderful summer and are going to add some of these herbs to your working so thanks so much we will see you next week in the meantime give us some like some stars and reviews that really helps the show out and makes our summer a little better I got to go I got plans to water yes you do you need to keep them alive and proof of Life shall we need proof of life life all right so I'm going to go wrap up some herbs in a nice little smokable joint and we will see you next week be wise be Wicked
