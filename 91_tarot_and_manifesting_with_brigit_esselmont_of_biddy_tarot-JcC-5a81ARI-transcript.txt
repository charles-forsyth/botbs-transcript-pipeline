popular website bitty tarot Bridget is also the author of The bitty Tarot deck and the book's everyday tarot The Ultimate Guide to tarot card meanings and most recently intuitive manifesting welcome to back on the broomstick Bridget welcome hi Bridget hi it's great to be here so good to chat today I was really excited about this Bridget because I actually came across you Jeepers it seems like maybe eight seven eight years ago and you know ilila introduced you as an author but I personally think what you're better known for is your email subscription list and your website I have been an email subscriber for a good minute actually when I realized that uh we were going to do this interview I was like no way I've been getting her emails for years I just got one two days ago so I've been I've been a big fan and I know a lot of people have relied on the knowledge in in the background that you give on your website and you give um in your email subscription list for our listeners out there if you not get on Bridget's bitty tarot email subscription list I recommend it but you know you talk about different things in your emails and one thing I wanted to start off with kind of my first question is you know you talk a lot about Rel ing on your intuition so I wanted to know what your thoughts are on learning tarot because a lot of people do utilize you for learning tarot what are your thoughts on learning tarot in the realm of book knowledge versus intuition good question you know I like what you say and I like the meanings you give but sometimes I put my own twist on your meanings because they're different for me so what are your thoughts on book knowledge versus intuition yeah yeah thank you and thank you also I mean it's so awesome that you've been with us for like nearly eight years um and following along it's been a good minute that's that's amazing so thank you for your support um so you know like when it comes to interpreting tarot cards yes this is the thing it can it can sway one way or the other the ideal is this beautiful place in the middle so when you only rely on the book meanings you can get into this state where you're like oh I hope I've got it right like oh I better check you know and this is something I say to my students is when you're doing a tarot reading please just put the book away like put it back on the shelf and just trust that you know already what all of those traditional meanings are in between readings go ahead like read up because there's so much interesting information about what are the symbolism what do all the symbols mean what are the stories of the cards you know where where are some of the origins of it what are the expanded like concepts of these cards all of that is really important information and then there's a layer of the intuition now that intuition is about really connecting in with what is personal and true for you you know like for me um I had a little toy lion when I was a kid and that I would always have that little lion anytime I felt sick my parents would come and bring it and go here his lion like his you're like this is going to make you feel better and so for me the lion is about protection it's about safety it's about you know feeling better and so when I see the lion in the strength card for example I feel that sense of protection now that's not something you'll find necessarily in a book but it's intuitively true for me it could Insite fear in maybe another person that's right yes yeah cuz you might go well maybe I was at a circus one day and the lion got out of its cage that's it and so it is this real blend of both and if we go too far down the intuitive side I think of kind of like the Tik Tok tarot stuff I mean I love that tarot coming out into the mainstream in many ways and we're all expressing it in different ways that's awesome and then there's sometimes where I see those videos I'm like do you even know what this card means like do you know anything about this it's just kind of completely made up so it is a really nice balance between the both um and it's about trusting and knowing like I can actually integrate both and when I read even if I interpret my intuition tells me something about that card that's different to what's in the book or what you might read on bidy Taro or anywhere else like it's about trusting that and going you know what actually this is really important and relevant for me in this moment this is adding that intuitive wisdom that I'm seeking here and I liked what you said about you know you read about the cards you know do your kind of quote unquote research about tarot but put that book away when you're actually laying them down yeah yeah it's too tempting otherwise to go like oh pull a card oh my gosh what does that mean I don't know you know cuz we then go into doubt myself don't know you know don't know the answer now I have to go outside of myself but really tarot intuition all of this is about bringing our energy back in and learning how to trust ourselves again uh because we've forgotten to do that over many years of you know oppression and kind of like trying to push that away but instead now we're reclaiming that that power that's a really good point about going within and reclaiming your own power and that's why I think it's so important to learn the archetypes and the traditional meanings first you know to have a solid grounding in the symbology because that framework then allows you the freedom to let your intuition and your your imagination run wild going with that I had a moment back when I first started learning the cards that was very profound to me when I discovered that the way people were facing a card the directionality of where they were looking could have a lot of meaning in the card itself for example if they're facing left it meant that you know they're dealing with the past or they're looking to the past if they're facing forward that means they're in the present moment and if they're facing to the right that means they're looking to the future or they're Forward Thinking and that kind of blew my mind when I realized that symbology do you have any symbology like that in the cards that when you kind of uncovered it or or when you started talking about it really felt profound to you or interesting well you know I I love that idea of yeah which way is the character facing and then to add to this is when you start pulling multiple cards now what's happening is you know is the queen facing towards the page or is she turning away is that paage facing towards like you know mama in a way or is he trying to like escape and go off onto his like Freedom Journey over here right and it it shows us so much more um about the Dynamics that might be at play particularly if you're doing a relationship reading so I find just yeah noticing these things in the cards can have really powerful and profound impacts the other thing is that like I'm always keeping my mind open with the tarot I've pretty much read every single day for the last 25 years right and I would think like oh surely I would know everything there is to know now about t but literally there's times you know time after time I'll pick up a card like you know just here we go random like Two of Pentacles and maybe for the first time I notice like oh these like ships actually there's one going one way and the other one's going the other way okay what might that mean for me in this moment am I being pulled in different directions as I'm trying to juggle different priorities and so on so I think just keeping that open mind to let your intuition guide you to what what you need to see in that moment and then what intuitive Insight or wisdom that is going to give you cu the neat thing that's happening here is that the symbolism and the pictures in the cards it helps us to really bypass our conscious mind the thinking part of our mind and then drop into our subconscious which is where more of those feelings and intuition is stored um but we can't necessarily access really easily because conscious mind wants to just take over all of the time it's like yes logical but what we're doing is we're helping to really drop into that more subconscious space so that we can bring it out of subconscious land into conscious awareness and once it's conscious that's when we can start to take action on things so that's how it ends up being very powerful when we connect in on that level love that that's the beauty to me of different decks now you don't know this Bridget but shell is a little bit of a collector of Tarot deck how many come on I'm glad you called me a collector and not an addict I'm getting politer I'm trying to be nicer about it because I'm trying to help you sh how many you got okay I I'm I'm I'm at the low numbers I'm at about 200 200 and 200 and something yeah that's amazing hey I'm I'm on I'm on a Facebook group and there's people who have between 700 and 2,000 so I'm low ball I'm Small Change here I'm small change and I think we all know that you're compensating by talking about people with bigger numbers but I just want to say that while I don't have as many decks as shell does I do like having different decks around in particular ones that aren't the um the standard Smith weight because I do know the imagery so well and it's really nice to be able to pull something different that has unique symbology that makes you think a little bit more about it for example right now I'm really into the tarot of the cosmic seed by lania Simone and I just pulled the um the action of Wands which is her version of the Knight of Wands and this has a motorcycle on it which is freaking cool but that helps me to look at it differently it really helps to get my intuition and my imagination going whereas if it was just a traditional image I might be stuck in the same old same old as before so so for that reason I like to have a couple different types of decks around but that kind of leads me to another question Bridget how do you suggest that folks you know our listeners people in General turn these readings or turn these one card PS into action you know you can do a reading all day long and you can interpret the cards and and get your meaning out of it but how does that how you know how how can you translate that into actual action you know what I'm saying yeah great question because I think often times you know if we get overly esoteric with the tar we go oh and look at this symol and this means this and that it's like yeah great but like what are you going to do about it you know then what and you know I I have so much Earth in my birth chart I'm a Taurus I think I have a Taurus Moon and a Virgo rising and all of the things right and so I love practicality I'm like okay what are we going to do with it how do we ground this into reality um and even you know if we're just to play with this Two of Pentacles that I drew earlier what it can do is first it almost like opens up some questions and so we were just connecting in with like oh am I feeling pulled in different directions as I'm juggling different priorities so I might go okay yeah where am I feeling pulled in different directions am I experiencing some like big Peaks and troughs you know at the same time am I riding a high while I'm feeling low and that might just start to open up some like questions or feelings of like okay if that's the case is there anything that I need to adjust what do I need to change right now and therefore you know how do I is there anything that I need to take action on maybe I'm okay actually with like just noticing oh I am experiencing paks and troughs at the same time that's interesting even just that awareness helps to go like you know cuz we we have those feelings in our body like oh something doesn't feel right oh I don't know what it is and then we can pull a card like this and go oh maybe it's because I'm juggling and yeah I'm I've got these like maybe there's competing priorities and those sorts of things and even just that in itself may be enough to go okay I can move forward now you know sometimes the inside itself can be the action yeah yeah exactly just the awareness and realization but then you can go okay you know what I'm not enjoying this feeling I don't like it okay do I need to like choose one or the other um do I need to start organizing myself in a certain way do I need to like change things um you know get on top of things create more order or instead just be okay with it being a little bit chaotic and like wobbly and inflow so the wonderful thing too you might have noticed there is that you have choice you can choose what you want to do with this information you can choose if I'm feeling a bit like weird about something or off track like I can just choose to accept that or I could choose to do something different you I always have that choice yeah and so one of the biggest misperceptions like with tarot is like oh what happens if you pull a bad card what if it tells you a bad future but I kind of scrap all of that because I think it's more about yeah good it's like how do we open up choices so that we can consciously make these choices we can be more intentional in what we do and how we approach our days and the tower is just simply bringing an awareness to these more subtle energies that we're experiencing so then we can go okay now I know the lay of the land what do I want to do here the tar is not going to tell you what to do it's just going to show you some options and and different paths and how you deal with it is completely up to you that's it yeah and isn't that wonderful that we all have free will that we all have the power to choose which is so different to if the Futures if the tar is just telling you your future it's like well here it is you know take it or leave it how disempowering is that it's horrible right don't think anything is set in stone for sure and so what I'm hearing here is that you should Journal these polls so that you can kind of work out your thoughts you when you're journaling keep track of where they're going would you say that's a good idea 100% 100% And you know the other thing is like even in Li of tarot using journaling is actually a very similar process to what we experience with tarot I often say to folks like who are working more in like a self-awareness introspection space is ask the question that you want to know from the tarot like I don't know um maybe um what do I need to do to deepen my relationship for example ask that question and before you even pick up the tarot cards to get your answer go and journal let like your conscious mind unload and go okay here's what I think I need to do to deepen my relationship right right right right right awesome because that in itself is helping you to access your own intuition to trust yourself then go all right tarot what am I missing here you know what how else can I deepen this how what else am I not seeing cuz the tar is awesome in helping to see the Unseen and so then you might let's let's play again uh let's see you might pull ah interesting The Hermit card how can I deepen my relationship well maybe with some more introspection and journaling it's actually the way forward you know so just deepens that understanding now speaking of deepening understanding one of the controversies that I see a lot online today in particularly in regards to tarot is reversed cards a lot of people say oh I don't read reversed cards some people say reversals are just the opposite of what upright means and how do you feel about reversed cards and do you use them yeah I love reversals and that's really because I have a different way of working with reversals I remember when I first started reading and yeah I'd go I'd pick up like an average you know tarot card meaning book and whenever it was the Reversed meaning it was horrible it was like this Doom and Gloom oh these ter horrible things are going to happen because it is like a lot of people think it's just the opposite which ends up usually being pretty um unpleasant and I remember going into like some tarot groups and communities and I'm like what do you do with reversals oh y oh we never read with reversals they're so like you know negative way too negative for me yeah that's it but I was speaking to um a Canadian tarot reader this is many many years ago James and I'm just forgetting his last name he was wonderful um and it was him that actually suggested to me have you ever tried looking at it from internalized energy I'm like oh that's interesting and so then I started to work with that and play with it and you know really kind of explore it as a as a more LIF experience and what I realized was our upright tarot cards is kind of like what we project out into the world so again like you know the hermit is like you might be showing others that you are on your own path of inpection right this is how what you're portraying to others but when it's in the Reversed um position it's more about keeping that private personal it's something that's happening as an internal process uh let's see what else have we got uh like the empress might be you know you're putting out your motherly energy outwards maybe you're taking care of your kids or other people um and you're in that kind of nurturing phase but then when it's reversed well this is actually about self- nurturing it's about self-care you know dropping into what you need instead of needing to worry about everybody else so you see how this actually shs and changes it yeah it's nice huh I freaking love that I'm James tarot reader from Canada thank you that's that's something I hadn't thought of it that way before and I really like that that opens up a lot of possibilities I'm I'm inged I'm going to have to play with that yeah it's great we've had a couple listeners who have never touched tarot before in their lives and so for example one of our listeners who just posted in our Facebook Discussion Group her name is Cindy and Cindy said that she is never touched tarot in her life but she's very very interested but has no clue where to start like doesn't know what a spread is doesn't know anything about the cards what would you suggest someone like Cindy do to start with tarot first get on over to bitty tarot.com agreed I totally agree with that um because we really do we have so many resources to support people throughout their whole journey you know from tarot card meanings to um free trainings and ebooks and courses even certification but apart from that you know I think just get yourself a Tarot deck um again I this is our bitty Tarot deck um the one that I've been showing like through here and it's all it's based on the ride awe deck but it's kind of like a I intentionally made it as a more simplified version because I do want to have a deck that's approachable for beginners so they not looking at these overly esoteric images going what on Earth is that like you know swirly thing over there or what does that mean and some decks are very busy to look at yeah or to abstract you know they're beautiful but it's like what's this wishy-washy thing over there I don't even know what what does that thing mean right um so I recommend just getting deck that you connect with that's easy to interpret that's probably more visual like you can see that there's a story like it's easier to go Ah that's what that is and then just simply pull a card a day this is it you know and you're only asking like what is it that I need to know today it's not really like what's going to happen is it a good day or bad day but just simply like what do I need to know today and then you know oh here we go beautiful we've got the nine of Pentacles here it's you know lady dressed in these beautiful robe she's in a garden surrounded by coins and on her hand she's got this bird and she just looks luxurious and you know lovely so if you were just looking at this you don't even without knowing anything about the traditional meanings I just invite you to go okay what am I seeing in this picture you know okay yeah it's a lady she's in a beautiful garden she looks like she's wealthy she's really appreciating the beauty of life and then you might go huh that's interesting I wonder if I could get outside today and go to somewhere that I find really beautiful and maybe I can appreciate that beauty but also appreciate the beauty that's inside of me and that's just like an invitation to experience the energy of this card and you just do that each day little by little you start to build up this connection to the cards you start to have a lift experience of the cards you might even go online and start reading about what it means um but it's a much easier and more Gentle Way of experiencing tarot than perhaps how I started out because I I had kind of that um School mentality I thought okay if I want to master tarot I've got to read every single book I've got to memorize every single meaning and I got so yes overwhelmed because there 78 cards I'm like oh my God reversals and then this author says it means this thing and this author says it means this thing and I'm confused who's right yeah that's it yes it can like from if you look at it from that perspective it feels overwhelming but if you just think okay all I need to do is just pull a card look at that imagery see what speaks to me how can I integrate that into my day how can I experience that card it is so much more enriching and more powerful now of course it's probably going to be a point where you go oh my gosh tarot is awesome I love it I want to learn more and then yes you probably will start reading all of the books and learning all the things but there is a really actually a very gentle entry point into this that is available to everyone and one like one last thing to add to this is again when I first started I thought I had to be like really psychic you know um psychically gifted I have to speak to dead people all of those things I'm like I'm not that person you might ever going to be able to work with these cards but what I've realized is that it's just really about activating your intuition trusting it and going yeah I can do this you know and over time building it as if it's a muscle so even if you're sitting there going like sounds really interesting but I'm just not intuitive enough I bet you are and I bet you'll become even more so just by looking at these pictures and the symbolism and working that into your life with tarot I definitely follow a practice makes perfect Theory the more you play with it the better you're going to get the more you look at the cards the better they're G the easier they will be to interpret and to read practice makes perfect in my opinion with tarot you got to you got to touch them and play with them to to make that connection and create that relationship with the cards 100% and Tarot is for everyone you don't have to be a witch you don't have to be psychic you don't have to speak to dead people pick them up and use them and I love that you talked about picking up the card even without knowing anything about it and particularly with Pamela Coleman Smith's Artistry and with all the depth of pictures that she put on there using a A Smith weight or a rer weight Smith depending on how you want to call it deck those have such Rich symbol it's an excellent place to start shell did not start there I started with a with a A Smith weight copycat clone kind of back in the day but it does help and and shell is now back to that deck the symbology in it is just so amazing that you can pick up a card and tell a story from pretty much any card you pick up in that deck you know it's some of them like the lenormand the PIP cards don't have any pictures so I wouldn't necessarily recommend that for someone who's just starting out but definitely pictures that call to you and Smith weight is a fabulous place to start from what deck did you start with Bridget yeah you know I started with the radiant R aweight Smith deck actually because I wanted a traditional deck but I liked the brighter colors it's like I don't know if you've seen the really original one it's kind of like yellow red and blue just yeah kind of um but even you know after having worked with the radiant rideway Smith deck for a long long time I was like this is still feeling a little bit not really me which is what it really did Inspire us to create our bitty Tarot deck cuz I love a lot of like purples and um teal and gold and that's what we really integrated into the color scheme um for our deck so it's a little bit easier on the eye was your deck because in my vast collection which is not an addiction Lea in my vast collection I did some point years ago obtain your deck but mine is called the everyday tarot did you change the name or is it a totally different deck two different decks so yeah oh okay yeah so everyday tarot came out in 2018 and it's super cute cuz it's like a little mini deck yeah but it's that same purple and gold Motif yeah that's right it's purple gold and white and it kind of has more of like this 2D feel um really again really great beginner deck uh that works really well in that respect and then the bitty Tarot deck is something that we have self-published and released uh last year actually and this one is more of like our purples and teals and blue and so on and larger cards you might notice like okay AB they're actually you know like tarot cards are often quite rectangular um and like long and I always get frustrated with decks where I'm like oh I can't Shuffle it right so I made this deck I'm like okay I'm going to measure my hand what my hand can hold and we're going to do something between like a tarot card and oracle card and so now I have this deck that perfectly fits my hand I hope it fits other people's hands too and it's you know like it's big enough to be like yeah it's here so um bit of personalization there I I'm never going to always going to think of that now the the way stuff sticks in my brain every time I pick up your deck I'm be like this is the size of Bridget's hand and that's all I'm going to be able to think about but yeah I do love that you thought of even that little little bit because some of my decks are huge and and I I will often have someone I'm reading for say oh I can't Shuffle this they're so big so having that is is a small detail but very nice one I understand from your history that that you did not start out with bitty tarot you started out reading tarot for other people and working a mundane World job um how did you transition from reading tarot kind of on the side to it being more of your main gig yeah so uh my journey with tar really did start like in my sort of late teens and that was a time when I was actually studying at University I was doing Commerce degree which is like business uh and in between having to study accounting and economics I was like this is getting boring so I thought well why don't I just take everything that I'm learning about tarot and I'll put it online now this was back in like the late 1990s when the online space looked somewhat different to what it is now absolutely but you know I was like I'll just start learning how to create a website and I'll just post whatever I'm learning maybe someone out there is going to enjoy it so that was kind of the first you know 10 years or so the birth of Bitty tarot was just this side project that I had to keep me interested and to have a creative Outlet while I was studying at University and then I went on to um a corporate career and I worked my way up that corporate ladder and you know I'd come home and then I'd do a tarot reading online right um because I just had that like nice side hobby but interestingly uh by sort of around like 2010 I was starting to read more and more about how you can make an income online or basically how you can take a p and turn that into something that could make some money um through ebooks and through offering readings and so on so I started doing more and more of that until it started to grow like and to the point at which by 2012 my income from B taru was actually at a similar level to what I was getting in corporate uh because i' just been building it up on the side and I had that decision point of like huh I could actually just leave corporate and go and do like this Tower is stuff how fun would that be even though it seemed yeah just like it seemed crazy you know I was telling my mom and she's like what are you doing you know you're insane um but I you just finished University and you're throwing it all the away I know and I have I have a master's degree as well in in human resource management I'm like what am I doing you know am I am I just throwing this away like is this a silly decision but my intuition said do it anyway what's so interesting coming back to that Master's degree in HR is you know at the peak Point um in around 2020 we actually had a team of 30 people we now have about 15 uh but with 30 people I'm like oh okay this is how HR comes back into it right right everything we learn someti those skills that's it yeah so yeah 2012 was really that turning point for me of when I decided to commit fulltime to this and really you know invest my time and energy into it um we now are serving like millions and millions of people every year um we do have an amazing team of 15 people who support the business um and just a you know full spectrum of courses offerings and certification I don't really do any tarot readings anymore because I feel more called to helping more people um and being able to help and inspire people to like interpret their own tarot cards cuz I I think there's a lot of power in that as well rather than going getting the rating and being told empowering them to do it themselves yeah yeah your whole body of work this whole website and all of your offerings very much are about personal empowerment helping people to find their own insight and Clarity in their lives you know and even helping them with a little with their mental health you know moving forward working through impostor syndrome and things like that you know you even say on the website uh quote that you help with revolutionary Collective change you really do help people change and grow what are some ways that people can use tarot to achieve those things in their life personal empowerment and growth yeah and I think that you know tarot really helps us to reclaim that power and if you think about it you know this is a witch podcast so here we go it has been suppressed for like centuries right we've been pushed down we've been told to ignore our intuition so that can you know be controlled so that we can conform and you know live in a more patriarchal society um but what I'm seeing now is that we are stepping into our power more we're able to reclaim who we are and reclaim intuition and we're no longer going to accept oh intuition oh that little like oh that lovely little thing you do over there it's like no damn it I'm going to be intuitive this is this is my superpower it's my Birthright um and I think tarot is just one tool of many that is helping us to reconnect with who we are to really remember what is actually important to us instead of always looking outside of us or waiting to be told what to do next or what we should believe or what we should think or do and so on isn't it amazing that we have these tools available to us to go within to reflect what is it that I want what do I desire what is my magic how can I bring that out into the world and so that to me is this like revolutionary change that we are creating in many many ways you know is is helping people to reclaim their power to step back in and go yeah this is who I am no more trying to suppress it no more like oh and read tarot on the side oh my God you know it's like damn it I'm a teror reader here we go you know no taboo about it yeah yeah that's it and how much better does it feel you know I cuz I used to be in the camp of like um you know when I was working in corporate I be like oh yeah I I read tarot and yeah but I actually I work in corporate you know that be like oh it's okay I'm I'm still normal because I still do normal things but these days I'm like oh if you're not interested in Tarot oh jeez poor you I feel sorry for you CU missing out too bad a lot stepped into the mainstream that's true it is it is ironic though that you say that because I am actually currently located in Salem Massachusetts which is like which city USA here and even here I I I do do a corporate day job um and I do get that oh you do that you do tarot you're into that witchcraft stuff and I'm in Salem and I get that yeah weird it's it's it's just it's interesting it's interesting we can be part of that change this is the thing you know and we have a choice we could like go small and diminish and dim our light in that and go oh yeah okay yeah all right well I won't talk about tarot in my corporate job and whatever or we could go all right I'm going to be part of the change I am going to bring tar I'm going to talk about it with confidence I am going to like be the advocate yeah and just own it you know be the corporate witch like step in um because that is where we get to make change and uh I think that's you know we can inspire people we can change mindsets uh and I think that really is our calling and our opportunity here is to really step in and and change things I am glad to see though that there is such a Resurgence a big Resurgence that we haven't seen in a good couple of decades since I don't know maybe mid late 90s yeah and and I think that by bringing it in I I loved your idea of bringing it into the corporate world I no longer thankfully work in the corporate world but when I did bringing those cards into the office most of the time even people that had been slightly critical of it before were like they want a reading could you give me a reading could you would you pull a card for me and then as soon as they experience that from someone that they know and are familiar with the fear starts to fall the these the stigmas start to kind of go away it's somehow all of a sudden okay because they work with you every day yeah and and by bringing it in and sharing it with people that can be a really great way to challenge that stigma now one of the things one of the things we also run into when we're exposing tarot cards to people who might not otherwise see them in real life we also run up against a lot of folklor superstitions um so-called facts that get passed around about tarot that just aren't true have you ever run into anything like that no no nothing at all so many things this is the thing and I I you know I sometimes feel like how much of this has been introduced again to squash our power and to diminish ourselves um as particularly as intuitive women um there's so many many things even just earlier this year I don't know if you saw there was a movie called tarot you we talked about it yeah yeah very interesting that that is a horror movie where you pull a card and you drop dead basically not a fun message to send no no um but there yeah there's a lot of this negative stigma still in the media in TV shows I'm always fascinated how tarot will be presented in TV shows every now and then I see it like oh awesome they're actually using it in a really cool way majority of time though it's still presented as evil mysterious you know um root of the problem yeah and I questioned that I'm like okay well why why are we still presenting tarot in that way like what is the underlying reason for that and it's it's hard because then people come in going like oh I'm really scared to have a tarot reading I'm worried it's going to make something bad happen and so much of that is because of what is out in the media and what is presented around it and yet we know that there is a very different way we know that you know pull the death card and someone's not going to die like at um and that you know the devil card doesn't mean that you're like worshiping Satan um all of these things so yeah I just I think we just need to keep challenging these misperceptions but also meeting people where they're at when I have someone you know come to me and go yeah I'm really scared of tarot I don't like you know don't tell me bad things I acknowledge that I'm like yeah hey I get it I see why you're frightened and you know why you're frightened is because you look on any TV show any movie and you're seeing a lot of bad things about tarot totally get it um and there's a different way there's a different way of working with tarot and then usually we can like pull a few cards have this experience of you know it's not scary and then go from there so I think again when we talk about like what's our role in terms of changing like changing and Shifting the mindset it is meeting people where they're at acknowledging that yeah Society has made you um conditioned you to think that Intuition or um tarot or even you know witchcraft or whatever it might be is like evil and what have you but it's actually not and you know here's the different way form your own opinion by using your intuition yeah that's really what it does it it it helps you to unlock your own thoughts and to think your own thing think your own thoughts think your own thinks that's great Lea think your own thoughts and really kind of you know move past that when people start to think for themselves VES and to question and to look deeper into things that's when some people start to get scared they don't want you to look too deep so it's definitely a great to introspection isn't always fun it's not it's not but it's good it's good yeah well let's let's talk about that just if if we may because I think this is what's interesting with tarot tarot is not like oracle cards oracle cards you pick up and like oh it's a dolphin yay I'm going to be like life is good or oh rainbows awesome you know like it's always like these beautiful positive messages and if you want your life to be that way great have some oracle cards I do don't like Oracle d hly i do I I I do enjoy them they definitely have their place and then you've got tarot and Tarot gives you full spectrum right it's got the tower card in there which is about like chaos and destruction you've got the devil about those because of codependencies and addictions to tarot Decks that you might have in your life um but you know like that's what I love about tarot is it helps to show us the light and shade in our life and life is not always like awesome and you know pleasurable or easy and we need to have these like bigger experiences that may feel uncomfortable so that we can then start to see maybe something new or appreciate something new if you think about like the tower card yeah chaos and destruction but what that opens up to is the star card which follows and that's all about that full authenticity and stripping back all the layers and finally stepping into who you really are and enjoying that whole process so I think the wonderful thing about tarot is that it helps us to see all parts of our lives so that we are living in a more realistic View and we're embracing both the light and the shade that is present in life and that's kind of how I look at the difference between tarot and Oracle kind of that reality versus that fluffy love and sunshine and Roses thing you know and sometimes you need to look at the world through rose-colored glasses I'm not saying I I I don't on occasion but I kind of prefer that more realistic just give it to me how it is and that's why I prefer Taro yeah tarot is a lot like that really amazing friend that you've got that tells you exactly what you need to know and doesn't sugarcoat it you know like when shelle calls me up for a tarot reading or I call her up for a tarot reading I'm not an or you are definitely not a fluffy bunny Oracle that's for sure now Bridget I understand you also have a new book out that came out in the end of October oh well we've just launched um intuitive manifesting the book so that is now out in bookstores everywhere and intuitive manifesting is all about like how we can create the life that we really desire but from coming from within you know instead of like looking on Instagram and going oh they've got this really cool thing maybe I want that or I don't have that and getting into a bit of a tail spin it's about again all coming back and trusting ourselves what is it that is most in alignment for me what is in my highest good how can I follow and trust my intuition as I create my future uh intentionally and inside of intuitive manifesting it's got Journal prompts it's got visualizations but of course it's also got tarot and how you can use tarot to really support and uplift like Elevate the whole manifestation process so if you're being like lit up by this conversation today about intuition and Tarot cards you're going to love um intuitive

those who are stepping into professional career or building a business or becoming certified tarot readers um it really is like a One-Stop shop for um folks who love Tower I'm going to interrupt you very quickly just because we were just talking about Agatha all along I'm not sure if you're familiar with this television show but there's a television show about witches and there is a Tarot reader amongst them and the most recent episode was all about tarot it was absolutely beautiful but throughout the series they talk about these cards and I think someone has been looking at your website because every time I I I see these cards come up in the show they are spoton and the meanings very often correspond to meanings that that you have from your website so I think that some people in media are paying attention and are doing good things so your site website is not only just great for beginners but even for advanced users and apparently for Hollywood too I'll take that that's awesome yes yeah beautiful and again like like I said earlier I do suggest um hop on uh Bridget's email subscription list it is actually awesome I still get the emails and I I I think that as much as you may downplay that piece of your website that is a valuable nugget for people is that email subscription list I love it thank you thank you awesome awesome my pleasure thank you so much for leaving
