it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey and welcome to a special lunar wheel of the Year episode of the stoned wites our today we'll be talking about the new moon in January the wolf Moon the stay-at-home Moon and we'll talk about all different things that you can do on a new moon what's good what's bad our tips tricks things we like so bringing you some new moon information today I'm Leila and I am shell and I just want to say that we are gonna also talk about not only all of the things that Lea mentioned but we're going to touch on a little bit why we're talking about the new moon you know usually the hubub is always the full moon this the full moon that so we're also touch a little bit on why we're talking about the new Moon and what that means to us now we have been talking about the new moon for a very long time about 30 years ago with circle our coven Circle amarat instead of our esit being every month on the full moon we had our celebrations every month on the new moon within our coven and a lot of that had to do with the fact that you start things on the new moon you know the full moon is all about culminations but it's not a time to set intentions really it's really about a time to gather those intentions you've already set probably at the new moon right and you know I think that that this is the overlooked one I think it's Associated it's it's misdirected Association but it's associated with you know Bad Evil you know there's there's the ying and the Yang the light and the dark this is the dark the spooky the scary we don't want to go there mysterious I don't know that's what draws me to it and it very often can be that the dark is mysterious and we're afraid of it a little bit and it's not that full moon night where everything is a glow and with that silver light and touched with a little bit of magic this is a more of a time where it's not as outwardly pretty it's time more to go within and that and that's I think what that is the true quote unquote scariness of the new moon is everything is just not presented all out in front of you like it is for the full moon the light is shining on everything this is where you've actually you've got to take a minute and go within and sometimes you got to go places you don't want to go that's that's the nature of life you got to sometimes evaluate things that aren't comfortable and address things that aren't fun if you do not do that you do not grow oh that's a very good point and now this month January the new moon as we've talked before in our tradition these things are a three-day event the day before the day of and the day after and this month the moon will be new on exactly 3:55 p.m. eastern time on January 21st but you can celebrate that January 20th 21st and 22nd the newest the newest of the new moon the newest of the new you know and here's the funny thing I never called it the new moon I don't know why I why is it called new is it new are we well it is new we're starting over but to me it was always the Dark Moon just because it was it wasn't there it was hiding there's no light it's dark dark the Moon is there it's still there complete and able to be seen it's just not illuminated it's dark it's the Dark of the full moon it's the the exact opposite and I love those nights and it doesn't happen every time um maybe a couple times a year but I love love love when it is the Dark Moon and you can still see it you can see like the outline very very vaguely of the outline but there's no light em emanating from it whatsoever I love that that's so creepy and spooky love it it's so beautiful and doing ritual under a new moon like that was a great way to set short-term goals like we talked before about Cycles in our first wheel of the year we were doing the bigger Cycles the seasonal cycles and now we're doing the smaller monthly Cycles you know even within those monthly Cycles you set your intentions at the new moon and to have that short goal of two just two weeks just two weeks later at the full moon is it just two weeks later really is yeah just two weeks later at the full moon so that's a very shortterm goal but then you can kind of also extrapolate that short-term goal into maybe a year long goal maybe to do that every moon cycle you know and kind of to live these smaller Cycles within the bigger Cycles is a as a very natural kind of way to to live magically in connection and you know you you as much as the emphasis is on the full moon this is this is the time to manifest New Beginnings you know whether you want I don't know New Beginnings with a job or New Beginnings with a relationship or or maybe you've got a hobby you want to start or a project you want to take to the next level and I think that was some of the draw not all of it but some of the draw that our coven liked and and and where we kind of focused on that new moon was we liked that manifestation piece I was actually g a fan girl all over the whole manifestation thing because I love manifestation I not your not your like pretty girl manifestation of I get everything that I want but more the kind of you put in the work you put in the the preparation and the intention and the meditation and the visualization and this is a a great time to do a vision board especially because this is the first new moon of the year and so setting those intentions for the whole year is something that you can do right now as well and so planting those seeds that you can so that you can sew them and reap your rewards down the road right and planting of seeds isn't as simple as saying I want to have pumpkins isn't that going to be great it it doesn't happen like that you have to you have to prepare the soil you have to get the seeds you have to actually plant them and then care for them and nurture them water them Y water them and take care of it manifestation isn't simply wishing for something right there's actual work that goes in behind the scenes for manifestation the goddess is not going to just give you something she wants to see you actually put the work in for it as well I feel like the latest Tik Tock Trend I've been finding is everything involves a ritual bath full of flowers and oils and crystals well [ __ ] yeah who the [ __ ] doesn't love a good ritual bath amazing I am not denying the fact that I want to go buy myself a claw foot bathtub and fill it with fresh flowers hell yes and buy all of the bath bombs all them I do but that isn't what I'm thinking of when I'm thinking of a new moon ritual like that's the Le that's like that doesn't even come to my mind light alone be the first or the last like it's not even in the realm no I love one I mean you can turn a bath into a ritual very very easily sure can but the way it's being portrayed right now on social media especially Tik Tok I just find it mindblowing because you know when I'm thinking of New Moon rituals I'm thinking of things as you know how how can I connect to like my deepest dreams and desires I'm thinking journaling I'm thinking meditation you know I'm thinking kind of really getting getting rid of stagnant energy and and and getting releasing what no longer is serving me oh my gosh yes oh yes and can you do that in a bath sure especially if you're if you're doing that meditation and that work during the bath and then visualizing all those things kind of being released as the bath is draining sure but they're portraying that is the only way they're portraying that is the only way and I'm oh no that's just the that's just the most visually pleasing way that's an easy way to look good and get likes on social media because it's right ritual baths are beautiful any ritual can be beautiful we have a very instagrammable religion it can be pretty but it also can be you sitting down and jotting down notes in a notebook on how you're gonna go from where you are to the next level and whatever that may be Mind Body Spirit project hobby work love relationships I don't know maybe it's you and I sitting here talking about how we're going to take our podcast to the next level those things can all be turned into rituals and it doesn't have to be your leatherbound handmade paper perfect journal with the pen and the gorgeous laid out desk it can be your spiral me notebook exactly exactly because as much as I love a beautifully laid out altar as much as the rest of us we're all magpies at heart don't say we're not right it doesn't have to be like that and it's unaffordable it's unattainable for most of us to have that beautiful Tik Tok backgr that beautiful Instagram alar the the gorgeous YouTube Spell components I don't have all of that but what I do have works and it's solid and that's okay too and you know this is the new moon it lends itself to journaling I don't know why but it does oh it's so introspective it's perfect I love that I I like Vision boarding I like either digitally or physically making some type of collage that that actually envisions the things that I want and writing it down works too I love writing that in a journal what I'm looking for what my intentions are like you said like like what we're trying to manifest where we're trying to go what seeds are you trying to plant either for this month this week or or being being the first new moon um of January you know what are you planning for the year right exactly Cycles within Cycles it's all about these small little things that we do on the day-to-day cycle that translate to monthly to seasonally to the whole year to your life and you know I sometimes take things back to tarot well you have so many decks I am not surprised they're on your mind often I just got a new one and I got 151 [ __ ] yeah and I got one that uh my my beautiful Amazon man should be delivering later this week 152 fabulous but you know good time to maybe clear your deck you know maybe that's that's a that's a thing that's a housekeeping thing people don't do relatively often you forget good point you know honestly Ila no lion here when was the last time you put your deck in order and cleansed it which one some of them I do more often than others on the usual no you're right sometimes I'll put it out to charge under the full moon but you're right the whole cleansing thing is not something I do as often as I I would like and you know there's something to be said for that that's actually habit I'm trying to get into is is doing that because you know ick can attach to your tarot cards just like ick can attach to your spirit damn it yeah for sure for sure and it's always a good idea to kind of cleanse that and just start over again and new Moon's a great time to do that right and especially if you're doing readings for other people with your decks you want to take a minute cleanse that [ __ ] yeah but also you know same with the chakra thing you know doing a once a month chakra alignment cleansing um whatever floats your boat doing that on the moon New Moon not a bad idea not a bad habit to get into so you know you don't have to have this salt Circle and I got my frankincense and myrr you you know you don't need to have $800 in crystals and $400 in tools maybe it's you just sitting there cleansing your [ __ ] just taking a minute and being like let me realign oh you just kind of hit on something and I think I know now why rich baths are so popular why it's literal cleansing we're dirty dirty birds it's it's a literal cleansing and so that makes it very very easy to visualize because taking my Tarot deck in the tub with me no no no but what I'm saying is that for people that are trying to promote a quick fix or or easy magic something that is a literal onetoone conversion a bath is cleansing that visualization is right there for you it's it's done it's done you you don't even have to pretend you're in a bath you are being cleansed magically as well as physically so it's a very easy onetoone conversion whereas if you're familiar with energy work and you have worked on it you could sit in a meditative space and envision yourself being cleansed in all sorts of ways through a crystal bath through a Moonlight or sunlight bath through through waterf a shower of flower petals whatever you know you can visualize that cleansing and have it be very powerful and work or you could shortcut it and take an actual bath or actually stand under a waterfall which is also powerful and great and works but it's easier it's it's right there right and unfortunately I think we're we're living in a Time currently of what I like to call MC Magic the McDonald's version of magic I want my magic I want it now and it it's a it's a you know kind of like these these courses you can you know learn tarot in an hour you're not learnning tarot in an hour my friend right and and sometimes there is a there is a time and a place for mcmagic yeah and and be there's nothing wrong with beginner magic if you're having a hard time visualizing that bath and getting into a bath makes it easier for you by all means please do that I do that on the regular I mean there's nothing there's nothing inherently wrong with that but but like you said when it turns into mcmagic where people expect it to be a shortcut that's when it's a problem that's what I don't like it's not that I don't like quick and easy I don't like shortcut right exactly quick and easy is great cut yeah yeah quick and easy time and place absolutely but I don't like shortcut no no I agree with you there if if you're using it as a teaching tool and is it something that helps you to reinforce your visualization you know that's a very very powerful thing to have like for like but you gave me an idea and this is how I can use Tic Tac to my advantage why not take because I'm sure you've seen the videos and I mean these are these like gorgeous cloth bathtubs set up in the middle of the forest you know everybody's got a cloth of bathtub in the oh yeah I'm sure I could just whip one up the flower petals the herbs the candles why not watch these videos put yourself in a meditative State and use the video to visualize your own cleansing boom well there you go I think maybe a lot of these people are putting them out for that intention maybe they're hoping someone maybe I'm just a middle-aged old lady just catching up finally but hey you know better late than never I think you're right there's a lot out there that are just doing it because it's pretty and it you know it's it's selling it's popular oh it's aesthetically pleasing like nobody's business right and it's very popular right now so you know it could be a little of both I would like to think I hope it's all for the good of all and to harm none but we'll see the new moon is a good time to like mop your kitchen floor also is coming back to the cleansing man like literally cleaning your house it's not just a figurative thing yeah it can be a literal thing shell and Lea say drink your water cleanse your house and change your sheets folks yeah right and the other thing that I I like is new moons are a good time to to incorporate some candles oh yeah I love incorporating candles at any time incense candles love it all and I think it's more of the bringing the light to the darkness does that make sense it does you're manifesting the light Absolut you're create you're creating your own destiny yeah the Moon is dark and you go outside and you can't see [ __ ] so you know what I'm gonna make my own light I'm gonna light that candle and light my own damn way yeah you know what I'm saying like that that's great and then you know again meditation you can do that new moon full moon no moon big moon Half Moon quarter moon always meditate people write your intentions down in a journal like you mentioned earlier it's a great thing to do and you know it doesn't have to be an elaborate ritual or a big ritual it can be a bath it can be lighting the candles and thinking about your intentions it can be sitting in ritual space and writing in your Journal it can there's so many things that it can be and I laugh because I see this Evolution that we've gone through I remember the days when you and I had everything had to be high magic where's my cord and oh [ __ ] you know I need my athme we were very like the book says we have to do this like we have to do this and it kind of transitioned into well we're gonna do it our way and sometimes we'll have stuff and sometimes we won't and now here we are 30 years in and we're just like n I'm gonna write in a journal take a bath I I cast a circle my knee hurts I can't do that tonight no I mean we've gone the evolution of how the high magic piece works the medium you know partially ritualistic and partially on the Fly Works to now just kind of go with the flow and make it happen and you don't need all the fra draw but back you know back when we were in our early 20s we thought we needed the fra draw and there was nothing wrong with that well I think in our early is we did need all of that because did not we did not have the experience of of setting intentions of visualization of being in a meditative or Alpha State and and working through that we didn't have that experience and so bringing those items in you know having the tools and and using the sigils and and doing everything precisely there's magic in that itself and so just by doing those magical things you can create a magical environment if you don't if you not able to do it yourself you can you can walk through the steps and do it you know I feel that because we had that Foundation that we're able to do that now sure yeah sometimes I it's training it's it's going through a training it's going through I worry that there's there's folks out there now that think that you can go from nothing to that and as much as we do do that that we had that Foundation sure I I see that a lot on on social media where where witches and practitioners do talk about that fear that they think you know people are trying to do this manifestation and like why is this not working and it's because they're coming at it from a sense of just making a wish and not really putting in the energy work and the meditative work and the actual real world work behind it no wish comes true okay very rarely do a wish just come true on its own there's usually all sorts of work on a magical level a mental level and a physical level that happens as well and if you're not willing to put that work in that's why your manifestation is not working it's because you're just making a wish and those only come true very very rarely on their own and to kind of circle back to our our theme of the of the new moon here that's exactly what the new moon is it's time to set your intentions and start doing the work you have to do the work this just isn't I'm going to wish for somebody to fall in love with me and then I wake up tomorrow and somebody fell in love with me you're a new moon fairy godmother does not want to just snap her fingers she wants to see you doing the work [ __ ] and then she'll snap her fingers to make the rest of it happen and the new moon is when you start making you you start doing your work do your work that's what the new moon is supposed to be teaching you yes start that work so that you can in the light in the fullness of the full moon you can reap those rewards whether the small the small ones of the small Cycles or the bigger ones of a longer cycle you've been working towards so it it it just comes down to nothing comes easy folks [ __ ] don't get handed to you on a silver platter you got to do the Dirty Work we all do and we're just pointing out that the new moon is when you should start it yep and at the Dark of the Moon that's when you go in things are not pretty it's not looking nice out there January is not okay it is in California but well not right now but most of the time January is not a pretty month it is not nice out there it's called the stay-at-home moon for a reason right so the dark of this Moon not pretty but that just means you need to dig in a little further dig in a little deeper and start that work so that you can enjoy belan so that you can enjoy the full moon in June but you got to start it now right and you know I just want to point out you know if you didn't think you already had problems Aquarius and the moon are at odds during this January New Moon oh fun so what does that mean for Aquarian shell I'm asking for oh me and several thousand other people we would like to know that's why I wanted to point this out because you are my my my best Aquarius friend so aquariuses need space to think obviously as you're well aware this is like probably the most cerebral sign and the moon isn't happy with you folks oh what did I do to piss off the moon now this January New Moon kind of wants that I want to cuddle in process and share secrets and blankets and you know watch some movies on Netflix cry on your shoulder um that sounds like an amazing winter evening uh duh what's wrong with that because that's the moon's current Vibe and right now with the Aquarius current Vibe is like all right you're eating cold fries [ __ ] from a brown bag yo like I ain't giving you [ __ ] you ain't getting cuddled I I I'm just going to do you dirty and throw you aside and I ain't kissing you when I'm done oh [ __ ] actually that's true this whole month I have been very self-centered I've been very much like I just want to do my own thing damn did you just not read me for [ __ ] filth [ __ ] what the hell blame it on the moon it's all I could tell you man whatever whatever you Aquarius folks to all our Aquarian listeners as well as Lea I'm targeting you all you and the moon are just having a battle this month happy with each other you're you're you're not vibing I guess not I guess I'm gonna need to kind of meditate and maybe do some journaling and get to the bottom of all of it I figure out I'll let you know which is so weird because you're a water sign like air sign air sign aquarians are air signs really I thought they were water well a lot of people think so Aquarius we are the water Bearer but we are an air sign how can you be a water bear and an air sign why do you think we have so much trouble why do you think we're so messed up and that's your is so that's your issue for the new moon to all you Aquarius folks there you go your astrological ass kicking from Shell so yeah good luck that's all I got to say yeah your astrological ass kicking from Shell for the month of January thanks you know I'm just I I'm on a roll here between between what we talked about last time with my my cursing issues this you know check it out on YouTube and also on our Instagram if you want to see the clip it's quite funny art by chaos a so yeah you know I'm just I'm just full of great like little magical tips and tricks here there you go I love it awesome now one one last thing I wanted to mention about the tarot is um I am trying this new moon spread New Moon Tarot spread three card spread what does it look like sh tell me love a new spread so I've got that sounds awful different podcast folks I love a new tarot spread what's it look like sh three card spread but you know I don't like to be normal and do things side by side so it's kind of a top card a card kind of off center below and then the bottom card kind of like a one two three oh like a crescent moon so you start at the top go to the middle and then go to the bottom in the shape of three cards in the shape almost like a crescent Moon basically even though I'm pulling it a new moon spread okay you know just kind of a you know what are you working on what do you need to do to be able to get to that end and what's the hidden outcome of this because there's always there's always that yeah but so the first card the top of the Crescent is what are you working on the middle card of the Crescent is what do you need to do to get to that goal and then the bottom Crescent the hidden outcome what is the hidden outcome not the ACT ual outcome but what is the hidden outcome like what might you not even be seeing that going to come oo that's a very new moon Dark Moon kind of reading I love it because well and you you know you actually just stole my thunder jerk because it's the whole Dark Moon what piece of this puzzle am I'm not getting right not seeing what's not in front of me what's not what what's not completely evident to my vision you know what I'm saying sometimes and I am so [ __ ] guilty of this we have a goal in mind and we are so single-mindedly headed towards that goal that we don't always know what the actual outcome is going to be we we have blinders on we think we know what's going to happen but sometimes we get to that goal and the outcome is very very different than we expected and so having a reading that's going to show you that hidden outcome that maybe you should be paying attention to that but you're not that would be very useful for someone like me who tends to get tunnel vision very very very easily when I want something or when I'm working towards something and the problem is is when you get tunnel vision you forget about the but this could happen but if this happens this could happen so yeah those hidden and unexpected outcomes fabulous oh I love that spread show great idea actually actually I do actually recommend that you try it you should try it and maybe do it for like two or three months and journal your outcomes see if it works for you I'm definitely going to try it you know we did that reading last time and this looked like it was going to be a month of working on things so I think I'm going to just kind of keep going with that and see where it gets my area Aquarian ass I think the biggest Point um throughout all of this is manifestation manifestation manifestation what do you want to manifest what are you able to manifest and how are you going to manifest it whether you're taking a bath doing a Tarot spread Crying To The Moon however you want to do it what are you trying to manif and how are you getting to that endend what work are you going to put into that manifestation don't just don't just dream it you have to actually do it you have to you have to put that work in there so you know on this new moon don't just make those wishes what work are you going to put into it what magical work what real world work are you going to put into it so that you can get those dreams and get those goals and for for me and I think for you this year sh a lot of those goals revolve around being more magical more witchy more involved in the community so I'm excited about that and seeing where that kind of takes us absolutely and you know I think one problem that you and I have always had and I know that a lot of our listeners probably do as well is you know sometimes going from the idea to the actual doing is a tough bridge to cross for you and I especially sometimes we can get very hermy very antisocial yeah and fighting against that inertia is difficult it is it is and I think that both of us without even real without even kind of coordinating it we had both kind of committed to ourselves to kind of put ourselves out there more this coming year yep and that takes work that takes work and we've already started working on that and manifesting that and I've I've started to see some inklings of what that might mean for us and I'm pretty excited about this year and all the changes that are going to come so I wish that for all of you that you know good things come for you this year and that you're able to put in the work to realize all your dreams and for those of you who have asked us if we're ever going to go out into the world and do do meet and greets with our fans and and and and let you see us in person and live that's one of the things Lea
