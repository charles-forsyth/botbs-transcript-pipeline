hurt me to my core me too it hurt me to my core and I did a thre hour spotifi tribute sesh yesterday and I just I just sat here and listened to three hours of Meatloaf I had a very Colombia moment a lot of people a lot of people don't realize this but later in his life in the last 10 or so years meatloaf actually got into ghost hunting um he was on Ghost Adventures I actually saw some episodes of him doing some ghost hunting up in the St Lawrence in Northern New York and he was actually an avid Ghost Hunter I just thought that was a neat thing that not a lot of people knew about meatloaf oh my gosh I had no idea he was into into paranormal stuff and I don't know if he was his whole life but he definitely had participated in in some TV shows where they do ghost hunting I do know Ghost Adventures was definitely one of them I can't think of the other one but yeah he was into the Paranormal the spooky the ghosty ghouls just like us and Rocky [ __ ] I will miss him his sad day sad day wow I had no idea he was into ghost hunting I'll have to check out some of those uh you said Ghost Adventures yeah Google if you just Google meatloaf and ghost hunting you'll find it a yeah sad day so so what are you smoking today because I'm smoking something new okay sometimes when I go to the store and make my purchases I'm going for a a higher THC content we say sure I want the best bang for my buck who doesn't you know if you're if you're offering 30% and 15% I'm going for the 30 my friend so this poked my interests yesterday it's GMO rocking at a 32% THC level which for flower is actually pretty high yeah that's a decent you know you see a lot of 22 21 26 sometimes but 30 that's you don't see that as often it's 32.6 and it's that very how do I say it like a lime green like that light lime green color we used to call kind green yeah this is kind bud I haven't heard kind in a long time God we old swag green and kind green yeah two different colors this was itely kind green it's like that limey green that has that like Haze of white crystal over it kind of like the Nuggets all I can think of is popcorn chicken um not the big like little uniform nuggets all over just coated in sugar as opposed to like get a big old huge bud you know it's it's more like little nuggets taste a little Piney which who cares it's weed you know that's probably the tpine Piney and it's good for you um it's uh it's good for anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory it's not like it's going to taste like anything in the name we had that conversation about banana cush last time right yeah so it's got like the little the little bowls siiz buns nice yeah that's funny that looks a lot like my Bruce Banner same thing it's the light kind green covered in Crystal kind of thing but this looks like it's a

so so what are you smoking today I talked about my GMO indicia 32% and awesomeness what's in the bong day well do you like my little bong I do like that bong did you watch that show um did you watch that show The White Lotus from HBO no so good oh my gosh the the the teenage girls the daughter and her friend smuggled a this bong on the plane to their vacation so yeah my bong is famous except not this not the piece because of course we broke that years ago Everybody Breaks hitter pieces so what were you talking about today today I'll be talking about Alcatraz Alcatraz Island surprisingly has a long history as as a prison not only a prison but a haunted place from the first time that the Native Americans were in that area it has a reputation alcat island is best known for being a harsh inescapable able inescapable prison maybe I shouldn't have done that [Laughter] dab alcatra island is best known for being a harsh inescapable prison that housed the worst of the worst criminals as I was digging into Alcatraz that it just got creepier and creepier the further down that I went um I was quite surprised to find out that it has been a prison almost the entire time that people have been around now it's on an island right it is it's a very small island it's it's like 1.3 square miles or something it's it's not very big at all when it was first found well okay it wasn't really first found but when Spanish uh explorers first came to the San Francisco Bay Area they saw this small island basically rising up out of the fog and even then they thought it was Eerie the ship's logs from the time talk about how they saw strange lights on the island and how it had and I quote like literally in their in their log it says they thought it was a bad place the indigenous people there at the time had obviously known about this island long before the Explorers got there and to them it was an evil place they said that it was a place where evil spirits would dwell and they would sometimes send people who had done bad things there to kind of like think about what they had done on this island of evil spirits so was it was it at that point was it just basically like a bunch of rocks sticking out of the yeah it was a big Barren rock that had nothing on it nothing growing on it and even back before the 1700s when the Spanish explorers found it the Native Americans were using it basically as a prison like I said they said that they felt that evil spirits dwelled there and that's San Francisco Bay right yes it is okay so it's located barely a mile and a half off the shore just this Little Rock and it was even considered evil back when the Native Americans were the only ones who knew about it and they kind of used it as a prison they would send people there who had been bad or who needed to be punished to go kind of be with these evil spirits and face their punishment now I have a question sure I have a question because I have a [Music] bong so whether it's a prison in modern times or a native quote unquote prison where they would just ship people to the island to think about their bad doings I got to say a mile and a half even my current Age and and more so when I was younger I could swim that yes I could swim that that was gym class in 11th grade a mile and a half that's nothing part of the problem is the the water is so cold you're going to get hypothermia within a very short time of being in the water it's absolutely frigid and the currents are very strong and unpredictable so sending somebody out there if you tried to swim and you weren't in excellent shape uh and prepared very much prepared for how cold the water gets you'd get hypothermia and the current would take you and you'd drown I would think in California it'd be warm water you'd think but it is not that warm especially that far north the waters are frigid all year round and actually one of the things about Alcatraz is it was one of the few prisons that allowed the prisoners to have hot showers and the idea was it so that they would not acclimate to the cold water and would be less likely to be able to swim to shore wow yeah kind of one of the weird little torture things that they did I always wondered that about alcatra I'm like why do they make it sound like it's so hard to get out of you these people break out of prison it prisons all over the country just swim the mile but I guess that makes sense we'll get into people that I think actually did Escape but no one ever escaped people were shot they were drowned in the water uh they you know froze in the water it it just didn't happen except for possibly again three people that movie escape from Alcatraz was about those did you ever see that yeah yeah those three guys that was a true story when was when was the actual prison built again it's been basically a prison from day one the Native Americans used it to banish people there they found um artifacts and Bones dating from that time period so they know that something to that effect is true because of where it is positioned it was turned into a fortress that kind of guards the mouth of the San Francisco Bay and so the military started to build fortresses there almost as soon as they found it and especially once the Gold Rush hit in 1849 California was vulnerable and so they started putting cannons and actual fortifications on that island so of any Ships coming in they'd be able to get them from there but the place is so hard to build on everything has to be ported in all food all water all building materials have to be brought in by boat and so it's kind of expensive to do it the place has always been military of some sort and they they did build what do you call military prisons garrisons or something I don't know but they built military prisons Briggs there you go so they built military prisons along with other fortifications and Barracks there in 1849 and they had cannons there at that time they started with 11 and ended up with 111 by the time they were done damn so they did keep military prisoners there at that time and then when this Civil War happened then it became a Confederate prisoner Dumping Ground and they were kept in absolutely horrific conditions like in these tiny cold damp Stone cells basically Shackled you know hand to foot in these cramped little places and as you can imagine a lot of people died there's no fresh water there so they were forced to drink contaminated water and this place has just been a site of confinement and death from its very beginnings and kind of seeped into the stones so after the the after the Civil War it stayed being a military prison they would dump like deserters there and US military soldiers that had long sentences would get sent to Alcatraz and it was actually prisoners that built the first prison there oh wow so it was a military Prison from 1907 till roughly 1930 when it became the federal prison that we're all familiar with now so indigenous Americans used it as a prison and just had the the evil spirits here teach people a lesson and then the first Americans came here and started turning it into a prison to absolutely torture the [ __ ] out of people so that was actually a federal federal prison or was that a state prison Federal it became a federal prison in 1930 and that was like a big gangster time frame you know a lot of gangsters in America so I who's been there you're gonna have to tell us well see here's the thing unless you're kind of into I don't know 30s 40s criminals these names might not sound familiar some of them are pretty famous so they will like um Scarface Al Capone that's a name Machine Gun Kelly not the current one not the current one right and Robert stad the Birdman of Alcatraz a lot of people have heard of himie um Arthur doc Barker no I'm not familiar with that name either but he's one of the famous ones too and Whitey bulgar which sort of some Bells that's I think he's still alive or was up until he just recently died and you know we've talked about this a gazillion times but I've recently moved to the Greater Boston area and Whitey Bulger was actually like his whole crime life was here in Boston so you can't be around here and not know who he is even now gotcha so even though there were like a handful of you know quote unquote famous people there none of them died there although one of them is rumored to still haunt the showers one of the things with alcatra is they decided to make it a prison's prison you weren't sentenced to go to Alcatraz basically it was any prisoner who was unruly or couldn't follow prison rules was sent to Alcatraz to kind of shape up and learn how to follow rules like the worst of the worst the worst of the worst absolutely one of the people who was considered the worst of the worst was Al Capone and Al Capone was sent there I think more as a PR move you know they wanted to be seen as being tough on organized crime so even though he was n i mean his biggest rule breaking things were that he got Privileges and extra phone calls and food brought into him and clothes brought into him in the prison basically he was treated like a king behind Prison Walls right and so it wasn't necessarily that he was the worst of the worst but they needed him to they needed him to send a message that's right I believe he was Prisoner like 80 number 85 so he was one of the first people to get there and they they had made it purposefully deer again they wanted to teach these guys a lesson they wanted to make sure that they learned to follow the rules of prisons and they wanted to break them so El Capone was was Prisoner 85 he actually didn't do too bad there's a ghost story associated with alcapone there's a lot of Little Ghost Stories here some are scarier than others but the AL did he die there he did not he did go crazy there though he had by all reports he had syphilis and that had been untreated and so he you know once it gets to your brain you're pretty much screwed and so he was dying and going crazy of that but he did manage to start a band in prison along with Machine Gun Kelly the gangster one but they started a band and Al Capone played banjo he taught himself how to play banjo and funnily enough there are reports of people who think they hear banjo music coming from the men's shower or well they were all men's but coming from the showers they would think they would hear banjo music and oh yeah come to find out Al Capone requested and received permission to spend his like one hour a day outside his cell practicing his banjo in the showers because he was afraid of getting beat up if he went out to the yard so basically Al Capone's playing the banjo while people are yanking it in the shower [Music] [Laughter] and he is still providing the soundtrack today oh no um other than Al Capone possibly playing the banjo none of the famous people that were there haunt the area most of the most of the hauntings come from other other incidences most of the 1,576 prisoners who spent time at Alcatraz not one of the more famous or big level gangsters or anything they were just regular old prisoners that happen to not conform to the rules and regulations of the prison that they had been assigned to or possibly were violent and dangerous or an escape risk how long was this place open not very long I mean it was it was set up to be a prison like a prison's prison you know kind of like you were if you were already in prison but needed to go somewhere worse they sent you to alz so it was from 1934 to 1963 it operated as a federal penitentiary so what is that 29 years is that's not a lot yeah that's not a very long time at all and in its time it was definitely considered to be inescapable it had a reputation of being this harsh completely unable to escape from prison have you ever heard any rumors about people about how like it was inescapable like have you ever heard anything about it I actually have I I've heard that people ran the risk of being attacked by sharks as well in that water oh that's what I was hoping you would say between between the harsh the harsh temperature conditions of the water that you spoke about so you're either GNA freeze your ass off or you're gonna get your ass bit off by a shark yes and that's exactly the type of rumors that they perpetuated however there are no hypothermia or Jaws yeah but there's no sharks that are going to bite you in the San Francisco Bay the only sharks that are there are like um they're like carp you know they're like Bottom Feeders they don't bite people I was thinking like Jaws yeah like that's the that's the idea they they have must have planted very much so in greater minds of people now you said you you said you had a story of someone who could have potentially escaped yes yes I do I do actually we'll get to that in just a minute actually let's get to it now so the myth of the of the waters being unswimmable with man eing sharks was definitely fake so there were three guys actually Four tried but he didn't make it through Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence angland for years plotted an escape that was famed in this movie Escape from Alcatraz so these guys one of which was super smart Frank Morris had a genius level IQ and he was always escaping and that's why he got sent to Alcatraz which was considered inescapable so they picked up like these hacksaws that had been from the work area that had been kind of laid aside and they dug through their air vents to make them wide enough to like squeeze through they made dubbies over their heads so when the guards went to do head count at night they they'd be in their beds they stole raincoats and hid them in the in the vents where they would meet and they sewed the raincoats together and used the hot Steam from the vents to like vulcanize the Rubber and to seal the seams and created an infl raft they stole right they stole wood and made ores again this was a plan years in the making and when the night came to escape one of the guys wasn't able to fit through his vent hole so he had to stay behind but the two brothers and Frank morus were able to leave they it wasn't noticed until morning that they had gone and they were never found pieces of their raft and pieces of the ore were found but no bodies or anything were ever found and they were assumed drowned however they're still listed on a wanted like FBI Wanted list interestingly oh wow John and Clarence angland one of their relatives said that uh their grandmother received a bouquet of flowers every year signed from John like after they had escaped and also the FBI received a letter I think it was in 2015 or 2016 they received a letter that was supposedly from one of the brothers saying that he was still alive that he had cancer and that he would turn himself in if they promised to only put him in jail for one year and to give him treatment for his cancer handwriting experts checked the handwriting and it was deemed inconclusive uh this letter also said yeah this letter also said that Frank Morris had died and was buried in a under a different name in Argentina the other brother had died in Brazil also interestingly at one time in 2015 a photo came out that was supposedly taken in 1975 of the two brothers when they were living in Brazil and recently uh facial analysis has been done you know how like Google photos can figure out who you are like when you were three they did fa yeah so they did facial recognition on several photos of these brothers and compared it to the one that came from 1975 and it was determined that it is them so it's entirely possible they did survive the crossing and did make it out and live their lives on the run so okay so there's the escapes but there's so much more to Alcatraz than just being just being a prison that was unable to be escaped from apparently even ghosts couldn't get away from the place who's still living in Alcatraz right now even while it was a prison the guards and the wardens at the time had ghost stories to tell because it was considered to be haunted even then so it's basically been considered kind of haunted from the get-go since the Native Americans said that they felt that evil spirits dwelt there they thought it was haunted and and they talked about it back in the 1700s so it's it's been haunted for hundreds of years here's my oranges all right so even while it was a a prison the guards and prisoners had lots of stories to tell of hauntings so it was extremely harsh for prisoners having to stay there all privileges had to be earned they lived in these teeny tiny cells they basically weren't allowed to do anything it was pretty monotonous if they broke any of the rules since they were sent there to kind of be retrained to follow the rules if they broke any rules you know they would have extreme punishments including being put in solitary confinement and these ranged from regular solitary confinement from a very bare cell where they had no privileges to an extremely bare cell that was called the hole that had literally nothing in it except a hole in the center of the floor for them to go to the bathroom they'd be stripped naked put in there and only given bread and water twice a day no [ __ ] no [ __ ] that sucks now would think that' make him crazy wouldn't it make him crazy did make a lot of them crazy quite a few people went crazy in there and it was kind of a running joke amongst the guards they would talk about the thing apparently a lot of prisoners that would go into the cells and dblock would talk about a black mist a figure made of of just like black smoke or black mist that had red glowing eyes it was mentioned so often by prisoners that were in the hole that the guards made a big joke about it was a running joke one night there's a prisoner put in cell D14 he starts screaming about there's something in the with him and he keeps seeing this thing with red glowing eyes and of course the guards just figure it's same old dumb story prisoners being idiots in cell block and the that really the guards don't give a [ __ ] they didn't give a [ __ ] they were just annoyed because this guy wouldn't shut up right so sometime around the witching hour he finally does shut up just suddenly quiet in the morning when they go to check on him they find the guy dead in the middle of the locked cell with strangulation marks bruises all around his neck but he was all alone and the cell door was locked all the guards had been accounted for who could have gone in there the autopsy report determined that he had been strangulated strangled Strang strangled that he had been strangled and that he hadn't done it himself he could not have done it himself again all the guards had been accounted for and no one could figure out who did it it was so suspicious that they did an investigation and it was inconclusive interestingly oh wow once after they found the body they had all the prisoners line up and did a headcount and they counted the exact number of prisoners that they should have as if the dead guy was still there supposedly oh [ __ ] freaky according to reports everyone saw the dead guy in line and when they all turned to look at him he disappeared they did headcount again and they were the number they should have been one short I would have been like look I will go to any other prison and follow any rule get me the hell out right oh when visitors go to that room D14 it's 20° colder than the rest of the cells you can literally feel the temperature change when you go into it um can you still go on tours there you can you can go on self-guided tours and walk around you can even go on late night tours which is kind of fun oh wow that's got to be creepy it really is it really is some of those cells are so creepy that Park Rangers will refuse to go in them alone there are reports of uh different guards ghosts of guards being seen walking around but also sightings of Native Americans walking around interestingly one of the the first Warden Warden Johnson does not believe in ghosts I don't know why that's always noted but every time they talk about Warden Johnson it's mentioned that he doesn't believe in ghosts and apparently it's documented that one time he was leading a tour of the prison you know some high muckety mucks kind of showing him around and as they're walking through the prison the entire group heard the unmistakable sound of a woman crying and the sound seemed to be coming from the very walls and it got louder and louder until it suddenly stopped and an icy cold wind blew through the whole group oh wow no one could explain it not one guest wanted to continue with the tour and the warden and none of the guests could ever explain what happened oh wow yeah no woman has ever been a guard or a prisoner on alcatra some of those prisoners would go their entire time there without hearing the voice of a female so who knows who that woman could have been um W that could have been like maybe a native Native American woman it could have been yes and during a Christmas party at that same warden's house several guards told a story of a time you know they're all having this party hanging out through the doorway comes a man wearing an old-fashioned gray suit with a brimmed cap and mutton chops like like he was from the 1800s when everyone noticed him it disappeared and the fire went out in the stove so very weird events in the laundry room of SE block it was documented by several of the guards that on more than one occasion it would smell like there was a fire in that room and they'd Rush down they'd see smoke they'd smell fire but when they'd open the doors it was gone completely no fire no that would make me kind of panicky that would make me kind of panicky because I'd always be concerned that something's burning I think so too and visitors now very often report smelling smoke in that area that area also a lot of people would report seeing like kind of a men in figure there and a psychic went through um Sylvia Brown and she was yeah when she went through she had a former inmate with her and she felt a menacing presence there as well and she got the name the butcher the gentleman that was with her said that there was a I think his name was AB Mo ABY morowitz who had been a um a Hitman for the mafia supposedly and his nickname was the Butcher and he had been killed in that room oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] so that might be the figure that people see there there's other ghosts so these two prisoners U Rufus McCain and Henry young along with this other guy Arthur Barker and two other men tried to escape they managed to get to shore like to the the shore of the Island right before the guards caught up with him and McCain realized he wasn't able to swim and that kind of stalled the whole group so two guards got killed the one inmate Barker was killed McCain and young were put in solitary for almost an entire Year young was pissed yeah young was pissed and he blamed McCain because he's like how the [ __ ] Could You Forget You didn't know how to swim before we got there so he was so mad and the tension between the two just escalated and escalated until like a few months later young snuck out of where he was working and crept down to the office or to the shop where McCain was working and stabbed him in the gut with a shiv and oh damn yeah McCain did not die immedi medely but he had a very serious injury and he lived for a few painful hours before dying in agony in the hospital oh [ __ ] yeah I know crazy right A lot of people way to go awful way to go just all because the Dude lied about being able to swim or something like how do you forget something like that but they see McCain the whole way of es escaping via water would probably involve a little bit of swimming yeah right some ghost sightings of a prisoner in uniform clutching his stomach and running towards a door only to disappear as he gets to the door has been reported by multiple people wow now has there been a lot of like I'm kind of curious is there does it seem to be more I don't know I guess some kind of torn is it more Native American haunted or do it seem to be more prisoner haunted well I think probably what happened it seems to be more prisoner haunted it most of the sightings seem to be prisoners or soldiers particularly from the time when it was a military fort and it was a military um prisoner like a prisoner of war station because those buildings are still a lot of them are still like basement parts of the of the prison system or some of the buildings that are there now and it was even occupied by Native Americans who were trying to reclaim it for a short period of time but you had mentioned earlier about people going crazy you know the possibility of people going crazy there and while some ERS did say that Alcatraz for them wasn't all bad you know again the hot showers which was unusual in the Privacy for others it was absolute hell on Earth and it was so bad for some people that they literally went insane during their incarceration and it led a few of them to self-mutilation and suicide self-mutilation yes why apparently it was so bad that they were willing to do anything to get out of it one prisoner rubbe persful chopped off all the Fig fingers of his left hand with a hatchet while he was working in one of the wood shops and when the guard rushed over nobody knows when the guard rushed over to stop him he handed the guard the hatchet while grinning maniacally and asked the officer to chop off the fingers of his other hand for him oh my God another prisoner yeah right another prisoner no Mental Health Care at that place none whatsoever none and the the torment that these people went through to drive them to that that type of energy is still bouncing around in there and this one prisoner Ed woodkey used a pencil sharpener blade to slice his own jugular in order to kill himself [ __ ] that's some like initiative that's that's really taking the things that you have at hand like Joe Bowers he used his own eyeglass lenses to try and cut his throat when that didn't work he rushed a fence and climbed it knowing that he'd be shot when a guard demanded that he climb down he he didn't he refused and was indeed shot and fell 75 feet to his death because they probably thought that it was easier to die than live out their sentence there yeah a small group at one time um a small group of prisoners in an attempt to escape overpowered some guards and grabbed their keys and tried to get out that way only to find out they had the wrong keys they didn't have like a key to the outside door so they essentially barricaded themselves in a in a deadend alley and held the the prison for like two days while they fought with guards eventually the Marines were sent in and you know a bunch of prisoners died uh guards died they executed a couple prisoners for it how did they really think that was gonna end honestly yeah they figured one of the they did try to negotiate with the guys and and they knew at that point that they weren't getting out alive and so they basically were like you know I'm gon to die anyway so this is the way I'm going to do it so Alat in it time malcus trous saw eight murders five suicides 15 die of natural causes 36 Escape attempts and supposedly none have ever none have successfully escaped except for those I was gonna say even though you said that potentially three could have yeah of those Escape attempts 23 were recaptured six were shot and killed and there's five that are still listed as missing and assumed to have drowned including the three gentleman that wow yeah I think they I think they lived I think that guy was alive at least until 2015 well and his grandma got flowers right and I Mom I don't remember who it was it was a relative who knows if that was true or not it sounds like regardless I mean it's it's got a lot of Paranormal Activity a lot of a lot of people stuck there oh yeah I wanted to say even I forgot there was um there's even reports of in the in like logs there's reports of guards hearing Cannon and gunfire with people screaming to the point where some of them would hit the deck or get or get under cover only to find nothing and that happened on multiple occasions where they would hear probably from the Civil War time the old Civil War canons right yeah and there was an Old Lighthouse the first Lighthouse that was built there was damaged and later torn down to make way for um a bigger Lighthouse that was built in a better spot but there are quite a few reports of people hearing a strange noise including a guard like a guard actually mentioned this before he quit said um back in the the 1930s he heard a weird noise like moaning and went to go see what it was saw a strange green light it looked like an outline of an out of a lighthouse and then heard like a lighthouse fog horn noise before it disappeared and that type of sighting has been repeated even now people will talk about seeing the Old Lighthouse and hearing it and it's just a quick noise what I like about that one is even the old legends from the Native Americans that had been there and the the Spanish explorers that came later would talk about the Eerie lights and the Eerie noises from the island so I almost wonder if like people are saying Lighthouse because that's what we're familiar with but it was just the same lights and noises that have been there for hundreds of years wow that's that's cool that's cool interesting place and it it's got such a long history of being a prison and being a bad place it's almost like it it draws I don't know for some reason everybody that goes there wants to imprison people there it's just odd creepy place we should go perfect smoke for a spooky story what about this so tell me about this blueberry Jack Rabbit yeah blueberry Jack hair now you you grew this right yes this is some more of my homegrown so I have abundance of that we did however hook up with our favorite delivery service last night and we got ourselves two grams of shatter one gram of yeah one gram of sfv San oh I love sfv yeah which is so funny because that's San Fernando Valley we could go there oh I never knew what it stood for I was just like why do they call this [ __ ] sfv yeah San Fernando Valley and some wedding cake I think wedding cake is always a good one right can't go wrong go wrong so I'll be doing dabs as well oh my God my story Total flop what it sounds like the Lutz family made half of it up there was some stuff that happened but they embellished on it greatly and there hasn't really been anything that's happened since through five owners and it might not be as haunted as people think the punchline is is I don't think that the Amityville hous is haunted is people think it is which is almost a dis almost a disappointment but you got to investigate to know that's oh I like that I like that you know and it's okay it's okay if we investigate these things and then find out that they right that they're not true that's okay but my whole life I thought that this was like some Demon portal to hell and now I'm not so sure yeah I thought we lived right next to the mouth of hell and now I'm not so sure yeah I figured at any time it's kind of like quicksand I thought quicksand was going to be much more prevalent I was pretty damn sure because of the Amityville house that it was entirely possible that every other house you bought was going to be demon infested ghost infested and you were going to have to leave in the middle of the night in fear especially if it had those fan shaped attic Windows oh yeah any windows that look like eyes haunted house 100% that's child me convinced but yeah no it like the the the kid in me the teenager in me the young adult in me was heartbroken to find out that everything I had always thought about that house could potentially be more embellished than what really is going on well I love that you looked into it and that we're gonna learn about it and I actually have a eyewitness account of yes there was some stuff going on but it was definitely embellished for the book in the movies oh wow and I witnessed account all right well I'm intrigued okay so it might not be real ghost stories but you know human deception is spooky enough yeah and and again you know there was definitely something but maybe not to the extent that that Society thinks it was basically like the guy George had married this girl that already had kids so the kids weren't his kids so the kid said as an adult he said in like 2005 did an interview that his stepdad was very much into the occult and Witchcraft and summoning stuff and that they were poor something happened and they were in a lot of debt so he basically there are some things that happened and then when he found out he could get a book deal on it he embellished a lot to get $300,000 to get himself out of debt so it's it it would almost it's it's like a trickle out of a sink versus Niagara Falls like yeah I there was some ghosty things and they were scared and they did flee because they were frightened but there wasn't [ __ ] oozing from the walls and stuff like that he was just trying to make money to get out of debt from a writer I gotcha it's it's kind of an interesting thing if you're not really familiar with the with the real backstory there's so many stories back and this is but this isn't a necessarily old story when you when you think about it the events that the events of the story that we knew happened in a very short amount of time in the not too distant past oh really 197 yeah yeah everything was fine and dandy at this place until 1974 so we're really only talking what 47 48 years ago which you know in the whole Grand schema thing this is really only my lifetime right it's not that long ago at all but 1974 there was a family there the defos owned this house and this house is in Amityville New York um we're we're again going to New York New York has so many ghost stories yeah it's a very rich history so this is actually you know if you're not familiar with where Amityville New York is it's about 30 miles outside of New York City on Island you know kind of the Long Island typical town but yeah so November of 1974 there was a family lived there the defos and they had I don't know a bunch of children four five six children and their oldest son uh Ronald Jr was 23 years old still lived in the house he got drunk one night and came home and murdered his whole family with a Marlin rifle holy [ __ ] [ __ ] so the oldest son talk about should have smoked a joint damn right chill the freak out it's 1974 roll one what the [ __ ] why was he so mad at his family um that I've never really been able to kind of figure out I didn't really delve too much into the info on his trial um but if you do Google him there is a lot of info on his trial I just kind of didn't go that route because I was looking more to see the roote of what makes this place supposedly scary honestly I cannot answer that for you but if you Google it you'll find it so yeah so the oldest kid comes home drunk one night murders the whole place actually killed most of his family while they were sleeping in their beds wow yeah that's some deep-seated shithe headedness kind of shitty like most of his siblings were shot in the back of the head face down laying in bed you know they're sleeping in bed and he just walked up and blew their head off of SH now how many people roughly because I mean a shotgun blast isn't quiet you'd think after the first one someone would have woken up I believe it was four siblings in both of his parents so six people at least six shots okay you know 1974 Long Island you know we're not talking the middle of nowhere I don't know where the neighbors were but you know supposedly let you know we're going back to to tying it into how we find some of these things prevalent throughout each story we do this was supposed to happen at the witching hour so apparently it was about 3 3:15 a.m. when this occurred but I would still think at 3:15 a.m. in a quiet suburb somebody would wake up when they hear six rifle shots yeah you'd think apparently not the four siblings the two parents um it did investigators did seem to think that one of the parents and one of the siblings were awake when they were shot that makes sense because honestly after the first two you know someone's bound to have woken up so I'm not surprised that the last couple people were probably awake and saw saw him coming with the shotgun and so you know you can imagine you know if you if you have done any looking into of how Spirit ghosty type things can tend to occur paranormal stuff can tend to occur traumatic death can kind of keep these things lingering and as you can see you know you got six six people and at least two of them saw it coming very traumatic deaths so you know 1974 family of six tragically murdered in their home that's terrible terrible history right there you know that's that's enough right there to kind of leave a mark um we've talked in the past on how some of this stuff can kind of quote unquote seep into the walls this is one of those things that can kind of seep into the walls you know yeah whatever emotions he was feeling you know whatever drove him to commit such a horrific act and then the the fear the the death you know that's a lot of energy to expend in one place a lot of negative energy and I mean we we've all kind of had experiences of being at a location where someone has passed away um and you do kind of get that Eerie you know someone died there kind of feeling you know what I mean yeah even if you don't know you know there's a lot of reports where people don't even know that someone died in that place and they can still feel how oppressive it is right right so 13 months later so the house is abandoned you know who's who's buying a house a week after this happens nobody 13 months goes by this is where the Lutz family comes into play the Lutz family is the famous family that that you've you've heard of in the book and in the series of movies these folks purchased the house so you figure at this point you're looking at like what December of 1975 okay were they aware of the history of the house when they bought it or had that been hidden from them that was never necessarily laid out in any of the research I did I'm not saying that that information isn't out there but I did not come across that information more what I came across was you know obviously no one wants to buy the murder house right so the price had been drastically reduced the luxes were Newly Weds but Mrs Lutz had some children from a previous relationship so they were instantly a family with children you know it wasn't like they were Newly Weds but there was children involved is my point right instant family instant family you know money's tight and and but yet you need space for for people so it seemed more like the Lees found a really great house perfect size enough bedrooms and a price they could afford in a area where you wouldn't necessarily find a home for that price kind of deal gotcha they get this and you know obviously the price was reduced because of the murders but this is where nobody's gonna want to pay market price for a house that's like a blood spattered walls can you imagine like the the realtor going through there and be like and this is the room where the youngest children were brutally murdered in their beds and here's the m so nice and easy to clean blood stains off the wall you know how do you what's the selling point for that it's like trying to sell the couch from the Lizzy barding house like come on yeah can you see that yard sale yeah I don't I I don't think people are going to appreciate what happened there I mean nobody wants to be associated with that the price cut must have been really steep for them to overlook the fact that this was like a death house right now this is where things get kind of a little a little interesting as you know from the movie the books the Lutz family only lasted in the house 28 days before abandoning it like these folks did not even take their underwear they just walked out um everything walked out of the house and left it all 2 food in the fridge food in the fridge man they walked out wow so what the hell happened to make them run like that imagine you know you buy this house you you just get married you have these children insta family you get a sweet deal of a blood soaked house and you only make it 28 days wow that house is gorgeous too huge house big windows I mean stunning now this is where things get a little interesting um so the the the the father George George Lut claimed that immediately within the first night or two of moving in that he was woken up at 3:15 a.m every morning um which again like I said was supposedly around the time that's when the kid killed his family that Ronald defo carried out the murders holy [ __ ] wow yep [ __ ] imagine I would be freaked out okay freaked out yeah that's your first clue that's like the subtle warning that the house is giving you that you should get the [ __ ] out they're like hey I'm going to wake you up at the time that these murders happened it's a hint oh no it gets worse oh boy so the Lutz family also claimed to smell some strange odors odors you can't described you know not like dirty feet or rotten milk like just strange odors that couldn't be described they claimed that green slime would ooze out of the walls in the key holes key holes too like the walls in E ew because you remember you got to figure a house like this probably had those old you know the skeleton key locks that's so gross green ooze I thought it was blood I thought I heard something or maybe it was in the movie was something about like blood from the faucets or the walls was it really just green oo I what I read on uh the biography.com website was greenlime ooze yeah that's gross they claimed to experience cold spots which we're all familiar with cold spots when it comes to Paranormal Activity this is where this is where kind of the little things that make you go huh so Mrs Lutz was a quasy religious folk she was getting a little freaked out so she ended up asking a priest to come in and bless the house and back then that was kind of a common thing nowadays I don't know if you'd have a priest BL not as common I hear that occasionally but not very very often so she asked this priest to come and bless the house because she's getting a little wigged out now the honestly I would ask somebody to come over and be like hey I need you to come and do a full- scale cleansing on this house because I keep waking up at 3:15 and there's green [ __ ] oozing out the walls I mean I guess when you put it that way then yeah I'm having a [ __ ] come over and do a cleansing so this is where we start getting a couple other people's accounts of Paranormal Activity other than the Lutes themselves so this priest I'm not terribly familiar with Catholic house blessings but appar apparently he was going like room to room doing his thing uh gets to a certain room in the house and the priest allegedly Heard a Voice scream get out that's the big clue this priest actually told the lutzes to never sleep in that particular room now what kind of priest is that why are you saying get out it said get out get out don't ever come back like like why is she oh just don't sleep in that room don't sleep in that room now you're you're a big fan and I I tend to agree that you know if one area of a house is haunted the whole house the whole thing is what you think that just staying in that bedroom yeah and I can understand that activity might be centered in one spot or might be strongest in one area sure that makes total sense but you're not going to get away from demons if you sleep one bedroom over okay people all I've got to say is just shutting the door doesn't lock the bedroom however covering yourself in your blankets is absolute protection that does that absolute protection so doors no blankets yes so the priest in my opinion was no particular help because his parting words were just to never sleep in that particular room of the house to me red flag although red flag I'd probably sleep in the room because I'd be like I want to see what happened but anyway you're a glutton for punishment and we know this about you I'm gluton for punishment but some other paranormal activities um that were were reported in the house was garage door opening and closing in the middle of the night the the the family would be dead asleep and all of a sudden the garage doors opening and closing at 3:15 or like at 3 am. maybe when the kid was coming home to kill his family right and here's another weird one this would freak me out even more somebody kept knocking a knife down in the kitchen like you'd be standing in the kitchen and all a sudden this this knife would just fall was it the same knife yeah that's creepy that's super creepy I wonder what that's connected to yeah yeah um there was also a report of a now this is this is I don't know me personally this is where I start thinking people are talking craziness there was a report of a pig-like creature with red eyes staring down at George Lutz and one of the children Daniel from a window me personally I'm thinking okay this is where we're getting a little wacko um there's reports that George uh walked in to his wife Kathy levitating off her bed the boys that the two of the children Daniel and Christopher were also uh levitating together in their beds okay I'm sorry I'm sorry you've listed a lot of things that would have been the final straw for me but really really my spouse or my children levitating you touch my family and first of all we're getting you the [ __ ] out of this house but you know honestly first I'm getting the [ __ ] out of the house and then we're coming back like I would not have last 28 days no no that's ignoring a lot of red flags I mean these are people in an abusive relationship with a house and a ghost that should have paid attention to the first couple red flags I mean really green news I'm out okay yeah get out I'm out levitating really this is where I kind of I don't know I'm kind of torn a little bit I believe that a lot of those things could happen I believe that would make quite an interesting uh place to stay if all of those things had happen sure but there's there's a couple things now that I'd like to tell you about this that that may change your view on the Amityville Horror The Amityville Horror house okay dear tell do tell so so I kind of laid out the the basic timeline of of what sparked the issue and um the Lutz's timeline of moving in so we've got November 74 the mass murder of the defo family which by the way I'd like to point out Ronald defo just actually died in prison this past March oh wow found that out yeah this past March he actually died in prison 2021 yep March of 2021 the guy who killed his family with a shotgun yep died just died in 2021 in prison wow he killed his family back in 1975 two four he 1974 yep dang and he you know I was going to ask you what happened to him he spent his whole life in prison and just recently died wow yeah yeah so did he ever I'll have to look this up but I'm curious as [ __ ] if he ever talked about why or what possessed him to do that that would be interesting because I right like like holy [ __ ] what would make so but yeah different podcast into the mind of a killer but this is kind of where the story took a turn for me because so we've got November 74 the murders happen then we've got December of 75 where the luxes move in and can only make it 28 days now in the time since then nothing's really happened with the house if you remember the movie The Amityville Horror that came out in 1979 the book was written I think either the same year 1978 something to that effect I guess I never really thought of that it the movie and the book came out like right after all of this happened like boom boom boom wow so they like move out of this house and get a book deal ASAP so in my opinion you know I don't feel that up to this point I have found enough evidence of Spooktacular spookiness to Warrant the movie that I remember okay no and this doesn't really fit with what you and I have found in some of our research like prior to the podcast and for the podcast is a lot of times with the people who have experienced these hauntings they're usually not the first ones to run out and get a book deal especially not that quickly you know maybe 20 years later or something but but to they usually don't want to talk about it a lot of these people in places I mean the ones that are sensationalized are Sensational for a reason uh because people have hyped up small things usually the really scary ones people tend to not talk about so I'm very very surprised that these people had such a traumatic experience and then went turned around and wrote a book couple things a couple things to to point out um there was a lot of people who actually questioned the validity of the luta story shocker I'm not surprised it's quite Sensational George and Kathy the parents George and Kathy Lutz took a lie detector test to prove their innocence they both passed oh well you know lie detector tests aren't that hard actually to pass I know you and I know this but just not just this is just a bullet point for you right here's another thing though the couple was bogged down in legal and financial issues uh which prompted folks to believe they had a motive to create this Fantastical story to get money weren't there psychics that investigated though yeah did that happen like at the same time or did that happen before the book was published or after it I believe would have been in between the book in the movie I think it would have been in between and the psychics did say that there were unhappy Spirits there well of course there were a family of six with slaughtered in bed of course they're there and they're pissed to what extent let me keep going okay let's here the the lux's former lawyer his name was William Weber he had a falling out with them over money issues and in 1979 he claimed that the three of them came up with it over many bottles of wine wait you're no you're telling me lawyer is claiming that they made it up like over a dinner party holy [ __ ] no yeah but now now here's here's another another switch in the opposite direction here the pendulum is going the other way now one of the children Daniel who actually still lives in Queens New York he claimed that the house had ruined his life and that he continues to have nightmares to this day that fits with with a growing up in a haunted house one of the children they didn't necessarily say which one but one of the children said that George had been very deep into the occult and into Witchcraft and that that kind of precipitated his embellishments of what really happened the child didn't say um in 2005 well he wasn't a child in 2005 but in 2005 one of the L's children said that there was an evil in that house and he could never ever go near that house again but that the story his stepfather told was very embellished interesting interesting wow it's almost starting to sound like there was some haunted stuff and then Dad just took it and ran it kind of sounds like these people might have made a little bit of it up yeah there could have been some bad stuff there yeah obviously we are aware of a murder of of family members there but slim Ming from the walls that's very Ghostbusters to me very Ghostbusters I mean some of this stuff is is definitely reasonable to have happened you know I I I can buy into a lot of the stuff here but the slime oozing from the walls that's where I start to kind of I don't want to say roll my eyes but a little bit Yeah weird pig-like creatures in the Attic it was most recently sold in 2017 and it seems like the price keeps going down it was sold for 600,000 which was 200,000 less than the original asking price but anyway in the time since the lepes there's been five other families and none of them have really had a problem in the house it was kind of a buzz kill no other experiences this was kind of a buzz kill for me there has really been no other reports now you know you stated before that that it was odd that you know George supposedly gets driven from his home with his family by these ghosts and runs right to a book deal it just seems odd you know maybe these families have had experiences and whatnot because you know sometimes you could look at it as having five owners in 35 40 years is a lot but true and the price keeps going down and that's also odd but maybe these people are just afraid to talk about it from what I remember there were some reputable psychic groups that have gone through that did say that there was activity there but I think maybe you hit on something saying that there's activity and then there's slim coming from the Wall come on now right right there's activity and the house probably is quite active you know there's probably some a lot there yeah I got think of six spirits that could be in that house yeah exactly six reasons why but but again you know you start to lose me at the SL climb in the in the half pig half human thing yeah that type of thing you tend to usually just see in the movies it kind of ends there and that's the weird thing you know looking into the Amityville Horror house it kind of ends it begins and ends with the Lutes you know obviously the story of the defos fits in and is a very tragic piece of the pule but as far as Paranormal Activity from what I can find it starts and ends with the lutes to me that doesn't seem consistent with something that is supposedly as haunted as it was portrayed to be now I know that sometimes Poltergeist activity can center around teens and teens with you know emotional issues and this was a blended family with you know kids coming into an environment so I suppose if you have to stick to the Paranormal aspect of it it's possible that there's like a small haunting there that was exacer ated by by teens and by what sounds like a a dad who was a little bit too into you know that type of dark dark magic or dabbling yeah dabbling into the occult yeah so maybe things did happen um I I honestly am leaning towards I think Dad embellished most of it but I I do think that there could be quite a few kernels of Truth and and it's possible that it was worse with that family maybe because of the troubled teens or you know something the one kid does say he still has nightmares so maybe there was a emotional component to it too but you know you've got these you know you've got the you've got three Witnesses aside from George and Cathy Luts you have a Catholic priest who says that something told him to get out you have an adult child who says he still has PTSD from things that happened in that house but then you have a lawyer who says that a lot of it was made up over several bottles of wine H I'm torn because you know a lawyer who was stiff who broke client confidentiality I mean it sounds like he broke client confidentiality a lawyer who would do that do we really trust his word I mean that this is difficult for me because it really does feel like most likely the dad embellished it all if not outright made up the whole damn thing and the kids are traumatized because Dan had issues but the priest worse and the voice but the priest and the voice I yeah I don't know this one's a difficult one I I yeah I think in my mind what makes the most sense is a small haunting you know maybe exacerbated by the kids maybe pissed off by the priest I don't know here's another here's another option if he was dabbling in the occult he could have had something attached to him that wasn't attached to the house yeah so maybe you know maybe it was just the the right chemistry of that family at that time in that house right because again and um unless they are just keeping it from any sort of public knowledge there's been no reports of any paranormal activity in that house since the LST yeah that definitely makes me lean towards I think Dad made at least 75% of it up so I will say that I was actually kind of disappointed because I'd spent my whole life thinking that this was like some evil portal and it doesn't sound like it is so much haunted sure I believe it may be haunted but I don't believe is as evil and I don't even know what the other words I want to think of but I I just don't think it's as bad as it was portrayed in Hollywood yeah I don't think so either I think you're probably right interesting well you know hey when you investigate something that's going to happen and and you have to kind of stay true to that investigation and and uh figure find out everything that you find out I'd rather find out than than kind of be oblivious and be one of those folks who who didn't know the truth truth and believed a falsehood yeah I agree I agree it was a fun story when we were kids it's okay to grow out of it new knowledge you know we're we're bound out of all the out of all these places that that we've talked about and are going to talk about we're bound to find places where it ends up kind of being a bust yeah I feel like Amityville horrror house was kind of a little bit of a bust well that's okay hey we have our first bust I don't mind it was scary when I was a kid it was a scary story I know right I I definitely think tonight that you won the spooky spooky place this was definitely a West Coast winner oh my gosh I think so too it's it's one of those places that captures your imagination it captures the attention you know the inescapable prison and holds such torment that it's still haunted and everyone that goes there can feel it and hear it whereas on my end I feel almost like the Amityville Horror house ended up kind of being a a paranormal flop I'm glad I looked into it it was a good story and an alorra man that makes me want to go there like half want to go there and half be scared our list is getting long showell we're gonna have a lot of places we need to go investigate we're gonna have to turn into like travel people yeah right the traveling ghost hunting podcasters I would love to do that so next week our episode
