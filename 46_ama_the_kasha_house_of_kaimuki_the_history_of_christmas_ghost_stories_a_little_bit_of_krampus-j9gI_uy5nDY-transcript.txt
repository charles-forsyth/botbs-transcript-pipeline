super high witches have got it all from the west coast of California to the Eastern shores of Massachusetts we cover all the ghost stories urban legends and True Crime to be found and we do all that while smoking the sweetest sticky icky representing the west coast and the spookiest ghosts I'm Lea I'm shell and I just want to say that I think they're actually really here for awesome because we're silly and weird I don't think they're here for the ghost stories I'm just oh you think it's it's our sparkling personality shell that kind of bring the listeners in I'm here for our sparkling personalities not that's a good point I I think I'm here for all of it I like the entire experience actually I'm here for the weed I'm not gonna lie and how high are you today shell what day is it well today is Wednesday the first Wednesday in December when did it become Wednesday in December like wasn't it August like a day ago I'm pretty sure I'm fairly certain we just started this podcast actually we're getting to the point where it's about a year now where we just started talking about this podcast oh my God can you believe it can you believe it no I can't I loved sharing the Spotify wrapped podcast version with you that was a lot of fun to see where everyone was from that listens particularly just on Spotify that was really cool that was very cool and I would like to say that I did not realize we were so popular in Poland so tonight our shout out is going out to you folks in Poland and and and and we love you and it's probably cold there but we still love you stay warm hey Poland this bowl is for you so this evening actually we're going to do a couple different things I have a bunch of questions from our listeners shell for our ask me anything segment oh my God I love questions and then I'm going to be taking us to the wonderful state of Hawaii O we're going to talk about the Kasha of the kaimu key house now I'm going to kind of go into a more seasonal Direction myself oh I like it this is a beautiful time of year to get seasonal I love the whole winter solstice Vibe so what's your story about I'm actually going to talk about the tradition of ghost stories at Christmas that's our thing I love that yeah folks in America might not be as familiar with how traditional it is to talk about ghost stories um in the Paranormal in the Supernatural at Christmas time I wasn't aware that it was like traditional to talk about ghost stories it is really yeah so I'm I'm gonna kind of talk about the history of that actually no wait you're right the the the Christmas the story of Christmas Carol is literally about ghosts right right so we're gonna talk about the the history of ghost stories at Christmas time and we'll touch a little bit on Krampus our friend Krampus our friend Krampus oh what a wonderful cool urban legend I love that so I'm going to talk about ghost stories in general and not necessarily one ghost story in particular but it'll be a seasonal story so that's that's what you're getting from the East Coast folks that's what you're getting wow this is an excellent episode and I am smoking some fabulous weed this evening I got a little tired of my homegrown so I'm smoking something called grunts right now ooh it's very purpley I've been very into the purple strains lately I guess it's a cross of gelato which I've been totally obsessed with since this past summer with Skittles and they say it has a decent level of THC I'm going to say kind of in the mid 20s but the taste is phenomenal shell you would love it it smells fruity it tastes fruity and it's just an absolutely delicious smoke so middle of the road THC gets me nice and toasty and I'm just happy to be here and keep smoking this fabulous cultivar how about you what are you smoking today SH now this is a weird one and I'll tell you why I bought this we all know I'm out for the bus bang for the buck with the highest here so this is called citral glue okay a citrus adore a citrus and a glue who doesn't love Gorilla Glue so I'm guessing it's a hybrid of those remember how I was talking about a couple episodes ago how they're starting to sell like they call them popcorn buds because they're not pretty and big I just saw that out of a shop in Riverside California they sold me an absolutely gorgeous half ounce did you get it cheaper because it was smaller buds it was $60 it was an absolutely gorgeous half ounce and it was just all smaller buds I wouldn't say it was just crumbled Bud it was just smaller buds like popcorn buds absolutely beautiful super high THC concentration and it was $60 for the half because basically it's not these like like like I was saying in that our previous episode for some reason people want their whole eighth in One Bud I don't give a [ __ ] no shit's given once an area has been legal for a certain period of time you're going to start to see the prices drop drastically and the reason for that is because cannabis is a weed weeds are easy to grow and if you start applying excellent lights and perfect growing conditions amazing nutrients you are going to get pounds and pounds of the crystally gooey phenomenal hi THC content cannabis everywhere it's going to be overflowing bags and bags and bags of it right they won't be able to give this [ __ ] away ounce prices or I'm sorry pound prices plummet to the double digits in some cases they can afford to put just the choicest buds that's how they have to make their money because there's so much of it they have to put like just the best ones together and try to sell that at premium price and the rest they're basically just going to try and give away at basement bargain prices well right now I'm taking the basement bargain prices I didn't even look at the name of it I was just like oh that's only going to be 30 and E I'll take it I love it and I want the market to go that way but my fear and this is why I always push for any area that goes to legalization make sure get involved and make sure that home grows are protected make sure that the people are allowed to grow because once a market gets to this point they're going to do everything they can to lock down the supply they need to limit the supply to keep the price is high right and if they make it like the diamond trade where only they are allowed to grow and only they are allowed to sell they're basically going to keep the supply restricted so that they can keep the prices astronomical and we can't allow that to happen that's what I'm concerned that's going to happen unfortunately because they're going to try to monopolize on it so that they can make the most bang for their Buck you know kind of like some of these states I'm not going to call out States but there's a a state here in New England where casinos are illegal except for three that are state run so that that that state can kind of rake it all in and not share the wealth similar concept you know if if they control the production the smoker the end user is screwed exactly and and if they say that it's illegal for you to grow your own you have no other access than the way that they provide it to you so they they can absolutely monopolize it so protect hom grows at all costs so anyway rant over I'm happily stoned I'm going to pack another Bowl here in my nice little bowl I've been totally into this bowl lately the one that I broke it's my broken bowl and I love it it's got the perfect size little bowl and it just hits so nicely cheap ass glass but I absolutely love it well you only broke the nub off right yeah I just broke the cute little bee off the end of it just a little decorative piece it's still functional oh yeah the pipe itself not broken just the decorative be broke off the end sacrifice itself to keep the bowl safe damn it damn it we asked a little while ago for some ask me anything questions and our listeners responded so I have a bunch of them for you here shell I kind of organized them a little bit we have a few witch ones we have a few ghosty ones and we have a few cannabis ones what would you like to start with so I would like to honestly since we've been talking about weed why don't we start with the weed questions all right sounds good okay so first weed question I have is from prohibition State a non they said how much weed do you smoke and what is your favorite strain oh boy oh boy well see you know I have a funny about that I would say I used to smoke about a half an hour a week and then I the last two or so years not as much um probably maybe a half every two weeks but soila comes to Salem for the weekend uh oh I think no didn't we go through like a half in that weekend I I think we went through a little more than that so you know sometimes it's situational is it just living your life hanging out at home or our Leland shell together like race smoking I would say on the regular probably at this point a half every two weeks for myself to answer that part of the question I would have to say I smoke a little bit closer to an ounce a week and that's only because I grow I think probably I I've noticed that when I started growing way back in the day originally there were a lot of times I didn't smoke I worked eight hours a day in an office so I didn't smoke at all during that time maybe a puff or two in the parking lot at lunch um but then when I started transitioning to working from home and growing even more my smoking habits started going up and then when the pandemic hit that was around the same time when my fibroid pain really also started acting up and getting through the roof unbearable and I was trying everything under the sun to keep that in check so and that's when I discovered that dabs really helped with that pain and higher level THC in combination with CBD helped with that pain that's also when my husband started working from home as well so we would sit in the same office and it became very very easy for us both to be listen to music working on our computers day pass a bong back and forth and smoke all day and so now it's a little bit closer to an ounce a week I do talk a lot about taking a THC break and I probably should I don't have any you've done that before though you you've taken a break before we' taking a break ritually do you remember before that big belain ritual we did we gave it up for about a month I think yeah yeah think of it as the Christian version of our L yeah exactly we we were so focused on on wanting to do a good ritual for our community that we gave up cannabis not because we felt like it hindered Us in any way but as a ritual sacrifice of something that we loved we were we sacrificed that ritually to give that up you know the idea to put all of our energy towards this thing and to sacrifice something that we really cared for I like your analogy to lent we always joke about how I always go for the high THC and that that's my thing and and I will never deny that ever but moving and being in a different climate because believe it or not Upstate New York and living on the ocean coast and Salem different climate I believe it I think some of the reason I like the higher THC better here is um when you have those chronic back issues that I have sometimes like I can tell when a storm's coming in my back kind of thing and there's a lot more moisture in the air here constantly that I'm used to like not that Upstate New York was dry per se but it wasn't like there was no Ocean Air there either so the the I think sometimes the higher THC makes you know it's not just about fun and games it's sometimes about physically getting out of bed yes and it it really does physically getting out of bed yeah and and it helps so why not take it if it helps so the second half of that question is what is your favorite strain what's your favorite cultivar shell oh my God like how can you ask these questions it depends on what day we've always been fans of like white wedding type stuff Sour Diesel stuff Super Lemon Haze I don't know if right now today my friend I can answer your question because there's a lot of good strains out there but there are some I like sticking with like again the white wedding Gorilla Glue any silver haze type thing an oldie but a goodie that I haven't seen in a while and I wish I could would be some Pineapple Express um so you know there's a lot of good ones I don't know if I can say one I I think I'm with you on that it used to be back in the day nothing had a name it was either Rick weeded or it was kind bud right we either had dirt or kind that was it it had no other name or Hydro remember that Hydro yeah eventually Hydro became a synonymous with kind had nothing to do with growing it in water I just I don't think I can say one particular no and and back when we first started smoking some of the first names that I would hear were Super Lemon Haze or diesel strains and those were the notes that you would taste the Diesels all had like a gasoline kind of taste remember White Widow I do I love white that bad boy in a while I just had some not too long ago fabulous oh yeah good stuff very white very crystally but the the lemons had a citrusy taste to it so anything with a citrus was a Lemon Haze and anything that had a gas taste was a diesel so those were my favorites at the time possibly because they did have a distinctive taste and you know I love something that tastes good I would guess how how about this this might be a more fair answer and a less vague answer if I had to pick my favorite type it would be the citrusy flavors my favorite type would be the lemons the pineapples those citrusy you know what I mean yes I also love those I definitely grab for the sweets and dreams section I go for a gelato in particular any day if it has gelato in it I'm going to smoke it don't get me wrong I will smoke anything that you put in my pipe but I I I am a fan of the Citrus strains so so if you want to ask a favorite then that's the best answer I can give you right now friend perfect I think that's it I think we kind of covered that one so do you want to stick in the same category or would you like to change category sh surprise me oh okay let's go random pick a number one through seven five one two three four five from I'm a ghost the question is okay what is it with these multiart questions people this was ask me anything not ask me everything because we're so we're so weird that they just have so many questions that one is just not they just can't I guess so but I'm a ghost sent in and asked what would you say was the scariest paranormal sighting you ever had and what would you say was the most convincing experience you ever had or the one that made you believe in ghosts um the one that made me believe in ghosts and the most convincing was when I was 10 years old and my grandfather was at the end of my bed about six months after he died most convincing made me believe that wow that's intense scariest honestly that [ __ ] up story when we spent the night at Leila's dad's house and like that thing like that thing was not a good happy spirit and I was scared and I don't want to go to Ila's dad's house again overnight especially because we were so oblivious to the angry spirit that was there until the next day I think that was the scariest part for me well and I think also I mean you figure that was oh good lord 20 25 years ago we were a lot younger we were a lot more inexperienced we didn't know as much about you know magic and and and Witchcraft and the Paranormal that we were we were way more naive which I think made it way more scarier I agree we had less tools to handle with something yeah we were we were [ __ ] around with [ __ ] that like we weren't prepared to deal with at that stage in our lives and that made it scary absolutely I would have to say that the the thing made me a Believer I grew up with a lot of ghost stories in my family and so you grew up in that house how could that not make you a Believer I would have to say it's a very similar experience of seeing my great-grandmother at the end of my bed and talking to her and then finding out she'd been dead for years right I think that was probably the one as a child it's almost like we were both at an age where believing in that wasn't beaten out of us by society and we were more SU you know you know how kids are more susceptible to ghosts kind of theory and I I think that we were both visited by relatives that knew we would still see them exactly I agree I agree I have no explanation for it to this day so that's the one that caught me so pick your next category shell oh let's do a witchie okay so the witchy is from Belinda x420 they say how did you become a witch and what age were you what does being a witch mean to you well okay that's kind of a weird question to answer like what age did I have Tendencies or what age did I start officially reading books and studying and and and whatnot because those are two different answers oh if we want to go with the formal when did I start studying Witchcraft and wiah and paganism and this that when did you declare you were a witch um eight okay but you know I I in retrospect showed all the signs all along from childood you're a witch from a young age I mean I remember sitting in my backyard mixing sticks and leaves and acorns I used to brew potions in my backyard as well you know and and and like shooting stars making wishes on shooting stars like just stuff that I didn't know and by the time I was 18 I started to realize what that was all along yes same thing I used to brew potions in my backyard and do rituals and incantations and not really know what it was I read The Mist Of Avalon and I think I was nine or 10 I don't know I was very young it struck a huge chord in me this whole idea that there could be an island of women that would learn magic and ritual and I started to kind of try and emulate that just by what came to my imagination or what I think now was what was coming to me from ancient knowledge or from inner knowledge I just kind of naturally I think we all have this and we suppress it over time but I kind of knew these things and and my grandmother was also at that time teaching me Tero and showing me uh how to use a Ouija board and that kind of thing under the guise of spiritualism so pretty young I think but I didn't call myself a witch until I was until I was probably a freshman in school and I found a book that said that's what I was part of it was I didn't know what it was called until really around meeting you yeah it it was so early back then there were not all these books there were few books and they were hard to find and the internet and and chat rooms were in their infancy at that time I just knew I was different and weird and one of the few people I knew that kind of really had no interest in church and you know I'd rather go walk in the woods and be at the rivers and the creeks and the streams than in some weird building drinking some crazy old wine that I was too young for and a wafer that tasted like [ __ ] exactly but I didn't I didn't know what that meant just it me that I was different so I guess forever in 18 there's your answers I love that answer all right so let's Circle back and we'll do another cannabis question so let's see here a this person chose to be anonymous they wrote in and asked again a multi-part question they said what kind of marijuana do you use for pain relief and what kind of relief do you feel physical or mental have there been any downsides to using so much weed for pain um okay Annie to start your first question one thing I cannot medically resolve with marijuana is headaches if have a headache weed makes it worse if I have a headache I just need to stop smoking otherwise there really isn't a downside I've never had it not work I have um ruptured inh herniated lower disk issues that I've had for I don't know 29 years now and it's never not worked um sometimes you need to smoke a little bit more or a little bit less depending on how much you've smoked leading up to that or how bad it hurts but but I've never had it ineffective per se a belly ache let me tell you you eat too much for Thanksgiving and you feel like puking or [ __ ] smoke a bowl it'll help headache is a nogo with weed it's the one thing like if I got a headache I need to stop smoking period I'm the same way pretty much weed works for everything for me and honestly people will say hey use this cultivar for this problem or this cultivar for that problem and there is something to that there is a lot to do with the tpin and and everything with that certainly talk to your butt tender I hope you have one that's really knowledgeable but honestly for me just just give me some weed particularly one with a high THC concentration if I'm using it for pain or for nausea if I'm feeling nauseated or if I've eaten too much like shell said I love it it works for that have you ever seen that movie shell My Big Fat Greek Wedding yeah there's the one dad who's like put puts Windex on everything it's like his cure all you know oh you've got a bruise put Windex on it weed is our Windex weed is my Windex I it works for it does work for me for headaches not all of them there are some types of headaches particularly if I have a light sensitive type headache I might want to stay away from the Cannabis and and again that's that's probably why I stick to the higher thc's you know again I've had this this chronic back issue the better part of 30 years and back when I started smoking there was no such thing as CBD you know there was weed and not weed brick weed you know dirt weed like I said I don't even look at CBD nowadays I'm looking at THC hi hi THC and my back is functional that's that's that's what I know and I just go with what I know General pain nausea I reach for pretty much anything if I'm having severe fibroid pain I will absolutely reach for a high THC concentrate and also usually a CBD that I can dab as well and I'll do both of them what was the second part of that question I'm still high have there been any downsides to using so much weed for paint yes the cost oh my God the cost when is there going to come a day where like I pay a lot of money in health insurance okay like I I pay a good old a lot of money each of my P like why it's a prescription I have a prescription for it it's been recommended by my doctor why can't I claim it on my insurance I mean even if it only paid for like half like dude help girl out and I'll go to the doctor and that's why I hate going to the doctor nowadays for my back like unless they can give me a back replacement because I'll be like oh you know it hurts blah blah blah blah blah and they're like well we can prescribe this opioid and that opioid and make you a [ __ ] pill addict and I'm like no I just want my weed I'm good and my insurance will make me a opioid addict but my insurance won't even give me a break on my bud so weird that is the strangest thing how [ __ ] up is that like I feel like that's just backwards I agree they'll give me the craziest pills with the longest list of side effects but they won't pay for my weed that has been proven to help time and time again and doesn't hurt anything except for my bank account I don't want perco setes I want Super Lemon Hayes Jesus you preach it shell I mean come on so yeah there you go Anon that is the downside all right so ghosty question let's see here John H says I've never seen a ghost but I believe in the afterlife and have even done some amateur ghost hunting very why do you think some people see ghost everywhere and some people okay me never see them even though I really want to wow um wrong place wrong time maybe I'm not sure the only thing and I'm not thinking of the right words because I'm high but all I could think of is overeager what am I trying to say Lea like you know how if you're too overeager it's not going to happen it really depends on the energy that you put into it and the people that you're there with if you go into it and you have the right attitude sometimes it needs a reverential attitude sometimes it needs more of a respectful attitude maybe you're going into it expecting too much and so therefore you're not open and aware to the subtle things that are going on around you that's what I'm thinking you're expecting some big loud Kaboom and you're missing all the subtle things that are happening so you had the opportunity but you were looking too big exactly exactly you're looking at the forest and so you're missing all the trees right right but I will say this like anytime Lea and I have done such crazy things we tend to try to put the ritualistic aspect to it you know cast the circle and things of that nature in invite them ask them to come tell you know treat it like you're trying to have a conversation with a a viable person that's standing in front of you I don't want to sound weird but that's kind of the respect you have to give I don't know where you are John come to us we will do a ritual and and we'll see what we can do for you to bring some ghosties to you email us again John at the ston which isour at gmail.com give us a little more information on your situation and maybe we can give you some pointers and I'm not going to say this applies to you John but I am going to say that the Paranormal seeing ghosts is kind of it's kind of like baseball I I use this analogy for tarot too but it's kind of like baseball everyone can play baseball some of us can go out there and we're hitting home runs and stealing bases and throwing the ball perfectly right from day one with zero practice or training and some of us cannot throw a ball to save our lives trip over our own feet and can't remember the rules right and it depends on where you are on that Spectrum everyone can play baseball but you might be on the I really trip over my feet when trying to see ghost end of the spectrum and so you just maybe need some more training or maybe you need some pointers or or maybe you need to to find your tools and find your training before you get up to the point where you're doing a good job and being able to to throw you know able to hit home runs to continue with a dump baseball analogy so give us a little more information and maybe we can help you out I'm interested John definitely email us back because I'm I'm a interested and B totally willing to help oh damn man and she has done ghost hunting before she's LED groups I've done a little bit so let us know and let shell the expert give you some tips man take the free advice all right next question I'm all right next question witchy question toia tiia uh tisia says have you ever cursed anyone only people that deserved it and only when I was willing to take the consequences you know what I'm just going to be blun and honest here yeah I have and you know what sometimes okay rule of three you know do unto others as you would have done unto you what you put out there comes back to you I thing I understand it it's a thing Karma I get it I'm there but let me tell you what people sometimes the karma and the consequences are worth the action don't do the crime if you can't do the time right and and and you know I'm not going to get into details but I will give you a snit bit so you don't think I'm just total batshit this involved my children and I'm telling you right now if you you you want to involve my kids and yes I I I will do what I have to do and be Dam don't piss off a mama and that's up to you man if you feel that what you want to do is worth the consequence rock on with your bad self and and and yes there's been times where I felt that those consequences were worth it not going to lie and there will be consequences it's it's very similar oh absolutely it's very similar to if you're doing a spell or a curse against someone who is attacking your child it's just the same as if you walked up to that person and you punch them in the face and tackled right there will be consequences for those actions they might be a slap on the wrist but there will be some type of consequences for those actions whether those consequences are worth it to you or not is the question right and and when it comes to my kids you know consequences be damned and I was put in a situation and I did what I had to and I paid my consequences with a smile exactly so yeah I guess tisia it yes I have and only with great thought and great care and with what I thought at the time was perfect reasoning a damn good reason has it not always been a damn good reason yes and sometimes should I have thought a little more yes probably probably yeah so you definitely should take care you should take thought anytime you're going to punch someone in the nose you should think about it first right probably but you know honestly that kind of goes with anything you know good or bad light or dark you know whatever you're getting those same quote unquote consequences even when you're putting out good it's just when you put out good the consequences are good so you know there's there's consequences to everything good bad light or dark It's just sometimes with the dark you got to remind yourself are you willing to pay those those consequences exactly all right great question okay so let's see uh I think the last question we have is from hin 93 and they say how do slid you incorporate your kids into your witchcraft practice I took them my house I don't know they saw in everything we had a okay here's a dumb one and I know this is the dumbest rhyme in the world but my kids still say it I still say it but you know how kids have irrational fears of the dark and the Boogeyman and everything I made up a little spell for them to help them when they were kids and it goes like this earth air fire water this house is safe safe for a witch's daughter and so so they would repeat that four times earth air fire water this house is safe safe for a witch's daughter and it would help them feel safe in their beds and at this point it has such the weight of history that it's still a very powerful spell that my eldest who's very witchy uses on the regular so back in the day back in our our younger days my kids grew up having the cuffing meetings at our house exactly so all you guys would come over and and we would have coven meetings or be getting ready for rituals or sometimes doing rituals in my house and my kids were there so I mean my kids just you know I had altars in every room um witchie books everywhere like like it was just it was the every day for my kids full on pregnant belly about to give birth at any second one of the community artists drew a mandala beautiful gorgeous Mandala on a tank top that I had over my very pregnant belly as I walked repres presenting the goddess in I think it was a litha ritual um you know and so and they've they've grown up going to community and going to Ritual with us it's something that they very much participated in from birth on up until now I do have a 16-year-old who is kind of an atheist but she adores ritual she's an herbalist and she does like witchy things but not very much into the religion and then my oldest who's 19 is a full-on witch I I mean I would like to point out that my my children have a set of grandparents that are very very Catholic and they are very wonderful people love them to death despite divorce and my kids equally grew up they would go to Vacation Bible School over the summer they were a part of my my son did Stations of the Cross for years so my kids did have an equal balance between their parents and their grandparents of paganism and Christianity and they both kind of still ride that line as adults they just believe it all we did divinations over your pregnant belly and you know brought our children in slings to Ritual and to spell workor and you know so they they have very much been involved in all of it remember remember that one time when my daughter was like three and like ripped up a whole bunch of tarot cards just like I was like I mean it's just been they've always been in and dated in it yeah I'd like to share a quick tradition before we get into our spooky stories but we do celebrate a secular Christmas mostly because Christmas is such a part of our culture that I wanted to find a way to tie the two Traditions together so that we could have a family Christmas which was completely secular and non-religious all about family and giving and that whole idea of peace on Earth and you know and selflessness and then also celebrate the winter solstice and the birth of the Sun and and Ule and so what I decided on was on the night of Ule we usually have a little rich ritual and celebration and then we light the first of four candles we light a gold candle to represent the Sun and then the next night we light the gold candle for the sun and a silver candle for the moon and then the third night gold Sun Silver Moon green for the God and then on Christmas Eve we light the fourth candle which is red for the goddess and so each night kind of builds the light is growing to represent that on the solstice it's the darkest night and then after that the days slowly gradually start to grow as we enter the light half of the year so having more lights each night helps to represent the growing light and it bridges that gap between the solstice and Christmas and helps to kind of tie the two together and my kids still tell me to this day that is one of their favorite holiday traditions now I just want to put it out there I kind of you know my my kids are used to celebrating both and are aware of both and just putting it out there nine Christmas trees at my house Lea is my witness I have like an ornament addiction but for all your witches out there whether you're newbies baby witches old witches sometimes you don't have that kind of time in your life and it's okay and don't think it's not okay because as a single parent I didn't do any of that crap it sounds wonderful and beautiful and I would have loved to but like you know Sports and and and and Theater and you know taking kids here dropping them off there like it's a lot it's a lot and as much as sometimes you can't fit those ritualistic things in in the holidays you know shopping and family visits but have the conversations you know sit down and talk even if you don't have time to light the candles talk about it while you're eating or driving to the next sporting event just because you can't do it ritualistically doesn't mean you can't acknowledge it and celebrate it and and and put energy into it and there's so much out there now there are children's winter solstice stories that you can just buy on Amazon or at your local bookstore you know you can get a book about my first Ule and read that to your kids it's a lot different than when our kids were little right we had to make [ __ ] up we did and you know and we didn't have you know the internet was new like when my daughter was born you were getting a discs in the mail and you know and it was dial up and that's what it was when my k were born and like nowadays you know you've got Amazon and audio books and there's resources everywhere for raising P resources yep so that's our first ask me anything thank you everyone who sent in questions we really appreciate it and uh that was kind of fun and great questions by the way love it send more yeah for our next one I hope you learned a little bit about us and if you have more questions send them to the stoned wiches hour gmail.com we'll answer some more on our Instagram if we get any more questions up so go ahead and keep sending them in if you got them but I'm going to pack another Bowl shell and I'm going to tell you a super interesting spooky story that I'm not sure if it qualifies as a poltergeist a ghost oh a demon or cryptic oh I'm intrigued it's everything rolled into one I love it it kind of is we are going to go to Hawaii to the neighborhood of Kaimuki which is in Hulu the island of aahu can I just say real quick if we have any listeners in Hawaii we're thinking of you I hope you're safe in the volcano eruptions the pictures are beautiful but we know that there's some danger so we're thinking of you love you yes no one has gotten hurt in those eruptions right now I hope it stays that way let's see Mount aloa is currently erupting on the big island which is Hawaii which is sometimes called the big island so Mount aloa is the volcano that's currently erupting right now it has been erupting for several days I heard it sparked kilaa to start going too I believe so yes and it's the first time that mount aloa has erupted from about 40 years kind of interesting a lot of P activity the goddess p is the volcano goddess of Hawaii she's called she who shapes the sacred land she's also called she who devours the land and so all volcanic activity is related to the goddess P love P love P but she can be a uh Angry woman she can be she can be but she was also the goddess of creation and we're talking a little bit about her and it's very cool that the mount aloa is erupting right now because these islands were all formed by volcanic eruptions millions of years ago over lots of time and it formed this archipelago of multiple islands and they're all made out of volcanic rock which is a there it's a type of Basalt as you know a lot of times we have ghost stories and paranormal stories that have to do with different types of rock and water where they get together so Hawaii is kind of a magical land already and I'd also like to just point out real quick as far as p in the magical lava rock um there are stories that if you take Lava Rock from Hawaii you're cursed and there's been people who have even mailed it back to the National Park system because they felt cursed like if you go to Hawaii leave that [ __ ] there don't take it home I I would definitely agree with that leave that there there's that curse that P does not appreciate it if you take her lava rock with you and they actually have a whole department that has to deal with these rocks that come back with story after Story of bad luck that happened to people when they took the Lava Rock from Hawaii don't take the Rock and it's said that this is actually was made up by people who worked in the tourism Department that wanted to stop people from taking it I don't believe that but whether it was made up or real the stories of these people are really happening and the things that have happened to them are truly freaky we'll be doing an whole episode on the different stories of things that have happened to people and something that I think happened to me when I found a statue made out of Hawaiian lava rock in a house I moved into but that's a whole different episode that's funny because I've never told you this but I actually have a a situation where I ended up with it um it came from my parents that got it from Hawaii and I actually did mail it back so I can't wait for that episode that'll be a fun one for sure but so this this town is called Kaimuki it's on the island of aahu and it talks about a lot how this whole Community was built on lava rock but I think they all were so I don't know if this one was necessarily I'm pretty sure that all of Hawaii is lava rock this this community called Kaimuki was built in the in the early 40s and it was created to be kind of like a middle class introductory houses it's a really nice neighborhood and and there's lots of family houses there now Hawaii is made up it's it's very much a Melting Pot there's a lot of different nationalities there there's a lot of different cultures there I'd like to be there same and there's a lot of Japanese people that live in the islands and in the 1920s they reached the height of 43% of the population in Hawaii so their culture and people very much make up quite a bit of the fabric of the Hawaiian island Islands so in the' 40s the population was about a third of the total population of Hawaii and the reason I'm bringing up the Japanese people is because we're talking about an entity that's called Akasha which is a demon in Japanese folklore and people believe that one of the houses in this town of koki is haunted or possessed by Akasha ooh and on August 13th in 1942 officers were called to one of these family houses in Kaimuki by a woman who was absolutely Ely hysterical on the phone and she kept saying repeatedly she's trying to kill my children she's trying to kill my children when the officers get to the house that would freak me out a little bit right so they are expecting like a domestic violence situation but when they get to the house inside they see a woman and her three children two teenage daughters and a young son the woman is using tea leaves which is spelled TI which is a plant in Hawaii but she's using tea leaves in salt and water and trying to bless the children because they're being thrown about by an invisible force the police officers can see them being thrown up in the air and fighting against something that's not there reminds me of The Exorcist very similar to that there's actually a newspaper article and it says that upon entering the house the officers could do nothing more than watch in horror as the children are levitated slapped strangled and hurled across the room by an invisible force they couldn't do anything in the beginning they could barely even get to the children and the woman is screaming that someone is attacking her children oh wow that's freaky yeah for over an hour the police officers tried to get to the children and they were finally able to get the children and the woman outside of the house and tend to the wounds of the kids the kids had been strangled they had bruises all over their body and the did the kids have any idea was attacking him interestingly in the newspaper article it says that the son who was 10 years old at the time had said when they came home from shopping that the house smelled like a ghost and it was shortly after he made that announcement that he started being thrown around the room by this invisible force I don't want to be weird or anything but like and I know that like there's been times recently where I said it smelled like snow outside but like what does a ghost like like what does that mean I'm not exactly sure BS it smelled like death or it smelled maybe he meant it smelled like cold like you said it smells like snow I don't know it never says the article does not say what he meant by that just that he says he smelled a ghost and that's when the attack happened I'm very curious on what snow or yeah what snow smells like what ghosts smell like I am too actually keep in mind don't forget the part where the woman was saying she's trying to kill my children keep that in mind for a minute oh I almost forgot about that actually so that was in 1942 and then later in 1977 a young couple had moved into the house same house same house and everything was fine they hadn't been there for very long maybe a month or so and it was Mother's Day and the family left to go to have a family dinner with the husband's family so the husband's mother when they came back that night and went to bed the wife said she had trouble sleeping for whatever reason she was super tired when she went to bed but as soon as her head hit the pillow she was wide awake something fell off and she couldn't sleep that sounds like a Tuesday for me she noticed that around 400 a.m. the room was noticeably cold and she could see her breath in the air she decided to get up and go to the bathroom and she shivered the entire way and said that the room was ice cold now this is Hawaii I don't know if it ever gets ice cold that's when you wake somebody up because it's weird right she said she got back into bed and the room was so cold she could still see her breath and that's when she noticed it started to form an oddly large Haze at the end of the bed and then she realized it wasn't her breath the air was actually crystallizing and getting thicker at the end of the bed and it gradually formed into the Torso and head of a woman with long flowing hair and a wide open mouth like she was screaming but no sound and she had no arms and no legs what would freak me out the most about that situation is that it formed out of my breath not that it was there if it just appeared on its own I'd be like all right but because it formed out of my breath I'd be like whoa she says at that time she was unable to move or speak and she desperately wanted to wake up her husband and she couldn't and she said it felt like forever and she was finally able to make a noise and wake her husband and then it was gone the room was back to normal temperature The Apparition at the end of the bed was gone there was nothing so they went to a priest that priest said it was a Kasha that had attached to the house due to the murders that had been committed there so this was one of those attached to the property type hauntings absolutely attached to the property Akasha is a Japanese Yokai or demon that attaches itself to people who have done bad things in life and then when they die it takes their corpse away and and eats them ew yeah like a freaking zombie right they also disguise themselves as ordinary house cats and they're described as when they turn into their their Kasha form they have the head of a cat and are upright on two legs like a human but they have big claws why do they have to be mean to kitty kitties right I don't know so this is I'm not sure if it's a ghost or some type of crypted or a demon I'm not exactly sure it's definitely something weird it doesn't exactly sound like the traditional description of aasha as I get into a few more of these stories but everyone I guess is in agreement that it is aasha so what this priest told them to do was that they needed to make offerings to the spirit they should leave out bread and salt water leave it out as an offering for this spirit and then at the end of the day they should bury it in the garden and they should do that every day for a week sounds reasonable yeah they did that and then they report that in the entire time they lived there they never had another experience however in 1996 a young couple saw that the Kaimuki house the Kasha house was for sale and they went on a tour of it and even though it was kind of in disrepair they fell in love with it until the owner at the time told them three stories the first one is what I think is the origin story of why aasha attached to the house and what he said was that the first family that owned the house was a father a wife and two children a boy and a girl and it was a young Japanese family moved in loved the neighborhood everything was fine until one night the police got called to the house and when they got there they found that the father had snapped for some unknown reason and had killed his wife his son and his daughter oh [ __ ] the house was covered in blood and they discovered the wife and the son buried in the garden in the back of the house a but they couldn't find the body of the daughter oh it turned out he had eaten her oh my God his own daughter his own daughter all right this guy has mental health issues they never found any remains of her so I don't know if necessarily that's true but that's what he said happened and I couldn't find proof of this particular story but everyone is in agreement that this is why the house is haunted and because it was a Japanese couple and he had committed such an atrocious act they say maybe the Kasha attached there to take his soul and to take his body and then just never left maybe it got trapped because of the Lava Rock and the water I don't know but the second story that this owner told happened shortly after the man had killed his wife and two children can I just point something out to you real quick sure they say that um sometimes it's easier for Spiritual activity Paranormal Activity near water areas lava is very lava is a very porous Rock um so it is conducive to kind of keeping paranormal activity in that space that makes a lot of sense it it follows along with the stone tape theory that we've talked about on this podcast before right where some geological formation something in that area allows traumatic events to kind of be recorded in the very area and replay themselves over and over again and the way lava's very porous once it hardens is is one of those geological phenomenons so the second story that this owner in the late 90s said was that in the early 70s before the young couple that moved in that that gave the bread and and saltwater offering in the early early 70s a young lesbian couple had moved into the house and that everything was fine with that couple until one of them started having an affair with a man uh The Story Goes that she broke up with him and then he found out that she had been in a relationship all along and had been living all along with this other person oh and he snapped went to the house and killed them both before killing himself in the house what do they expect to be honest and then he told them a third story and this story is another one that was in the newspaper and what did you say the year was roughly it doesn't say it just says years later I'm not able to get an exact date on this newspaper clipping but I have a clipping of a newspaper so it may or may not be fake because I haven't been able to get a date for it but I see it everywhere online okay basically this article says a police officer in kauki got a late night call from three girls who were sharing the Kasha house they had heard some banging and some strange noises and people talking but when they searched the house they found nobody there one of the girls felt a man's hand grab her arm yeah but the three of them were alone in the house that's when they decided they were going to go to another town and spend the night with one of their mothers however they were having trouble leaving the house the bangings and the noises were increasing to the point where they were scared to leave the house so they called the police and asked the police to escort them to the mother's house one town over so what happened is the policeman wrote an actual report that says they got into one car the three of them in the front seat of one car he got in his patrol car to follow them he wrote in his report that the girl in the middle front seat as they drove away all of a sudden started jerking and reaching up as if she was trying to pull someone off of her what he said it literally looked like she was trying to fight off someone who was trying to strangle her oh my God the girl driving the car pulled over he pulled over and jumped out of his car and ran over to their car the other two girls got out but the girl that was fighting the Unseen entity was like wrestling around in the front seat he reached in to try and grab her and pull her out of the car and he says it felt like a large calloused man's hand grabbed his arms and pushed him out of the car oh my God he said it twisted his arms so hard it left marks oh my God he went back to his car and radioed for assistance when they got there the girl was still fighting in the front seat of the car and he says quote there's a ghost in that car the two friends are a hysterical on the side of the road oh [ __ ] so they're hysterical on the side of the road and now there's a second officer who got there within minutes and they're trying to get this girl out of the front seat they pull her onto the onto the parking lot where they had pulled over and she seemed okay so he tried to put her into his car and she wouldn't go she started like writhing her back arched he couldn't get her into the car but as soon as he would stop trying she'd be oh my God the three girls decide to go back into the girl's car and have the police officer follow them again no sooner had they gotten in the car than the passenger door flew open and the girl who had been being choked before literally looked like she was tossed out the side of the car onto the pavement oh [ __ ] she was grabbing at her throat as if she was trying to pull hands away and choking on the ground it took both officers to hold her down and to grab her hands away from her throat they were able to get her stabilized and stop choking but none of the girls would go back to the house they absolutely refused they had to have contractors go in and move all their things out of the house I don't blame him I wouldn't go back in [ __ ] that [ __ ] so after telling the potential new owners these three stories they decide to offer him half price for the house and to their surprise he quickly accepted so the house went from being $500,000 reportedly they heard these ghost stories and said okay it's [ __ ] haunted needs a little bathroom work I'll give you 250 needs a little bathroom work love it he says done let's sign the papers so they leave do a little more research and find there's even more more stories oh God and backed out of the deal refused to buy the house I'm not sure what happened after that but eventually it was torn down and I believe a small apartment complex was put up in its place now keep in mind nobody can agree which house exactly is the Kimo Kei house probably because no one wants to admit it there's some stories that could have happened in a different house in Kimo key so even if it wasn't one exact house that area is haunted as [ __ ] oh yeah oh yeah there's also a um you can find an article online a gentleman from San Diego named Keith man who lived in that house in 2016 or he lived in the apartment house that replaced the Kasha House of Kaimuki he says he was having a hard time finding housing in Hawaii and I guess he was living with someone who was kind of scary and had a fetish with knives and talked about killing people in his sleep so we haven't we all you know it's that it's that really weird slightly dangerous roommate that you that we all had in our early so he was looking for an apartment any apartment really fast and he found this one in Kaimuki super cheap and it wasn't until after he moved into it that he found out that it was the Kasha House people would be like oh you live in that house so when he looked it up and talked about it with his roommates they all agreed to have a few ground rules number one no Ouija boards good rule by way very good rule number two no Halloween parties of any kind ah taking all the fun out of it yeah but kind of understandable the veils thinness that time of year you don't want to tempt fate I get it and rule number three no challenging the ghost or tempting fate also a very smart rule which a lot of people don't think about also no fun right but you don't want someone like O say shell or you know your cousin who doesn't know any better coming in and being like and I don't mean this if there's anyone around by the way hey ghosty come on out and [ __ ] with me you know you don't want to be saying that man I feel kind of bad saying it all yeah right but you don't want to say that so I think that was pretty responsible of them he said kind of secretly he was hoping to have like a ghosty thing happen but other than the you know the pretty normal doors opening and closing and things moving around a little bit they didn't really have anything you know that's kind of the equivalent of having like little earthquakes in Los Angeles and really a big one you know you're just little things they're kind of fun he does say that there were a coup nights that made him way less of a skeptic oo he had a few Supernatural experiences here's how it started he would wake up every night at exactly 4:33 a.m. Here's your sign right he said his room would be ice cold and his heart would be racing as if he just had a hit of adrenaline he would barely know where he was and it would be as if his internal alarm was going off and he'd have a gut feeling that something was very very wrong the room would be ice cold and he says that shortly after waking up every single smoke alarm in the apartment would go off at the exact same time just one beat he wants to point out that these smoke alarms are not wired to a central unit they're all just individuals stick on the wall put in a battery smoke alarms but every night minutes after waking up at 4:33 a.m. every single one would beep once in unison there's your sign he says he has a portable AC it gets hot it gets very humid there right he says he has it set at 72 degrees and it cuts off he doesn't think it's actually possible for it to get any colder it's just a cheap room unit but he could see flashing on the AC unit 60° so he knows what temperature the room was that's weird because I mean not that we've lived in Hawaii but we've owned air conditioners and they generally don't go that low and he says it wasn't that the room was cold that was the weird part it was the ice cold feeling in his chest he says and I quote it felt like being stabbed by a white walker my veins were filled with ice water and I thought my life force was being drained out damn my chest was tight I struggled to breathe no matter what I told myself to calm down the feeling crept through me like a virus until I could barely move wow so he says whenever he'd wake up it would feel like someone was staring at him from the darkness and he would be super freaked out and he'd have to leave his room it felt like it was kind of localized to his bedroom and he says he never saw anything weird there was never anything physical there but just this ice cold dread and the room being super cold but it would just happen for a few nights in a row and then it would stop he doesn't think that it's aasha that lives there he does feel that there's a ghost aasha is a Japanese demon and it has that whole cat head and it carries away people who have done wrong right so people call it a the Kasha house but I don't necessarily know except for maybe that first guy that was there that his whole family I don't necessarily know if it's aasha that might just be an assumption right and it might be a poltergeist because there is one more story of a terrible thing that occurred in that house so there's a story that a Samoan woman and her son moved into the house I don't have a date for this story either but I heard it told and retold several times some by traditional Hawaiian lore storytellers so this Samoan woman and her son moved into the house and he started dating a young woman in town and the mother hated her could not stand the girlfriend at all and would constantly berate her son about this woman and said that she didn't want any half-cast grandchildren and certainly not with that woman that she couldn't stand unfortunately the mother passed away and as is I guess Samo and custom he buried her in the backyard and put up a headstone which I believe is still there at the Kaimuki house and some people say that that's how you can tell which house it is because the headstone is still there in the back Garden so he buried her in the backyard and time passed and the girlfriend becomes the wife and they have two beautiful children a boy and a girl and whenever he would leave the house there'd be Poltergeist activity that kept getting worse and worse but it would be perfectly fine when he came home and it culminated the night that the police were called and the newspaper article was written about the woman that said that it's all my husband's fault and she's trying to kill my children so they think that so it was kind of a poltergeist activity of maybe the mother that had passed away that was buried in the backyard of this house that already had a lot of spiritual paranormal energy lot of stuff going on yeah and nothing would happen except when the husband was gone you know so it's possible that those two stories are related interesting so there's another story about the unbless house and this is uh this is told by Haan Master Storyteller laka caponi and he says that in 1972 there was a new age Kahuna and Kahuna is like a like a witch like a spiritual a spiritual practitioner somebody who practices like Witchcraft and he had made a name for himself doing house blessings particularly in the Kaimuki area and he was kind of a hippie New Age kind of kahuna he had heard that there was an unbless house in the Kaimuki neighborhood maybe it was the Kasha house maybe it wasn't Mr caponi does not believe that it was the Kasha house but it was definitely in the same neighborhood so it was rumored that no priest Priestess Mage Kahuna witch anybody nobody could bless this house and as a tradition in Hawaii people like to bless their houses when they move in they kind of do that all the time good idea smart choice right they'll use the tea leaves salt water all of these things that are sacred there to to bless a house now this Kahuna took us as a personal Challenge and decided he of course could totally bless this house yeah so so he goes to this location and he's wearing all his ritual clothes and he's got his beautiful painted bowls that match they're made of this gorgeous sacred red clay and he's got one of water and and one of Hawaiian salt and he's waving the tea leaves and he's throwing the salt and the the water and he's blessing this house and he's getting louder and louder and he's using Hawaiian words and curse words and at the end of it he's thrown his last fist full of salt that he says he had made himself from a sacred place on the island and he takes the bowl the empty bowl of salt and throws it against the outside of the house and declares this house is blessed had dramatic a little bit now the homeowners have been through this before they've had the house blessed many many times and it has never worked but Kahuna seems very very confident so they're willing to give it a chance they're like are you sure he says I'm sure they're like great good job dude so they go home and he goes back to his house goes to bed a very smug and happy Kahuna does this have any tie to the phrase the Big Kahuna I believe it does yes weird this Kahuna wakes up at 400 a.m. and he finds that his bed his blanket is weighed down and covered entirely with a thick layer of the same type of salt that he had used to bless the house there's salt all over the floor his dresser his nightstand all the furniture in his bedroom oh in one corner of the room is no salt it's perfectly clean and laying in the center of that corner intact the bowl that he had smashed against the side of the house and it's filled with salt oh [ __ ] he gets up out of the bed and that bowl shatters right in front of him oh my God rumor has it that the Kahuna gave up house blessings entirely after that and to this day that house is still unbless we should go live there so I don't know if it's a Kasha or if it's a demon or if it's a poltergeist but it sounds like that house or that neighborhood is really really haunted so that's my story tonight what do you think makes me want to go to Hawaii can I just say that oh that's the reason you want to go to Hawaii just that well no but but there's a thousand reasons I want to go but that just adds to the pile now do you think there could be a p connection possibly it's the whole volcanic rock thing and P is part of all of this and maybe the jealousy thing maybe P could have inflame some passions possibly I I don't know I'm not really sure but maybe I do feel that the Hawaiian Islands are magical everything about it there's there's magic in every nook and cranny and there's a lot of there's a lot of spirituality that goes into the place and like you said even into the the lava rock that there's the whole urban legend about having bad luck attached to it that right actually does whether it's an urban legend or a real thing it actually happens to people so I don't know the whole place is just crawling with with magic and you know powerful Spirits it is a not that the whole earth isn't but it is a living breathing growing like Hawaii it ain't like Continental America like especially with that volcano going right now the size of that Island today and that size the size of that Island in a month could be different it's ever growing it's own living breathing thing yeah it's growing right now with the with the eruptions that are happening these lava formations will create new space and new land you know that that's how they were formed in the first place very magical cool place I want to be a hoola dancer can I just say that since we're talking about Hawaii oh oh my gosh what a beautiful tradition what a beautiful storytelling tradition so I think that would be pretty cool for you a Storyteller to practice a storytelling dance well speaking of Storytelling I want to kind of dive into my story real quick yes please I can't wait to hear yours your this is the first December episode so give me some good December stuff sh what you got it's about storytelling actually so it's funny you mention that you know it is the season you you talked about Ule and Christmas and how we're kind of proponents of both yeah why not I love I love a lot about it commercialism aside it's it's a beautiful holiday it is it is and just as a side note decorating a Christmas tree you're practicing witchcraft there I said it you're bringing a tree in your house you're practicing paganism people I was looking I was like oh you know the first episode of December and I I thought let me see if I can kind of tie it in somehow to the holiday cheer I love that I love that so I came across something very interesting that I honestly did not know and I like to think that I know a few things this I did not know and I was like fascinated which is how I ended up having it be what I wanted to talk about today I was trying to find Ghost Stories Paranormal Activity uh Supernatural thing is that we're somehow surrounding Christmas Ule the holidays and actually what I came up with did you know ghost stories were actually a Christmas tradition in Victoria England I absolutely did not know that I would not have put those two things together I mean we've all heard of A Christmas Carol I'm gonna get and I'll I'll get to why you would not have put those two things together because that's actually part of what I'm going to talk about awesome yeah I didn't even know this and I was like no [ __ ] but yeah Christmas Carol I was like oh now I get it I thought that was the only one no you know spooky stories featuring like Supernatural ghosty type stuff were all the rage during the darkest times of the year that is not just Halloween sin Day of the Dead whatever you want to call it you know put it that way and that makes sense I'm I guess I'm surprised I didn't see that connection before right so you know toward the end of each year you know fireplaces are lit hot cocoa the whole bit even here in America we've made the tradition to kind of revisit favorite classic holiday stuff like who is not totally right now in the mood for National anoon Christmas vacation because I I love Traditions I am all about traditions this time of year you know rudol Charlie Brown family touchstones I love those Hallmark Channel we're there so even though ghost stories may seem out of place in present day America um they were actually once a Christmas staple and their peak of popularity was during Victorian England no [ __ ] victorians were some freaky people you know they were like weirdos they were like SNM like BDSM people like they were they were some nutty people basically wait BDSM wait did you what back to Christmas here back toas yeah different podcast different podcast basically they used to have a tradition of Storytelling and it was mostly oral in the beginning obviously but they had oral stories about spooky things um and this wasn't just in you know England per se it was in different countries and cultures all over the world how How The Story Goes it gave people something to do during The Long Dark evenings because remember I'm I'm talking about have Tik Tok they didn't have electric Tik Tok okay no YouTube no Tik Tok but because of the long midwinter nights folks had to stop working early they spent most of their Leisure hours huddled close to the fire at home and this is how these stories came about and a lot of them were local the Industrial Revolution was what kind of put these oral stories to print and they actually started coming out with like I think today we'd call it like a magazine but like think of it as a magazine a periodical where every December they would actually put out a a publication of spooky Christmas stories oh like the penny dreadfuls yeah yeah so even when people moved out of their small villages and into larger cities they still wanted access to these like Supernatural sagas so you know Victorian authors uh such a Elizabeth gasal Arthur Conan Doyle they would cook up all these stories to have them ready for print in time for Christmas so there'd be like the Christmas movie release like the premiere release for the the Christmas holiday season like remember when we were kids we had the Sears catalog for Christmas toys the toy catalog oh yeah the toy cataloges would come out and be so much fun to look through same concept except they were stories like the Christmas specials except they were scary right but these were like horror filled holiday Tales they were like how the family gathered and it was it didn't matter if you were rich or poor or if you were you know so socioeconomic status didn't matter they would do stories about middle class people they would do stories about ghosts and people's stately manners um so it really it kind of touched everybody it wasn't just an upper class or a lower class opportunity ghost stories equal opportunity and then you know obviously as we all know 1843 uh Charles Dickens he was on that bandwagon uh he did A Christmas Carol now Americans didn't really get on to this tradition and the reason they believe that that didn't happen was because when they immigrated um a lot first of all a lot of the early immigrants seem to be coming more from like Ireland and such and they kind of tagged those spooky stories to Halloween so you're saying we could have had a nightmare before Christmas type Christmases all the time yeah we don't yeah that's kind of a bummer yeah I'd kind of like that and also you know people came to America for a fresh start and to live a different life and this was one of the Traditions that they kind of Left Behind when they came here I know I've seen some people decorate their Christmas tree as a s tree that looks very much like a Halloween tree with the whole Halloween Gothic type of decorations y now I have an excuse to do that I can say I'm doing a Victorian Christmas and I can decorate it as spooky as I want the only re the only reason we got a glimpse of it here in America was because at the time which by the way going back to some of our October Salem episodes Hawthorne even wrote some horror Christmas Story stories Nathaniel Hawthorne or judge Hawthorne Nathaniel oh he's cool but [ __ ] that judge guy no yeah no the author one he uh he had written some Christmas horror stories in this period as well but the thing with Dickens is he was like already like a superworld famous author so that's that's kind of how Christmas Carol got picked up in America but that was like the only one oh because it was already famous so they're like all right we'll let you tell your spooky Christmas story but that one because we like you right because we already know who you are and blah blah blah but American American Christmases the scenes and stories were actually described as syrupy sweet they really are and they still kind of are it's a Marshmallow World in the winter that's all I'm saying but you know it was hard to put those vi Victorian style Christmas ghost stories into that American culture um so it just never happen sticky sweet and you know candy canes and gumdrops does not mix with Gothic and ghosts except in Nightmare Before Christmas where it seems to blend beautifully in my opinion I may be bias I am wearing my Jack Skellington socks right now so in mind do you remember the beautiful Christmas tune you know I kind of love Christmas music it's weird and I know but I do you know the song It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year yeah do you remember the line in that scary ghost stories I'm not going to sing on our podcast people it ain't happening but there there's no line that says scary you Google that right now right now all of our listeners and I are going to sit here and wait patiently because it's happening scary ghost stories is a line and It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year and no you're wrong you are totally wrong I'm going to prove you're wrong right now there is no scary [ __ ] there'll be parties for hosting marshmallows for toasting and carolling out in the snow there'll be scary ghost stories and tales of the glories of Christmas's long long ago I love being right damn it I love they say it repeatedly they actually do it's right in the song but holy [ __ ] it's right in the song You and I have been singing that song since 197 what and but who knows the words does anyone never da but but we've heard it our whole lives and when never never never thought twice until I looked into this I'm like oh my God it really is oh my God how did I not get that but yeah you're just blowing my mind tonight shell I am learning new things left and right so really the way they used to celebrate in Old Europe is that it was kind of ghosty season all winter it wasn't just Halloween okay so so Halloween and sin are when the veil are the thinnest yes but that darkness that reclusiveness that conducive to ghosty stories that's that's all winter well we are still in the dark half of the year until the winter solstice we are still in that that go within time and like we discussed in some of the sa podcast the veil doesn't slam shut right it's still thin it gradually thick you know it gradually Thins and then it gradually thickens we are still in a Time when they're very very close to us right and you know once you think about it it's actually kind of cool it is a good time for Ghost Stories you know everybody together sitting around it's like having those campfire stories but inside you know what I mean it's like the inside version of campfire stories well it sounds like there's toasting marshmallows and having hot chocolate and telling ghost stories so it very much is like camping and it sounds like fun we're gonna touch a minute talking about the past present and future you know Christmas that but I just wanted to add one little last tidbit we are in the first week of December um as we stated I just wanted to real quick uh talk about Krampus oh Krampus okay all right let's let's get into let's get into that one real quick and I don't mean to put you on the spot and and we did not plan this ahead of time um but what do you know if anything about Krampus okay I know there's a film that stars Krampus I know that he's like a a demon looking Santa like figure do you know what his purpose is he's kind of like you know how how we say Santa Claus is always watching and and kind of making sure that you're a good kid Krampus is the one who like scares you if you've been bad so absolutely first of all absolutely you're correct you know one kind of stand thought in in wiah in paganism what have you good and bad light and dark yin and yang balance everything has it nothing is strictly one or the other right everything has a balance and for all of the the light and sunshine and presence and and candy corn that is Santa Claus there has to be a balance and this is where Krampus comes in so how I want you to look at Krampus is Santa is the yanging Krampus is the Yang oh okay that's a good way to put it yeah actually Krampus actually comes from pre-christian Alpine Traditions around sixth or seventh century a German thing Austrian um that part of the world okay and actually Krampus has a night and that's kind of why I wanted to talk about it real briefly on this episode The Feast of St Nicholas is celebrated on December 6th so the preceding evening the evening of December 5th that is actually what is deemed Krampus night now I am not going to pretend to give you the German pronunciation so we're going to stick with the English version of Krampus night so this episode actually will come out on December 7th which is I think two days Krampus night is December 5th the night of the 5th so it's the night of the 5ifth so this will come out two days after Krampus night now Krampus is described as a wicked hairy devil that appears on the streets sometimes accompanying St Nicholas sometimes on his own um he visits homes and businesses just as St Nicholas Santa Claus W he's doing exactly what you said Santa Claus is rewarding St Nicholas rewarding the children with candy and gifts for being good and CR is beating and torturing those who were not that's a that's a little bit more drastic than a lump of coal well we're being real get a choice can you choose Krampus or coal because I would probably take the coal now in some of the recent movies they actually portray him as a murderer that he kills you so hey whooping your ass ain't so bad that's true killing me or whooping my ass I I'll take the whooping like I said he's generally kind of in that German Austria Bavaria Croatia CCH Hungary um that kind of Slovakia like that part of the world now did he come to America at all other than the movies or is he more of a a European kind of thing other than the movies no um he is actually a a European thing but in North America Krampus celebrations are a growing phenomenon but you know I you know there's immigrants people from all over the world coming to America they're bringing their culture they're bringing their beliefs so you know that those celebrations are growing but the core of the belief and the core of the folklore is in kind of middle Europe there's got to be a word for it but I'm calling it middle Europe okay no that sounds fun I like that's interesting but kind of like an evil Elf on the Shelf kind of thing you know just little spies Krampus is gonna kick your ass but I'm very interested you know he's supposed to have like you know the devil horns the hoofed feet and all of that yeah he looks really cool kind of like a kind of like a a Satan version of Santa Claus like a thing on his back like he does he even have like a pack on his back or something I think so yeah he's supposed to like have a switch like he basically beats you with a switch oh great him and my grandma must have had a a shared notebook so basically you know I I think the best description I could come up with is the ying and yang um with St Nicholas because you know obviously back in those days it wasn't Santa it was St Nicholas but but Krampus is a thing and the festival is coming up so be good because you know on the night of the 5ifth you don't want to be getting your butt whooped right exactly but you know we do have some listeners in Poland so I would if you're out there our polish friends first of all hey second of all what are your crampus celebrations what do you do to honor Krampus because I'd like to know I'm super curious that is an interesting tradition you know there's getting a lot of media a lot of movies a lot of TV shows so it is ramping up at least here in America so I I'd like to know if you celebrate Krampus tell me about it I'm nosy and as with everything of course we have to take a tradition and turn it into a murderer so Krampus instead of just punishing bad people before the holiday is a murderer is that true or like is he more of a you know I'm here to kind of scare you straight kind of figure like like which is it is is he really really evil I mean because I can accept that there's a lot of creatures in folklore that are or is he kind of just I'm here to get you on the straight and narrow path the way from what I read and from what I researched it would be like the only way I can equate it um remember my mean Grandma yes it'd be like my mean Grandma I gotta mean to you because they love you and want you to do right but they kind of show it in a hard way yeah this is more of a Scared Straight And you know do you want to get an ass whooping or do you want to get a gift because those are your options right because if you go with Krampus you're getting an ass whooping and if you go with St Nicholas you're getting a gift makes it very easy for a child to understand I mean like you said Krampus is looking Santa's looking everybody's looking be good kids exactly there you go and hey these elves on the shelves are everywhere know I don't know how I feel about elf on a shelf they didn't have that when I had my kids in the spirit of Christmas our next three episodes are going to be Ghost of Christmas Past for December 14th Ghost of Christmas present for December 21st which is the winter solstice that will also be
