hey it's 4:20 a.m. welcome to a special wheel of the Year episode of the stoned which is our I'm Leila and in this episode we're talking about the Spring Equinox sometimes called ostara Dawn is two hours away and this year the Equinox is on March 20th it is that moment when the day and night are of equal length the sun is aligned to sit exactly on the equator and Springtime comes to the Northern Hemisphere it's [Laughter] [Music] switchcraft we want to welcome everybody today it's 4:20 a.m. welcome to the stoned Witches Hour we've got a special episode for you today um we are going to talk about ostara a pagan slwic holiday another as I like to call notch in the wheel of the Year we're moving to the next notch in that wheel I'm shell I'm Lea and let's talk oara yeah let's talk all things oara for this special wheel of the Year episode of the stoned Witches Hour and ostara in the northern hemisphere is the celebration of the Spring Equinox in the southern hemisphere it is a celebration of the Fall Equinox you know I remember when I first got into into paganism and and wiah and all of that I would get so damn confused I was like what do you mean it's different in Australia it took me a minute to kind of yeah it took me a minute Northern Hemisphere southern hemisphere you know I just I I it took me a minute yeah that's one of those things that that I think being a pagan helps me to realize because it's not something you normally think you don't normally think outside your own culture you know or your own area of the world a little bit and and spring festivals are something that remind me that we're all kind of connected you know there's so many different cultures that celebrate the Spring Equinox or or the beginning of Spring you just to mention a couple you want to hear a couple cool Traditions I found about shell absolutely what' you find well as you know eggs are a big thing in oara as well as in Easter which is a Christian tradition that happens around the same time of year eggs are huge in a lot of spring editions and obviously they're a big sign of spring you know do you remember in New York looking for like the little robin eggs the blue robin absolutely absolutely it's kind of that it's that sign that the Death part of the Year winter I like to call Winter the Death part of the year the Death part of the year is over and things are coming to life things are blooming things are blossoming and that egg is like the symbol of the birth of everything green and and new and fresh and warm yeah and so many cultures recognize that for that exact same reason just as you said sh that there's the egg is a beautiful easy representation of New Life of Rebirth of things of the earth Reawakening and and new things being born so like in Bosnia they have this Festival in a particular town uh the town of zenica in Bosnia where at dawn which is another commonality a lot of us like to gather at dawn on on the first day of spring again new beginning I'm a lazy [ __ ] for me to be up at dawn come on like I understand tradition but I'm one of those witches that I will pretend it's Dawn at like two in the afternoon and that's perfectly valid and I would definitely say that that um oaro was one of the few times I was willing to get up at dawn because it is such a neat feeling but if Dawn's not your thing like shell said pretend it's Dawn at any time of day that you want but these people somewhere it's Dawn somewhere that's right these people in this Bosnian town of Zena will get up at dawn and gather on the banks of the river and everyone will get together and they'll have this big communal scrambled egg meal everyone will make these eggs they make enough to feed like everyone in town and it just sounds like such a nice way to celebrate the first day of spring and it's I'm not sure what it's called but uh it translates to the Festival of scrambled eggs and they celebrate that is the first day of spring and I think that's so cool that is cool that is cool but again too early in the morning that is very another one that you might like um the Egyptians also used eggs and they celebrate something called sham Al nessim which is a spring festival and they celebrate that the Monday after Easter and to be honest I love how they figure out the date of Easter do you know how they figure out what day Easter is every year I have no idea it's hilarious I love well it's not hilarious it's really cool actually so Easter is the first Sunday after the first full moon after the Spring Equinox so yeah that's that's so you find the Spring Equinox and then you find the next full moon and then you find the first Sunday after that and that's when Easter is yeah but that that doesn't follow no no no no no that's not right because sometimes Easter is in March that's right because the spring aquinox is at the end of March but it's it's always after the 20th so say the Equinox is on the 20th or the 21st like this year the Equinox is on the 20th okay say the the full moon was on the 21st okay and Sunday was the very next day so Easter could conceivably be like a day or two after the Equinox or it could be as much as a month later maybe the full moon was the day before the Equinox I see what you're saying I gota okay so it depends on when the full moon was after the Equinox which I think is kind of a cool way to figure out a holiday I I don't know I guess it's the Pagan me I love that that that's kind of a pagan way of telling time I don't know I kind of like that Wick and wheel of the Year man it's always on March 21st 22nd like I ain't guessing what month it is and all that [ __ ] it is March 21st or 22nd period but the egy Egyptians so the the Monday after Easter they have a spring festival and that the name of that Festival translates to smelling the breeze and it acknowledges the coming Harvest and the change in the air um they decorate eggs and write wishes on them and the eggs symbolize rebirth and people hang baskets outside their house hoping for their wishes you know it's just kind of cool how eggs and rebirth you know are kind of all over the place well and that kind of goes along with the tradition of of the hair uh with oara the rabbit the Easter Bunny yeah the beautiful you know you start to see rabbits in the spring yet another sample of of New Life due to that it became that the hair is kind of a totem symbol for lunar goddesses as well as the hair as a symbol for the moon and that's kind of why it's it's one of the goddesses it's most closely associated with is eostar goddess of oaro you know it it ties in that rabbit that Easter Bunny our little happy friends everybody says they can see a face in the moon and I've never really been able to see it but I do see the rabbit in the Moon that some say that you can see on the face of the Moon and so really yeah that's another reason why the rabbit is associated with the moon now here's an interesting one I don't know if you remember back in elementary school whether you were in elementary chorus or Elementary band Hot Cross Buns remember Hot Cross Buns I do remember the song Hot Cross Buns Hot Cross Buns you got to kind of think of that as like the celtis Celtic cross um the four equal armed cross with in the balance within the circle what is a hot cross bun shell it's a bun with a hot cross put in it I don't freaking know so it's literally it can be like a sweet bread bun that has a an equal armed cross on the top like you said a Celtic cross but it kind of has that symbolism um of the of the the equinoxes you know you have the two equinoxes crossed by the two solstices and then you got the Four Seasons you know the north south east west quadrant I love that that's great symbolism and then the circumference of your bun I like that the circumference of your bun that represents the cycle of the year the cycle um of of Life the circle of life and there's that still point in the balance of the center so you know you like hot cross buns actually have this like magical symbolism other than a sweet tasty treat and as a stoner who loves her munchies and loves bread carbs of all kind are my favorite hot Cross Buns on ostara are fabulous and easy to make they are they are and I just don't know how you get the cross in it that's all you just cut it while before you bake it oh okay okay another thing that I I thought was a a nice Association I'm all about dragons I love dragons I have a dragon tattoo you have a dragon tattoo as well right I do yes okay yeah that's right so we both got these Dragon tatos we love dragons um in some mythologies the goddess eostar as well as stara in general is associated with the serpent or dragon energy it's the point of the year that the serpent or the Kundalini energy is positively exploding leading up to B oh I like that it's the same energy that you see in springtime the new beginnings that Fierce fiery change that breath of fresh air you know with the dragon is renewal and hope and optimism just like spring spring is Hope and renewal and optimism amazing rebirth energy and and just the two of those go together really really well you know it's that coming out of the dark time spring is is just like a dragon coming up from underground with a beautiful fiery breath spring is is coming up from the dark and coming out from that dark and it's the breath of fresh air that those first hints of spring that that just let you know that anything is possible this is kind of that that notch in the year where where you kind of feel that that dragon energy that serpent energy that that Kundalini Let's Get It On ch ch yes that those New Beginnings you kind of feel those stirrings of life and and the get Twitter pated like they said in Bambi right and some festivals in other parts of the world like Holly in Northern India I love this Festival so so much it's so beautiful um have you heard of this no it's Holly is celebrated by Hindus across India I know they have a a holly celebration here in Riverside California and it involves color it's the Festival of Colors and they throw colored powder or they'll get like squirt guns full of of um liquid colors and everyone runs around and kind of throws these powders and squirts each other with the color and lasts all day and night and it's just out door festival with bonfires and people sing and dance and they have lovely foods and at the end of the day everyone is just covered head to toe in bright spring colors and they full bellies of good food and they've been dancing with friends and having a great time and and just really calling in that spring energy and that you know that glorious happy celebration of spring and I just like you were saying it's like that rising of energy everything's been asleep and slow and and now we want to celebrate the colors the flowers and the bursting of life and that that calini energy that's moving up through us the sap that's Rising right right and and you know this is like this I look at this as the time of year where things start to explode the Earth explodes with grass and flowers the trees explode with Buds and leaves the weed explodes with buds yeah it's an excellent time to you know hopefully you've started some seed if not you can start them now yeah the birds are chirping you know um rabbits are being born Lambs are being born calves are being born the world is exploding with new growth now and and you know we're we're jumping we're springing forward in our time it's lighter longer you know I I think one thing that that people sometimes forget is that the Spring Equinox it is so named because we're we're back to that equal parts we're back to that Equinox where everything's equal that equal equal day and equal night when the when you have the yeah everything's divided perfectly on that day there's a balance there and it's a good time to to help find your own balance and you know sometimes in some parts of the world I know it's your part of the world it's rainy and cold in New York it's snowing right now here in California it's a little different the desert is blooming you know that's the balance that we have here it's usually dry and and everything is is usually dead and brown but this time of year we have more rain and and so the balance here is is everything is Lush and green and the flowers come out and some years we've had super blooms where the flowers are just literally covering Hills yeah and and and that's part of the balance depending on where you live and you can see that this time of year it's very obvious and you can feel that in yourself and sometimes this is a good time of year to you know maybe find a spot outside or where you can see the outside if especially if you need that hit of sunshine that that hit of a fresh new flower you know maybe bring some of them into your house and you know you know there's there's a lot of traditions that are kind of woven into this that that people don't even realize they do spring cleaning there's one of them it's almost like this drive within the depths of your soul that like oh my God it's above 47 degrees I need to open all the windows and dust you know people people tend to to clean things out um get rid of things um open Windows more they want to bring that bre of fresh air that that spring Breeze that's going to kind of cleanse the old and and fresh dank winter get rid of that dank winter vibe that dank winter feeling and and let in what's fresh and what's new and and and if you are not a ritual person and you are not even if you're not even Pagan and and or or Wiccan the best way you can celebrate open a damn window yes it's beautiful and we talked about imul being like the beginning of the spring rituals where it's just the hints of it now you know you're full on spring in a lot of areas there's flowers coming up even if the snow is there it's melting it's the mud luscious time of year New York that East Coast is kind of Muddy Now's the Time to start something Fresh open a window like you said and get that that breath of fresh air feel that balance within you maybe maybe meditate pack your favorite pack your favorite weed in your favorite Bowl you know have a seat someplace where a little sunshine falls on you and think about what new things you want to bring into your life like what do you want to Manifest this this rebirth this birthing energy doesn't just mean babies it means new ideas new thoughts new art new jobs moving whatever you need an impetus for whatever you need that fresh spring air maybe to kind of push you or help cleanse you to what you need you know and and kind of ride that energy I think that's where the spring cleaning piece comes in because it's almost like subconsciously as a people we feel that need to make room for all of the new amazing things coming in in the coming year obviously New Year's is in January but you're still in that hoarder hermit Funk where you know you don't want to get out of bed you don't want to get out of your blankets now you're throwing your blankets aside and and and you want that rejuvenating you want to make room for new things and you know spring summer you know warmth activity let's be fac it we're all more active in the summer than we are in the in the winter part of that out with the old gives room for in with the new right and we talked about that in imul and so now hopefully in oara you have gotten rid you've shed some of that winter and you've made that space and now you're opening Windows to let that sunlight and to let that fresh fres air and redo your altar now's a great time to put fresh flowers on your altar go outside smudge your house yeah feel you know with some fresh scents go out for a little bit of a hike you know find nature where you can and see what's new see what's blooming listen for the new Birds I love to watch the friends of Big Bear Valley on YouTube have an eagle watch camera and I watch it all year long but particularly in the early like January February and spring like right now they have a baby chick that just hatched there's a little baby eaglet and you can watch that baby eaglet all day long and that is a beautiful example of rebirth and spring that you can visually see outside right right in New York I love the lilocks I'm looking for the lilocks I'm looking for those flowers and those fresh scents so redo your altar bring in fresh flowers you know decorate it with some bright pinks and Light blues and purples and you know fresh to to kind of bring the energy of of Fresh Starts and new beginnings and and birthing something that you've been hoping for bringing that into this world you know what a sign of spring is in Massachusetts and I find it so disheartening I could die what's that seagulls seagull you don't like seagulls oh my God can I just say so you know there's there's a lot of places in in in and around Salem where you can go to the Waterfront and some of these have places you can get food you know everybody loves fried dough do not hate on fried dough love fried dough love fried dough love fried dough you know me me and my sweet love significant other and his son were at one of these food places along the shoreline one day so his son is like you know probably 17 at the time holding a paper plate with like I don't know it had some fried dough on it some french fries whatever and we're walking these SE gos they got no shame in their game man they like will come and take the food off the plate in front of your face they don't give a [ __ ] no [ __ ] given they have no fear of humans in when there's food involved they will attack you for food they will come at you for food and it's not like these son of a [ __ ] don't eat they are not starving they are like big fat turkey size seagulls when it says don't feed the birds people there's a freaking reason you turn turn them into flying SC scavenger Pirates don't do that but they they will if you have food on your person you are not safe they became evil flying pirate scavengers they're terrible I hear these seagulls squawking and I like start getting like Twitches yeah birds like Alfred Hitchcock [ __ ] man yeah you're not talking about you know the nice seagulls that are wheeling in the distance over the ocean no I'm talking about the ones who want my freaking food you're talking about dive bombing evil [ __ ] ERS exactly um we went to a we went to this place in seab Brook New Hampshire and got some seafood at like one of these like curbside seafood places love those places by the way oh yeah I love the taco joints out here so my boyfriend says well we let's let's go eat in the car and I'm like well there's picnic tables here why are we GNA go eat in the car and I'm like all right whatever we go eat listen to the native oh my God we go eat in the car and then I watch these three older older ladies sit down at a picnic table right in front of like where our car is parked oh and dinner and a movie these [ __ ] are getting dive bombed to the point where they're like hovering over their plates and trying and I'm thinking get in your car just go to your vehicle run run get off of the picnic table and and and then I'm like oh I see why we're in the car now but you had front row seats to was a horror show finally these ladies like get a grip and like Duck and Dodge into a vehicle so then you know my boyfriend being the [ __ ] that he can be starts like plucking he'd open the window a tiny bit and pluck out a french fry and those seagulls were dive bomb in the car for the french fry and i' be like get the window up it's GNA get in and I'm freaking out so yeah you know it's spring the seagulls are back watch your food yeah watch everything oh my goodness you know another thing that um is fun this time of year is the food you know like you're were saying the hot crust buns fried dough is a good one for this time of year food trucks we are getting in a food truck season food truck season how magical is that right right you know coloring eggs that's something that is has been kind of co-opted by Easter as we were talking about it's part of a tradition in a lot of different cultures and there's a bunch of fun ways to color eggs you can use red onions red cabbage you can use turmeric to make them yellow or orange depending on how long you leave them in coffee can give you like a light brown or a tan blueberries can give you blue you know if you want to go the maker route and try that it's kind of fun to use what you have in your kitchen and dye your eggs it's just nice or if you're like me you can go to your local grocery store and buy some of that what is it Paz Easter egg coloring yeah color it with Paints color with markers do it with stickers however you want to but decorating eggs is a fabulous way to celebrate the season it's an easy way to get the kids into it you know what we would do I I would give my kids when they were younger um obviously they're adults now and they won't play my reindeer games but when they were kids I would give them white crayons and we would all draw little symbols and little pictures on our eggs um with the white crayon and then dip it in the dye so that once it was dyed whatever little symbol or picture that we drew on was like a white outline that didn't get dyed basically like the wax kept the coloring from that area and and your little picture showed up and that's a great way to do a spell too yeah and I mean obviously my kids weren't sitting there doing all kinds of crazy spells they were drawing little faces and sunshines but like I was doing like little you know little sigils and stuff with my little crayon on my eggs and it was not only a really fun thing to do with the kids but kind of put my little witchy Twist on coloring eggs with the kids exactly same thing here we always celebrated oaro when my kids were little until they went to preschool when my youngest went to preschool in kindergarten that's when she learned about Easter and candy and did wanted to know why the Easter Bunny didn't come to our house and why we didn't talk about Easter and she learned that from her teachers yeah that was surprising to me so after that we would celebrate a combination stara Easter for ostara we would decorate eggs like you did sometimes with magical intent sometimes just with fun spring intent and we would also they would get baskets from the ostara fairy on the Equinox usually with like seeds and flowers and maybe a little crafty thing in them and one of the things I love to do with my kids is to make flower crowns and you can make flower crowns and have weave a spell into that as well you know you can weave a a flower crown for love put a little of rose in there you know you can weave it for you know some type of protection if you want to put some type of sage or not fur what am I thinking of um like a fur tree lavender Pine you can put lavender in there you know you weav some magical herbs or some magical flowers into a flower crown and you can put those you let them dry and put them around your house wear them on your head for you know your spring ritual but that's an easy way to weave a little bit of magic that you can put around your house you can put different crystals um what are some do you have any crystals that you like for oara Shell you know I kind of stick with I like color I I I kind of am a color follower I know that sounds weird but no it sounds it sounds perfect you know deeper darker colors uh in the winter um lighter colors so so I have I have a lot of stones I keep handy this is something that I would use as say in a in a in a springy type ritual this might be hard for you to see on video but it is it is a a purple and white amethyst uh it does have kind of a big white band through the the purple P that's very pretty this is something in in this particular Stone happens to be kind of egg shaped as well yeah it looks like a decorated egg with the the purple of the amethyst and then the white of the other Stone it almost look like a perfect GE geometric design it's very pretty so with sometimes how I look at things is you know people might might go well according to my stone and Crystal book amethyst is for blah blah blah I don't care for me it is light purple and white and it's shaped like an egg so I'm using it for an estara ritual because that's in my head it works for me it works for me that's what kitchen witchery is it's we're not trying to follow or copy anyone's particular Doctrine and we're also not trying to make fun or co-opt anything but you know it when we're decorating for spring we we go for things that draw us to Spring maybe we're drawn to a citrine because it looks like yellow sunshine this green adventurine it's it happens to be a pale adventuring so it's kind of like that that color of new grass a fresh butt of weed it's that light green that makes me think of spring so because of the color I'm going to incorporate that because it visually makes me think of that oara vibe that spring Vibe and that's perfect I mean that's part of you know if you're especially if you want to have New Beginnings with money if you want to draw money into your life be like this is the year I'm GNA have fresh starts as far as money goes you know aventurine is perfect for that you know it's a Prosperity Stone and that light green makes you think of spring and money so what a perfect stone for that you know rose quartz you can't ever go wrong with a rose quartz and again that light pale pink makes me think spring think Gara and you know you can never go wrong with using a rose quartz in a ritual oh absolutely because who doesn't need a little bit of self-love or or or positive energy like that coming to them and the same thing with citrine is it looks like sunshine it looks like happiness and it it does the the energies that it brings are joy and new energy so perfect for spring so just because you're picking it based on the color doesn't necessarily mean that the kitchen witchery in you or like we've learned talking to Tom from Story Time with Tom and Mike the chaos magic your intent imbus that thing if you look at that green stone or better yet you look at that egg-shaped amethyst I mean that is a beautiful stone it really does look like an ostara egg it looks like a spring egg how can you not be put into that mindset and that's what magic is is getting your mind in the right frame you know athletes and people know you when you get into a state of flow that's when you have kind of done everything all of your practice all your work leading up to that moment and you can literally feel everything moving exactly the way it's supposed to and some people call that state flow and you can get to there in a magical State as well and having these tools around you these colors these things that symbolize spring to you flowers and the stones and the the fabrics and the open window and and you you start to meditate and this can all help you get into a state of flow where you where you are in a very Zen graceful place and you can feel those New Beginnings you can really find that energy within yourself to kind of push out into the world and to manifest those things that you're looking for in the spring and I think you know if if if there's anybody out there that's that's into chakras and things of that nature this is a good time as well to kind of to to to cleanse your chakras and and try to rebalance your chakras and you know get your spiritual [ __ ] in alignment align your [ __ ] people you know if you do yoga at all you might be familiar with chakras chakra itself means Wheels in Sanskrit and what we're talking about is seven energy points specific points on your body where this energy pools and it Swirls and it moves and it moves in with specific colors and vibrations and they each have a specific intention um they influence emotional spiritual well-being take the the hour it'll take you to kind of become one with yourself again and kind of work on on clearing out some of the [ __ ] from those shakras and and rebalancing them and and getting yourself into a more even space to go into the next phase of the year yeah absolutely finding a meditation that works for you even if it's just repeating a mantra over and over again while you sweep the dust out of your house whether you go simple or high magic you know do something like that and visualizing and I'm Stone and forgot where I'm going but visualizing that and and feeling that energy you know is really what you're looking for here so for this spring meditation what I want you to do is all you need maybe a candle if you got it some incense if you like it but it's not necessary if you have cannabis and you want to incorporate that I think this is a great meditation type ritual to use it but again not necessary so grab your pots down in a nice place a nice comfortable spot where you won't be disturbed for about 8 minutes and we're going to use the number eight here you're going to do this eight days in a row for about eight minutes at a time and the reason is because the number eight in numerology is the number for success and so that's going to help set our intentions for success and what we're going to do in this ritual is really help you over the course of8 nights do a little bit of meditation for yourself and give yourself an intention something that you can help grow with this spring energy you're going to set an intention which is basically just a statement and you're going to want to make it something specific and be careful because words have power Terence McKenna great author hippie philosopher Shaman said the real secret of magic is that the world is made of words and if you know the words that the world is made of you can make of it whatever you wish and I think about that quote a lot especially when I'm writing a spell or I'm doing ritual because those words are speaking to your subconscious they're really speaking to you and so make sure that you're telling yourself something that you need to hear that is going to be good for you to hear so you want to use positive words make your intention like it's yours already describe how you feel rather than exactly what you'll get so just like advertisers use just the right descriptive words to get the customers to come in if you're making an Instagram post or you know Tik Tok or whatever you use the right hashtags and the people will come words have power so use positive words and say I have I am rather than I want I need you know say it like you have it so for an example what that would be instead of saying I hope I get a job your statement would be I have the career that satisfies my material educational and life satisfaction needs or instead of saying I want a relationship you would say I am in a strong committed relationship with a romantic partner where we satisfy each other in heart mind and body make it an I am something that's right now statement and and kind of try and be specific if you can once you have that intention and your spot go to your spot for your eight minutes a day take your joint your bowl your Vape your BM whatever you've got and sit in your nice comfy space and then take a nice deep breath and as you inhale and exhale again pay attention to that breath as it moves into your lungs as it as it comes into your body breath is life breathing is life and that again we talk about the breath of fresh air in Spring that first hints of spring breeze so feel that life feel those new hints of Beginnings move in your body and as you're breathing in you know take a to if you'd like to hold that for a moment and let it go and visualize yourself sitting in a circle of light or maybe a circle of pot smoke maybe you're inside one of those soap bubbles you know the kind that kids blow on a lazy summer day the ones that swirl with all the colors of a rainbow as they're floating gently on the breeze one of those bubbles one that's so strong that it will not break until you tell it to so you're sitting inside this safe space and take a couple hits on your bowl each time you breathe in or or take that intentional to reaffirm your intention think it or say it out loud whatever you feel most comfortable doing and elaborate on it daydream about it allow yourself to just kind of go with it let the feelings roll over you pretend like it's really happening how will you feel when you get that job or when that relationship when that person holds your hand how will that make you feel inside you know what does their neck smell like what does the office smell like you know what music is playing when you first walk into that room think about it imagine it just let those emotions every sense that you can use and reaffirm that whole day dream and just give yourself eight minutes to let your mind wander take nice deep breaths on occasion or take nice toes on occasion every time you inhale whether it's inhaling that really good cannabis or taking a nice breath into your lungs inhale the good inhale all those positive wonderful feelings all those things that when your intention happens you'll feel and then exhale and just let go of any stress or any tension just kind of feel yourself sink a little deeper into relaxation each time you exhale after your eight minutes is over give yourself a little Shake give yourself a nice big stretch say thank you to yourself to the universe to the space to the Cannabis all of it to Spring and then mentally wipe away that light or the smoke the bubble whatever imagery you used as your safe space let that go thank it return it to the Earth and you know hydrate make sure you drink have a little something to eat walk around pet your cat give someone you care for a nice big hug but you know and then try that every night for eight nights and that's a really great spring manifestation it's a really nice spell to do it doesn't have to be Springtime but that's a great time to do it because again it's a time of new beginnings you know I just want to point out to all of our listeners that uh when uh we would be coming up with rituals for our coven this is exactly how we would come up with them we would just sit here really high and be like all right let's flop some ideas out and make something of it and somehow some way it would be the Great [ __ ] ritual Ever every time every time making an outline basically and then going from it and that's a good way to do magic you know put your you know do your research put your things down you know take your notes but then trust your intuition and and go with the framework that you've got and and just allow yourself to be open and receptive to to going outside of that framework you know based on how you feel and how you're called in that moment absolutely what wise words such wise words so we we do want to thank everybody for listening today about our thoughts on ostara things that we we are interested in as far as ostara and we we definitely like doing these special episodes on the on the wheel of the Year stay tuned we'll have a belan episode coming out soon and I'm super
