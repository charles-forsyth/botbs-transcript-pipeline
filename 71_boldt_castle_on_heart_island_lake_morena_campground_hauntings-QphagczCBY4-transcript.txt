it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 71 of the stone Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends separated by way too many miles get together to tell each other ghoulish creepy Tales from across the USA while smoking large amounts of Mary Jane we're smoking the Mary Jane today while smoking the Mary Jane just like they used to back in their old dumpy apartment bringing you some creepy stories of a haunted Campground I'm Leila and I'm talking about a haunted castle and some aliens today I'm sh well you do love castles and Aliens so I guess I shouldn't be surprised the only thing that would round this off if if freaking Bigfoot checked it into the castle be S I'd be S I've got a lady in white but no Bigfoot at my haunted Campground okay listeners we're all sitting here shocked I know we're shocked Leila's got a lady in white look at the shock on my face the only the only thing that's GNA Shock Me and the listeners even more is if you say there's orbs well yeah there's some orbs there well why don't we start with the down and dirty fun stuff I hear you puffing on a water pipe what do you got today I have got good news bad news for you today oh no is it Jack hair that sucks no this is an OG this is like a this is called grandfather OG and it is really good it's little buds but they're sticky they're dense they're purple they're very very crystally and no no there's some really good news still coming it comes in at 40% THC what the blankety blank now here comes the bad news okay no I was waiting for it yeah I'm pretty sure it's [ __ ] oh and I'm almost positive it's [ __ ] because I don't know I'm pretty high but I wouldn't say I'm 40% THC high and there are some studies out there including one that was just in Forbes Magazine a few years ago that said that science reveals cannabis industry's greatest love there's only one right so April of this year um in the Washington Post they said the weed you bought might not be as potent as promised a study finds and Colorado researchers took a whole bunch of cannabis and tested it and compared it to the labels and found that on average the THC levels of everything they tested was 23% lower than what was reported on the label so if it says it's 23% then that means it's zero well no it's 23% lower than that 23% so it would be like 5 percenti lower than that Liars the are on fire some of these cultivars came in at a whopping 40 to 50% lower than what the label said see that just pisses me off and that's why if you're gonna if you're gonna make us have this stuff regulated and you're going to make us go through the whole process of taxes could at least be consistent and right and and truthful ex if I'm paying taxes can my taxes pay for the truth that's a damn good point if they're going to go through all of this trouble they should label it correctly and I think the reason that they're not is money obviously if I misrepresented something i' sure as hell get in trouble for it because everybody reaches for the high level THC well duh who doesn't right l no that's true I don't I like the tasty ones I do tend to gear towards the higher te HC I'm just as guilty but it's not the first thing I look for however just recently at uh the green chamber near Riverside California this 40% THC is on the shelves now I like this company this place is a good place to go you know I'm kind of wondering where it got tested and why they think it's 40% THC yeah but if they're buying that third party they're just buying what they're told too so it can't necessarily be their fault exactly in California and in a lot of States it's not seed to sail like it is in Massachusetts right and so it could come from anywhere now while 40% sounds really good Anthony Deo from oaksterdam University he says that's just not feasible it's probably not ever going to happen he's fairly certain that because of the way cannabis is made up that to have anything 45% or above THC is just not really going to be possible is that true or not I don't know nowadays these percent seem to keep going up and up with no end in sight and as long as the consumer is going to reach for that first they're going to be padding these labels with higher and higher fake percentages gotcha so yeah this T when I said hey what have you got that's the highest THC what have you got that's going to hit me right upside the head this is the one that they handed out so and so far it's definitely Stony is it 40% Stony I don't know well that's kind of a downer I'm not Li but we've suspected for a minute that they've been padding these percentages well yeah oh absolutely absolutely because you know people like me are going to go for what is higher automatically and they're just kind of duping duping us how is the average consumer supposed to know you trust that it says right on the label lab tested you're going to believe it and if they're lying or if they're using faulty measurements then just like you said people are being conned out of their hard-earned money because they're paying extra topshelf dollar for these higher thc's we've been pleasantly surprised when I've gotten you to buy mid-range or lower and you found that they packed just as good or almost as good of a punch as some of the quite a bit more expensive top shelf and I think you know label padding is probably the reason why now this week what I've got this I I know we talked about this before because this is like my second go around with this but this is that uh uh Blue Dream number two M I like it it's not too shabs blue dreams are usually pretty good they're in the sweets and dreams category very tasty typically it says my total cannaboids are 28.8 I'm feeling it I'm liking it I'm getting what I paid for that's the thing as long as I'm getting what I paid for I'm good you know if you're going to sell me dirt weed at least charge me dirt weed pric okay don't sell me topnotch and then I'm smoking dirt weed then I'm pissed this totally getting what I'm paying for happy love it good stuff good stuff a little more leafy than I'm used to especially for store bought store bought is never leafy I thought is this a su grown because sometimes if it's Su grown or outdoor grown sometimes it'll have a looser bud structure and it'll it does have a Lo it does have a looser bud structure yes I wondering if that is outdoor or sunr do they have to tell you that is that going to be on my they usually would it can be a selling point for some people Some people prefer the outdoor sungrown but you know again it will have slightly different bud structure the only thing I could think of is if that's why it's the blue dream number two maybe number one was indoor two is outdoor three is hydro who knows if you're lucky enough to have a good bud tender and shell very often in Massachusetts does you can ask ask where it was grown ask how it was grown ask if they like it ask what their favorite is if they're a good bud tender they will have tried several of well if it's a good place they will have let their Bud tenders try their product and they should know what's tasty what's head high what's body high you know ask questions I'm definitely gonna have to check this out because um this was let's see this was not grown by the store it is thirdparty weed but it does have a website that I will have to look up I love that it's funny that cannabis makes us label readers but yeah no super happy with it again one of my cheaper ones I think I got this for like 150 an ounce after taxes which hey if you're from around here you know that's a hell of a deal yeah I'm loving it but still as much as it's more Airy than those super dense ones um I'm still grinding it seems to be the way I have finally I think gotten on the grinding bandwagon you know I fought it I fought it for years and then a friend got pissed off at me and bought me a grinder so now I feel like if I don't use the grinder that I'm wasting it and you know me waste not want notot man so like I feel like if I just am stuff and shove that I'm wasting it I find my partner my husband my sweet love is still a stuff and I love him I love him it's the one place where I get irritated with him I almost every single time want to unpack the bowl grind it and you've done me before you've done that to me before I'm just saying it doesn't burn as good it just doesn't well now I'm kind of starting to see your point fine you were right whatever I am liking ground I am liking it ground me too Welcome To The Ground side show to the good burn side here's the [ __ ] of it though I have found out that I've actually had to clean the grinder you know how I buy that cleaner what the hell is it called um you and your fancy cleaner I still use alcohol and salt um grunge off that's what it is my grunge off I have to actually take a freaking Q-tip and clean that outside part of the grinder because it'll start getting stuck with resin and then I can't twist it to grind and I'm like this is [ __ ] okay go to your local craft store okay go to the section where they have their clay tools like are you talking like like a AC Moore Michaels type store like CRA store if they have a section where where you can buy like modeling clay tools uhhuh they will have little teeny tiny metal like scoopers and piics and scrapes that are teeny tiny that are made for making marks in clay uhhuh you can get one that has just the right point you can get a whole set of them and then use that to clean out the cracks and crevices of your grinder oh no [ __ ] that [ __ ] put it on a joint put it on the top of your bowl but please don't waste it with grunge off use a little tiny tool and get all those because that's the good stuff right there if you saw how green that water was when I put it in the grunge off you would have cried your eyes out you're hurting my heart shell I did take all the KE out of the bottom though I was I wasn't that high I wasn't high enough to forget that I mean still but yeah I mean I've been using a dentist tool back like I don't know probably 30 years ago you probably remember that dentist tool I still have that that metal dentist tool from back in the day that I like I'll scrape my my bowl with but yeah maybe getting some of those little ones for the for the grinder might yeah they're less they come in all sorts of different shapes I like them better than the dental tools because dental tools are Pokey they're sharp and pointy yeah yeah these will have like Scoops and shovels and little wedge shapes and all sorts of little shapes you can find one that works perfectly for your for your tools nice have to go to the craft store any excuse to go to the craft store I mean really I know I need to get a charge card there so other than crafting well and smoking the other thing we like to do over the summer is camping camping I love camping and what better than to tell ghost stories around a campfire right well I'm one uping you here what are you doing you know I always try to do that so I've got a story for you actually I kind of got two stories but one of them we're going to save to the end because it's it's a current news event but my ghosty story this time it isn't necessarily about camping per se but it's it it ties into my yearly family camping trip I love it all right well let's hear your camping or your tie into your camping trip and then I'll tell you an actual Campground haunted story okay I mean how this really it doesn't really tie into camping per se but how it does how it does tie into camping is every year my whole life my my mother's side of the family we vacation camping we go camping it's what we love we all love it we prefer it over anything else but it's a particular place where we go camping we go camping up at the St Lawrence River up at the Thousand Islands region which is a big Seaway river that borders New York and Canada it feeds from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Ontario and where we stay in the Thousand Islands region is kind of at the mouth of Lake Ontario so you know camped up there every year since I was like four months old actually I'm leaving in a month to go I can't wait that kind of sparked me to come up with this particular story because I was thinking about my upcoming trip so it's funny that you brought up camping because again we totally did not plan that ahead of time but my my yearly family camping trip is what sparked me to do this story so up in the Thousand Islands region um if you've been there if you're familiar on the New York border with Canada there is a beautiful beautiful castle on an island called bolt Castle the island is called har Island part of that is because the original owner of the island which we'll get into in a few minutes kind of had the physical shape of the island reworked into a heart shape so if you actually see aerial pictures of heart Island it is in the shape of a heart you've told me about bolt Castle a million years ago when since we met since we've met I have heard some of these story so I'm really looking forward to this I can't even start with the beauty of this place now oh I you know I gota I got to look up the specifics but I want to say it's a hund it's a six-story 120 room Castle there's that's a legit Castle it's a legit Castle 120 rooms I mean imagine having a clean that no be pissed you need an army but on the on the island as well as the six-story 120 room Castle there are tunnels there is a Powerhouse Italian Gardens a drawbridge there is a tower it's a mini they call it a tower it's really a mini castle it's called the oler Tower or the Children's Playhouse which is a mini castle their Playhouse was a mini castle you don't even know man I love this place I've visited this place a thousand times I'll be back in a month and I can't even wait and it's like even though I've been there a thousand times I'll still go there every year you know funny tidbit of a story you know sometimes people get married and divorced it happens one of the times I got married um I actually got married at this place so this is a a beautiful Stone Castle I don't know how else to describe it so this was built at the turn of the the century back in like the early early 1900 I want to say that construction began in like 1901 so literally the beginning of the 1900s and there was a millionaire properer uh named George C bolt he was actually one of the head workers at the waldor ftor hotel in New York City um he was like the hotel manager type person the top dog at the hotel so to say so this guy was loaded 1900 loaded so he built this Castle right off the I don't want to say the coast I don't know if that's the right word because it's a river technically um but on a on an island right off of Alexandria Bay do you know how big the island is I know it's pretty small do you know how many acres the island I was just gonna say if I had to gauge it um I'll have to look up the exact acreage but if I had to gauge it just on my wherewithal of the world I would call it probably seven to 10 so very small very small barely big enough to hold this ginormous cast and and like some grounds around it right but it's gorgeous it's gorgeous so you know as a as a typical man of his financial stature back in those days he was in love with his wife more than anything in the whole wide world he built this actually for his wife that sounds so romantic an island shaped like a heart with a literal Castle on it built for his wife it's [ __ ] romantic it is and you know they had some children so the Children's Playhouse or the the mini castle was meant for the children there was actually there actually is and you can visit it you can look at it obviously you can't use it but there's a bowling alley in the basement of the children's Castle wow what happened was so he builds this his wife's name was Louise um so he builds this is like a project of love it did have a name prior to Island and I I can't recall this has been ingrained in like my family history knowing this and I can't recall it for the life of me but it was George Bol um in 1900 who renamed it Hart Island after the reshaping and what he did was have you ever seen the reinland castles in Germany yeah with like all the towers and the cone shaped tops and stuff well George was German and so he kind of visually they're supposed to look like those those reinland castles from like his homeland like a replica from his childhood right right the castle itself is 60,000 square feet what damn that is a big house well I'm assuming because it's six floors that it's you know 10,000 a floor ultimately um and then I would say probably about a thousand yards off of the northeastern side of the island is a yacht Island there's an island that holds the yacht house so they do have a yacht house on a separate Island I'd say about a thousand yards away is a house for their yacht I didn't sit there and measure it but we're estimating here is a yacht house like a a house for their yacht yeah rich people good rich people problems like total rich people problems because back in that you know back in the 1900s people had had started making the Thousand Islands region it was was becoming a booming vacation area and being right on the Canadian border and it's gorgeous in the summer you know you'd think oh Northern New York chilly cold let me tell you July and August Primo best place to be so it was act it was actively becoming a vacation area when he was building this Castle so unfortunately Louise in 1905 or 1904 excuse me uh 1904 Louise died suddenly like I said he began Construction in 1900 1901 and his intention was was to gift her the castle on Valentine's Day of 1905 oh no but in 19 oh damn right so now keep in mind she would go there and they would visit they would take the kids there and the kids would play there for the day and they would hang out and have picnics and they'd go show their rich friends you know all the progress but they never moved in they never lived there never lived there so she dies unexpectedly in 1904 he immediately he was in New York at the atoria immediately telegraphed workers to stop all construction basically they laid down their hammers got on their boats and sailed off and never came back he just couldn't bear to finish the castle without her that's so sad yeah even he never returned after that oh wow so this 6,000 square foot Castle just laid there 60,000 oh excuse me 60,000 square foot castle with a yacht house and a play castle just sat there unfinished and and keep in mind it was only you know maybe six eight months away from being done so the majority of this is done at this point okay 73 years the Castle was abandoned subject to the elements subject to vandals he wouldn't even sell it and let someone else live there 73 years un abandoned wow oh that's so sad think of it like you're so heartbroken you just can't even freaking fathom okay and that's what that's what I mean this man loved her so much he just couldn't he just he shaped the island like a heart he fashioned it after the castles of his childhood he couldn't he could not even think about it enough to sell it he was going to gift it to her on Valentine's Day and she died a few months before that yeah yeah heartbreaking heartbreaking so 73 years it laid derik finally 1977 the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority acquired the castle and systematically have been restoring it ever since the place is freaking gorgeous they've even got Furniture in it now it looks like like it actually looks looks like they lived in it a week ago it's all done up how it would be in the early 1900s very authentic very awesome so now we've gotten into kind of the backstory here and like I said you know the workers spent a good four years working on this it was almost complete by the time they were told to drop hammer and walk away so it was almost complete they had a a child Clover and clover actually had spent time there she actually has a a house right across the bay from there had a house right across the bay she's since passed obviously some of the stories of when folks would first go there now like I said 1977 the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority took it over so now you know you can't just trespass there you do have to pay to enter it's a nominal fee worth every cent did they make it a park I don't know if you'd call it a park per se but like an attraction it's an attraction you can rent you can take a ferry over if you don't have your own means of water transportation um you can hop on a ferry boat 10minute ride over from Alexandria Bay over to hard Island I think it's like 10 bucks to go through once you go through the gate pay your 10 bucks you can wander the whole island and the whole property for an unlimited amount of time could you bring a picnic and have a picnic on the ground you could bring a picnic and have a picnic on the ground yes could I bring a ghost hunting kit and go ghost hunting in the backyard you absolutely could but you do not have free rain without the public I mean there'd be people there but yeah so I could bring a Ouija board and [ __ ] around and find out oh we could totally [ __ ] around and find out the only problem is is there's no after dark access oh bummer but are there ghosts here so that's where we're getting into the relevancy to this podcast now first of all you can only get to this by boat so it's not like any old Rando is just going to wander upon it you have to have a boat to access it prior to 1977 there were people that had very lavish stories and as you can imagine back in those days we weren't alive back in the 40s and 50s and 60s but you start talking about ghosts and people are like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Crazy Train okay so like I said early 1900s um this started becoming a popular vacation spot in the Northeast which just ramped up over time my own family in the 50s got on that bandwagon and my grandparents from the 50s until the time of their death vacation there every year my mother's vacation there from the time of her birth until we're going in a month me from the time of my birth to I'm going in a month I think that means that you and your family by inheritance should own this island now we should we should own the whole [ __ ] and Kaboodle up there I'm pretty sure I think by right of having been there for so long consistently that Hart Island should be yours I should own enough to put a tent there at least enough space for a tent I agree I second this motion let's get it in writing so you know a lot of boers um back in the 50s and 60s uh personal watercrafts started becoming popular people were having their own family motorized boats back then and so there was a lot of folks that were just venturing out on the water and they come across this abandoned castle and I mean I'm sure you can imagine just coming across this you know you're cruising up this big huge River and all of a sudden this six story freaking Mammoth of a castle out of nowhere that would be quite the sight to see especially unexpectedly it absolutely is and so you know people start looking around and you know I personally I'm actually going to show you a picture of the children's Castle portion of it that looks like someone could stay there it's huge it's stunning someone could live in that that's just for the children that's just a tiny that's the Tiny Castle their playhouse has got to be bigger than most people's normal house correct that looks like an an easy 10 bedroom house correct correct and these people would be like what the holy hell we want to stop and look around and you know I can tell you from personal experience when you have your own watercraft up there you can go around and ride around at nighttime I mean we've been out on our family boat at nighttime cruising the river so imagine coming up on this at dusk or in the evening time you know I happen to be showing you currently a picture of the children's Castle there is a bowling alley in the basement now you can see this is a huge River you're like what there's a basement basement underground the basement is underground under the water that's creepy and they built all this so as you can imagine a lot of workers died really in the late 1800s early 1900s they didn't have OSHA we'll just say good point no oan yeah to build a basement in a river I mean this Castle we'll put some pictures on our Instagram but the children's Castle looks like a little castle it's beautiful a stone Castle but it is literally in the water there is an arched bridge that goes from the island to the castle the entire Castle is in the water right it's kind of cool yeah not to put a basement there they had to have built a basement in the [ __ ] River underground in the water no OSHA yeah no oan no sa requirements so a lot of people died oh they did they did and I want to live in that children's Castle how do I live there I would live yeah I'd live in the small baby children's castle and be A-OK okay and not even have a care in the world but you know beautiful stone laid so they were bringing Stones over on boats so there was boat sinkings from workers where workers drowned you know they're they're lasting out things underground and as you can imagine people are going to drown but like look at look at this picture um and and again we'll post this for our our viewers look at some of these pictures uh coming up on the castle this is the Power Tower over here I'd live in the PowerHouse okay Castle looks like a little city it kind of does I mean from the water on the island it looks like many houses it looks like a little town it does and and the castle itself aside from the other out buildings is just huge and enormous and just pictures I'm actually flabbergasted because the last time I saw pictures of this Castle I think was a good 20 30 years ago and it was dilapitated yes this has been a lot of work done on it right I mean oh millions and millions of dollars I think they've put in something like 25 million into it I remember looking at it back when you first told me about it a good 30 years ago and being so [ __ ] sad at how crumble it was no amazing they've they've done a lot this is a picture of the yacht house said is about a thousand yards off the yacht house looks like something you'd find in the Swiss Alps again it looks like it was built on an extension out from the island into the water not actually on the island itself well and again you know this guy is from German descent so these are going to have those German undertones yeah that aesthetic kind of look right it's just amazing the detail the scope of that project how much that must have cost is staggering for Love Money means nothing oh the story is so romantically tragic but there's been stories that because she was there and because the children were playing there people believe they've seen her there they believe they've seen Louise bolt there and I can get it because yes she may not have lived there and spent 247 there but a she did visit vised there and it was her gift even after death she would have known that was her gift I think that the folks that have said that they've seen her in the windows and they've seen her walking down the halls I do think it is Louise bolt but they have also heard the screams of workers they've heard sometimes in the bowling alley portion which is in that basement part of the children's Castle they can hear gurgling as if someone is drowning oh that's awful but imagine the the working conditions working under this in the 1900s think of the workers that not only in the blasting in the building of the tunnels in the underground spaces were risking being drowned there but the workers that didn't make it to shore because the boats sank or or what have you and they drowned in the river itself right there so they do hear the screams they do hear the cries but unfortunately based on the time of constru ruction it's almost expected wow that's too bad that's sad they do hear sometimes at night there have been because you can you can Circle the island at night you just aren't supposed to Dock and get off at night um but there's been boers fishing around the islands at night that have heard children playing they've heard what they sounded to be like you know you know back in the day those old rubber kickballs those Red Rubber freaking kickballs that they play dodgeball with they make a distinct sound when they hit the side of your head they do but they make a distinct sound when they get kicked too and people that have been fishing around there at night said they've heard children laughing and giggling and have heard that distinct sound of that ball getting kicked oh wow you know I'm not surprised that Louise and the children are still there even though they didn't pass away on the island because we have seen over and over again shell the same criteria it's a place that had a lot of emotional connection to the person and it has a lot of stone particularly Limestone and running water and this is right in the middle of it right in the middle and it's built of stone and so that makes a lot of sense we've seen those same conditions play out over and over again and not only do they tend to have a lot of hauntings but they tend to be haunted sometimes by people who had an emotional connection rather than dying there but you want to hear an interesting theory that went around for a while on the internet and I almost buy into it oh I'm curious what is it okay you know the theory of rewinding time and it just playing over and over like the groundhog day of ghost stories yeah the stone tape Theory people think that there is that going on here because and this is a good freaking Theory let me tell you this is one of the few rivers in the world that flows technically backwards right the St Lawrence is one of the few rivers that flows Northeast I think so from the Great Lakes out to the ocean I've heard a lot of ghosty stories and Paranormal Activity talking about North Flowing Rivers so you've got water technically moving into backwards motion but yeah so so the Atlantic Ocean um creates you know right in that area New Brunswick Nova Scotia area you you get the the Gulf of St Lawrence and then like I'm actually going to show you I know I I can't really show our listeners right now but they can Google it friends that again follows the stone tape Theory which says that some traumatic or very happy emotionally charged event can be recorded in the very air and the fabric of the Earth around you particularly in places that have a heavy Stone concentration and have water or running water involved these places tend to hold on to some type of recording and those are the ghosts that kind of repeat the same actions over and over again that's the theory people have with the backwards water flow is that because the water this is one of the few places where the water technically flows backwards and against the natural flow of water that it's rewinding time over and over and that these folks are just on the island reliving the same moments over and over and that that has to do with the backwards flow of the water interesting oh that's a very interesting Theory I don't know if it's because this this Castle is near and dear to my heart and the story and the love story but I I I want to buy into it that that backwards flow of the water is letting the bolt family relive their happy times on the island before she died because yes you do hear the sad parts the screaming the crying out the gurgling of workers that may have perished but you're also talking about the Happy Times of of the other folks as well so there's a balance between the happy and the sad you know there's there's not too many stories of apparitions other than Louise people say they have seen her in the windows walking up down the hallways workers who are there after hours and potentially at the dark period say they've seen what they thought was Louise roaming the Halls not a lot of apparitions here it's more of the vocalizations that they're that people are hearing but when you step on the island and when you you just you feel it you feel a combination of Endless Love and endless sadness you feel George's heartbreak when you step on that island like you're in awe but your first thought is this poor guy even though you're in awe wow what a tragic love story and there is some talk that there was a I can't remember what show it was one of the Ghost Hunter shows meatloaf they took meatloaf up to the Thousand Islands like yeah doesn't he have his or didn't he have his own ghost hunting series for a little while I think he did for a little while but what got him going was he guested on another show and they did the Thousand Islands region and they talked about boat castle and some Another Castle up there called singer Castle which uh we might talk about potentially next week to to do a final gear up to my vacation up to the Thousand Islands but yeah meatloaf did a an episode going to different spots in the Thousand Islands um because like I said as much as it's a hot spot right now in 2023 this be was becoming a big hot spot in the uh 1900s 19 19 20s 1930s 1940s so there's a long history of big old rich people houses and people going on vacations here and unfortunately some tragedy and some ghosts I've always wanted to visit there every time you've told me any story about the place you have talked about the Eerie feeling the this is like the one place we've never gone together we have not but the place itself definitely has always sounded like the air itself has that feeling of tragedy but at the same time almost a feeling of hope so interesting the whole area itself not not just boat Castle in in hard Island but the whole Thousand Islands region has an air of oldtime memories if that makes sense I think it could just be because it is a primarily vacation spot and people don't necessarily live there year round not a ton of people live there year round but it's got that bring you back to you know my my grandparents unfortunately are are are passed and gone but when I get up there it's almost like I feel like I didn't see my grandma 10 minutes ago but I feel like she's four camps down because I'm there and my you know what I mean it's like you feel everybody who's ever been there and it has that familiar nostalgic back in time feel yeah yeah maybe there's something to that water going backwards that's making that kind of time Loop there I don't know it's an interesting play on the stone tape Theory I'm very I just feel like when I get there I just step into a 1950s postcard and I'm in that postcard for a week and then all of a sudden I'm in some crazed reality that's reality when I leave I feel like that when I leave a pagan Festival there is that back in time feel to this place and it it it's almost like the memories and I don't want to say the spirits and the ghosts of old that are there but they draw you back to a time where nothing else matters than being there nothing else is relevant than being there in the moment you forget reality when you're up there and it's almost like I don't want to say it's got this like Gates of Hell thing because it's not hell it's got like this Gates of paradise where you better you gota you know remember that time we did that dream walk to Avalon and we tied our coven cords then the AEM to ground Us in it's almost like you got to ground yourself in when you go here because it's like the spirits pull you back to a Time where everything was wonderful hey I'm ready I got to go camp in there now I got a visit sounds awesome so now that I've done my little preaching about how much I love the Thousand Islands region in boat castle and and you know maybe I should take my Ouija boarded up oh my God should you should ask see who's there do some [ __ ] around and find out your comment about meatloaf I hate to say it but your comment about meatloaf got me thinking about another star that we've talked about recently on this podcast asked Kesha she of the Haunted [ __ ] love Kesha I did not know this but I found out after we were talking about her that she also has I think a short-lived ghost hunting series I haven't watched it yet yeah but she starred herself in a ghost hunting show so I'm gonna have to look that up I'm gonna have to look that up I'm interested because who doesn't love some Kesha I mean come on so my ghost story also is about a campground this is in California we're going to a place called Lake Morena o I like it it's got water yeah Lake Moren actually isn't really a lake it's a reservoir and it was created in the early 1900s to serve the San Diego area the dam that forms the reservoir is one of the oldest parts of San Diego's Municipal Water System most of San Diego is haunted anyways but lake morina is considered to be the most haunted Campground in the United States really okay I'm intrigued I'm intrigued so one of the reasons they say why this area might be so Rife with Paranormal Activity and ghost sightings is because in 1916 the reservoir flooded and over 50 people in the surrounding area were killed there's a weird backstory to the flooding actually it was caused by a man named Charles Hatfield but he called himself the rain maker what so this guy did it on purpose the rain maker my ass well Charles was a well-known literal rain maker he said he had created some type of mixture that he could release through a tower and it would cause rain let me guess he worked for the government no he worked for himself but he started out with some ranchers in Los Angeles who wanted rain it was this is right around the time when droughts are happening I'm just saying this sounds an awful lot like pre-come Trails like snake oil salesman right absolutely abolutely but he managed to tell these Farmers that he would produce some rain for them and he said give me 50 bucks and I'll make it rain at the time let's see $50 was equivalent to just over ,000 in today's money roughly $1,100 so for that money he said I'll do this so he built this like evaporating Tower and released his mixture into the air and it rained so the ranchers paid him he was so successful sucker he was so successful they doubled the money that they had offered him oh [ __ ] why did I come up with that idea right he's now got a reputation as a man who can literally Make It Rain and so he starts getting jobs I'm Foolery damn it he promised officials in the city of Los Angeles that he could make it rain a lot and then it rained 18 in and they paid him $11,000 at the time which is the equivalent to about $21,000 today wow so then uh he goes to a few other places and he gets a contract for $10,000 at the time wow but it didn't work didn't work so he managed to get some money for expenses but he's mostly got a positive reputation for a man being able to make it rain so in comes the reservoir at lamarina the reservoir is at its lowest point they're facing drought the city wants some rain just give a call they call the rain maker Charles Hatfield and in he comes and he says for $11,000 an inch that he would make it rain and fill the reservoir $1,000 an inch $1,000 in porn like what's going on and the council said give us 10 inches give us 10 inches of rain had to specify of rain give us 10 inches of rain in the reservoir and we'll give you $10,000 wow so he is about to make a lot of money so he and brother build their stupid Tower and release their magical chemicals into the air shortly afterwards on January 5th 1916 the rains began and they kept raining and it got heavier and heavier and heavier no [ __ ] no [ __ ] until they were getting feet of rain in the reservoir until they couldn't handle it at that point it was too much riverbeds flooded Bridges were out people got Marooned houses were flooded on January 27th the dam overflowed it was just devastating and again about 50 people lost their lives so Hatfield a few weeks later walks into the council and says hey I made a rain like I promised I made it rain a lot more than 10 inches but I'll take my $10,000 now thanks wow did he get it no the town was livid pissed off they're like you have to pay damages you made it rain so much that there's over three and a half million dollar I'm not even going to calculate what that is in today's dollars $3 and5 million doar worth of Damages you need to pay for this and so everybody went to court and it took a very long time and finally the court said it was an act of God the court said either the rain was an act of God in which case Hatfield is not responsible for the damages and does not get paid because he didn't make it rain or Hatfield made it rain in which case he can collect his money and he is responsible for three and a half million in Damages Catch 22 my friend catfield chose to not collect the money now did he really have a chemical mixture that could make it rain no he was just really good at being able to predict weather patterns right and he had a better than 50% chance at having his mixture quote unquote work and so that was his KH basically but the deaths unfortunately were very very real and to this day people say that they will see orbs around the shores of the lake and there is a lady in white but I wasn't able to find a lot of information on her and I could not find her particular backstory I can just assume she was one of the people that perished in the flooding right but she has seen very often walking the shores of the reservoir all white dress long white hair she'll stop and stare at people which is the creepy part of her ghost story but that's all she does is uh she's just seen walking and at most if she sees you looking at her she'll stop and stare back oh but then she disappears the other thing that happens quite a bit this is a campground and you can go stay there it's a really nice Campground but there are a ton of stories that people will have all over online on Yelp on Reddit people talk about in the middle of the night uh they'll be in their tent and they'll hear footsteps of someone walking up to their tent or walking around their tent and then just stop they never hear them leave and if they look out of their tent there's never anyone there and there's no Mar be like what so they call it the invisible ghost because people will hear someone walk up to them or walk up to their camp but there's no one there and they never hear the footsteps receding ah really creepy right yeah like when I'm in my tent I don't want to be messed with because I'm GNA think you're a grizzly bear I'd rather it be a ghost than a grizzly bear but if I'm in my tent I don't know right I'd be so scared to stick my head out or you know it could be Bigfoot just saying just saying it's probably Bigfoot that's my guess some of these stories actually made the newspaper in 1981 a gentleman named Walter Stucker was a volunteer at the park who actually was able to live in a trailer right on the lake and he had unlimited fishing privileges there he was kind of like a volunteer like groundskeeper right he says that everything was great he really loved living there but he says one fall evening he woke up some sort of noise something woke him up and he looked out the window and he says he was looking directly in the eyes of someone who was standing right there the only problem is is his window for someone to be standing there they would have had to be levitating a couple feet off the ground and he says the gentleman was wearing a dark cloak and a knitted foul weather cap and he says they kind of stared at each other for a little bit and then the person just turned around and walked towards the lake Stucker says that there was no full moon but it was light enough to see clearly the man was taking very deliberate steps but it seemed to me his feet weren't touching the ground they appeared to be about 6 or seven Ines above the surface and he says he walked out to the lake and disappeared and he said he had quite a few more encounters that fall similar to the man who was walking on air other shadow people and he finally decided to go tell the Rangers he went to the ranger cabin took his keys and said he was leaving he couldn't take the encounters anymore it was too weird chicken and the supervisor Ranger Tracy Walker had no doubts was not surprised in the least because he said he'd had similar encounters himself he said that the ranger station which was originally a concession building that had built in the 20s and he said that all around it are all sticks and leaves like people can't walk up to it quietly you're going to make some noise and he heard someone walk up to the cabin with heavy footsteps and he was so certain that someone had come up that he put his work aside and went out to meet them he heard them run right up to the door and move the handle of the door before he could get to it and he was kind of concerned maybe somebody was hurt why why were they in such a hurry but they didn't come in so he opened the door and went out and there was no one there they had just been rattling the door knob seconds before so it's not like they could have gone anywhere so he told his wife and he went back to the office and she came with him and it happened again while she was there oh wow like confirmation same thing they heard someone running up the side of the building rattled the door knob and they both went there and no one was there he says later he had another experience where the log book that he had been writing on it would often disappear he said he would find it in weird places once he even found it in the bathtub oh wow now the campground is a popular stopover on the Pacific Crest Trail and quite a few hikers of the trail will stop there and several of them also had stories of seeing the lady in white that walks around the lake some of them had orb photos that they had taken and quite a few of them often talk about hearing someone screaming in the woods why is everybody got to be screaming why do people always got to be screaming one couple heard what they thought was a young girl screaming and they went to kind of scour around near them to see if they could find anything and all they saw was a white shadow walk towards the lake and disappear oh my God always the way one of the creepier stories is has to do with the very first house that was built at the lake it's the dam Keeper's House one of the residents that would stay there said that quite a few Poltergeist type activities would happen often at the house in particular when they had guests over it was pretty quiet if it was just them but if more people were staying at the house they became more lively they wanted to be seen something would happen and it would stir up the energies and things would move in front of people or things that they put down would be misplaced and one guest in particular a woman was sleeping in the living room when she woke up in the middle of the night and she saw what she said looked like a baby's christening gown so like a long white flowy dress that early 1900s I know exactly what you're talking about because sadly I've seen them she says it floated across the room to her the arm of the Gown reached out and brushed her cheek oh I believe her and then it floated back towards the window and disappeared that would [ __ ] creep me out out you know that 1900's gown you know the look I do chills thinking about it when I first read that I thought of the cemetery investigation that we had done or you had investigated it with some other friends not me balbrook I think Fall Brook folks go back it's like maybe episode five six seven like it's an early episode and I was scared shitless and you found a [ __ ] baby Bonnet on the front seat of your car after coming back from that Cemetery that's all I could think of so there's quite a few ghosts there's orbs there's the lady in white most of them are they're very active but they're not evil like nobody's really they aren trying to scare anyone it just seems to be a lot of poltergeist activity and then for whatever reason the the invisible Ghost and the footsteps constantly coming up on people why do they always got why do go okay I got a ghost question if there's any ghosts out there why you always got to be creeping up on uh can't you just like I'm a loud person when I'm coming at you you know I'm coming why can't a ghost be that way why do you got to be a creeper I know now I do have a story I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's very long but a young woman named Alicia stayed there with her brother and her boyfriend and she says that when they first got there she could immediately tell that the place was haunted and that's repeated by other people that I've seen on Reddit and Yelp and a few other places they can sometimes feel it it's not constant but sometimes like this wave of unease will roll over the campground this young woman just like other people said that she heard a woman's voice in the distance that sounds like she's talking or in distress she also says that the feeling of dread and sorrow would just kind of roll through them occasionally for no apparent reason but particularly when the sun went down they also would find uh cold spots around the campground just randomly now it's [ __ ] hot in California goes not as bad but it's still quite warm and she said they would just find random cold spots as they were going about their Camp chores at night they kept hearing what sounded like a woman crying in the woods and then they would hear the footsteps coming up to their tent and even though they wouldn't hear them leave there'd be nobody out there when they'd go look so they kept having these experiences to the point where she her brother and her boyfriend even though they weren't believers they were so spooked and so frightened she said it was the most terrifying time that they'd ever had it sounds like people have had cons stantly similar experiences yep and it just seems like the the feeling of sorrow and of sadness really and and just of an eerie heaviness rather than any type of evil or malevolence so creepy place and definitely has a lot of activity there for a campground so if you want to experience your campfire ghost stories rather than just tell them head to La Marina Campground it's in Campo California check it out it makes me want to go right how fun would it be to go camp there and see if we could get pictures of the lady and perfect camping and ghosts doesn't the best place all they need is ice cream and I think there is one there's a lot of concessions it's like a state park there's a lot to do there so definitely a cool place but spooky as hell spooky as hell I love it one final thing I want to touch on before we before we wrap up today is I have got a current news event that we gotta talk about here for a minute tell me tell me tell me I've been waiting for this the whole show so what I've got for you is this current news event you know me I'm befuddled because we're talking 10 foot aliens in Vegas I am loving all the alien stories there's so much the government was covering it up all along we knew it we knew it now I want to say this is um this just came out on the news within the week it's only a few days old as far as news story but I believe this this physically happened on April 30th about a month or so ago month and a half two months ago time is Irrelevant in the podcast World we're just going to say it happened on April 30th I want you to listen to the 911 call and then we'll discuss you ready okay I'm ready okay what's going on over there okay L me my dad and my brother we working in a truck in our backyard and we have a big lot outside right correct okay we was working and we just see in a corner of eye something fall on from the sky and it was light and when I head down it was like a big impact and we felt like an energy and then and then and then we hear like a lot of footsteps near us and then we have a big a big uh equipment and and we see and there's a there's like a a person beside it and another one inside and it has big eyes they looking at us and it's still there okay where is this on your property uh in my backyard I swear to God it's not a joke this is actually we terfy so there's two people or two subjects that are in your backyard correct and they're very large they're like 9t 10 foot I don't know they like they look like to big eyes shiny eyes so that's the original 911 call no no way now what's even a little funnier it crashed and they felt the impact and saw 8 to 10 feet people with big oh my Gods oh my God but what the other thing where are they now the police get involved so you're ready for this clip I got another clip for you okay here we go I'm ready newly released body cam from a bizarre police house call shows officers freaked out by a family's otherworldly ples I'm still nervous right now I have butterflies bro people say there's aliens in their backyard shortly after Las Vegas Police witnessed a strange green streak falling from the sky they were called to a family's home with reports of a nonhuman creature in their backyard I'm not gonna be you guys one of my partners said they saw something fall out the sky too I'm kind of curious officers searched the neighborhood and spoke to other residents just the fact that our partner saw something at the same exact time but found nothing sounds crazy but you never know the case was eventually closed as unfounded but the responding officers were were clearly rattled those n foot be come back don't call us all right deal with it yourself now my first reaction to this this part of the video is the cop says if those 9- foot beings come back don't call us handle it yourself I love that the best policy there was a green streak in the sky beforehand right and actual [ __ ] that got caught on the officer's body cam I actually had another CLI I don't know if I have it readily available where the officer said something like you know he's like I'm getting butterflies in my yes I heard that part holy [ __ ] the officers were scared because there's 9 foot [ __ ] aliens they just saw fall out of the sky holy crap now wow this is where [ __ ] gets a little funny because you know I understand they're declassifying some of this UFO [ __ ] but do you totally trust the government's take on Aliens no no bed lying us they're still lying to us so I I found an article because of course I have to research this I'm not just looking at you know I see it on Daily Mail and I'm like oh my God let me look it up NASA says no go I love NASA great group of folks do a lot of good work but are they truth tell tellers I'm still not convinced so what they're saying nothing fell out of the sky or what are they denying no what they're saying is um they're just saying that it was a meteor and that it was uh definitely not an alien craft a small meteor that had a couple 9- foot big eyed guys on it they're saying that it was likely a bright meteor less than a meter in size likely okay where's your proof yo because these people saw 10 foot aliens and that's more proof than you saying it's likely and those people were close enough that they felt the impact of it hitting right right basically they're saying because they didn't physically find aliens and because someone of an authorative figure didn't see it that it's not true so because the guy who saw in his backyard works for Costco it's not true but if he worked as a policeman it would have been true like I don't get that rationale first of all so according to this story there's like two aliens on the loose now is that's what you're telling me this guy says they had big eyes and it was looking right at him and the body cam footage listen to this listen to tidbit the body cam footage documenting the police's response shows that the officers on the scene found the report credible okay the cops think that these people were credible yeah they said so I mean they'd seen the thing land they saw it hit the atmosphere they know something was up I'd be scared let me give you another interesting piece in this part I'm a little up in arms about um because this is not normal for the government in any way shape or form so these people call and they're like hey you know we got these 10 foot aliens in our backyard and the government's like oh no it was just a meteor but what we're gonna do is set up surveillance video camera on your house oh the old it was nothing but we're gonna put these cameras up in case that nothing comes back no you know what the story is what they're putting up the cameras to protect the family in case UFO Fanatics trespass on their property or aliens or tempate aliens so basically you're telling me that the federal government has begun surveillance with high-tech cameras outside of these people's homes to protect them from alien hunters [ __ ] the government don't give a [ __ ] if they have alien hunters coming after them that's the part where my I cannot suspend my disbelief I cannot I cannot believe that the government would give a [ __ ] enough about someone who called line11 about what they're saying is a fake story they don't care why would they care enough to protect this family against that they don't care they're looking for those aliens to come back that's what they want I hear the 911 call and like that guy on the phone he didn't sound like he didn't sound like he gave a [ __ ] either way he's just telling the facts the cop who you see his body cam footage and he even says that he's scared and then you got NASA saying what what these people talking about and then the Govern I saw the Green Flash in the sky I saw that right and then the government saying oh it's probably nothing but let's spend a million dollars on cameras for your house wink wink nudge nudge for protection we're protecting we're protecting you from your neighbor because we didn't give a [ __ ] a week ago but now all of a sudden we do I have to say I am loving all of these alien stor that are coming out I think the government is [ __ ] themselves on how much is coming out because it's there's sightings all over the world there's a map you can pull up you can Google um a UFO sightings map and it'll give you a world map of sightings and holy [ __ ] there's a lot that's amazing I am so [ __ ] I'm just so excited to see where this is going to go who knows what the next year is going to bring so keep your eye on the news because stuff's been happening on the regular I don't know maybe it's because the aliens are like these people need help down there on Earth maybe they like the weed prices are out of control amongst other things that's the thing you know aliens if you can come down here and get a grasp on the price of weed please I'm begging make it happen yes there's also a lot of other really big problems that you should also get to but weed for sure absolutely absolutely so thank you all so much for joining us on the stoned which is our we hope hope you have enjoyed your little interlude of high paranormal comedy and a little bit of uow realness keep your eyes on the skies people because they're coming apparently they're here and uh hanging out in some dude's backyard probably hanging out in somebody's barbecue you know they got actually I thinking they probably went and hit the slots down on the strip in Vegas yeah no one would notice some 9 foot people there just put a hoodie on and some glasses they'll think you're a poker actually in Vegas probably no one would notice just if you're in Vegas and you see 9 foot aliens let us know email us at the stoned Witches Hour gmail.com and uh oh also we put out our PO Box you know two weeks ago and uh I hearing rumors that we might be getting a package from uh from The Listener who was going to send us a Ouija board so oh my God that would be so great fingers crossed in two weeks we will have our uh e board that we're supposed to cleanse and hopefully the backstory on what happened oh my God I'm so excited I can't wait can't wait me either so stay tuned we will see you in two weeks on Wednesday at 4:20 a.m. for the stoned Witches Hour keep it spooky
