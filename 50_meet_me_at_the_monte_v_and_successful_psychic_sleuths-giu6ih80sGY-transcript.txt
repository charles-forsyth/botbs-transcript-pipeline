it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 50 of the stone Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends get together to smoke copious amounts of cannabis while telling each other a true crime and paranormal Tales from across the USA we do get witchy though too oh that's right we definitely get witchy weedy and weird on this podcast and today representing all things ghosty and cannabis with the most THC I'm Leila I'm high like I don't even know I'm just hi I'm shell I'm hi welcome we're glad you're here smoke with us listen to some stories because we're [ __ ] up today we're [ __ ] up I am still I think hung over from New Year's Eve not drunk hung over weed hung over I smoked a lot of weed on New Year's Eve I'll admit I'll admit normally I'm just a weed smoker predominantly but I did have a few shots of the old Jack Daniels Jack's my friend we go way back nice and we had a little reunion on New Year's a a little one a little one reunion nice nice it wasn't like a blackout reunion I also danced with Jack Jack hair on New Year's Eve so that was nice you and your jack hair you love that [ __ ] even the knockoffs are good I haven't had what I would call a an original or Genuine Jack but I've had some damn good Jack so I also had fun with Jack on New Year's well New Year's day was very good very you know when you smoke too much weed night before and you wake up and you still feel high oh yeah that was New Year's Day that's when I reach for a hippie speed ball and start my day in style which is basically just big bong and copious amounts of caffeine yeah I just get going with that for sure but I've had trauma in my life oh oh no shell what kind of trauma is this the trauma like you were telling us before you got some peanut butter and your chocolate and made it better you know your ke and your good weed trauma no this is a bad trauma no so listen to this [ __ ] that happened to me this morning all right what happened sh so I'm sleeping okay like any normal person is doing on a day off at 4:30 in the morning okay absolutely and I was up late because I've I've gotten sucked into this new podcast so I'm up laying in bed listening to this thing until like 1:00 in the morning so 4:30 in the morning my sweet darling love has to get up and go to work because he doesn't have today off although I did so he's tiptoeing around and I always tell him when you leave in the morning shut the bedroom door now we have two cats we love these cats my babies they're adorable I'm taking that Ginger one home with me yeah you're gonna take that Ginger one home with you today after I finish story oh no what happened so he locks the ginger one in the bedroom the black and white one is out in the other part of the house shut out of the bedroom so she's good we'll let her be okay she's not the devil cat today she's a sweet angel today sweet angel today the other one he locks him in the bedroom so he leaves at 4:30 you know what that little bastard cat did at 4:45 oh no what okay so in my bedroom I have my TV is on it's like in like this armoir kind of thing and there's an area in front of the TV and I keep my tray of weed there okay so on this tray of weed what I had done I had you know how when you have a tray and you make a mess you just kind of shove it all into the corner for later use sure so I had a corner of that and then I had a grinder that was not closed that had grinded up probably pushing a about half of a but the top is off of it my bad to begin with 445 he jumps up on that little spot between the TV and where that is and he knocks that goddamn tray on the ground no on purpose oh no I had a full glass of tea in the same spot he weaved around the tea because he knew not to knock the tea over and purposefully pushed like the tray wasn't on the edge he had to push it he pushed itate evil that was evil and when the grinder hit the ground like you know how there's the little mesh thing where the Keef falls into the bottom yeah a whole bunch of Keef smashed out onto the floor too so not only did I lose a half an eth of like grounded weed I also lost like most of the Keef in the bottom of theing grinder I'm crying I'm there's literal tears coming out of my eyes oh my goodness so I jump out of bed because of course boom bang you know so I jump up and that cat looks at me and he's starts running everywhere in the room he knows there's no Escape I open that door I'm like you get the [ __ ] out of here and I slam the door no so then I'm like I'm like and you know at 4:30 in the morning on the East Coast this time of year it's dark so I'm like I'm just gonna tiptoe back into bed and I'm gonna go back to sleep and I'm not going to stress I'm gonna deal with this when I wake up sure as [ __ ] who could go to sleep knowing all their Weeds on the floor no no no sleep are we going to have to take the grinder away from you shelle this is the second grind our incident in just a couple weeks I'm thinking is this a final destination kind of situation you know like where my cat's not going to live through the day yeah but no I'm thinking about your weed man like just a week or so ago you had that grinder incident where the bottom came off that could have been bad it should have been bad for anyone else it would have been bad but it worked out it worked out great for you you got did not work out I'm picking up my weed in a dust pan Lea oh that's so sad I think this was Final Destination I think that first time your weed was supposed to die and it didn't and so something bad had to happen to make up for it I would have rathered lost the KE in the first accident than a half of an eighth in this accident oh ouch ouch so of course you know I haven't swept my floor in like four days so there's dust there's dirt there's actually a crunched up Leaf in there so it's not smokable I'm texting my boyfriend I'm like there [ __ ] cat he's like oh you can't just pick it up and smoke it no it's sh ground up weed e in my 20s I would have picked it up and smoked it I am not smoking dust and dirt anymore I'm crying today I'm crying I'm crying with you I am crying with you that is a sad sad moment this is what I thought was going to happen last time when you said it I was so happy when you said that it didn't it worked out great and now here we are my heart breaks for you it's a heartbreaking moment for sure put it this way that cat has near me in a good six hours if I even walk in the same room he gets up and goes away like he knows he pissed me off I think one of his Nine Lives is completely gone he's used one up I am not letting him in my bedroom for no a while obviously does not have any weed toate at all that cat oh terrible and he knows what weed is he smells it and he was just like how can I piss her off at 4:45 a.m. yep he was just bored wanted your attention knew exactly how to get it Mama stash there's my morning story for you ouch that's a tough one on this brand new year oh my goodness that's a harsh story sh hard one been a pain it's been a painful new year so far and at the witching hour no less [ __ ] cat you should have been see sh That's The Universe telling you you should have gotten up at 420 with your sweet love and smoked smoked and gone back to sleep that's yeah that that was my bad that's not the cat's fault obviously not my adorable Ginger baby's fault at all I should have just been up smoking weed instead of letting my cat destroy the weed right see I'm glad you know where the blame really lies in this situation CU that was trauma that was some shitty trauma sh I'm so sorry that that happened to you as our listeners know I feel your pain you've had the same trauma yes oh my gosh that's awful so did you literally look at it in the dust pan for like a full minute before you were like no I'm throwing it away no what I did no no I did the opposite I left it I swept it up in a pile on the floor and I left it there for like 20 minutes and I was like every time you walk by May no maybe no 20-year-old me would have been on my knees yeah yeah and then after about 20 minutes then I was like godamn [ __ ] and I swept it in the dust pan and I was just done put it right in the garbage I've heard that the more you swear the less it hurts that's just science I feel like that was may be the case a little bit I feel like the more I talk about it the more it hurts a I I knew though that you had to at least left it for a little bit because there's no way a [ __ ] Stoner can easily throw that away you got to think about it a few times before I didn't even put it in the dust pan for 20 minutes that's my show but it was endgame it was good I'm still smoking that endgame they have big sales on that I feel like they overgrew it and so they're trying to like get low get rid of like pounds and pounds because they have it really cheap and they keep having it consistently week after week after week and it's good so here we are again endgame well there you go well I'm smoking I'm not even sure what I've got I've got some purple [ __ ] I've got some really really dense purple [ __ ] I've got some really really pale pale I think it's white widow I'm not positive oh oh my God that's one of my top five yeah but like we were all kind of smoke anners at a little party you know with some other smokers some other Growers and we all kind of passing stuff around so I ended up with a little bit of everybody's [ __ ] and I don't know what salad I got a good salad going on over here it's great but my Garden's really on the roll so I'm very much smoking a lot of my own weed right now and as you know I'm kind of traveling my home base is still California but I'm in New York I'm in Canada I'm in Colorado I'm all over the country this year so you sent me pictures you text me pictures the other day and you're like oh I saw this in Canada I'm like what the the hell are you doing in [ __ ] Canada like how did you even get to Canada like why are you in Canada you're like I'm just there like oh I have been a nomad as long as you have known me I'm a little bit affectionately called you a gypsy that's true but you can't use that word anymore oh yeah that's right iot a slur that's right it used to be my nickname but it's a slur so we don't do that so no mad no madad but apparently in Canada what I was doing was sending you pictures of pen Dutch hex signs which blows my mind because I'm like wait Pennsylvania Dutch she's in Canada Pennsylvania Canada Pennsylvania Canada and I'm like hey I'm just gonna roll with it I saw too it I we stopped we literally stopped reversed and took pictures twice and then I just kept seeing them and I'm like what the heck we are so far away from Pennsylvania it's not even funny but they were everywhere I stopped sending you them because I I was just like she's going to be so sick of this well I know you know I actually did have like a totally reasonable conclusion to that which is obvious I I have family and ancestrial backage to Pennsylvania Dutch folk but I did not grow up and live in Pennsylvania so in New York we always had the Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs in our kitchen they're everywhere they had them all over in their homes and on their blankets and towels so we had them you know we had them in the kitchen in Upstate New York so you know it could just be as simple as they have ancestral ties or maybe they grew up in that area and moved to Canada people bring their traditions and their [ __ ] with them no matter where they go and nowadays people aren't as stuck in one location as say a hundred years ago you know 100 years ago 200 years ago where you were born is where you died that isn't the case nowadays people grow wings and fly away man but they take their Traditions with them I think I am a very good um example of that that's yes because I am very much not I grew up and have not been for quite a while I I I move a lot more than your average person but like I have I still have my collection of um Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs and I have brought them with me to Massachusetts so they just travel with people just people aren't as stuck in one location is maybe a hundred or more years ago yeah and one of the coolest things I realized about hex signs which I didn't know before I mean I thought that they were very specific I thought that each symbol I mean and do each symbol has different meanings but like one of the hex signs I sent to you looked like it was a hummingbird just a blue hummingbird like on a a geometric yellow background and I'm like I even asked you I'm like is this a hex sign or is this just decorative and you said no that's definitely 100% a hex sign the reason I asked is because I I've never heard of a hummingbird in a hex sign so I thought usually they're like doves or something right but what I realized after kind of researching this is is that while there are some symbols that are kind of universal like you said doves for peace or happy family you know there's different colors and symbols that do mean things you can make your own hex sign there's no rules or anything about it it's just like a spell or a Sigil it's what you want it to be exactly and people will use colors like they'll find Regional colors like what they'll use specific colors in certain regions or certain symbols will be you know kind of popular in a town or an area but you can make your own [ __ ] heck sign for your family and I love that I just slap that [ __ ] right up on your barn man right I'm like I can use whatever colors and symbols and things that mean something to me to make myself a beautiful geometric basically the biggest thing is they're geometric and they're they're very uniform they're very symmetrical and colorful and bright bright colors right colors and and in a circle you know and then there you go make your own hexine and I love that I love that kind of earthy witchy you know do what you want within confines of rules you know there's rules but within those rules do what you will to make the magic and there are a set of traditional hex signs like you said like a I can't remember how many there are off the top of there is a traditional standard set but as with anything alter it to suit your need what's your spell what's your intention you know what are you trying to bring you know if you're a farmer maybe you want your hex sign to have corn on it right with cows with dripping nipples I don't know I nobody wants that shell nobody wants that that's milk milk milk well I know why am I the type of person that when I try to think of a Sigil for milk I come up with cows with dripping right I don't know I have like the most [ __ ] up mindset that just means that when we come up with a Sigil for my Greenhouse my weed Greenhouse shell you and I will have to do it together no nipples and no dripping milk but other than that free rain free rain show you're no fun man I know and this this right here is why people love us that's right and this is why we probably should not be allowed to smoke things with over 30% thz I'm just glad I'm not smoking anything that's touched my floor today as are we all as are we all notice I can't stop thinking about it I keep going I know I'm so sad about it my my heart hurts I still have dried tears right here you see it on my cheeks from it I I see that little tear Crush I know it was so sad it's terrible but so to make you maybe more sad or at least to take your mind off of it I'm going to tell you a scary story oh what you got what you got what you got I've got a ghost story for you shell actually it's quite a few ghost stories it's a haunted place one of your favorite things oh where where look get my notes sh where the [ __ ] are my notes did I close them hold on pause please while I bring up my notes okay so we are going to the State of Arizona and this is drum roll please the most haunted hotel in Arizona oh interesting they're all the most haunted shell you know this every every article starts with the most haunted fill in the blank that's right and everybody is more than happy to promote that they are the most haunted Fillin the blank right right this particular hotel is about 2 hours north of Phoenix along historic Route 66 everything on Route 66 is haunted duh right one of our places for our USA road trip shell is going we're going to do an entire Route 66 series for sure does that come to Massachusetts nope it doesn't go into Massachusetts at all it starts in Chicago Illinois and runs to Los Angeles California it doesn't hit the East Coast which is too bad because Route 66 is haunted as hell and so is the east coast of the USA that's because the east coast is the most haunted Coast just saying Well the West Coast has probably the most serial killer so there you go that Idaho [ __ ] yeah which we're not saying the PA guy is the Idaho [ __ ] but it's looking like the PA guy might be the Idaho [ __ ] he's kind of set himself up to kind of look like a [ __ ] just saying just saying innocent till proven guilty but it's looking but you put the dick costume on that's right if you'll put the dick costume on don't be surprised when people say you look like a dick it's like Cinderella he's put the slipper on where just waiting to see if it fits that's right we're just waiting we're pretty sure it's fitting and you know again we talked about this off while we weren't recording but we were both kind of giving the police a little bit of a hard time and it sounds like they were really building a very strong case against against this person in the Idaho murders and so good on you dudes I we'll have to wait and see what comes out to make sure that that's actually how it is but if it's as solid of a case as they're making it sound like then good for them way to go I just putting out Good Vibes so that the families of those that were lost get some closure cuz they deserve it damn it MH and if it is this guy I hope his family also I wish them strength and healing as well but if it is this guy I hope his penis falls off right yeah whoever did it whoever did it yeah their dick can fall off for sure yes like fall off and their sleep wake up without it yeah terrible dick disease you know may their balls itch for eternity and they be able to find the reason why that just made me think of you know I do not promote cursing but if you ever want to curse someone just curse him with an itchy [ __ ] oh that's a bad curse shell you are an evil [ __ ] I like that I like that don't murder people man that's right don't murder people if you don't want shell to curse your [ __ ] don't murder people that's all I'm saying please do not email us asking me to curse people with an itchy [ __ ] because I can only do that to people I know I know someone you did it to yeah exactly but I have to know you on a certain level to give you that kind of curse this is why we have a not safe for work rating by the way in case you're offended it was right there in the rating I I don't take requests sh does not take [ __ ] requests thank you he needs to know you a little better first take her out for dinner buy her a Tarot deck and then she'll consider it and then I'll I'll give you the secrets to my itchy [ __ ] curse but yeah the key to Shell's Book of Shadows is good food good weed and a Tarot deck and you're in can I just say that I I am a massing so many tarot decks at a rapid rate at the moment like I got three for for for Christmas and I got another one that was ordered for me for Christmas that'll be in later this week ah I love it the one I'm getting later this week will make um that'll make number 150 in my collection ah see we knew you were close to 150 I didn't realize you were exactly at 150 that's fantastic this one that's been ordered that should arrive Thursday will be my 150th Tarot deck and it's to the point now where I have a a Google Docs spreadsheet of all my tarot decks alphabetically listed so that my my children and my sweet love whenever they're looking to buy me a deck they can refer to the list to make sure I don't already have it very smart do you have a wish list of decks Jesus Lord I have a paper list and an Amazon list what you talking about I have an Etsy list I've actually that was the nice thing you know I've kind of always stuck with Amazon and brick and mortar stores that I'm aware of or order online from stores that I'm aware of well you [ __ ] have Salem right at your fingertips I think you have every single deck and limited run deck and everything like available to you right there I do but my daughter has turned to Etsy Etsy those two decks we talked about right after our ulie christmy episode that I got from my daughter for the holidays um she got those on Etsy I've gotten into a couple of exclusive Facebook groups uh for Tarot and Kickstarter has a wealth of gorgeous Kickstarter is a great place when I started making my own personal deck I was involved with some other artists who were using Kickstarter to promote their decks as well and there's some beautiful things on there yeah amazing artists out there for sure and I'm finding that the stuff on Etsy and Kickstarter it's gorgeous it's beautiful and you know I like things that are limited run yes yes yes that not everybody and their brother has you know right something a little different I like to find those Niche things and I just like to point out I'm still using the wrer weight deck yes despite your large and beautiful varied collection you go with the basic riter weight deck I you know I feel that that happens we we all go back to the basics sometimes but in my defense actually in the last couple of months that's the first time I've ever used the rer weight tarot ever in life has been in the last couple of months I've always shied away from it because I always felt it was so basic MH I don't know I guess for whatever reason I'm feeling very basic right now so yeah that's okay hey there's something to it I I am very basic [ __ ] in some things myself so no shame in going back to the basics in Tarot you are inundated with all these different and varied things there's something pure and simple and strong about going back to the basics and just really kind of vibing with that and just really getting into it well and also with what's happened in the last couple years I had kind of backed off from tarot for a couple of years whether it was quarantine or you know I I just I was busy and I pulled away from tarot for a couple years so I think that going back to the writer weight was a good way to you try to reconnect with an old deck and sometimes that deck's like you know what we had our time it's been nice knowing you but you know what I've closed the door on you and I kind of felt that with my witches tarot yes and so I was like [ __ ] it Go Back to Basics I never used it and for some reason all the stuff I was getting involved in even if it wasn't tarot necessarily but more witchy that wrer weight deck kept popping up even if it was like talking to someone and they're using the writer weight kind of thing like it just kept revolving back around to everything was starting to show up in various forms with the wrer weight deck and I was like [ __ ] it give it a go I think we're both it's it's fun how we both kind of at the beginning of this podcast we like hey I've been reconnecting with my spirituality and with my tarot cards and let's get back together and do things like this again and and now here again we're both kind of ramping up this tarot thing we've we've started with new decks and and the same thing happened with me with my old deck that I have used for a very very long time it was did you ditch it didn't ditch it but it did say we're done here thank you we've had our time we've had our time you need to move on it's time to move on not to say that I won't still go back to it because it's like an old comforting pair of slippers or you know but it's that pair of slippers you can't wear every day anymore that's right and I certainly can't wear them out and and they don't want to be worn out they they're like we're done thank you move on and they kind of had to say that a few times which is why I think I went into that time period where I didn't read because I I wasn't listening to myself and where I needed to be I maybe it was quarantine I don't know but I just wasn't ready for it then they were done and they cut the connection yeah and I needed I needed some growth in different directions and I wasn't ready for it yet and now I think I am and I it's fun because it sounds like we're kind of in the same place I like that and that's the best part we've we always kind of seem to end up in that same place it's nice to be able to bounce tarot things off someone so if you have someone in your life or if you want to ask us questions about tarot email us the stoned Witches Hour at gmail.com find us on Instagram at the stone Witches Hour tell us your questions if you have a question about a specific card or how to connect with your cards or anything like how to pick a deck we'd love to hear from you or if you have some freaking fantabulous deck and you want to show us we are deor yes please send us pictures I love so today I am smoking out of the bowl I got in Canada we rolled joints right we are such [ __ ] Stoners we're decided we're going to go travel we're going to do some travel time in Canada right so we we get everything all packed up and uh we figure out how long it's going to take us to get from where we're staying to the border and we pack enough joints to get us there so that way we can cross the border with zero weed and we had picked out we're seven joints away from the Canadian border I packed about a joint for every half hour is what I figured and it worked out to be about right so that's not a lot right no I'm just I I I just can't get over in my head I can just literally see the two of you plotting out the time okay it's going to take us this amount of hours and we're gonna this amount of joints for this hour okay so we're seven joints away from Canada okay okay we need to we need to take a bathroom break okay we're four joints away from Canada and then I IM in the car with us were you there I can imagine calling you where are you well we're about four joints away from the Canadian border you know me oh that's so sweet I can just see you measuring distance in in in terms of yeah we did we totally did I love that yeah that's how we do that's how we travel we had I'm smoking joints right now out of my lovely little oh you're mystifying minc I love it so we packed enough joints to get us to the border and we picked a um a weed spot right across the border immediately so let me ask you this and and some of our listeners might want to know this because I'm dumb to the way of laws we've all we've all established that so if it's legal to smoke in the state you're in and it's legal to smoke in Canada why is it illegal to drive across the border with that weed okay let's say for example you're in New York state because we know weed is now legal in New York so let's say for example you're in New York it's legal and you cross over to Canada and it's legal why is it illegal to cross that bridge with it when um this side of the bridge it's legal that side of the bridge it's illegal why is the bridge making it illegal I'm confused crossing the bridge with weed makes it smuggling it's basically a very illegal very bad thing with consequences that far outweigh the offense in both countries just don't bring weed across the border kids just don't do it Canada has the Cannabis act which legalizes and regulates their their cannabis trade and it quote creates a strict legal framework for controlling the production distribution sale and possession of can so they don't want you coming into Canada from the United States and bring weed that they haven't regulated don't do it even though you're going from like say for example New York to Canada like if I cross that Thousand Islands Bridge why is it illegal to be on the bridge with weed but I can be on either side of it with weed coming from Canada back into the United States weed is still illegal on the federal level and the Border guards are federal so they also are not going to take too kindly to unregulated weed crossing the border so if those border agents were state agents it'd be okay but because they're federal agents it's not okay is that the deal um disclaimer Lila is not a lawyer yes yes that is the deal I don't understand laws they're dumb and I'm pretty sure there's also possibly some sort of taxing involved as well because that I can see that I can see yeah coming back into the United States from Canada the federal government again doesn't want you to bring what's ferally illegal in plus I'm sure they also would want you to pay taxes if you did they didn't get their money so they're pissed that's most likely what it is I mean you [ __ ] have to pay $ five dollar just to cross the bridge well yeah they just want money oh you're leaving give me five bucks oh you're coming back in give me five more bucks that's cheaper than the George Washington in New York City man that's 25 bucks to cross but yeah like I that confused me on why it's illegal cross the bridge even though it's legal on both sides but I get the tax thing and all of that yeah weed here is schizophrenic it's federally illegal everywhere they really need to change that let me ask you is Canada weed any better it was good it was just as good I would say it wasn't any better just as good so it wasn't any better or worse you'd call it kind of an even I would say it's even prices were slightly cheaper just because of the money exchange or what um yeah yeah just because of the money exchange I would say that they're they're on par with Southern California and Massachusetts prices although Southern California prices are coming down you just feel like you're paying less because the money exchange correct yeah it's like a130 okay $1 American gets you a130 Canadian I gotcha okay so it's definitely cheaper although note if you do travel from the states to Canadia and you decide to go Canadia and you decide to go pick up some of their their greenest sticky icky make sure you exchange your money first if you use a credit card or anything like that they will not do the conversion for you so you will not save any money by paying American they won't do it you want to convert your money first convert your money first pay with the Queen's face people that's right that's right all right so we keep getting distracted I'm going to go back to Arizona that's what happens when you smoke weed that's right I'm going to go back to Flagstaff Arizona which is again just a little ways away from Phoenix Arizona and right off of Route 66 in Flagstaff there is a hotel called the hotel Mont Vista I feel like I've heard of that before as far as like news stories about ghosties yes because it is full from top to basement with ghosts and it has had a lot of famous people stay there any famous ghosts well not famous people ghosts but ghosts that are famous because they've been seen so much I Goa and famous people who have seen ghosts but like there isn't like Jim Morrison hanging out in the hallways no sadly no but Freddy Mercury stayed there and so did John bonjovi oo I love bonjie I actually love Freddy Mercury too right oh and suie Sue from Susie and the Banshees oh my God love her me too okay so let me this is such a great Hotel I love this story we're having a hard time circling back and keeping on the point today we must both have the best weed this joint I'm pretty sure is my gorilla glue and I don't know how much tea THC is in this [ __ ] I really need to get a test kit but man I only rolled a little one get me high as [ __ ] so this hotel was smoking the last to what the cat didn't dump damn it not that I'm bitter only a little bitter only a it's so [ __ ] expensive it's like dropping freaking gold over there right so this hotel was actually built entirely from public taxes and the reason was because Flagstaff back in the 20s was realizing that tourism was booming in the area but they were losing people because there was no place nice to stay in Flagstaff so is it owned by the town it was for a very long time until the 1980s when it was purchased by a private investor it's actually the longest running publicly owned building of its kind oh no [ __ ] yeah for real all I can think of is the guy from The Stand remember Stephen King is The Stand movie and the in the in the weird guy was in Flagstaff Arizona he was in Flagstaff I wonder if he was in this hotel at all I don't know I'm gonna have to look that [ __ ] [ __ ] up so anyway so the Flagstaff people didn't want to lose out on those juicy tourism dollars so they decided right so a man named VM slier is he too cool to tell us his real name I guess so probably Voldemort Voldemort slier back before Voldemort became e evil he invested in property in Flagstaff Arizona correct yes so VM it's gonna be Voldemort now VM slier started a fundraising campaign in Flagstaff saying we need to keep the tourist in Flagstaff let's build a beautiful hotel and the city loved the idea the public loved the idea they voted for an ordinance that established a municipal bond to build the hotel and people bought these bonds including the novel Zane gray have you ever heard of zaye gray I feel like I should but it ain't it ain't coming to me so Zay gray was like a um a western novelist he he wrote like those Penny westerns kind Adventure novels basically Western Adventure novelist like my grandpa used to read exactly exactly he was quite famous for the time and he was one of the biggest people to donate to these bonds I believe he donated um $200,000 which is a [ __ ] M back then was a lot of money yeah that's right so the bonds were sold everything was great they broke ground for this hotel on June 8th 1926 and the four-story 73 room hotel opened on New Year's Day in 1927 Oo Happy New Year that's right happy New Year it was originally named the community hotel to honor the fact that the whole Community had come together to raise money to build this hotel and it sounds like they had a contest to rename the hotel and a 12-year-old was the one who came up with the new name Monte Vista which means Mountain View and that was referring to the nearby San Francisco Peaks that you can see yeah see I've never been to Arizona so I don't even I I just picture just miles of flat land and all you see is flat mostly it is there's just a couple areas that have mountains and this is a a beautiful view from here hence Monty Vista so after the hotel opened it was hugely popular very beautiful hotel tourists were more than happy to stay there it had a great bar and even the locals loved it it became a very popular Meetup place I guess even today there's the phrase meet me at the Mont t v and that's supposedly what people would say all the time I guess meet me at the montv Shell we're going to go have a drink see you soon yeah see you soon meet me at the Monty V also another famous fact about this hotel is in the first year of its opening it hosted a a radio show in room 105 by a woman named Mary Costigan and she is actually the very first female radio host in the United States oh God bless her right so she was kind of like Trailblazer exactly for what we're doing right here Trailblazer yeah I don't think she covered ghosts and True Crime but you know close enough she was on the airwaves and we have made it to the airwaves we are also we're the same we are also on the airwaves we're so much the same so as you know prohibition happened and during prohibition the hotel mon Vista did have a Speak Easy and you would go kind of down into this secret bar and it was very very popular but in 1931 the Speak Easy was raided and shut down oh [ __ ] two years later prohibition ended in 33 so was not a big blow to the hotel at all also for about 5 years between 1935 and 1940 there were slot machines in the lobby which from what I've seen they still have some there today so there was actually gambling there as well so the hotel kind of rose to prominence in the 40s and 50s because around that time was when America became [ __ ] obsessed with spaghetti westerns everybody was doing westerns at that time and they were all being filmed near flag sta out in Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon and so this hotel became like a popular place for stars to stay while they were filming and so oldtime stars like some of these I've never heard of but some I have Jane Russell Gary Cooper Spencer Tracy John Wayne John Wayne and Bing Crosby all stayed Hotel Bing Crosby man he's like the Christmas singing God right right everybody knows Bing Crosby we just got done with Bing Crosby Christmas right although my kid have kind of turned me on to U Michael bé is the new Bing Crosby I think we always do the bow man for Christmas music but uh the hotel has also been featured in a couple movies uh Casablanca and also in Forest Gump oh okay so many famous people have stayed at this hotel that the rooms themselves will have the room number and then it'll be named for a famous person who slept there like the bang Crosby Suite is room 212 uhhuh Michael sty from RM his room is 205 love him Michael J fox 216 suie Sue 220 Bon joovy 305 Freddy Mercury 403 Spencer Tracy 404 Clark Gable stayed there Humphrey bogar Anthony who's in room 420 who's 420 who's 420 you know honestly I don't know I know Jean Tierney who's like an old time old timey star she stayed in room 411 interestingly one of these famous people John Wayne himself actually saw one of the famous ghosts at the hotel Mont Vista because not just famous people stayed there this place is [ __ ] haunted there are ghosts on every single floor I wonder if John Wayne is still there oh I don't know as far as I know there have been no sightings of John Wayne but he stayed in a couple different rooms he stayed in room 210 which is one of the more haunted rooms the second floor is reportedly haunted by a Bellboy ghost and people will see him either wandering the halls or very often guests will report a knock in the middle of the night at their door when they ask who it is he'll say room service and if they say they didn't order anything which a lot of people say he's like are you sure what do you mean am I sure what the hell are you trying to bring me it creeps people right out usually when they open the door there's no one there there's no way someone could prank them because there's nowhere to hide in the hallway it's very narrow hallway that's just lined with doors so if someone knocked at the door and said room service they would need quite a bit of time in order to run away by the time you could open the door so there's no way someone could do it and just hide I need to win like Mega Millions or something because I want you and I to go to every one of these locations you and I need to be sleeping on that second floor and checking this [ __ ] out this is so so so scary shell you are absolutely right we do need to stay there because this um one man was staying in room 210 and got awakened at Night by this bell boy and apparently the gentleman staying a acoss the hall from him was also awakened by this Bellboy knocking and the gentleman in the room answering to the point where he looked out his peole to see what was going on and he saw a young man in like a red velvet Bellboy jacket with big brass buttons and black like that 1920s 1930s Bellboy look exactly complete with the little hat and everything right outside the gentleman's door but did the guy at the door see the same guy or did he not see anything here's what happened the across stopped looking out the peephole but then he heard the room across the hall the door open and the guy say what the [ __ ] so he opened the door too and there was no one else in the hall just the two of them and that's when he told the gentleman staying in the room 210 what he had seen oh [ __ ] but he had just looked through the peephole and seen the bell boy there and only a few seconds had passed when he stopped looking and the guy opened the door and said what the [ __ ] there's nowhere for that guy to have hidden he was just gone we got to go St in those two rooms oh worst things have happened into room 210 according to Hotel staff they avoid putting people with pets into that room why pets freak out they either get really sad and get very depressed and like tail tucked whining hiding in a corner or they go so crazy they start ripping things up and they'll start destroying the room so they won't let people with pets stay in that room so basically your pet either gets scared or confrontational super anxious John Wayne experienced that Bellboy ghost when he stayed there to the point where he asked the staff about it he was awoken twice by the Bellboy ghost and he said that the ghost seemed friendly and that he didn't feel threatened by his presence he was more kind of excited that he had seen a ghost but he reported the bell boy to Hotel staff oh wow John Wayne's Not Dead He's Frozen he's just Frozen so there's also a story about in the 1970s uh three men robbed a bank in flag staff and after they robbed the bank apparently they decided to stop at the Mont Vista and have a few drinks in the bar good idea right I hate to say it but back then there were no cameras there was no DNA evidence unless someone saw your face and was like oh yeah Jim Bob did that they weren't going to know but one of the gentlemen who' robbed the bank had gotten shot by a security guard in the course of getting away so they stopped at the hotel Manifesto to have celebratory drinks at the bar because you know God forbid you get that bleeding tended to right so the one who gotten shot is like oh it's just a scratch give me another scotch and bleeds out at the bar and dies let me guess he's still at that bar very much so and apparently he's a very nice gentleman he will often say good morning to the staff when they come in people will unlock the door come in start setting up the bar they'll be the only one there and they'll hear a very cheerful good morning from a gentleman at the other end of the bar damn by stools will also move on their own they'll take them off the the tables take them off the bar put them on the floor go to get supplies come back in and they'll be in different positions drinks will regularly slide down the bar on their own or get violently thrown off the bar oh I love that I want to see that multiple patrons report that they'll be drinking their drink set it down and when they reach for it and pick it up again it's an entirely different drink oh [ __ ] what did the guy drink do they know what he drank is it does it turn into like basically what he would drink oh I love that idea I don't know we'll have to call and ask we'll find out when we go there bar area is super haunted and people report sometimes seeing this gentleman and again very often particularly in the morning they'll hear him say good morning what drew me to this hotel was a video that I had found I'm trying to find the original video apparently a family mother father and like three young children went and stayed in room 305 which is the Bon Joy room by the way way and the reason they stayed in the bonjovi room is because nobody's sure exactly when but sometime between the 20s in the 60s an older woman had stayed in the hotel as a long-term resident and she stayed in room 305 she was reported to always be sitting in a rocking chair facing out the window whenever anybody would see her that's pretty much where she stayed until she died and she did die in the rocking chair in that room recently one of the managers has uncovered evidence where she feels that um the woman was waiting for her son to come back from the war and when she stopped hearing from him that's when she started just sitting in that chair staring out the window which unfortunately was kind of I don't want to say traditional but kind of traditional for that period right and now it is extremely common for people to see that chair rocking and hear humming coming from it some people will even see the woman herself sitting in the chair when it starts rocking almost everyone who stays in that room sees that chair move or rock on its own hotel staff and guests report that if you move the rocking chair away from the window and you leave the room when you come back it'll be back facing the window the video that I saw that got me here was from a young family and they were staying in room 305 specifically to try and get in touch with that old woman and they had a Ouija board my kind of people yes the son the young son said if anyone is here make the rocking chair move and nothing happened and the dad kind of asked him to repeat it again and uh he did and then the rocking chair literally turned to face them on its own and started rocking oh my God they start screaming on video start screaming and leave the room and run away and the hotel the hotel manager says they checked out in the middle of the night they refused to stay that's a [ __ ] around and find out moment if you're going to [ __ ] around while you going to check out you ask stay there for the Long Haul here move the rocking chair nothing's moving they all felt it and they were um you know they did check out in the middle of the night well if you're here move the rocking [Music] chair hold on hold on hold on hold on hold hold on hold on hold on I think the dad is more scared than anybody right that is that that's nuts that is nuts so that's from uh the Travel Channel Jack or yeah Jack Osborne what's his show um portals to hell I think tra from the Travel Channel so I I saw that video from that family and I could not find the original video i' I've been looking and looking and looking but the only place I can find that clip is from the Tri Channel but apparently that's what had got Jack and Katrina to go to the Mont Vista to investigate this that makes me want to go and investigate it I want to go and investigate it too plus it's the John Bon Joy room why would St there but the the humming the elderly lady that's there is very very common and I looked at that video a couple times and if they did something some type of wire to move that chair I don't see it in the video and the reactions of the family seems pretty genuine and the hotel dad was scared they were scared they were screaming and running out of the room you know it wasn't like they just started laughing and haha isn't that scary they legit ran out of the room and checked out according to the the hotel manager I want to go I want to go too that's pretty scary juman Joy sent me to your room right that's not it shelf it does not stop there there are so many more experiences another one is room 220 which is Susie's room right down the hall apparently right different floor 220 uh three that the one we were just on was uh floor the third floor room 305 oh okay okay but room 220 is right across from or right near Room 210 which is the one that the B boy yeah so room 220 is also haunted and in the 1980s a long-term resident stayed there that was very eccentric he was known for hanging strips of raw meat from his Chandelier the smell coming from this room was so bad that when that's a little more than eccentric by the way right that's just downright creepy unless he's totally into homemade beef jerky apparently he was very into chandelier beef jerky I don't know but the smell coming from this room was so bad that this gentleman died he was dead for three days before anyone noticed oh [ __ ] because the stench from his dead body just kind of mashed Blended in yeah so after he passed away a maintenance worker went in to clean the room and to prepare it for another renter and he had the room mostly finished and needed to go get some more supplies so he locked the room went down the hall got some supplies and came back was gone for just a few minutes when he came in all the lights were turned back on the bed linens were stripped off the bed and in a pile at the foot of the bed and the television was on and broadcasting at full volume and he had only been gone for a matter of minutes when guests stay there now they will regularly hear someone coughing in the room he's choking on the beef jerky apparently and the TV also seems to have a life of its own it will turn on or turn off and the volume will go up or down so he's basically just living in his room still he's still staying in his room and trying to control the television he also doesn't like people being there and people will often report feeling touched by cold hands particularly on their back like they're being pushed by someone with cold hands well that's probably a case of he doesn't realize he's dead and feels like some [ __ ] are invading his apartment why did they what is with the long-term usage a lot of places do that it seems like whenever you have a long-term tenant that's when you start getting ghosties I think so plus the hotel also changed hands in the 1980s it went from being a publicly held hotel to being um a private owner and some people now a days have kind of described it a little negatively and said that it's more like a bar that just happens to have a hotel on top of it oh gotcha another interesting fact is that it was one of the first self-service otus elevators in the state of Arizona the elevator has been modernized since its beginning it did originally have attendance in the shaft and people do say that there is still an attendant ghost at this elevator people will often hear when they get in the elevator even if they're alone they hear a voice asking which floor people report seeing a hand uh cross in front of the doors after they've gotten in as if oh like the old people like they used to do back oh that's so cool yep as if the ghost is still shutting the gate from the oldtime elevator and if you walk out of this elevator and there's a mirror across from you people report seeing the old man standing in the elevator behind them in the mirror even if the elevator's empty I W to go damn it room 306 is the Gary Cooper room and that room has one of the saddest stories because because two sex workers were killed there oh and then they were defenestrated which I'm not sure if they were killed in the room or if by being thrown out the window is what killed them oh yeah just a few blocks down the road there used to be a very thriving um community of sex workers uh red light district if you will and so this tragedy occurred in that room um I don't know what year but it is a well-known fact that two women were killed there and thrown out the window and people will report a heavy feeling of being watched and very often people will be awoken suddenly in the middle of the night and just have this chilling cold feeling of being watched and men who stay in that room all of them report feeling as if someone is sitting on top of them with their hands over their mouth or on their throat oh the majority of the time the staff says male guests will wake up feeling unable to breathe or being short of breath it's funny that it's not females that feel that way a lot of people think that it is the women who were killed trying to exact Revenge I Goa and these might also be the same two women in elaborate dress that are often seen uh walking through the lounge or the pool hall and they're quite transparent and disappear if you pay too much attention to them sounds like me yeah maybe they're just uh you know introvert ghost now that's all nothing wrong with it right so polter activity abounds in the entire Hotel people report their beds being stripped TVs coming on and off light bulbs particularly if the staff says if they put in a new light bulb they usually have to do it twice because they'll put in the light bulb they'll come back it'll be unscrewed and sitting on a table nearby I'd just be annoyed at that [ __ ] pretty much they're so used to it it's just kind of a common thing to them things just happen Furniture moves around they also say there's usually a Phantom Sausage like smell throughout the hotel and if you try to follow it to its source you end up at room 220 the meet on the chandelier guy room yeah there's a couple unexplained ghosts there's a little boy that mostly children will see in the lobby and on some of the different floors and women very often will feel a small child's hand go in theirs as they're going up the elevator like they're putting their hand in their mother's hand kind of thing exactly but nobody knows where this little boy has come from one of the more creepy things that's unexplained is in the basement which is usually only where staff goes there have been numerous reports of Staff hearing a baby crying just wailing and then it'll slowly morph into a man's evil laughter like a deep male laugh okay I don't like that I don't like this whole ghosty morphe [ __ ] because that just means that there's a manipulative ghost out there with not so great intentions yeah what is that that's really [ __ ] creepy and I have to wonder if it's related it all to some of the tunnels that are underneath the city o there's tunnels there are there was a lot of immigrants that built the area and that built tunnels to kind of help facilitate things and I believe that there were some fires that happened um in the 20s I I think and it was blamed on these immigrants and so a lot of them kind of resorted to using these tunnels to stay in and to kind of get around town just to kind of get away from a lot of the attacks that they were getting so I and and it these these tunnels are rumored to have been Rife with crime that there was also you know that there were drug trade and smuggling and things that happened in these tunnels some of these tunnels did come up in this hotel Monty Vista and so I wonder if some of these ghosts might be related to things that may have happened in the tunnels in the nearby area but I I think maybe in a future episode we should explore those tunnels that's definitely on the list for sure for sure there's also a couple a very well-dressed couple a man in a tuxedo and a woman in a beautiful ball gown that are dancing uh in the cocktail lounge they look very happy they're laughing they're smiling and people will see them dancing and just having a good time before they disappear I have another story for you this one really really freaked me out so a man staying at the hotel was looking for ghosts right so he's wandering around the hotel and he saw a room door open and so he stopped thinking a person was going to come out but instead a shadow came out of the room oh no [ __ ] so he immediately trained you know he's recording looking for ghost so he immediately trained his recording on that door the video looks like he follows something down the hallway before he stops recording or at least that's what he says because if you look at the video it's blank there's nothing on it he insists that there was a black shadow vaguely in the shape of a person that came out of the room and walked down the hallway but nothing showed up on the video that's not surprising though except if you turn up the volume it sounds like like a man right up against the microphone screaming help the entire time oh no [ __ ] no [ __ ] he insists that there was a shadow there and he didn't hear a thing while he was taking the video but if you watch the video no Shadow but you can hear someone screaming help oh my God that's [ __ ] up I got another super super creepy one this one totally gave me chills now a lot of people recently if if you read the reviews for this place it goes back and forth people love it for this haunt things for the fact that so many famous people stayed here and it seems to be very active if you go there looking for a ghost you're going to experience something however the bars seem to be very very popular and the hotel is kind of getting run down and a little bit old so don't go there expecting luxury accomodations and definitely expect to hear the bar just rocking until about 2: a.m. so I read this blog of someone who stayed there a woman named Gemini in January 8th 2014 and the first part of her blog was basically complaining about how shitty the rooms were how loud the bar was and how she could hear everything on the street outside really it's felt in the 1920s there was no insulation what the [ __ ] do you expect yeah it's it sounds like management might not exactly be the greatest at the moment either or maybe they don't care about the hotel part so the rest of the blog is where she now says she kind of believes in ghosts so she says they returned from dinner about 7 o' and that as soon as she walked into the room she immediately felt fatigued she says the level of fatigue that can only be described as suffocating oh she went from being fine just had dinner in a great mood to cross the threshold of the room and was immediately crushingly tired suffocatingly fatigued she said it was the type of tired where she had no control over her eyelids or her Limbs and so she decided to lay down on the bed and cover herself up with a blanket and she said she mumbled to her husband was literally falling asleep as she talked to him was like I can't stay awake I just need a little a little nap she says she fell asleep and the next thing was that she felt she felt kind of cold some cold air around her so she snuggled in further under the blankets and kind of pulled up into a fetal position and that's when she felt her husband kind of playfully roll her over and lay down on top of her and was jokingly like hey the kids aren't here we've got the place to ourselves was it really her husband hold on don't get shell don't spoil it and so and he's like hey we should you know take advantage of this opportunity being alone and she she sleepily agreed and he said he was going to take a quick shower so while he leaves and takes a shower she gets up and walks over to the window to kind of look out at the view of Flagstaff she says she didn't see Flagstaff but it was the weirdest thing all she could see was just snow as far as she could see it was just a blizzard white out everywhere outside the window and she could see a small fire as if someone was just outside the hotel and she could see a man in a Parker kind of warming his hands and she's kind of yelling to this guy come in you know it's freezing out there come in and trying to tell him to come in and he starts walking towards her and then gets faster and faster until he's running towards her and as he gets closer she's able to see his face and she starts screaming because his face she says was full of rage and evil and he had a light beard looked like he was in his early 40s or 50s and he had red eyes that just were like screaming rage and anger at her and she knew right then that she'd better not let him in the room ever and she put her arms out and shouted you must not enter this place you cannot enter this place and she doesn't remember how many times she repeated it but just as he reached her window and his breath like appeared on the window in front of her she said the snow disappeared the cold disappeared and she saw the streets of Flagstaff in front of her oh [ __ ] she says she kind of like went back to bed and curled up under the blanket and was trying to figure out what just happened if she had been sleeping or sleepwalking or what the [ __ ] [ __ ] and she started dozing off and every time she closed her eyes and dozed off she could see that man's face and she would scream she' put her hands in front of her and scream you must not enter this place you must go away now every time after a few times of this she felt really sluggish like she was sleepy but she didn't want to go to sleep she wanted to open her eyes but she couldn't and she felt her husband sit down next to her on the bed but she felt as if she couldn't speak you know when you're trying to wake up and you like everything feels super heavy and you can't really form words words she whispered to him did you take a shower she's waking up fully now and he's looking at her like all confused and he says I've been sitting at the desk the whole time with my iPad I'm going to take a shower in a little bit why and that's when she realized he had never sat on the bed with her she must have been asleep but she says it felt like it was very real oh wow the area where she was was ice cold and the rest of the room was warm and she says she's not normally someone who has nightmares and she doesn't usually remember her dream other than apparently a childhood nightmare that was very traumatic but this one particular time she had this super Vivid dream and when I first read that and I read her do the Waring I got chills so yeah so she apparently had some sort of weird ghost [ __ ] up right weird ghost experience thing so that's the hotel Mont Vista lots of ghosts lots of famous people and a few confusing Mysteries yeah it makes me want to go there you know how I I am the the weirder and more [ __ ] up it is the more the more you want to go yes oh yeah it's on our list we have to stay there because every floor so many ghosts and I want to stay in Susie's room I want to stay in I want to stay in jamban J's room what are you talking I want to stay in Freddy Mercury's room I mean come on so cool I don't even care if it's run down I have stayed you know unless you stayed in a Budget Inn in lower Manhattan you realize that you have no you you have no cares yeah a roof I just want a roof we'll go weed's legal there we will go rock out at the bar until 2: amm smoke our faces off drink with the locals dance ask the guy what his deal is and then yeah and then we'll go up to the our room and use the Ouija board all [ __ ] night and see ghosts I want to talk to the the chandelier meat guy because I want to know what the deal is with that this this human meat like what what type of beef jerky you Mak in here ew of course you go right to human meat show thought I was the True Crime person that's just creepy it is but I I am a fan of I am a fan of beef jerky so I have I have a couple of interesting things this is you know and it might have been the the Idaho story that kind of sparked this um but I was looking into um different psychics and mediums that assist in solving crimes because as we know there are legitimate and there are we'll call them attention Seekers newbies like the attention seeker in in this Idaho case who after Brian K was arrested this tarot reader Tik Tock person who accused the professor went ahead and said that the professor hired him as a Hitman Lord so attention seeking doesn't even begin to cover it but I will say and and we know that there's varying levels of experience in Tarot readers and psychics and mediums you know they go from from newbie all the way to more experience than us abely so going back to the fact that he was a teacher's assistant I could see how a newbie could per could get that as a professor because oh I see what you're saying do you see what I'm saying I think you know I'm not saying that that this person is doing the right thing because I feel at this point that she is not this teror reader is not doing the right thing but I do think that maybe there was something in the cards that were a little bit misinterpreted maybe I think that's being pretty generous but I I see where you're going with it but do you see where I'm going with it because of him being an an assistant professor she's saying it's a professor so I can see the tie in but I I have actually very irresponsible to name a person like that though very irresponsible and we do not condone that in any way shape or form you know if she had just said hey I see some type of connection to a professor right or someone in a teaching capacity right she'd be looking like a hero right now instead of you know going to Zero have her pants suit off yeah I mean she she could have she could have looked like the hero inste she looks like the zero but here's a couple of cases that are 100% legit and where it involved either a psychic a medium or a Tarot reader because oh I can't wait tell do tell do tell because here's the thing and I don't think people you know we live in a crazy world we always have and while law enforcement agencies don't like to say this publicly the truth is is that they often consult with mediums to help solve crimes or uncover New Leads oh yeah you and I have both not only heard of it we know some people who' have been involved in that correct especially if like a case has gone cold or they have nowhere else to turn um no leads cold cases that maybe have been you know unsolved for a while they will seek guidance from spiritualist people you know murder cases are especially important to to police and investigators because they want to bring peace to the family and they also want to get the killer off the streets you can find there's hundreds of stories of psychic mediums or tarot readers helping helping law enforcement but I didn't want to get anything too far back so I I did dig up a few stories from the 2000s um from 2000 um and and Beyond so these AR technically old I mean granted it's 2023 now holy crap episode 50 but but still I mean the 2000s is more relevant than say the 1950s so there there was a man Dennis McKenzie in 2002 two 10-year-old girls Hol Wells and Jessica Chapman never made it home from a barbecue and these these girls were in England and I know that not all of these stories I'm going to talk about at the moment are are United States based but I want to talk about these these psychic medium ter people who help solve crimes so their bodies were never discovered um for another two weeks so in in this two week time period no one had any answers police had no answers family had no answers the family actually reached out to psychic Dennis McKenzie not the police in this particular case but the family which honestly if I was in that situation I trust and believe in law enforcement but my ass would be a psychic first oh yeah I think family is going to be looking for anyone with any type of answers they can get and actually McKenzie proved to be a vital tool in cracking the case he was able to describe that there was a man and woman involved in the crime oh wow and without getting into a lot of details the article didn't go into exact details but he was able to describe a man and woman that were involved in the crime and it did lead police officers to arrest and charge a man with a female accomplice damn and that's not that's not typical usually women are involved in that type of thing unless it's their own children usually right be able to see that from a psychic perspective you know it's not like he just randomly pulled that out because that's an unusual situation right and then there was um another psychic medium Debbie Malone back in 2003 the body of a 27-year-old named Maria Scott was found after she was murdered the circumstances surrounding her death were unknown for rough about four years oh wow that's terrible so that's four years with no closure for the family no new Clues no leads to investigate the law enforcement in this particular case reached out to the medium Debbie Malone who actually LED investigators to the location of the murder oh no [ __ ] yep and because of that they were able in in you know four or so years had passed they were still able to locate a murder weapon oh so this location had been previously unknown correct oh wow what investigators hadn't told Debbie was that the murder the murderer had committed suicide sometime after committing the crime so they didn't tell her that so they did know that the murderer committed suicide but they didn't know any other details and they never told her that wow Debbie actually reported feeling that the murderer passed through her body um the way that only dead people do and that's how she was able to discern that he was no longer living oh wow and when she told investigators that they knew and they were like yeah we knew that we just didn't want to tell you that so they were like kind of testing her but because the the killer the the the energy of the killer moved through her like a spirit did she knew cor damn correct so she was able to kind of not necessarily close the case per se because obviously the murderer was dead but she was able to lead him to the murder weapon in the location of the crime which after four years and no murder weapon that was a pretty big break in the case damn yeah of course there was a another case um there was a psychic named Rosemary Kerr so there was a person that went missing 1987 um Andre dagel her sister reached out to this medium Rosemary Kerr for help and unfortunately Kerr confirmed that her brother was indeed dead um having been murdered by two men who reportedly killed him just to see if they could oh [ __ ] that's [ __ ] shitty so Rosemary Kerr was able to tell police where to where to look to find the body and where she told them to look they found the body she was right right on the [ __ ] money damn actually this this one I I I like this one a lot more because this is where even the judicial system acknowledges her really prosecutors prosecutors actually called cerr as a witness during the proceedings and this made it the first time a medium has been used as a witness in a murder trial she testified that the moment she had touched a photo of Andre the missing person she knew that he was dead and her testimony actually was what it wasn't the sole thing but her testimony uh participated in these two men ultimately being found guilty of murder damn wow score one for psychics I liked that one particularly because that was the first time that they had actually used Medium as a witness so it's in the court record correct correct there was another case involving um a psychic medium Christy robinet she was awoken by a spirit of a young woman who told her that she had been murdered so she didn't even want to get involved in the beginning she just apparently came to her she was so open the spirit was like oh that person will listen I'm going to go talk to them right right so this lady this Christy lady is just snoozing away minding her own business and this young woman came to her told her she was murdered and she needed someone to help law enforcement find her body wow the woman turned out to be 20 year-old Ashley Howley who disappeared in Ohio in 2004 no [ __ ] yep so Christy Robinette reached out to police about her vision when she was able to describe the clothes that howy was last seen wearing police put her in contact with the victim's family Robinette was able to lead them to the location of how's body but because the location was on private property they were unable to dig up the spot and search for remains however in 2008 how's suspected killer was arrested and charged with two other murders and he ultimately confessed in his confession he described the spot where he had buried howy and it is the same exact spot that Robinette had previously led the family to no [ __ ] way no [ __ ] way totally confirmed yep now that he had confessed to the murders then law enforcement was able to get a warrant go on the private property dig up the remains and there they are right because probably rightfully so you can't just take a psychic's word for it that there's a dead body I'm GNA go dig up your [ __ ] no you're not but yeah once he made the confession then the police were able to get that warrant and then go and dig it up and that is exactly where they found her remains and then finally uh this one last one I want to touch on um Psych medium Nancy Weber in 1982 Elizabeth Cornish was murdered in her New Jersey apartment and the police suspected her boyfriend committed the crime but when they reached out the police reached out to this medium Nancy Weber um asking for her help she revealed that cornish's killer was actually the man who lived above her oh wow damn and she was able to provide a detailed description of what he looked like no [ __ ] the significant other is always and rightfully so like the first one they look at can you imagine no it's not can you imagine this [ __ ] feeling of being like the love of my life just got murdered they didn't do it and I'm the prime suspect they didn't do it but check this out at first the alleged killer was able to provide an alibi for his whereabouts during the time when when Cornish was said to have been killed but but Webster insisted that the coroner had gotten the time of death wrong so guess what turn of events twist turn of events so somehow Nancy Weber was able to convince the coroner to reexamine the body okay hold on that part I have a hard time believing maybe it was a small town or something or maybe she was well known I don't know but she got the coroner to re-examine she was so sure they re-examined sure as [ __ ] [ __ ] changed the time of death to four hours earlier no [ __ ] way and then the alleged killer Alibi no longer covered him for the time frame and then check it he eventually confessed to law enforcement that he actually was the killer oh [ __ ] no way he felt that this Nancy Weber wasn't going to relent and that basically he had no way out so finally he was just like yep did it and he would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for that meddling tarot reader right oh my God scoy right holy [ __ ] so I guess kind of the point I wanted to proo with those couple of little tidbits today is that I think that the tarot reader that is trying to insert herself in the Idaho killings is definitely performing a grave disservice to the families a grave disservice to tarot reading in general and a grave disservice to her own Karma but I do believe that there are Terror readers and psychics and mediums out there that I do believe do have the ability to assist in such cases I just think that this particular gal trying to insert herself in the Idaho cases is misled misdirected maybe misinterpreting the cards to a little bit maybe a little newer and maybe a little bit of attention seeking but I do want to put it out there to people that you're hearing about this Terror reader in the Idaho case because it's a big popular thing right now and I don't want people out there to think that I don't want her to make the Imp question for all tarot readers and all psychics and all mediums that that they're all full of [ __ ] and can't help because there are there are those that can help and this is just kind of a you know a Mis Cleo situation I am 100% with you and I I think that in several of the instances that you just described at least in two of them the spirit the energy came to that person they didn't seek it out right and I just think that situations like that are few and far between they do happen and sometimes they happen to people who aren't even professional psychics or tarot readers it just happens sometimes but it's rare and so I just don't think tarot I mean of course you can use it for insights and things like that but I think it's much better tool to be used for personal growth and for you know helping for Crime solving right not necessarily for Crime solving does it happen sure obviously your stories proved that there are people that have that talent and that sometimes there are situations you can stumble into that will that have ghosts involved or or will have something like that but it that's just not the norm and that's just not where I don't know that's just not personally where I think it should go again I just wanted to kind of put it out there because it has been in the news a lot lately that just like with any group there are there are the people that are a little cray cray and the actions of the one don't reflect the actions of the many and just because this one might be a little Loosey Goosey doesn't mean everybody is I love your stories how fun though I and even better I love that they helped bring closure and relief to the families of these victims absolutely absolutely and and you know that's kind of isn't that how we should all use our powers for good we should all try to use it for good absolutely the more good you do the more weed you can smoke yay and I just finished both my joints I'm packing another Bowl I did bring my bowl back from Canada see my cute beautiful my little $10 Bowl I like the little honeycomb on it isn't that cute what's with all the honey lately I there seems to be a honey Motif the bowl I just got in California has the bee and the
