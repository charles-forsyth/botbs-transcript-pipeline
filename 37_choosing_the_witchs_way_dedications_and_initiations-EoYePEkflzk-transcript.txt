welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hey welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea I'm shell and today shell has opened her big book of the old coven day amarat to an initiation let's talk initiations because you know I see a lot of stuff online um and a lot of people kind of going back and forth on what is an initiation is it necessary do you need an initiation are you a witch if you don't have one so I thought this would be something good for us to delve into today this is an excellent topic because all of those questions that you're asking right now are the questions that you and I heard 30 plus years ago back when there weren't very many people doing initiations and it was a Hot Topic then and it's a hot topic now you know honestly I remember a day and I don't I don't know if you recall this um roughly like you said thanks for aging us about 30 years ago there was kind of this unspoken if you weren't initiated you weren't real almost oh what do you mean unspoken it was blatantly told to me on more than one occasion you know kind of like kind of like how there's that that hereditary witch issue if you want if your grandma's Grandma's Grandma's Grandma wasn't a witch you're not bullhonky is what I say to that I am so surprised that those are still arguments now and we were dealing with those decades ago and the answer is the same it's all bull crap but but that's the thing with initiations and you know there's different levels of initiations are are we talking initiation into witchcraft are we talking initiation into a coven so I just should be good things yeah that's a really really good point so let's kind of back it up a little bit what is initiation and in wickah in witchcraft what we're talking about is a new beginning initiation literally means to start something to be to be entered into something to begin something and that's exactly what we mean when we're talking about initiation into Witchcraft and like shell said there's different levels of that you can dedicate yourself to the path of Witchcraft by simply declaring I am a witch and now you have initiated quote unquote or dedicated yourself into witchcraft you are a witch but if you would like to have a formal initiation that usually comes from you're being initiated into a degree system like a first degree second degree third degree or initiated into a particular tradition or craft or coven and so those can vary wildly depending on the tradition that they come from I I do want to point out that an initiation is different than a dedication and me personally you know everybody has an opinion and a way of doing things but I always view dedications as dedicating yourself to a tradition or dedicating yourself to a deity and an initiation was more of a quote unquote dedicating yourself to the craft or a certain a certain tradition of craft so that's kind of how I differentiated like I give you an example I am dedicated to hiate have been like it or not for decades sometimes I've not liked it but here we are so I'm dedicated to hkat but I've been initiated into a couple of different Traditions so I look at those things differently yeah I agree they are two different things usually a dedication is something that you do yourself you declare that you're going to be following a certain deity or or a certain tradition dedication is more personal it's much more personal and it's an agreement that you have between you and this this deity or this goal or this idea and initiation like shell said is more of being brought into something by other people so I think that's a little bit where some of the confusion comes from because technically you can't be initiated into something if it's just you right I mean I suppose you could you could create and we did we created a coven and a circle and a whole idea of levels and degrees and training and different things you had to go through for each of those steps and then be initiated into them and so us as The Originators of that kind of initiated ourselves or each other into that Circle each other really more than elves yeah or maybe you could say we dedicated ourselves and then initiated other people into that Circle that we created and dedicated so it it could be semantics it's it's a little little bit of a fine point but I agree with shell a dedication is more something personal between you and something that you choose and an initiation is usually done by someone else to you you're brought into something now let's let's talk real quick about the necessity is it necessary to be ini my my personal opinion no but that also depends on what you're looking for if you are looking for a solitary life initiated into what caseras yeah dedicate yourself you're fine right but if you are looking to work with a coven then yeah an initiation is is kind of the path that that leads to that so it really depends on your perspective and what you're looking for and if you would like to be Wiccan if you would like to follow traditional wiah beliefs and be alexandrian or Garian Wiccan you have to be initiated that is a requirement like a rule yeah yeah you you it's like you can't run around and and just declare yourself a Wiccan because that goes against their rules declare yourself a witch follow those belief systems all you want but unless you've been initiated into their tradition and the same goes for other coven any you know just because we're not mentioning every single Covenant group out there but unless you've initiated into those circles you can't really call yourself a member of that group so I guess the answer to my question is depends yes and no is it necessary no I mean you can be a witch and practice Witchcraft and and and all of that without being initiated but if you want the coven life then then yes it's basically a requirement and they both they both have their their pluses and minuses um working as a solitary has its great pluses working in a coven has its great pluses and both solitarian covens have have drawbacks so absolutely you know there's there's nothing wrong with seeking out that that group Vibe and and getting that initiation but can you be a witch without it hell yeah oh yeah 100% 100% And I think some of the problem stems from the old witch Wars back when we started with witchcraft there were no spaces really for witches you couldn't find them the internet was just barely a thing or not a thing in some of our cases and finding books was very very difficult first of all there were few of them and the ones that you did find were like Janet and Stuart ferrars which is okay difficult to read it's not the it's not the easiest stuff to read out there so the point was back then you were either initiated and a witch or not initiated and not a witch and that was the stance that most people took at the time I would like to take the subber to give a shout out because the day the internet was born I feel was the day that witch boox was born so shout out to witch Fox for bringing us all together on the day the internet was born because you know people our age as soon as the internet was a thing witch boox was there and you could like start to find witches and find groups and that was invaluable in it really was God bless 1993 and and prior to that in the late ' 80s when I was in school it was difficult I knew no one near me that was a real witch I knew some Satanist I knew some pretend Satanist you always knew you always knew the people who were a little bit different because you know I could have said the same thing I never knew a witch but now retrospect Facebook friends from from you know how you always end up with Facebook friends from high school and all that in retrospect I was around a whole freaking group of people people I should have started a Coven in 10th Grade if I only knew and a lot of us didn't know what witchcraft was at that time we didn't know that our beliefs had a religion I don't think it was until the power of the witch came out that I knew what to call myself love Lor cabet right and then we started on the internet finding like-minded people and that was the time when if you weren't initiated you weren't allowed to be a witch and so I decided well screw that I'm a witch this is this whole religion is about personal responsibility personal dedication personal knowledge finding this for yourself there's nothing between you and deity in this religion and so I refused to let that stop me I was a witch I dedicated myself and I went through all the training that I needed to get myself to Priestess level to where I felt that I knew what I was doing and what I was talking about and that's around the time that I met you and unfortunately that's still the time when people would try to say well you're not not a witch because you weren't initiated well we banded together and created our own folks that's right we created our own coven our own rituals and did it ourselves and that spawned off lots of lovely groups and wonderful people you know hey all you former amarat Souls out there I love you I adore you we should have love you miss you we should have an Omar out reunion we should we should how fun would that be that would be fantastic you know just to see all the little witchlings that Circle amarat has Bond and all the groups but anyway but if you're out there if you're out there listening and and and you're a solitary witch and you are in a situation where you don't have that Brethren of people around you don't sit there for a second and think that if you are not initiated into something that you are not worthy because I am here to tell you that is  absolute absolutely and you know Tic Tac may tell you if you're not initiated you're nothing but Tic Tac lies it lies as long as you are focused and and have a clear sense of who you are and what your goals are what everybody else their opinions don't matter that's the beauty offt yes and the learning the self-learning and as someone who loves to jump down rabbit holes and learn as much as I can about things I'm interested in being able to do that for yourself is so empowering but I want to jump back quickly to you saying that talking about people on Tik Tok saying bad things or anywhere red flags I want to talk very quickly about red flags you might find because nowadays everyone is out here selling initiations everyone's going to sell you a year and a day class they're going to sell you you know for $59.95 you two can join my coven and so I want to put up a couple warning flags that I saw on Reddit that I think is an excellent idea oh my God definitely do tell because you know we grew up in a different time where we didn't have to worry about this stuff and now right like they're scammers on every level they're not just trying to extend your car warranty here people they're trying to initiate you into fake covens for $99.99 right and so shell tell this is from a user called Lial Echoes which first of all I love that name so I'm going to list off their red flags and tell me if these sound good to you sh so the biggest one is if anyone ever says this way is the only way oh yeah right I don't even have words for that yeah so bad just run the other way please next one you can't do this way unless someone initiates you into the official this way club and only I can initiate you can I put poop emojis up on these right now again we want to put a little bit of a caveat in here for if someone says you can only be initiated into Garian wiah this way they might be right so a couple times you kind of have to pay attention because there are some traditions that are very strict and they do have specific ways which is a little different than what we're talking about but if you're trying to get initiated into it you should already know what type of what you're getting into beforehand and you should know that just saying Bingo always know what you're trying to get initiated into folks yeah thank you that has been a wonderful message from Shell pay attention to Auntie shell children so now the other one is once you're in my tradition you have to follow the leader explicitly and that's also a big flag you should always be able to question your leaders you know shouldn't have to follow just them or only listen to them you know that's kind of got culty Vibes to me but I'm the queen no I'm just kidding right in this practice one of the biggest things is you can learn on your own it's wonderful to be initiated into a group and to learn with them but you don't have to do that yeah you know that kind of falls into the my way is the only way category and I don't like that right so what happens during an initiation one of the things I saw that I absolutely loved was from someone that you and I both adore Phyllis kirat love her and she says okay what happens during a Wiccan initiation not gonna tell you and I like that I'm not gonna tell you exactly what happens because that's for the initiates in a lot of these cases they are private ceremonies people always have to like be all down and on that oh it's secret it must be bad oh it's secret well you know what nobody's bitching at the kns Templar or the Masons about their secrecy so we're not telling you about ours either if you get a Mason that'll tell you about their initiation rituals then I will sit there and tell you about mine and just like the Masons you can find initiations all over the internet all sorts of books will have a lot of things however I am going to tell you that if you ever get the blessing of being initiated in into a group that you adore there's something to be said for the mystery and the Wonder and the magic and the beauty that goes into these rituals and into the unknown because you are being brought into this space that you haven't been in before you're going from an initiate to first degree you're being pulled up into this magical space and going from one to the other is an experience and it's it's a wonderful thing to go through and so having some things remain a mystery and be part of that magic is fantastic kind of quell the the anxiety and folks let me also add this to that you know if you are working with a group and you are looking to get initiated into a group then you should have the foundation of trust to be okay with not knowing also you should have the personal wherewithal that in any situation whether it's initiation or not whether it has anything to do with witchcraft or not you should have the personal wherewithal that if you are not comfortable and you get a bad Vibe you duck and run no matter what period but if you are in a situation where you are trying to get initiated you should have that that Bond and that trust to be able to be okay with not knowing now we all have Wiccan DNA we just do paganism has a big streak of Wicken DNA in it have to just say that it does our circles our quarter calls buckland's Big Blue Book I still have that yeah was a huge influence on our lives I still recommend it to people because the foundations are solid and they're right there but they're Wiccan they're Wiccan based and a lot of things are so you're going to encounter a lot of similarities no matter what type of pagan which group you get involved in or what you're called to they're going to have a lot of similarities so some of the things that you can expect when you find a group are first of all you'll most likely be asked to do like a soft dedication like join the group for a year and a day and they'll do a very small welcoming ceremony a dedication type ceremony where you're initiated and brought into the group but it's not a big mystery it's not a big initiation ceremony it's a hey welcome you know you've expressed interest we like you you like us we're letting to infiltrate the friend group yeah so a lot of times you'll have maybe a new name maybe you'll choose a coven name for the group or your learning name for that year in a day time you know you'll spend your time as a a page an initiate an acolyte a dedicant you know someone who is learning for that time period a student is a good word I like to use a student a student it's perfect exactly what you are usually those people in a group are very permeable they'll come in and out some people will decide it's not for them some people will stick it out and they're kind of like the helpers you know they help the coven they bring things they come to all the rituals all the esps all the sabbaths but they might not be involved in making any rules or making any decisions and then after that year and a day if you so choose to join the coven and you pass whatever then it's like you know how I am with my analogies then it's like meet the  you you're either in the Inner Circle or you're out of the Inner Circle so like I love that so so when when you first come in you know you're kind of in the Outer Circle and then after that year in a day you get in Robert dairo is it Robert daero in your inner circle from Meet the fuers you're in the ccle yeah exactly and then you have your initiation which hopefully is not as traumatic as whatever they went through on that movie but then you have your initiation ceremony and it's more serious than your your dedication to the group and it and you really are saying I'm binding myself to this tradition to this group and you get your first degree and that's usually a much weigher ceremony and it will involve casting Circle calling quarters calling deity and going through some sort of M history usually because a lot of these initiations involve you're changing you're fundamentally changing you you're recognizing that you have learned and that you have grown over this time period and now you're entering a whole another phase and a lot of times for us it would involve taking a new name maybe rededicating to a different deity for that year in a day to study with and to study under it would involve sacrifices in time in having to go to classes in learning with your group community service exactly community service with the coven with your actual Community with your Pagan community and so these things are all part of getting to know this group like shell said you shouldn't go into any of this blind you should know the people that you're with I mean there's no reason to jump into something and and make all these promises that an initiation implies to some stranger on the internet that you only know because you gave them your credit card information and you know wanting to know all the details of an initiation is kind of where our society has turned to instant gratification I want to know and I want to know now well if you want to know put in your year and a day work like Le and I had to do to find out I didn't know what was going to happen until after I did all that work and got to the point where I was going to find out it's not an instant gratification thing you know part of the mystery is part of earning it that's true if you're someone like me I only ever did dedications myself I did have a Cy into into amarat I didn't feel that I needed to redo it for a group because I very much felt that my self- dedications were very valid and I didn't I didn't want to invalidate that as much as I love and loved the coven at that time it was very much a fight for me to say to to be in these Pagan spaces and say yes I was a solitary for a very long time I knew no one I had to do this myself I had to learn this myself and so I didn't want to give that up at the time now I'm a lot more flexible and I'm like yeah I would love to have an an isue so if I ever did it again like in the group that I'm in now I have kind of soft dedicated myself to this local coven and I'm going to rituals with them and I don't know where I'll be or if I'll be in this area get initiated into their Inner Circle they don't do degrees they have inner and outer circles so I don't know if I'll do that or not which is the whole purpose of like that first soft layer you know you don't have the instant gratification of knowing the future of that I don't and I would love to because these are very magical women I love working with them I'm having an excellent time and and even just having that initial welcoming initiation changes things like it feels different you know I I've met them a couple times we've worked together a couple times but it was that initial you're in the group now and you feel like all shiny and happy you know you were like a fuer I was like a fuer now I'm I am in the circle so but that's a good thing to talk about though is um now you have had a very powerful initiation in the circle on morat coven and did you feel differently afterwards like can you tell anything about that well you know I kind of did a a couple different things if you recall you and another did a initiation for me way back way way before omat that's before omat and I think that that was probably more moving than the amarat one and I'll tell you why and I'm not trying to take anything away from the amarat one I was just more of the weirdo growing up and that first one with you and that other person was kind of a there is something there that you do belong to and are a part of you're not just the weirdo in the neighborhood who's not going to a Wana or CCD you know you know what I mean it was like that first recognition that a I'm not the only one B I'm not some freak C I'm also not a devil worshipper it was just a big one yeah it was just more meaningful deep and you know in retrospect maybe that other person wouldn't have been the greatest choice for me you obviously were but in the moment more more profound than I mean with amra it was that coming together of a group which is a whole different a Ness um but that that original one was just kind of the acknowledgement I loved being part of that and even if the other person we all need to confront our shadow selves and sometimes that comes in the form of another person and the lessons that they bring us and so I think that makes it even more powerful that you had both a light and a dark presence bringing you in oh lessons were learned and you had that balance of both of those sides of the Goddess kind of bringing you into the fold you know and we need to pay attention to those things and that's a big part of initiation is it's not all fluffy rainbows and light there are going to be dark size and maybe we didn't realize at the time how dark she was but you know that it's very symbolic because that is a truth you know you have to confront who you are the good and the bad you can't ignore any part of who you are especially for a magical initiation well and also you know I'm a Gemini so it probably worked out that I had such extreme good and bad doing this because of my gemin that's a good way to put it but yeah so I would have to say that was very much more profound than the other just for the timing and and that sort of thing I love that and it's really cool that you mentioned too that they were different and they were for different reasons like oh absolutely the one was like your initiation into witchcraft which you've been studying for a while but it was a a celebration an explosion a an acknowledgement an acknowledgement opening an offering it was other was a Cen which is a different vibe and a different type of initiation which was equally awesome but you made me choose which one was more profound so I had to I didn't mean to but I'm glad you brought it up but yeah the the amarat one was about bringing people together and about starting this new adventure together and right so I there can be initiations and dedications for all sorts of things and you know I really liked our tradition of taking a new name because names are so important and what you call things are so important so a big thing for me was whenever I would dedicate myself or do an initiation something big like that I would take a magical working name for that time period and that would really help me to kind of connect with that deity or with that energy that I was trying to work with for that time so there's lots of different types of initiations you can get initiated for so many different reasons but it is a profound thing it is it's a wonderful amazing transition it's a great way to start something new to say I am a new person I'm starting a new phase in my life whatever you want to do with it I think is it necessary no but if you ever had the opportunity it is great and also honestly it is great to be a part of something and be a part of a group and you know like I previously said there are bonuses to be in a solitire but there are bonuses is to being a part of a group and having that group energy and that group mindset if you have the opportunity jump to quote someone named coyote I'll have to say it's difficult to sing lead and Harmony vocals all by yourself and dancing is different with a partner doing a spell or a ritual with the whole coven behind you also feels quite different preach it right I have to agree with that quote being a solitaire was wonderful it was a great learning experience being part of a coven starting a coven also great learning experiences so I think you should definitely try them all see what works best for you but watch out for the warning signs but you know for sure take advantage of all the wonderful things that it has to offer and you know if you're in a remote place um because you know we've got listeners all over the world if you're in a remote place there are valid online covens that are wonderful and flourishing you just have to be able to um differentiate kind of the scams from the deal but there are wonderful online covens that you can seek out so on that note thank you so much for joining us on back on the broomstick and also we'll see you next week on Friday keep it witchy
