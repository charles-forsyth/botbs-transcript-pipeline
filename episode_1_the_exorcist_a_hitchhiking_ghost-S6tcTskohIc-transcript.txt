[intro] It's 4 20 a.m Hi and welcome to episode 
1 of The Stoned Witches Hour with Chelle   and Laylla. Grab a seat, pack a bowl, 
and maybe turn on a few extra lights.   Listen in as we smoke more than a 
little cannabis and tell true-ish   tales of paranormal events, ghoulish crimes, 
and things that go bump in the night. *lighter and bong noises*
[Laylla] All right [Chelle] I have a… I have a legitimate 
question for smokers, female, female smokers. [Laylla] ooh [Chelle] So have you ever 
lit your thumbnail on fire?? [Laylla] Multiple times, especially after 
I've gotten a very expensive manicure   which is a big huge pain in my ass. [Chelle] No one ever talks about the drawbacks of   smoking marijuana and lighting your 
thumbnail on fire is one of them. [Laylla] That's how you know you've met 
a fellow stoner! Look at their thumbs.   First of all we have the callus right? [Chelle] Yep, yep, the lighter callus. [Laylla] *laughing* Yeah the lighter 
callus. And we also have melted nails so [Chelle] Yeah. Not to mention look at our 
lighters and it's got like that bowl mark [Laylla] Oh yeah that's the first thing. If 
you look at the bottom of someone's lighter..   like “Hey can I bum your lighter?” and you 
look at the bottom and you see that it's a   little melted, it's a little black, and 
yeah you know they’re a kindred spirit. [Chelle] *at the same time* 
you know you know you know [Laylla] I hear you gotta really 
you're gonna really scare me tonight so   I'm packing another bong in anticipation because   this movie… all right I know I'm spilling 
the beans but you said it was The Exorcist [Chelle] I did I did. [Laylla] It scared the crap 
out of me when I was a kid   I think it's kind of silly now looking back 
on it; but it was very scary at the time. [Chelle] Well you better pack a bowl because 
this, this is really an interesting story because   it was scary back then because we were 
kids but now it's kind of unnerving   as adults because there's truth behind it. 
And we're going to talk about that truth. [Laylla] ooooh okay that sounds 
fun! All right so let me grab this…   why don't you uh hit me with some facts. [Chelle] So it goes without saying that director 
William Friedkin's 1973 film, The Exorcist   is probably the most celebrated 
and perhaps the most horrifying,   HORRIFYING, motion picture ever 
released. This movie has won nine   academy awards. Pretty much the 
greatest horror movie of our lifetime. [Laylla] It was definitely creepy I have to… I,   I do remember it. I mean it looks so old 
now. Although did didn't they just redo it? [Chelle] Yeah but we're kind of old too by the way [Laylla] You keep saying that! *laughing* [Chelle] What I want to talk about is the 
real story behind the classic The Exorcist.   When you dig a little deep you know we all 
know pretty much the story of the little boy,   who actually in the movie was played by a 
little girl; but we all kind of know the   story of the little boy, but there's a little 
side story that kind of briefly peeks into this   and has a part of the writer's version of 
this and I want to kind of definitely do that [Laylla] A side story? [Chelle] Yeah like a little side story 
um it doesn't play a big huge key role um   into the true story behind it. um 
But there is a small piece that does;   and when when I dug a little 
deeper… it was intriguing [Laylla] Okay, I'm down for some side stories. [Chelle] Like, it was, it was 
intriguing so I, I just kind of,   I want to kind of talk about some of the 
interesting things about the story we all know   um about the boy; but I also want to kind 
of delve a little bit into this little side   story; because that's the part that 
I think maybe nobody knows about. [Laylla] ooh all right [Chelle] I never knew that there were 
two legitimate documented stories   that actually were kind of merged together to make 
first of all the book, the book, The Exorcist, and   then the 1973 movie; which was based off the book. 
It was actually two totally different stories.   Everybody knows the boy, which obviously in the 
movie was a girl, but the real life story was a   boy, a 12 year old boy. There's a couple different 
towns that have been mentioned. Actually this boy   lived in Maryland but ultimately outside of DC, 
like rural Washington DC, but like in Maryland [Laylla] All right so in the movie it was a 
girl. And you're saying in the real life story   that it's actually about a boy? [Chelle] A 12 year old boy, yep. [Laylla] I did not know that, I've never 
heard that before. I always assumed that   even the real true quote unquote 
story was about a young girl. [Chelle] By the way I just want to point 
out that in the St. Louis University's Pious   the 12th Library there are binders 
of documents that relate to this. [Laylla] Really? They like, they 
have a ton of information about it? [Chelle] Yeah, all of the news 
articles, the case studies,   the newspaper articles; like 
there's like a folder man [Laylla] No shit? [Chelle] This was in 1949;   so you know, I mean it's a upper middle-class 
type environment to say the least. [Laylla] okay [Chelle] Some people call this guy Robbie, 
some people call him Roland, but he like   was a Lutheran, so he was Christian but he was a 
Lutheran. He had a favorite aunt. Don't we all? [Laylla] Yeah, I think, I have a favorite Aunt. [Chelle] You know, you figure it's the 
40s and this Aunt, Harriet is her name,   gets them into ouija boards. 1949 
this kid's playing around with ouija   boards with his aunt; probably opened 
some freaking demon portal by the way [Laylla] *laughs* [Chelle] Seriously. Then Aunt Harriet dies. [Laylla] Like, right after using the ouija board? [Chelle] well not like right after but like [Laylla] Oh okay
[Chelle] She dies.   And the kid keeps the ouija board as kinda like a [Laylla] Memento? [Chelle] Memento of like this was my 
aunt’s so now she's gone and I loved her [Laylla] So the dude inherited a ouija board 
from his aunt like everyone. *bong bubbles* [Chelle] You know, it always comes 
back to a ouija board. I feel like…   don’t you feel like every story goes 
back to a ouija board? Somehow, some way? [Laylla] Especially in the 70s and 80s it 
seems like every single story had a ouija   board involved! *coughs* I… I do have to 
admit though… I, I inherited a ouija board,   but from my grandmother. Do you 
remember the one that we used [Chelle] Really? [Chelle] Yeah! We we've used it a couple 
times I think in some pretty spooky spots.   um The really old one like the first run 
parker brothers 1974 I think ouija board? [Chelle] You know funny story, um I also 
inherited a ouija board from my grandma but [Laylla] *laughs* Of course 
you did! *both laughing* [Chelle]   But! No! Like here's the irony of my 
life! This predates Parker Brothers;   it was from like 1949, manufactured 
in Salem, Massachusetts. wooowoo [Laylla] oh wow nice [Chelle] Talk about legit ouija board! And 
and and I have some interesting stories   about that that we'll talk about another 
time. Actually I bought a new one as well.   I have a collection. You know how 
I am. I like to collect things! [Laylla] You have a collection 
of Tarot cards. I know about   your quite extensive collection of 
Tarot cards which I envy and covet. [Chelle] But I also have a mini 
collection of ouija boards. [Laylla] Oh I love that! What 
what have you got? Like I know   you have the super old Salem one and you said [Chelle] I got this I got this super old Salem 
one which I guess um kind of long story short   my grandmother bought back in the early 50s. when 
you know when when ladies would have lady parties [Laylla] oh lady parties [Chelle] I don't know what you call them like   going to like card parties sewing parties 
drinking parties I don't know like… [Laylla] okay [Chelle] Like how I would come over and 
smoke, and we'd hang out and smoke, but   this would be like people drinking tea and having 
crumpets and like there'd be like 10 of them and [Laylla] okay okay [Chelle] They wouldn't be smoking weed but anyways 
so like you know they play cards and this and   that. So anyway 50s ouija board got it. And then 
my mother used it and my aunt and my uncle as   teenagers. And then when my grandma died they were 
like “hey you know do you want this”? I'm like   this is gold and you people don't even realize 
this; to me it was gold. At 16 I got the Parker   Brothers version for Christmas one year. Santa was 
kind. I still have that from from my original one   for my my teenage years. And then I've collected 
about four or five other ones. Most recently   I got this most beautiful artwork one 
in downtown Salem and it is gorgeous. [Laylla] I think you showed that to 
me that's the butterfly beautiful   blues and yeah it looks way 
too pretty to be a ouija board. [Chelle] Which actually they have the um ouija 
board history museum or something or other here. [Laylla] Yeah yeah I remember that's part of 
the reason why you get ouija boards. But okay   so we've ascertained like everyone obviously 
inherits a ouija board from a family member. [Chelle] Correct. Then they start having 
like paranormal activity in their house.   Vibrations, to strange noises, to flying objects [Laylla] Did they immediately connect it? Like   did it happen right after the aunt 
died or was this like not connected [Chelle] It was connected 
but they didn't realize it. [Laylla] okay, so they just didn't know 
yet at the time what was causing it. [Chelle] Right, basically 
they felt, later down the road   they realized this was probably 
like the infestation stage. [Laylla] Okay [Chelle] Like books would fly off all of a 
sudden. And then, that's when like the bed   would start shaking violently, which 
I'm sure you remember from the movie.   Furniture moving across the room, 
the scratching noises on the wall…   Like any parents you're gonna be like hey maybe 
I should take my kid to the doctor because it's   1949 and where else do you take your kid if some 
shit's going down you take them to the doctor. [Laylla] How do you explain that to your doctor? 
Yes, my four-year-old is levitating three feet   off of her bed most nights, and occasionally 
we are noticing that as her head spins around   she's vomiting pea soup… I mean how 
do you say that to your pediatrician? [Chelle] So as you can imagine 
*Laylla laughs* the child was taken   to Saint Elizabeth psychiatric hospital. [Laylla] Oh, yeah. [Chelle] highly regarded place for the 
time, granted 1949. Treatment required   institutionalization and was basically often 
referred to as an insane asylum. The go-to   is - you're freaking nuts let's lock you away. [Laylla] Well, didn't they do that for 
everything, particularly women at that   time? Oh you're cranky? Insane asylum. 
Oh, you have bad periods? Insane asylum.   Oh your husband's an asshole? Well 
you need to go to an insane asylum. [Chelle] Well listen to what they tried to say 
what was wrong with this kid. They tried to say   that he had like schizophrenia or tourettes. So 
you know back in those days they just assumed the   paranormal was nuts. He happened to get, like the 
parents happened to tell the story to someone who   was like hey actually you should get a priest. 
And they were like, hey we'll do anything we   can to try to fix this. The parents were able to 
get a priest to go to this like crazy hospital [Laylla] Was he responding at all in 
the hospital? Like as the doctors were   trying to treat him like were they 
having any success with him at all? [Chelle] No. No. No. No. [Laylla] Poor kid! [Chelle] So remember I told you they were Lutheran   so the parents were referred to this Father 
Albert Hughes. Now this guy was Roman Catholic;   so basically that's the whole point of 
pointing out they’re Lutheran that now   they're referred to a Roman Catholic which is 
a little bit different but I don't know how. [Laylla] Okay [Chelle] this guy totally believed that the boy 
was possessed and ended up seeking permission   from the Archbishop of Washington DC 
to like immediately begin exorcisms. [Laylla] yeah I think that is something I've 
heard. Don't they have to get permission to do   that? Like they can't just go performing exorcisms 
willy-nilly. They have to ask permission; [Chelle] it's like you gotta ask 
your supervisor kind of thing [Laylla] Right. Okay [Chelle] So he goes and tries to do 
this and then he can't do it anymore   because the kid starts breaking off pieces of the 
mattress springs and slashing the priest with it [Laylla] Wow! oh my goodness [Chelle] so ultimately leaves the 
first exorcism unfinished. Bad idea [Laylla] oh no [Chelle] Then scratches start 
appearing on the kid. Brought in [Laylla] is the kid scratching 
himself with the with the   springs or did they take it all 
sharp objects away at that point [Chelle] like all sharp objects away and all 
of a sudden the word Louis like carved into him [Laylla] okay so like a 
name? What’s the kid's name [Chelle] uh ronald or roland [Laylla] That's right, that's right not Louis [Chelle] So the mother thinks that it 
actually means that they need to go   to Saint Louis where they have relatives [Laylla] Okay, why would you 
make that connection? oh yeah   someone's carving the name Louis into my 
son, that must mean the city Saint Louis [Chelle] She has this cousin who's 
going to Saint Louis University.   They put her in touch with this 
other father, Father Walter   Halloran and Reverend William Beauderne. 
These are actually Jesuit priests which again [Laylla] Oh! A new flavor. We're   introducing a third flavor
[Chelle] a different flavor [Laylla] okay [Chelle] And they agree to do the exorcism 
with like a whole bunch of assistance.   So remember in the movie where they had like 
a couple priests and like five assistants?   So here we are with that they go 
there; that’s you know that's the whole   vomiting mattress thing kind of like the same 
types of things that happened when the first   exorcism failed. Ripping the bed apart…. 
blah blah he was kind of they noticed that   night time was when a lot of this happened 
in daytime the kid was pretty all right. [Laylla] is he still under the care of 
doctors at this point or has he been   released to the parents and now they're just 
going to different types of Christian priests? [Chelle] Going there they took the kid out of 
the institution and hightailed it to St Louis.   They're on their own now. So the kids going in 
like trance-like states; you know making those   guttural sounds. Things flying all around. 
The father decides he's not giving up.   No matter what. All these like horrific things 
are happening, so they decide at midnight….   why would they do this at midnight? they're 
going to give him the holy communion [Laylla] That doesn’t sound 
like it's going to work! [Chelle] It's not; because basically, the way 
that the priest put it in his diary (which is   in that library that you can actually go to) 
they said that satan would have no part of it. [Laylla] Satan wants no part of communion [Chelle] Right you know all these things 
are getting carved on this poor kid   they're trying to like hold the kid down. 
but like what they do finally in the end…..   so you know this is going on for months. 
they're trying to exercise this poor kid   for like I think it was like three months. 
easter comes. is it like jesus's birthday?   maybe maybe that's what happened. The kid 
wakes up with seizures, things are really bad,   so they call Saint Michael. I don't know 
why they didn't do this before. as a witch   I would have even done this prior to this 
if all this bullshit happened for months [Laylla] You bring out the big guns 
right from the beginning. Right? [Chelle] Why weren't you doing 
this like two months ago? [Laylla] So he'd be a logical pick. I mean 
st michael; they already know that he's,   he’s like a warrior against satan so if they 
think this kid is possessed by demons I mean   bringing out the big guns means bringing out 
Saint Michael. The guy who's got a big sword and   is more than willing to use it against evil.
[Chelle] Well and you figure these these   folks were Jesuit priests so you know their belief   in these saints and the archangels and all of 
that was extremely strong. So they probably felt   deep down that if they called Saint Michael 
they would somehow someway win this battle. [Laylla] And it's definitely a thing, you and 
I have both seen it, where deep-seated beliefs   whether it's a deep-seated belief 
in Saint Michael, or the cross,   or a pentacle, or whatever 
your religious symbol is,   if you have that deep-seated belief that 
this is protection, it is protection. [Chelle] It is. Remember in The 
Craft *giggles* I love The Craft [Laylla] Me too! [Chelle] They actually talk about that. 
The policeman. That his badge, the star,   and you know he didn't believe 
in the whole witchcraft thing,   and then he actually saw the demon guy. 
And, they told him that if he believed;   because he believed in his star that was 
his talisman to ward off the evil and [Laylla] Was that in Practical Magic? [Chelle] err no yeah you're right Practical Magic. [Laylla] that's right! the 
police officer in Practical Magic [Chelle] the star! and he held the star up, and 
he's like, and it basically made the demon guy   like go away temporarily. Because he believed that 
his star, his police badge, would make it go away [Laylla] That's right his belief that his 
police badge was his talisman against evil [Chelle] Right, right [Laylla] yeah! It was so much a part of 
who he was.. Exactly that! Exactly that! So   whatever your belief system is, if you believe 
that putting your foot underneath the covers   at night is going to stop the demons from eating 
your toes, it will! That blanket becomes powerful,   it becomes a safe.. you've made 
a magical space underneath it and [Chelle] Just so you know I do that every 
single night. And I do believe that by the way [Laylla] oh it's true everyone does that. [Chelle] Ghosties can't get my feeties 
if they're under the blankets. Duh [Laylla] That's a life truth 
I think everyone we all learn   that as children we just carry it with us 
into adulthood we just don't talk about it. [Chelle] Exactly, exactly [Laylla] We just know it's true [Chelle] So they call Saint Michael to kind 
of expel satan from this poor kid's body.   st michael was like supposedly like 
fighting satan for his soul. they are doing [Laylla] like like right there 
in the room? There's like a   saint battling with Satan over this 
boy's soul?! That sounds fucking scary! [Chelle] I guess! Yeah yeah. so this happens 
for like 10 minutes. but like all these weird   things were happening. like during this battle; 
like that was like this 10 minute long battle   like an x appeared on the kid's 
chest and it's supposed to be like   they thought that meant he was possessed 
by ten demons instead of one and like [Laylla] oh because x is the roman symbol for ten?   Yes, points for me. I'm a stoner 
and I still got that. All right. [Chelle] And like he had like a pitchfork 
shaped pattern with red lines on his   thigh, and like a snake going down his ankle like [Laylla] this poor kid! [Chelle] and I mean imagine being 
like 12 13 years old and you know [Laylla] And getting all the stuff 
carved on you? Oh that poor baby! [Chelle] and then all of a sudden like 
the kid just comes out of a trance   and he said he was gone and never coming back.   Saint Michael won. their belief and their 
faith in that kind of pulled through for him [Laylla] wow that's fantastic! What a cool story! 
And and the the author used that story it was his   he was looking at. You had said he was 
looking at stories of exorcisms and he   came across that local one right? [Chelle] Yeah he he was a student, the 
author was a student at Georgetown University   outside of DC. He was taking a 
college course that this article   somehow infiltrated and related 
to that course and kind of   dug into all the newspaper articles because it 
was happening at the time. I mean it was like [Laylla] Kind of going on [Chelle] time yeah it was 
the headlines at the moment   he was kind of looking into the exorcism stuff 
separately um in his college life and in his   outside of college life the headlines is this 
current thing happening to this boy. You see   in these articles he's a writer wants to write 
a story. Even though it like evoked negative   reactions from like religious groups; do you 
realize… this is going to blow your mind. This   guy actually wrote this novel to try to 
scare people into going back to church? [Laylla] wait, that was the whole premise? [Chelle] yeah! He really thought he'd 
scare a whole generation of people into   going back to church. Like sorry pal 
led me down the path to witchcraft! [Laylla] laughs* [Chelle] Ooh that backfired! Like really, He 
he thought that the premise of the story would   lead people to go back to church. He… during 
his classes at school, had been going into   the Loudoun France incidents, um the exorcisms 
that happened there 1632 uh when that happened [Laylla] There were exorcisms 
that happened in France this   isn't just an American phenomenon? there were [Chelle] No. Actually yeah this 
this actually happened in 1632   in Loudun France and kind of resulted in what 
became the witch trials across the world. [Laylla] The Salem witch trials?!? [Chelle] You know everybody everybody in the 
free world has heard of the Salem witch trials. [Laylla] Right [Chelle] um whatever year that was. I don’t even 
remember, 1692 or something. We always kind of   don't focus on the European witch trials. You 
know some of the European witch trials date back   prior to the Salem Massachusetts witch trials. 
They’re they're called the Loudun possessions.   That's that's the name of this particular story 
that is also intertwined in The Exorcist, which   I'll get to how. Was actually also a notorious 
witchcraft trial uh that took place in Loudun. And   this happened in in 1634. And I'll get into into 
the the witchcraft trial part of it in a second. [Laylla] So that was quite a bit 
before. You were absolutely correct;   the Salem witch trials were in 1692 and 
so that was quite a bit … what that's   almost 60 years, 50 plus years, 
before the Salem witchcraft trials. [Chelle] 58 years before [Laylla] yeah [Chelle] What people don't realize is the 
second story actually dates back to 1634.   So like we're talking… shit I'm high. I'm 
having a bad math moment. What, like 400 years? [Laylla] *laughs* I can't even 
do math when I'm not high!   Hold on let me get my socks off so I count on 
my fingers and toes all right what are we doing? [Chelle] 1634. So like I don't know   like three four hundred years 
ago, whatever like a long time ago [Laylla] okay, long ass time ago [Chelle] In France. I don't speak the french 
language so maybe I'm not pronouncing some of   this right and for that I apologize but okay so 
1634 I think it's pronounced “Loud-inn” France [Laylla] I think you might be right. I don't also 
don't know French but I think that sounds right [Chelle] Yeah, Loudun France I believe.   there was some issues with a nun and a 
priest. actually 17 nuns I believe it was [Laylla] *laughing* wow that's a prolific priest [Chelle] it was the covenant of ursuline nuns [Laylla] ursuline convent [Chelle] Yeah I think yeah I think that's 
how it's pronounced ursuline or something [Laylla] ursuline convent or ursuline convent yes [Chelle] all I can think of 
is ursula from little mermaid [Laylla] right [Chelle] and they were said to be 
visited and possessed by demons and again   you know I I am not a French-speaking person 
so I might be pronouncing this all wrong. The   Catholic church did an investigation and there was 
this local priest named uh Urbain Guardiere and [Laylla] Urbain?? [Chelle] Urbain [Laylla] Urbain? Urbain. Okay that's a 
name, that's quite a name. All right. [Chelle] It's 1634 in France his name's not Steve.
[Laylla] Hahaha   All right, good point. I'm sorry Urbain. [Chelle] Lord! hehehehe! Listen 
to this, the witch trials [Laylla] Urbain!! *snorts and laughs hysterically*   I'm sorry! I can’t! His 
name's not Steve!! *laughing* [Chelle] *laughing* [Laylla] No, it’s Urbain that's why it's 
funny! *lighter clicks* All right, sorry. [Chelle] It's not steve [Laylla] No [Chelle] But, so this guy's a priest in this [Laylla] Urbain [Chelle] Urbain. Urbain the priest. [Laylla] Urbain the priest. 
Sorry, I'll be quiet now. [Chelle] you're high [Laylla] I know I'm smoking [Chelle] Smoke a bong. Smoke a bong while I talk [Laylla] All right hold on [Chelle] Well anyway *bong bubbling* 
Urbain is a priest and, as is true with   pretty much all witch trials, he is like 
not a witch, being accused of a witch.   And what happened was he was like this kind of   debonair, kind of hot and sexy guy. I don't even 
know what hot and sexy in 1634 France looks like [Laylla] I have no idea. [Chelle] Like imagine, like do these people, 
like they don't brush their teeth, they don't   shower for weeks like when they do shower it's in 
a river…. I don't know what the expectation is but   apparently he was like a good-looking fella. 
he pissed everybody off in the town because,   basically whether they were young or old or single 
or married, he was pretty much fucking everybody. [Laylla] Oh! Sleazy! He was 
sleeping with everyone in the town? [Chelle] All the men in the town 
decided to try to persecute him [Laylla] oh yeah they're like 
this dude has got to go he's [Chelle] Because basically   their wives and their daughters were like fair 
game and they were getting pissed. Urbain sexy man [Laylla] sexy sleeping with the whole town Urbain [Chelle] Come trial time all of sudden   nobody wants to be a witness. so 
they had no choice but to let him go [Laylla] Really?!? [Chelle] No choice! Basically, in like   2021 terms, basically all charges were 
dropped for insufficient evidence. [Laylla] Because no one would 
snitch on the town Casanova. Nice [Chelle] Because [Laylla] Well obviously they were 
happy enough with him that, you know,   everyone was like: you know what? 
I am not giving loverboy up. [Chelle] Another problem that was going on in 
in that moment is there was a king it might have   been one of the Louis’. They had a wall around 
this town already, so like imagine this like   medieval town that has like a like a stone wall 
around it okay? The king wanted to tear down the   wall. well the town was split. Like, think of 
it like the Berlin wall. Do we keep the wall?   Do we not keep the wall? What are we doing with 
the wall? Here the catholic church decided no   matter what they personally believed, as a church 
entity, they were going to side with the king   to tear down the wall. Guess who didn't want 
the wall torn down and fought tooth and nail? [Laylla] Urbain? [Chelle] Urbain! [Laylla] Hm? Why did Urbain like the 
wall? Was he keeping his lovers separate? [Chelle] Probably. *Laylla laughs*
[Chelle] He felt that,   that's the way it was, that's the way it 
always should be, and just because the king   wants it doesn't mean we should do it. kind of 
thing, like he wasn't really a rule follower. [Laylla] Obviously, no care 
for the sanctimony of marriage. [Chelle] Basically he ended up winning the 
battle of the wall and as punishment because   they couldn't convict him of basically being 
a manwhore they made him the priest of Loudun. [Laylla] Wait wait wait! 
So they took the manwhore,   and they made him priest of a whole city? [Chelle] Yeah, behind the wall and then like   these people couldn't leave the town 
they were stuck behind the wall like [Laylla] Wait wait wait wait! Even 
better so they took the manwhore,   and they made him the priest of the 
like trapped people in the city? [Chelle] You want your fucking wall, then 
you ain't leaving. There were 17 nuns there [Laylla] Are these the 17 nuns he slept with? 
Yeah. Typical manwhore Urbain. Okay go on [Chelle] Well because he's the priest and [Laylla] He's the priest, yeah. 
Poor nuns! Those poor nuns [Chelle] Now, these chicks range to be about 25ish 
years old. There was a plague. It's like freaking   now, 2020 plague. That was part of the reason 
actually why they were kinda, quote unquote locked   in the town. Couldn't leave the wall because 
they didn't want the plague coming or going [Laylla] So they were on 
lockdown like we, like last year? [Chelle] basically. [Laylla] okay [Chelle] basically plague of 1632. I don't know. [Laylla] okay [Chelle] but you know a lot of the wealthy 
people and a lot of like the doctors and like   business owners; they had left before they 
were kind of locked in the town. There was a   period where the people who wanted the wall 
to come down; they were able to leave when   the decision was made to keep it. and it was 
kind of like: you want your wall here you go. [Laylla] Okay [Chelle] people are kind of isolating… Oh my 
god! I didn't even realize that it is like now!   Even the nuns kind of like lock 
themselves in their little house. [Laylla] all right hold on. I need to 
do one more hit, because I am not high   enough for time repeating itself. *lighter 
clicks bong bubbles* okay continue *exhales* [Chelle] so the nuns aren't getting 
any visitors anymore and Urbain [Laylla] Because plague! [Chelle] Because the plague. 
so they're kind of even though   they're like in the lock down town they're 
still kind of like not leaving the house [Laylla] okay [Chelle] so Urbain was still visiting sick people   and giving money to the poor 
gracious man. gracious man. [Laylla] gracious in public, but then behind 
the convent walls he was raping 17 women. [Chelle] then all of a sudden there was a 
nun now you got to remember these are like   25 year old kids probably have 
to be like what 18 to be a nun [Laylla] I have no idea. I think they 
were throwing their girl kids that they   didn't want into the nunneries like left and 
right; so I think some were pretty young. [Chelle] this young nun all of a sudden 
has a vision of her dead father. basically,   all these other nuns started 
having visions of a dead priest.   like a recently dead priest that died of 
the plague. so they decided because they're   having all these visions dead people that they 
need all these nuns need to have an exorcism [Laylla] of course and isn't that what you do for   bad dreams? You call a priest 
and have an exorcism. Duh. [Chelle] remember the kind of controversial scene 
with the crucifix in a sexual act kind of way? [Laylla] oh yeah. That scene, yes. [Chelle] that is what these 
nuns started to do in France [Laylla] like for fun? Were they 
coerced? Did the demon make them? [Chelle] like I guess the demon made them 
I guess? they decide to let Urbain try to   exercise the demons. but then two other priests 
got involved and blamed Urbain. and they said   that Urbain was the one who brought this demon, 
asmode and purposely like. possessed these nuns [Laylla] what? So Urbain was behind 
it the whole time? I should’ve known. [Chelle] That's what they were saying. that's what 
they were saying. these, these, nuns are kind of   quarantined in their convent.   so like they're not even opening the door 
for anybody except essentially Urbain. [Laylla] No alms to the poor. No [Chelle] no no no they're 
they're they're on lockdown.   They are 100 percent on quarantine lockdown [Laylla] 17 women locked down in 
a convent. locked down in a city.   no one can see them except handsome, sexy [Chelle] Urbain [Laylla] Sexual deviant. Sexual deviant 
Urbain. This is not a recipe for good things. [Chelle] No. So, he you know, he he was doing some 
shady stuff and that's where some of the the the   tie-in to The Exorcist the movie, or the book, 
either way. There is a tie-in somehow you know! [Laylla] this is such a good story I forgot 
I'm like what the fuck is this crazy,   demon possessed, dude gonna do next?! I forgot 
there's a tie in to The Exorcist! All right. [Chelle] so you know these these 17 girls, 
young women, are are being taken advantage of   by a person they trusted, their priest. there 
does seem to be some weird stuff going on because,   they really did kind of it does seem like 
he was maybe, either a jekyll and hyde, or   maybe invoking something not so nice? I I I 
don't know if there were actual possessions   of him, or if they're saying they were 
possessions of the nuns, but the nuns were doing   sexual things with religious 
objects. not just crucifixes. [Laylla] *gasp* No! [Chelle] they were masturbating on statues. [Laylla] *gasp* [Chelle] I mean they were they 
were doing some freaky deaky [Laylla] *gasp* you said! You said in The Exorcist   that the boy was kind of 
normal during the day like [Chelle] Right [Laylla] like Urbain going to 
people's houses during the day [Chelle] right [Laylla] he was okay, and then at 
night he turns into a freaking demon!   And he's like doing all this 
crazy stuff with the nuns! [Chelle] Potentially. Correct. Because 
see, I don't know I don't know how, or   I don't know what he did. I don't know 
what happened he could have just been a   manwhore who got possessed and his 
man whoriness went all sexy demon.   he kind of quote unquote put a spell over 
these girls and they would just get violently   horny and do some crazy stuff with some religious 
objects. And they started calling him a magician.   then it was like they decided to have these 
big hearings again. so they do this trial the   second trial, and at the end of the trial 
they find him to be guilty so this time [Laylla] Is he guilty of being a manwhore, 
or is he guilty of being a demon? [Chelle] He is guilty of 
being a witch, essentially. [Laylla] Oooh okay [Chelle] Now that he's guilty, it's execution 
time. Crazy thing is, they tried to hang him,   lightning storm. The lightning bolt 
hit the noose and let him free. [Laylla] no! [Chelle] So they were scared of him [Laylla] no shit they tried to hang the 
manwhore and lightning oh my goodness [Chelle] So then of course they were like: 
oh my god! You are a witch! You are a witch!   like all these guys jumped on top of him,   and tied him down, put all this wood 
around him, and burned him alive. [Laylla] Damn. That's a rough way to go. [Chelle] And then they basically tried to 
say that the possession stopped with the   nuns. and then that was it. [Laylla] Everything stopped once 
Urbain was gone? So it was his fault. [Chelle] Kinda yeah. [Laylla] Well he was probably 
raping all 17 of those poor   nuns. The poor things were probably 
like scared out of their wits of him,   and when the other priest came 
they're like: please it's a demon! [Chelle] right but to go back to the boy [Laylla] yeah how is this related to The Exorcist? 
oh because of the the crucifix…. that scene. [Chelle] yeah basically that was like 
the one piece still an interesting story [Laylla] Absolutely! so they stole that 
part and like inserted it into…. oh wow.   sorry! no pun intended. and they stole that 
story and put it in The Exorcist just for   shock value? That's what he took away 
from that story? He's like: hey this   uh masturbation thing is way too interesting 
I'm throwing it into The Exorcist story? [Chelle] you know you look at the story there's 
a lot to it it's a very interesting story. I   never heard about the Loudun exorcisms. 
I had no idea that that was kind of the   pinnacle of the the witch trial movement; 
but yeah, you look at the whole thing,   and that's the one piece you can pull 
out of this my friend? That's it? [Laylla] I had no idea. [Chelle] Where, where is your head? [Laylla] I mean that's them obviously 
that's why they made this little boy   into a girl so they could include 
that sexualization in there [Chelle] right [Laylla] what's what's a scary movie without 
a little bit of uh tna right? you gotta like,   throw in a little sexualization or people 
aren't just gonna watch your scary stuff [Chelle] And some of that vulgar talk where 
she's talking vulgarly about some of her body   parts and stuff; those that was also said to 
be some of the stuff that the nuns would do.   The whole sexual piece of The Exorcist is 
what came from the Loudun exorcism stories. [Laylla] I wonder if it was the same demon? [Chelle] you know? right! [Laylla] right [Chelle] Interesting [Laylla] It could be we'll have to 
look and see a little deeper I can't   believe you found that like how I never knew that [Chelle] and and you know like 
I said a total side story,   but just that little piece that ties it in 
made it so worth finding out about that. [Laylla] You know that makes the movie so much 
more interesting now. just to know that it's not…   just one beside the fact that it's a it's a true 
story. that you can go to a college library and   look up the actual documentation of people that 
experience this, beyond that to know that there's   these other interesting historical pieces that 
were pulled into it like how interesting is that? [Chelle] Yeah, because again, you know 
that was like what almost 400 years ago. [Laylla] Amazing the things that you can find when 
you get high and go down a rabbit hole. *laughs* [Chelle] Seriously. Seriously, dig a 
little deeper, smoke a little more. [Laylla] You know that's actually 
good advice. Dig a little deeper,   smoke a little more. *giggles* Things 
would be so much nicer. *bong bubbles* [Chelle] So, in the end these priests 
like did it man; they rocked it. [Laylla] well, like, the seventh one they tried. [Chelle] yeah right? and no one 
would ever talk about it after that. [Laylla] They just, they went 
out and lived their lives? [Chelle] They wouldn't even release like, 
technically, like the last name; or the real   name of the kid. That's why you don't know if 
it's ronald or roland or robbie. They're kind   of sketchy about that. The kid never admitted it. 
Like grew up all these years and never was like:   hey that was me. I mean that kid's got to be 
like 80 right now if he's even still alive;   and never once publicly was like hey that was me. [Laylla] Just kept it quiet. Never said 
anything. Never tried to seek fame.   But this guy heard about it and wrote a 
book about it and then it became a movie. [Chelle] Correct [Laylla] Wild! oh my gods [Chelle] and we we think back at 
that, you know that's that's like   one of the original awesome horror movies of our 
lifetime. you know we look back on some of those   crazy parts; apparently they were one story or 
another all pretty much based on facts. you know,   you got the ouija board that opened the portal. 
you know, you got the story from Loudun,   where the manwhore priest is is burned alive 
for being you know supposedly witchcraft. [Laylla] Right [Chelle] To like this poor little boy 
who's getting his body carved up by god   knows what. and then these priests that are 
doing whatever they can to try to save this kid;   and at least the priests and 
the parents didn't just like   leave him in that nut house. God 
knows what happened to the poor kid. [Laylla] Right? Well let's 
see, we have the bad priest   and then the good priests to make 
up for it. Kind of like that. [Chelle] Just interesting to see that 
what what the true story of this was.   And it's documented and it's kind 
of weird that it actually is because [Laylla] There's a diary from a priest. there's 
an actual written diary from a priest; of of what   he experienced during this that's that's 
just crazy that's absolutely amazing [Chelle] Nuts. Nuts. So what 
are you smoking tonight? [Laylla] After that story I'm *coughs* 
really really glad that I'm smoking some   of my favorite gorilla glue. *coughs* 
Although I think we're not supposed to   call it that anymore? I think we're 
supposed to call it GG. like gg [Chelle] Or gg four. GG4 [Laylla] Right. gg number five, gg number 
four… but yeah it's gorilla glue and I really [Chelle] I don't know why. [Laylla] But yeah, I don't think the company 
appreciated having their name associated with a   marijuana cultivar. but yeah, so I'm smoking 
some gigi number five from my my favorite   delivery place, the gas station. it's pretty good! 
I like it it's very tasty. it's got a really great   high. it's one of my favorites. I i first started 
smoking it when I came out here to California. and   I i discovered it because the garden shop that I 
went to had some clones and while we were waiting   to get our gorilla glue clones they were packing 
bongs. which they probably weren't supposed   to do… of their own homegrown gorilla glue; and it 
was just so tasty! and the clones came out great,   growing it was easy, smoking it was even 
easier. very tasty. So yeah, tonight I'm   smoking some grilorilla glue. How about you 
Chelle? what are you smoking this evening? [Chelle] In the whole true spirit of 
getting it at the store this time,   although mine's not delivery, one of 
my local stores had a sale on pre-rolls [Laylla] I love payrolls [Chelle] Yeah basically it kind of 
came down to buy one get one free. [Laylla] Oh! I love buy 
one get one free even more! [Chelle] Right right so sunshine daydream. [Laylla] Oh I like that sound. Sunshine daydream! [Chelle] very nice very nice 
kind of a hap happy-go-lucky high [Laylla] So you're smoking some sunshine 
daydream on the east coast where it's   all dark and cold and wintry is it 
helping you feel a little bit of that [Chelle] Shush yourself. [Laylla] Yeah it's gorgeous here. It's gorgeous. [Chelle] Yeah well it's getting 
ready to snow here, so whatever. [Laylla] Oh wow. sucks to be you. [Chelle] Yeah, yeah pretty much. [Laylla] All right Chelle, spark up a pre-roll,   make sure you've got those lights 
turned on. Are you ready for a story? [Chelle] uh-oh let's see. scare me. [Laylla] All right you got it. Here 
goes; like any good ghost story,   I'm gonna start with a dark and stormy 
night. *Michelle laughs* Okay not really,   but it had just been storming and the wet pavement 
was black as ink. There was a young couple,   let's call them Kim and Pete, no reason. They 
were parked on the shore of White Rock Lake,   which is near Dallas Texas. And this is in 
the late 1920s and you can probably guess   what this young couple was doing parked at 
the side of a lake in the middle of the night [Chelle] A little smoochy kissy. [Laylla] So after a little interlude of, 
you know whatever a young couple gets up to   in a car on the side of a lake. They're getting 
ready to go home and they turn their lights on. In   the glow of the headlights they see the silhouette 
of a young woman, dressed in a kind of sheer white   dress, outlined against the dark shadows of the 
lake. This young woman moves closer to them, and   in the light of the headlights they can see that 
she is soaking wet from head to toe. The dress is   just clinging to her in the cold, and her blonde 
hair… It's always a blonde, Chelle. why is it [Chelle] really? [Laylla] Right? [Chelle] I don't know. I 
think they think we're stupid. *Both laughing*
 
[Laylla]   So yeah so her blonde hair is soaked 
and just clinging to her face,   her shoulders and her back. The poor thing is 
just drenched. She speaks in a faltering voice;   and she sounds distraught. And her voice is hoarse 
as if she'd just been crying or really cold.   And haltingly, she tells them that she had been on 
a boat on the lake with her fiance and her friends   and that there had been an accident. between 
sobs she says something about the boat capsizing   and that all her friends are safe, but she had 
somehow become separated from them when trying to   get to the shore, and that she needs to go home. 
and Pete, being the gentleman that he is, gives   her his coat to wrap around her scantily clad 
body. and she climbs into the rumble seat of a car [Chelle] uh is it like the back seat? [Laylla] not only is it a back seat, but 
it's like… picture an old, like 1920s car,   where it's just like a two-seater right? and 
then it has like this big trunk off the back? [Chelle] Yeah? [Laylla] Well the trunk folds up backwards, 
and basically makes a bench seat outside   the car. So that's your rumble seat, or 
your mother-in-law seat, right? like it's [Chelle] like the Munsters? [Laylla] yes! So it's like it's like a trunk seat. 
They're not actually sitting in the car with you;   they're like kind of outside the car. So she 
decides to climb into the rumble seat of the car,   because she's soaking wet, she doesn't 
want to squeeze in with the couple.   so she sits in the seat and gives him an address 
that's just a few minutes away from the lake.   as they're driving to this address Kim 
is like clinging up next to Pete and   and nervously glancing at the young beautiful, 
young, woman in the rumble seat. and she sees that   this woman doesn't speak again but is just kind of 
sobbing quietly and staring off into the distance.   after a few minutes of this, Kim notices that the 
young woman appears to have fallen asleep. and   when they get to the house and they're pulling in 
the driveway Kim tells Pete not to wake the woman   as they're pulling in, because she just feels 
so terrible for her. so they pull in, and Pete   sprints to the door and knocks on it just hoping 
that there's someone going to be awake this late   at night to retrieve this poor, sad, cold, girl 
from his car. The door opens, and an older man   looks kind of sleepy, befuddled, and confused, and 
and then as Pete explains he starts to look sadly   resigned. Pete explains that this woman in white 
had given them an address, this address, and she   appeared to be distraught and in need of help. 
And he just really wanted to get her some help.   As Pete turns to point to the woman in the rumble 
seat so the gentleman can see her, he sees that   Kim is now standing outside the car holding 
his soaked jacket and the rumble seat is empty. [Chelle] Now where'd she go?!? [Laylla] Right? So she's nowhere to 
be seen and Kim looks really scared.   Pete's very confused at this point, and the 
older man gently pats him on the shoulder,   and with tears streaming down 
his face he tells Pete that   years before, his young daughter had died in a 
boating accident while celebrating her engagement. [Chelle] Ohhhhh… [Laylla] Yeah. And every year since then, 
someone has come to the house late at night   claiming to have picked her up hitchhiking. 
Only to have her vanish before he gets there. [Chelle] Aw! [Laylla] Yeah [Chelle] that's so shitty!! [Laylla] Isn’t that so sad? so it's like some 
people say that she's still trying to make her way   home. And and that she just can't quite do 
it. Now the thing about this story is that   it's kind of repeated all over the country 
I'm sure you've heard something similar [Chelle] Everywhere. Everywhere. 
Every single state I think has a   hitchhiker, ghost on a road, kind of story. [Laylla] You're not wrong. That is very very true. 
There's like tons of them all over the place. And   the interesting thing about this one is that it 
was first published in a book uh in 1943. And it   was called The Ghost of White Rock. yeah it was 
written by a woman named Ann Clark, and it was   based on a story that apparently kids have been 
telling each other since the 30s in high school.   I did a little digging and tried to see if I could 
find if this actually had any truth to it; because   a lot of people seem to think that this 
is one of the places where this particular   story had originated. I dug around and I found 
that um the area originally belonged in the 1800s,   it originally belonged to two families, the Daniel 
and the Cox families. And they settled there   and it was not a lake at that time, it was just 
farmland. There was a little town nearby, they   had a private cemetery that's still there to this 
day, that has like 500 or so people buried in it.   And in 1910 construction began on White Rock 
Lake itself in response to a drought in the area. [Chelle] So they just made it? [Laylla] They just made the lake because 
of a water shortage. So they basically   took these farms and turned most of it into 
a lake; and the cemetery is still there but   not much else remains of what had been there. 
During World War II it was used by the US Army to   induct recruits and there were actually 403 
German prisoners of war housed there. So it   didn't have the greatest history as a happy 
place. So the lake itself was created in 1910.   The earliest written account is the story 
that Ann Clark wrote in 1943, and she wrote   it about stories, again that had been circulating 
since the 1930s. I did find that in May of 1929,   now remember May. So May of 1929 three young 
boys drowned there in a boating accident. [Chelle] Oh [Laylla] Yeah, so a group of kids, I guess they 
used to regularly go out in these homemade boats,   and they would go fishing. 
And on this particular day   one of the boats capsized and three 
of the young boys uh in it drowned. [Chelle] I feel like a homemade boat 
you're already taking your chances [Laylla] You'd think apparently they did 
it regularly but on this particular day   yeah their luck ran out. But none of them 
are obviously a young woman. so I didn't   think that that although that fit the time 
frame and it is a tragedy that occurred in   the lake it didn't really fit a story of a 
young woman there were two young women that   died in the league a louise fort davis age 
38 drowned herself there july 5th of 1935. [Chelle] Broken heart? [Laylla] They think so. Her sister found 
a distressing note and alerted police;   and emergency responders rushed to the lake. Only 
to pull her lifeless body from it moments too   late. They did find a suicide note and her white 
gloves carefully folded in the seat of her car;   and it is rumored that it was a broken heart. [Chelle] It's always a guy. [Laylla] But again she didn't 
die in a boating accident. [Chelle] True [Laylla] The second story that was easily found, 
was another distraught woman. This time in   November of 1942. A 35 year old, Rose Stone, 
committed suicide; also by drowning herself in   the lake. And she was discovered there after a 
brief search. and she had a note pinned to the   sweater that she drowned in, asking that 
her relatives be notified of her death.   I couldn't find any proof, but that was 
also rumored to be of a broken heart. [Chelle] That's just kind of a shitty lake! [Laylla] it gets worse, Chelle [Chelle] I'm not going to this lake [Laylla] No! No do not go to 
this lake! it's freaking creepy.   Yeah, this is not even the beginning. 
so after a little more digging I did   actually find what I think is 
the origin story of this ghost [Chelle] tell me tell me! [Laylla] I got you. We have the 
tragic drowning of Hallie Enid Gaston.   This was in May; again remember that month, May. [Chelle] yeah [Laylla] This was May 26, 1927. Miss Hallie, 
19, a teacher, drowned in a boating accident   when her boat and her friend that she was on 
with her friends capsized on white rock lake.   interestingly enough louise and rose the two women 
who committed suicide tragically in the lake,   are mentioned all over the place. I can 
find mention of them everywhere. Hallie   Enid Gaston was a lot harder to find, and her 
story matches almost perfectly. And so I just   found it really odd that it was difficult 
to find any information about her at all. [Chelle] Oh wow [Laylla] Yeah. So she was 19, again 
a teacher, recently engaged. And she   drowned tragically on the lake in a boating 
accident. And this again was in 1927 and and   the original story that had been published, 
she had said that it was based on stories   that teenagers had been telling themselves 
since the 30s. That one really fits. There   have been numerous documented stories of 
a ghost in this area on White Rock Lake,   and some of the other different areas of the lake 
and they differ. In a few stories, some of them   the woman says that she was with friends, some say 
that she was on a dock, sometimes she says she has   to get home, or she has to get to her fiance. 
Some people think that there might be multiple   ghosts here because of there's so many 
different sightings and and different things. [Chelle] It's like a hotbed there. [Laylla] It is like a hotbed. And locals 
say that there are places that are   so creepy that they won't go there 
during the day let alone at night. [Chelle] It almost makes me want to go there just 
because they said that. *Laylla laughs* right? [Laylla] You're not going in the lake 
but you want to go there to investigate [Chelle] Right right. Oh 
no I'm not going swimming. [Laylla] no no no [Chelle] You know who knows what's going to 
be grabbing my foot and pulling me down no [Laylla] oh absolutely well see here's the thing. 
those again were not the only lives that this   lake has claimed. More recently in july of 2012, a 
young man named Joe Stephen Cunningham, he died on   the lake after he and his son were paddle boarding 
and a freak gust of wind knocked them over and his   son was able to swim to safety but the father 
was unable to make it out and they found him. [Chelle] Oh wow [Laylla] Yeah they found him drowned 
after a brief search; and then [Chelle] So this just keeps happening, [Laylla] This just keeps happening. In May, [Chelle] again [Laylla] of 2014 Jeremy Daughtry,   also 21, and a friend jumped off the 
Mockingbird Lane bridge over the lake.   And Daughtry unfortunately had trouble swimming 
back and sank. And his friend escaped unharmed. [Chelle] holy shit [Laylla] yeah. a lot of these people were around 
20. The boys that I mentioned that perished,   um one was 12 one was 17 and one 
was 19. So a lot of young people.   One of the saddest stories associated with 
this lake, is in October of 2015 a woman,   Patty Stevens uh I believe she was in her early 
50s she committed suicide um by turning her car   on in her garage. And she lived in a 
home in a suburb on White Rock Lake.   And the reason she committed suicide, is that 
her beloved husband of 25 years had been killed   days previously by a machete wielding 
man as he jogged around White Rock Lake [Chelle] Jason Voorhees! [Laylla] This actually [Chelle] *laughs* I couldn't help myself [Laylla] Yeah. No, this sadly was a mentally ill, 
former football player; but yeah so this man was   killed as he jogged around White Rock Lake   and his wife then committed suicide 
because she it was too much. [Chelle] Wow! [Laylla] That's not all! There's more. [Chelle] There's more? dun dun duuuh! [Laylla] There's more!   The most recent one that I saw was in june of 
2017. A sailboat capsized on White Rock Lake;   again with a boat capsizing, again after a freak 
strong gust of wind. And a man and a woman got   dumped in the water. The woman was safely 
pulled out, but the man couldn't be seen;   and after a short search they found his body. [Chelle] Oh this is, like, this is like a   bad place. Where is this again 
Austin Texas? Where is this? [Laylla] This is near Dallas Texas. This is called 
White Rock Lake. It is a park near Dallas Texas;   and the urban legend around this lake… 
there have been so many sightings of people   picking up this hitchhiker that 
Reader’s Digest, Reader's Digest!   named White Rock Lake as one of the world's 
most haunted bodies of water in 2018. [Chelle] oh wow [Laylla] Yeah [Chelle] that wasn't that 
like that like that wasn't   like 20 years ago that was just a couple years ago [Laylla] That was just a couple of years ago;   but interestingly enough Neiman Marcus comes 
to play in this lady of the lake legend. [Chelle] How? [Laylla] So in 1953 there 
was another book published,   it was about Neiman Marcus; “Texas the Story of 
the Proud Dallas Store” and in this book a Mr   Guy Malloy, who was the director of display for 
Neiman Marcus at the time, he recounts a story   in which he's driving home after work and a 
beautiful blonde girl, again blonde girl.. [Chelle] Blonde girl [Laylla] blonde girl..Appears on the side of 
the road soaked only she's in a very fine dress   that his wife says is obviously from 
the Neiman Marcus store. And she says [Chelle] Well, duh of course it was. [Laylla] and the wife says stop, Guy. 
That girl seems to be in trouble.   She must have fallen in the lake. Her dress 
is wet can you tell I'm using my 1920s accent? [Chelle] You know. I wish you had the outfit. [Laylla] *laughs* So yeah okay imagine me and I'm 
gonna do it again. Imagine me in a flapper dress.   Stop, Guy. That girl seems to be in trouble. 
She must have fallen in the lake. *both laugh*   Her dress is wet. You can tell 
that it is a very fine dress.   She certainly got it at the store. 
Meaning, of course, Neiman Marcus. [Chelle] Of course. [Laylla] Of course. So the girl asked them 
to take her to an address on nearby Gaston   Avenue. And she doesn't say why she's soaking 
wet, and they're of course too polite to ask.   And when they get there, the girl is gone but 
the back seat is wet. Just a damp spot remains [Chelle] As usual [Laylla] *laughs* and same thing they go to the 
door, tell the gentleman who answers the door   and he says that it was his blonde daughter who 
loved to wear nothing but Neiman Marcus clothes,   had drowned two years before when she 
fell off a pier at White Rock Lake. [Chelle] oh wow [Laylla] The Neiman Marcus clothes make it sound 
kind of funny. But interestingly enough Guy Malloy   did not ever add that part. That was actually 
added by his wife much later. The original story   that he had been telling for years to people, he 
was kind of reluctant. You know, you would have   to kind of get him to tell it, and in it there was 
no trace of Neiman Marcus clothes. But he did say   that he had picked up a young woman and she didn't 
talk much but gave him an address, and he put her   he wrapped his jacket around her because she 
was cold. Again no Neiman Marcus clothes in his   telling of the story, took her home and then 
she was gone and only his jacket remained. [Chelle] You know one one thing I noticed about 
both of our stories is the real people involved   aren't necessarily jumping out there to tell 
their story to everybody. it's almost like   they kind of shy away from it, and other people 
tell it, and they kind of try to hide from it. [Laylla] It seems like the people that that 
had it happen are a little reluctant to speak   about it and and in this particular case 
it got very much embellished by his wife,   she obviously threw the Neiman 
Marcus bent into it; but [Chelle] Well, yeah [Laylla] *laughing* But there are a lot of 
different stories there. The Dallas newspaper has   several different accounts of people writing in; 
it was pretty easy for me to find people who have   said that they have had something similar happen, 
or have know someone that something similar had   happened to. interestingly enough, like you 
had said at the beginning of our conversation,   it it is part of a Americana it's like woven 
into so many different states. and a lot of them   do seem to have a similar origin story, maybe not 
quite as early as this one, but they're out there. [Chelle] You know I I think that part of that is   there are people who just go in a bad way 
and and and their spirit their their whatever   sticks there. You know like, that we've heard 
it all, you know somebody was doing whatever got   killed on the side of the road and then they're 
forever walking on that side of the road. It's   like their spirit stuck there. And I think 
that's what maybe makes that a universal,   coast-to-coast story, is because unfortunately 
bad shit happens to people. And when they die,   they sometimes get stuck in that location and 
sometimes that location is a deep dark road. [Laylla] you know I my personal theory for 
that, is that a lot of these hauntings are…   I guess, I think the term a lot of 
people use is residual hauntings.   Meaning that it's not really like someone's 
spirit or their ghost that's there;   it's more like something so bad, so emotional, 
or so powerfully, so psychically powerful,   happens to a person in this location that it kind 
of recorded itself somehow on that time and space.   And sometimes people when they stumble into that 
they can they can feel that energy there or they   might actually be able to see that recording play 
out in the form of a of a wet blonde hitchhiker [Chelle] I I believe it I believe it [Laylla] yeah who knows. It's interesting 
to me that so many different people,   even some of them seemingly not having 
any knowledge about the history,   again the original woman that I found, Hallie; she 
was very difficult to find. I did not see her name   all over the place even though her story 
most closely matches the ghost story.   So it was kind of kind of strange to me to 
see that the story the ghost stories follow   the original story very closely even though 
that one's not the popular tale that's told. [Chelle] Right and again you know the these 
original people that these are, these are based on   are the people that aren't trying to brag 
about it and tell everybody who will listen. [Laylla] Right [Chelle] they shy away from it [Laylla] yeah they keep it kind 
of close to the vest so true.   All right I need to have some of 
this gorilla glue. oh excuse me, GG [Chelle] You're not allowed to call it that [Laylla] heh GG!! *lighter clicks, bong bubbles*   That makes it sound like the cat 
from Kiki's Delivery Service. [Chelle] Love that movie. [Laylla] Love that movie. *Chelle laughs*   I love your story this week Chelle what 
have you got in store for us next week [Chelle] So next week I'm 
gonna take it to a scary place.   you know like I like I had stated 
previously when we've chatted   uh you and I have have met in in rural upstate New 
York so I'm I'm gonna do a story from near Troy,   New York. Forest Park Cemetery there 
are places that claim that this is like   one of the most haunted places, they have even 
dubbed it the gateway to hell. Dun dun duhhhh! [Laylla] in a cemetery? a 
gateway to hell? Why are people   are people still getting buried 
there? Why would you even go there? [Chelle] *laughing* it's a gateway to 
hell why wouldn't you go there? duh. [Laylla] Okay, good point. I would totally 
get high and go there. You and I *both laugh* [Chelle] No, no when I when I tell you 
like, we're talking headless angels.   Like an actual iron gate, 
that is like the gate to Hell. [Laylla] Dr Who has ruined angel statues for me [Chelle] Yeah no. like like [Laylla] Headless angel statues? now maybe 
maybe I don't want to go *laughs nervously* [Chelle] no like like it it gets creepy. it 
gets creepy. So yeah, we're going to go to   the Forest Park Cemetery um near Troy, New York 
and it's going to be spook freaking tacular. [Laylla] I'm looking forward to it [Chelle] Where are you taking us? [Laylla] Well I'm going to actually 
stick to my new roots since I'm kind of   outside of LA ish, I'm going to 
go to Hollywood to a very story. [Chelle] Oooh [Laylla] this is something you've probably heard 
of I know we were talking that a lot of my stories   neither you nor I are familiar with but this one 
this one is so popular, this one is so was so much   in the media at the time and is still in popular 
lore and popular culture now. the Black Dahlia [Chelle] oooh I like that! Oh that'll be great [Laylla] So okay you haven't heard of it then! 
I'm really glad. I am gonna blow your mind [Chelle] Scare me. I can't wait; one week one week [Laylla] Even if you had heard of this story I had 
heard of the story I thought I was familiar with [Chelle] Wasn't there a movie? [Laylla] Yes, yes there was. I I thought I 
was familiar with the Black Dahlia… there   are so many books and movies and shows and 
documents. I think there's a documentary,   there are bands named the Black Dahlia murder; 
and all sorts of things. And her death is still   unsolved to this day. And there's so many creepy 
and scary things around it; it's just it's going   to blow your mind. you're going to absolutely
