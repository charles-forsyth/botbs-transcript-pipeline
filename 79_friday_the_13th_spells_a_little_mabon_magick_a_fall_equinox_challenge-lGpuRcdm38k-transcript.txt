the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and tonight we have a plethora of topics for your Delight it is Friday the 13th when this episode comes out one of my favorite days one of my favorite horror movie franchises okay they're a little cheesy but fun it's also about a week before the Festival of the Autumn Equinox when the day and night are equal length and you know here I am shell sitting over here living life for me this is my favorite time of year I named a child after something in this season and I am a Friday the 13th lover okay who does not love Jason Vorhees okay and you know just a little side note let me go off on a tangent real quick where I am in Massachusetts about 10 miles from my house there is a Crystal Lake just saying I I swear he lives there still because it it had to be that Crystal Lake in my mind but also it is my sweet Love's birthday but also Leila with Friday the 13th come superstitions it does I've always loved the superstitions of Friday the 13th as much as it seems like everyone knows that Friday the 13th is bad luck not everybody knows exactly where it came from and to be honest the origins of it are shrouded in a little bit of mystery it seems the most accepted reason for Friday the 13th being an lucky day has to do with the Knights Templar some people say that when the Knights Templar were arrested on Friday October 13th of 1307 that that started the origin of the Friday the 13th Superstition other people think that it may possibly be related to a book that came out in 1907 called Friday the 13th by T W Lawson and that has to do with the stock market crashing on Friday the 13th as the source of all this bad luck there are other cultures that have other dates Tuesday the 13th in both Hispanic and Greek culture is unlucky so there's a lot of things around the 13th but 13 happens to be my lucky number there was some with the knight's Templar yeah so you know it kind of comes from there and then all the superstitions just followed and it it's a lot of fun I think nowadays and one of my absolute favorites that I think is so weird is did you know shell that if you put your shoes on the table on Friday the 13th someone in your house might die what my first thought here is who the heck puts their shoes on the table like is that something you really need to worry about on any day let alone Friday the 13th okay now in the household I grew up in that is null and void because if I put my shoes on the table on any day 365 I would have been murdered by my mother okay um it didn't have to Friday the 13th it could have been Tuesday the 8th and I would have gotten murdered okay yeah probably at my house too I don't know it doesn't sound like something anyone would do that's kind of why I love it because it seems so absurd like how did this become a suti of something you shouldn't do on the 13th anyway so while I was looking up some facts I found from a website called worldstrides.com that there are superstitions around the world about Friday the 13th so before we start talking about the Autumn Equinox I'm just going to give you a couple of these from other cultures so in Norse lore they say that Friday the 13th is unlucky because the gods got together for a big old party in Valhalla and Loki crashed the party as the 13th guest and caused all sorts of problems so they say that's why 13 is unlucky particularly Friday the 13th uh Christians think that the last supper There were 13 people at that particular Dinner Party The fear of Friday the 13th is known as frot Trisa decophobia frot fra Trisa kaida phobia not even GNA try it yeah yeah I know the name comes from the uh frigga Freya the Norse god of for Friday and tris decophobia which is the fear of the number 13 so they work in a goddess in there now some other interesting 13 lore is it isn't always looking at is a is a bad luck quote unquote evil number because for millions and millions of people across the world who are Taylor Swift fans the swifties 13 is like the number Taylor Swift was born on December 13th her first album went gold after 13 weeks and I believe she turned 13 on a Friday the 13th so if you're a Swifty there is no bad vibes with 13 man wow all hail Taylor Swift dang okay so Taylor Swift's unofficial day I'm I'm I'm down with that don't they say that now I know that we don't believe the hype I get that but isn't there a quote unquote thing that a actual coven should have 13 people yes one of the ideas was that it should be 13 yeah I've heard that that is the traditional number for a coven as you and I both know a coven can be as few as two people as many is 70 you know it's usually a handful so yeah nothing there 13's always been lucky for me I'm not sure why but ever since I was little it was my favorite number when I would Place different sports ball teams in my youth 13 was always my number and it's always been a lucky day for me it's even more fun now because my besties beloved his birthday is on the 13th Friday the 13th this year so so many good things it's also the reverse of my birthday my birthday is the 31st flap but it's 13 um combined them together you know you get that core number four oh now we're getting into some fun numerology so before we get too far down that path back to the now we've also been talking a lot about candle magic and abundance magic lately and I heard that you have a special Friday the 13th money spell or abundance spell so you know I get on the old Google here and a there so I was Googling cuz I wanted to make sure that we touched in the beginning about the whole mabin versus Autumn Equinox which we'll get to in a minute but I Googled mabin versus Autumn Equinox and what came up was you know how you can like Google will initially come up with like an AI response now uhhuh so I Google this and the and it comes up with this like whole detailed AI thing okay and you know I think there might be something to this and I'm always down for some divination and some money spells but it was to take 13 pennies and twist on this is because I do collect pennies if not from the year of my birth from the decade of my birth I would try to take 13 pennies at least from the decade of my birth and you do you know your type of money spell I won't get into what it said on there because I'm not necessarily for using other people's verbage but you know do your little chant your little rhythm your little poem your rhyming sentences whatever you want to call it and then you take these 13 pennies and it says to bury them in the earth I am not necessarily for that because you know pennies in the earth you know they're not going to decompose or anything and that's really not kind but my Twist on it would be take a mason jar full of dirt and bury those pennies in the middle of that dirt and basically you are going to put out there that with this these buried pennies what you're supposed to do then you're supposed to bury them all heads down okay you know the heads and tail heads down so you're supposed to wait until like the next Friday the 13th however long that is you dig up the pennies and I guess depending on how many pennies are now heads up is whenever you will get that amount of abundance in your life here's my problem like a day a week a month per Penny it wasn't really specific this is like some AI but the thing is is is it what if there's like say there's 10 or 15 months between Friday the 13th it's a good question I guess you'd have to wait this is like one of those long-term spells I have instant gratification issues right well you know especially with things like money these things take time money doesn't grow on trees and even if it did that takes a long time but there's absolutely nothing wrong with a long-term spell sometimes you have to do long-term spells like my money Bowl has been going since January 1st this is longm spell you have had that thing going for at least forever it's burning right now but this gives me a really great idea because what I like to use those AI suggestions for is inspiration and you gave me a fantastic idea for a Friday the 13th more instant gratification spell using 13 pennies but do you see how like I didn't really like some of the ideas so I twist my own idea that's exactly what I'm saying yeah I wouldn't want to bury it out side cuz you know that's kind of not kind to the Earth you know put it in a jar and bury it that way there's ways you can kind of twist it it just says you know use 13 pennies I would want to use 13 pennies either from the year I was born or the decade I was born you know you want to take these things and and you want to make it your own you wanna not just take what you're getting from a book or from a a website or from a Facebook page or from Instagram post you know yeah okay AI came up with this 13 pennies bury it you know say some words there could be something to that if you make it your own and come up with your own words like don't use the AI words take that idea and make it into something that's yours yes like the idea that it sparked for me is to take 13 pennies charge them on the 13th with my idea of abundance and I love your idea of taking pennies trying to find the ones that are from your specific year of birth or pick a particular year or decade the act of searching for that specific time frame that adds magic and energy to it so that's one more component to the spell so I really like that but I like the idea of taking those 13 pennies charging them on the 13th and then I like the idea of a little bit of constructive littering you know kind of maybe drop those in a little bit in a parking lot or maybe as you're doing your errands maybe drop one or two on a sidewalk keep in mind that you're spreading abundance and you're spreading luck so that when other people then how you going to know if your head to no no I'm changing the whole spell oh gosh so now you take those pennies and you spread them throughout your day maybe on Saturday the 14th or over the next couple days and every time you drop those pennies think of the idea of spreading luck and abundance so that when someone else finds those pennies they not only get some of that energy for themselves but it redoubles the spell and sends energy back to you so now you're kind of spreading it out to other people because everybody knows you find a penny pick it up all day long you'll have good luck so you're just reinforcing that with a little bit of extra magic of your own with Friday the 13th in the mix as well so you can do that you change the spell a little bit I Chang the spell a little bit and now we have a fantastic spell and it's much more personal that way and that's how you utilize it for powers of good yeah use it for inspiration in a few minutes I'll I'll give you another example of a really cool AI thing but I'll get to that when we start talking more about traditional stuff awesome well all right so now that we're into the Equinox a little bit the Autumn Equinox that's coming up is on September 22nd this coming Sunday at 8:43 a.m. eastern and for our southern hemisphere friends it is the Spring Equinox so they're getting ready for that luy I don't know I think we're pretty lucky this fall has been phenomenal in my part of the world it's absolutely gorgeous here actually it has it's actually been really nice things have actually been rebutting have you noticed yeah I have some when I was doing your little I'll get to your little Challenge in a minute but when I was doing your little challenge I went out to my garden that's mostly kind of overrun and finished but there was a couple little Peppers that are trying to flower again yeah it's definitely not what we're used to there's so much abundance here in Pennsylvania as compared to when I lived in California this was a very hot dry everything was brown and dead time of year so it's it's fun to see the difference in Seasons but I'm very much enjoying the abundance around here it is my favorite time of year actually you know I say I love summer best but I just like to be warm let's face it there's something intriguing and wonderful and mysterious about like it's not just we talk about change you know you might feel change but like it's visually right in front of you at least where we are and I understand it's not like that in all parts of the world but in the northeast of the United States this time of year is a drastic visual change everything goes from Gorgeous bright green you know everything is just that vibrant green and colorful flowers now we're getting into that Autumn Leaves everything's Reds oranges yellows Browns it's it's a die off but it's a gorgeous die off is that okay to say yeah the meaning of the season is right in front of your face there's abundance every where you look the farm stands on my road are overfilled with vegetables and corn and gourds of all kinds but in the same respect the fields are now chopped and bare they're starting to die off you know everything's starting to change and to die and even as the trees are gorgeous you know they're turning those Reds and oranges and yellows it's because the leaves are dying they're getting ready to go dormant you know it's that visual reminder that we're well into the dark half of the here it's the peak of reaping what you seow yeah it's literally the peak of reaping what you seow but in the same respect astrologically it is also that second point in the year when day and night dark and light are absolutely 100% 5050 equal you know we got 12 day 12 days that'd be crazy 12 hours of light 12 hours of Darkness you know we've in the past done this stand the egg up thing stand the broom thing up but even if you're just living life and you're working and and you know taking care of the kids doing whatever you do you're still cognizant that there is 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night for that one day you know everything in the seasons around us are telling us that it's time to stock up for winter it's time to get ready to go within and it's a beautiful time of year to start work on taking stock of your magical self taking stock of where you're at and be prepared for the second half of the dark part of the Year where we really go within in a big way so funny you should say that I happen to do this from time to time what'd you do I came up with a new tarot spread and I'm just you know I didn't come up with no fancy name I'm just calling it the fall equinox spread what I've got here is eight cards good amount I like that you can add a significator if you so choose a just seemed kind of right because I kind of broke it up into four quarters you know the eight sabbaths the kind of four quarters of the Year there was some thought put into it what I've got to start the spread and it almost kind of looks like a cross similar I'll post stuff online you've got your first two cards and they represent getting things in order before the dark time I like it although we do recognize that we are Midway through the quote unquote dark Time of the Year this is when it starts to get dark this is the celebration of the Second Harvest this is when we start to put things away for the winter time traditionally and this is when people really start to notice that it's getting dark until inul really so these first two cards uh getting things in order before the dark time before going within and then above that the second two cards are balance and Harmony what do you need to bring balance and Harmony the next two cards left or right or above so we're starting on the left with getting things in order uhuh then two cards on top for balance and Harmony the next two cards next two cards do they go to the right so the first two on the side okay so the first two cards go one two to the left like the leftand arm of a cross right right getting things in order and then you've got the two for balance and Harmony kind of making like a center piece of the Cross stacked on top of each other like the top arm of a cross correct and then to the right of those you have one two out like the right arm of a cross correct and those are your plans for going within okay and then the bottom two that are kind of stacked like the bottom of the Cross uhuh the best wording I could come up with action items yeah well that's like the fire position so that makes sense action items and then basically the thought is if you choose to have a significator that could go in the middle or all four points me okay I like it the theory behind this spread is to give you a sense of where am I at what do I need to do to find my inner calm what are the plans I need to make to get there and what are the action items that I need to do right now top priority what do I need to do to get my together I'm I'm excited to try that particular spread because I I really like doing tarot spreads this time of year if I'm going to increase like my daily card plls that I'm journaling now is the time of year I tend to do it I get very introspective after mabin Summer's over Fun's over trips are over vacations are over festivals are over yeah it's I look in I kind of reevaluate everything so I'm doing bigger spreads and bigger polls so I'm really excited to try your your Poll for the next time I do a journaling spread that that looks like a really good one to journal well you know and and you did bring up a good point that it seems like I don't know if it's because you're inside more looking for more inside stuff to do the introspective thing but tarot is is definitely a good way to kind of guide yourself through that inner dark time yeah and it it's cold at night here in the mountains it's chilly I'm still out and active a lot during the day but at night it's cold you know I'm I'm cold I want to be in my office or in my house you know that's when I tend to pull out the journal and write a little bit longer than I did maybe in the summertime absolutely I will definitely post the schematics of that spread I just like coming up with spreads I think it's fun it's a good one I like it now I'm going to apologize to some of our purists because I did say mabin as I was just talking about the Autumn Equinox and I will still affectionately call this holiday mabin because I like it that's what I learn we do know that mabin is a term that was given to the Autumn Equinox in roughly 1974 by a gentleman named Aiden Kelly when he was trying to make sense of modern day at the time and historical wheel of the Year holiday so they wanted eight holidays he kind of made up some of those names and mabin is one it's the name of the God but he chose to kind of slap that onto the Autumn Equinox and some people prefer not to use that because it's modern well and I I sometimes I don't mind calling it the fall equinox but a Equinox is a different connotation for me on a personal level which you're aware of so I just I just call it the fall equinox sometimes I will so mbin I'm out of habit but as we're learning Leila just because we learned it when we were 18 doesn't mean it's right now that's right that's right I'm trying to retrain myself I'm trying to retrain myself I love that I think with mabin it's totally okay and if you don't want to call it mabin for reasons because Aiden Kelly made it that's okay that's absolutely fine but please don't send us hate mail about it so I will occasionally affectionately call it mabin although I do try to say autumn Equinox to be a little more specific so you actually had a fun challenge for me today that I adored shell it had me feeling very witchy and very magical out in my lovely yard well you know we hadn't done a quote unquote try it episode in a while um a long while and not that this was a TR it per se but it kind of was I you know I was thinking you know we've been doing this for a minute now and this is like what our third mbin episode our third fall equinox episode podcasting so I was like you know what could we do that would be a little different you know we don't want to talk about the same old same old what can we do to give folks not a task per se but a TR it for lack of a better word you know something that they can do at home and I was outside smoking my cigarettes cuz I can't smoke in the house and I started looking around and seeing kind of all of that fallish kind of stuff you know the pine cones are falling from the trees and leaves are starting to fall and get a little colored and crispy and dark and the bark is starting to peel off the birch trees the acorns are falling it's starting to look like fall it is ultimately things are dying off for the season and I thought thought I'm just going to go outside and forage me some false stuff out of the yard so I went around I gathered some very wonderful fall looking stuff and I was trying to think of a way I could turn some of the stuff into either a magical piece for lack of a better word or something to put on the Altar and I just started kind of collecting stuff and walking around and I came up with something really pretty and very poignant for the season and we'll talk about in a minute what I'm going to do with it but I sent you a picture and sent you the challenge do the same you sent me this gorgeous picture of a beautiful collection of fall items we'll put up pictures on all the socials but you sent me this picture I'm like wow that's gorgeous and you said go out in your yard gather what you can that reminds you of fall of mbin and bring it back and see what you can do see what you can put on the altar just with what you can Forge from your yard and I'm like challenge accepted I'm so down for that it literally started becoming like a battle of the pictures every time I would go out I'd find something more beautiful more interesting you know at first I'm like what the heck am I going to get but I am very lucky dare I say blessed with the yard that I have because I have so many wild herbs and animals and things just abundant in my backyard so I knew I was going to win this Challenge and you know I kind of have it from more of a city d perspective I do have a yard and I do have trees but I am definitely not in the country like you no you're in Downtown Salem practically yeah yeah and you know for for folks that are even more downtown than I am you know go to a local park or go to a a state forest or if you got to do what you got to do go get some stuff from the damn store it's okay you don't have to find it on the ground Wagman's has their cinnamon brooms out I've been being very good and not buying a ton of them but yeah go to your local farmers market go to a park all you need is one fall leaf or one Acorn or one pine cone you don't have to go as all out as shell and I did we're both pretty lucky that was a beautiful photo you sent and what you decided to do with your leaves and bark we'll put up pictures of what we found I did also put my hag tapers I cheated a little I'll admit I cheated I already had the Mullen stocks that I had harvested just a little while ago that I've been keeping and drying so that we can make hag tapers hiat's torches as a tri it closer to sin so I'll admit I already had those but the rest of them I just kind of gathered from what I had in the woods and the fields the annoying part about all of that is the fact that you actually have Mullen and I don't grow yard so there's that but so I put this together and you know whatever you want to do and you know you kind of made like an alter out of it that was absolutely gorgeous and I kind of Jarred mine I put it in like clear vase what my intention for that was you know sometimes my go-to in the fall is a simmer pot and I'm like I'm not going to be simmering barking leaves here you know I wasn't going to do that and I was like what about kind of making like a spell jar simmer poot minus the water so I almost want to call it a spell vase okay you know bringing in that change into your into your home bringing you know that natural change from outside into your life you know change sucks and we all hate it how about make it as least shitty as possible by having natural change instead of chaotic traumatic change it's almost like a quote unquote spell jar of sorts to bring in that natural next tick in the wheel I really loved your spell vase for a couple different reasons I like on the changing of the seasons Every High holiday every tick of the wheel as shell would say I like to redo my altars at the the very least I'll clean them off dust everything put everything back all nice and pretty but I do like to decorate them for the season so maybe I'll put a new cloth PR yeah but if I had a vase and I know exactly the vase that I can use you can change what's inside the vase for each season and I think that's kind of lovely you know and this might work for witches that are undercover as well if you have a large clear vase for summertime you can just put things that remind you of summer in it for Springtime it can be all spring flowers and and lovely light crystals and for mabin it can be fall leaves and and Shell's even got some Salem dirt I think at the bottom of it and I do I do you can put berries and cinnamon sticks in it sand in the summer those little twinkle lights for Ule and so I love the idea of a vase that stays the same on your altar but you change the contents of it with each holiday I think that's very cool it's a very good idea Lea we're witches we like things we can put things in totally do we really do so the other thing that we're doing for this holiday of mabin is we're going to be together which is absolutely fantastic I'm very much looking forward to doing ritual with you let's tell the people what we're gon to be doing well actually we're going to be recording a lot of episodes first and foremost people I promise hopefully some video if we can get off our lazy witchy beehinds but very fun thing that we'll be doing during the day is we will be at the central New York Pagan Pride day in in Liverpool New York near Syracuse we will be there all day this is fabulous and and and if you are in northeast PA or New York State Central New York hell if you're in Jersey or Vermont if you can get to Central New York on Saturday the 21st these girls will be there we'll be doing workshops at the festival at Pagan Pride day if you are looking for

subscribes all of it thank you guys so so much we love it we also want to make sure that you're aware we are still catching up on DMS emails and all of that we are still catching up have faith people we'll get back to you you know I was a little late getting to our recording session this evening because I was out trying to buy a Tarot deck I'm so excited shell oh my God oh my God what are you buying what are you buing hold on it's not that exciting do I have it yes I'm sure you do the Tarot deck I'm buying two actually I'm getting a Tarot deck which is just a mass-produced rider weight Smith Tarot deck I love that by the way I do too it's very nice but I'm getting it so that I can break it up and give it to people for this chaos divination Workshop so if you're one of the people that comes to my workshop you'll have an opportunity to take some tarot cards home for your own Magpie deck but the other deck is the old Druid animal Oracle and I am so excited because I think that was my very first Oracle deck ever and I know you've got that one I feel like I have that it was my first Oracle deck and when I saw that she had had both of these decks I was just so excited so I'm happy to get the first one because it's one that I won't mind breaking up and giving to people and I'm super stoked about the other one because I haven't had this Oracle deck in a very long time like a lot of witches you know you get excited you loan things out to people who want to learn and you're like make sure you give it back and then you never get it back so that's what happened to mine so I'm excited to replace it but she wasn't able to make it I have to wait so I'm I have to wait but I will I will post pictures once I get it can I just say I have literally known you for like 30 years and you are always the person that loans things out and never gets it back I know it's literally your fate except for me I've always given things back that I loan out no you are wonderful that's why I love you sh you are like the one person who always loans  out and never gets it back it's okay I've kind of accepted it at this point but you know I I do like to loan things to people I like to teach people I like to share did did you ever get that copy of Mr Avalon back no I never did damn you and I'm not exactly sure when I decided to start putting a come back to me spell on all the things I loaned out but once I started doing that oddly enough I haven't had anything not come back to me in a while okay but yeah I'm very very excited to do the central New York Pagan Pride I'm very excited to do the workshop I'm just very much looking forward to the Autumn Equinox this year and you know for me um on a personal level I am going to be thrilled to be back in central New York I'm actually from the Southern Tier of New York but Southern Tier Central New York same thing for fall you know to be in Upstate New York during the fall you can't beat it well unless you go to Vermont but you can't beat it you know the smells the colors it it just I'm excited I can't wait I just can't wait to spend the weekend doing ritually stuff with some New Yorkers yes I'm so excited that you're going to be here and that we're going to be able to do ritual together the dark half of the year is not just about abundance and preparing for the winter and preparing to go within but it's the time of year when the veil starts to thin people like to say around these bigger holidays the veil gets thinner until it gets to S when it's at its thinnest that time of year so working with ancestors is another really good thing to do this time of year well that's also why it's a good time for tarot because that connection is I don't want say easier but kind of easy when we talk about the items that we gathered for our gather things in your yard and and see what you can turn it into some of the things that I gathered were dead flowers uh was bark was thistle down and some of what I gathered was living you know it was bright flowers I had um asers and beebalm and there was some flea Bane in there there's some Golden Rod but there's living and dead things you know this is the time of year when you have both it's it's that balance it's you know the balance of abundance and coming death damn you I went dead only so I have a spell that you can do using some of those things that you gathered no matter what it is so because the Autumn Equinox marks the point between light and dark and life and death it's it's a Lial space and so you can get into that Lial space to talk with your ancestors so I'll quickly I'll tell you what this is you're going to have one Black Candle one white candle to represent Duality to represent death and life put the Black Candle in a safe dish and you're going to surround it with anything that you've picked that's dead that's not alive bark pine cones bin corns I have a deer's jaw bone that I found so any of those things that represent death you're going to put there then in the other dish you're going to take a white candle and you're going to surround that with living things you know the leaves the flowers of fall anything that you've harvested from your garden but things that are alive that represent life renewal Vitality that type of thing so now you've got one life bowl and one death Bowl basically you're going to light both of your candles and as you light the Black Candle focus on your ancestors maybe you'll say their names out loud maybe you'll call them to you then light the white candle think about life and yourself and your place in life and where you're at right now and think that you are a continuation of your ancestors you are part of that whole cycle so then as those candles burn medit itate Journal maybe pull some cards think about your connection to your ancestors and what lessons they might want to give you what advice they might want to teach you you should also think about what your intentions are for the dark half of the year uh what lessons from the past can guide you what wisdom from your ancestors could help you navigate the challenges that are coming up so as those candles burn down do your journaling do your ancestor work and then once the candles have burnt out trust that that spell has worked that you've gotten some wisdom from your ancestors and then dispose of the organic stuff outside give it back to Nature and then maybe put a little bit of the candle stubs on your altar to remind you of the changing seasons of the change from life to death I love that love so you can do that like with the challenge that shell gave me I I started Gathering things that were both alive and dead that reminded me of the season so that's something that you can do with those now one other thing I wanted to mention you know I love all things divination and this is something and again you know being a New Yorker at heart I like this uh Apple Magic oh I love that so this particular form of of divination involves taking an apple peeling the Apple in one piece that is real hard by the way it's a lot hard oh my grandma used to make us do that and say the alphabet while we did it and where it broke was the person you were going to marry or the letter of the name of the person you were going to marry oh that's not where you're going with this is it that's not where I'm going but you know that is also good form of of Apple Magic if you'd like for for that I guess it kind of is right to almost a a similar end you know you try to peel it off in one big piece and then you drop that one big piece to the floor that is going to make some sort of shape and you are going to basically Divine that shape looking like a sailo it you know does it fall looking like I don't know a caterpillar it's kind of like the same thing as reading tea leaves or or throwing buttons or even throwing bones you know you're reading patterns cool right so you're you're basically going to peel this apple into one big long piece and then Divine whatever the picture symbol whatever it is you see in that I love that and then you should chop up that apple and make air fryer apples out of oo I don't have an air fryer but I know where you're going with that I'll uh put a link to a recipe I found but yeah air fryer apples lots of cinnamon and sugar and butter yum but you know I'm also I'm also a a a go-to person of uh simmer pots T the season for simmer pots you know take some cranberries some cut up apples some cut up oranges um some pine needles maybe put in some bay leaves little Anna stars and simmer that that's a really good magical on one level make your house smell good on another level thing for this time of year I love those but I don't know it's something about my brain I as soon as I start thinking about putting a simmer pot together I'm like well I could put a simmer pot together or I could make apple muffins or I could make cinnamon sugar apples in the air fry and my house will still smell delicious and like fall see I'm not a cooker so cooking never cross my mind because I'm not a cooker so once I get simmer pot in my mind that's it done deal I do love the simmer pots but yeah then I start thinking I'm like I could make some mold cider but yeah but you you're just you're just doing Food Magic that's all yep same thing I love that yeah simmer pot toss it in there put everything all together oh it smells so good and then you've got an offering to put outside absolutely one last thing is I noticed on the things that you gathered and the things that I gathered we both had different types of very thin and you even mentioned it when you texted me you're like aren't you the person who loves these birch bark rolls and yes yes I am which by the way I don't know what made me think that but I was like I'm pretty sure Lea loves birchbark rolls so I actually took a huge couple huge rolls and put them in ziplock bags and I'm bringing them to you I love you you're amazing that's fantastic who else can I bring tree bark to that's going to love it more than life itself for real no it's absolutely true I'll totally own that I am that friend yes it's me yeah I'm the friend you bring the weird too it's true it's true but I do love that bark any thin bark will do and I have some pine trees here that have super thin pretty bark I I'll give you some in exchange for your birch bark but I love those for spells they're absolutely phenomenal for spells bay leaves are you can write on Birch Bark because it's so you can yes you can and this other type of bark as well and it's super thin so once you've written on it you can then burn it in a candle if you have a safe burnd dis or in a fire it's organic so you can bury that spell in the yard so if you have a spell like your penny spell that you want to bury in the yard instead of burying the pennies you could write your spell on this and bury the bark and plus it's bigger shell in the past has lamented the fact that she can't write all the people she needs to curse on a bay leaf so small but birch bark you can have really long so I really really love all the things that I gathered I'm drying the be balm keeping the bark I'm keeping these things as components on my Altar and they I'll use in spells going forward so it's pretty nice to have it around I'm glad you've come up with a couple of ideas for folks I do hope that you guys find some of these something that you can go and actually try on your own and and find use and magic in them but if nothing else enjoy the balance enjoy the harmony
