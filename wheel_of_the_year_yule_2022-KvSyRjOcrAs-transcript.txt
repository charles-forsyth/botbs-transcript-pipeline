it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi and welcome to a special wheel of the Year episode of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast we talk about the pagan holidays the eight High holidays in the wheel of the year and we are now to our final our last tick in the wheel that's right for us we started at imul and so our year ends at the regular calendar year in December on Ule and so that'll be our final one and we will have done every single one of the Pagan High holidays in the wheel of the year that's fabulous first of all Kudos that that here we are a whole calendar wheel away and and and and we're still here and people are still listening and that's awesome that was my co- host shell I'm Leila and here we are on our special winter solstice Ule episode of the stoned Witches Hour so welcome everybody and uh Happy Ule is the season I love it this is one of my favorite Seasons because like so many other holidays this Festival of Lights is celebrated by so many different cultures and people and religions and I mean you've got Quanza you have Hanukkah which started on Monday the 19th all these different festivals of light what did we say last episode Hana chrisma they used to call it christmaa Chris mwansa does that but that doesn't have Ule or the solstice in there anywhere it doesn't you can only you can only fit so many holidays in one word that's true that's true and you know you will in the winter solstice usually get kind of kicked to the side when people talk about the different holidays this time of year but we are certainly going talk about that though we're gonna talk about that because you know what you say that and you say that with almost a little salty tone in your voice but I'm G to show you how Ule is still intricated in every tradition out there to this day because I've been taking notice of them lately it's been like some weird thing that's been like every time I hear a Christmas song or something of that nature I'm like huh huh where'd you get that oh that makes sense so yeah we're to point out some of the similarities and some of the U tide Traditions that are still in place today and there's so so so many of them I think Christmas is the one typically Christian holiday that I have Incorporated in as a secular holiday in my life because it is already so Pagan I didn't really have to change anything to keep it with my Solstice Traditions same and I think we will actually touch a little bit on how we have kind of melded them into to I don't want to say one per se but how we both incorporate both of those aspects in our life and can still sleep at night I love that I love that well because there are people and you know that we've been criticized here and there and everywhere well how can you be a witch and celebrate Christmas we're gonna tell you how exactly let's start with Ule so Ule this year in 2022 takes place on Wednesday December 21st at 4:47 p.m. in the Northern Hemisphere as you know in the southern hemisphere they'll be celebrating the summer solstice so good on them ly can I just point out on a personal note that's also mine in my sweet Love's six year anniversary the winter solstice or the summer solstice the winter solstice December 21st reason we here that's right happy anniversary oh my gosh six years it was a magical day that is so magical I love that that what I recently learned the solstice comes from a Latin word Soul meaning the Sun and cyer which means to stand still because on the day of the solstice if you look at the sun it rises in the lowest part of the sky and then around noon it doesn't get very high and it you know hits at certain point in the sky and then for three days it stays in that same point in the sky so it almost seems like it stays still for three days that marks Ule which is which is you know we talked about at the summer solstice you know basically the exact opposite exactly so this is the shortest day it's the longest night and the shortest day of the year and so a lot of people especially prehistoric people they were looking for that sun to come back it's already been very dark and and very cold and very quiet and it's a little scary can I tell you something depressing sure on the winter solstice this year on December 21st here on the east coast of the United States the sun will set literally at 4:19 p.m. that's depressing like that's de I'm not like in in in my everyday life like I'm not out of work yet and the sun has set so when you spark your joint at 420 or your bull you're actually bringing back the light apparently because it's a minute later because yeah on the 21st it's it's 4:19 and I was kind of annoyed that it wasn't 420 but yeah but but 419 that's pretty early that's pretty early I don't like it it is and it it's but that's why we celebrate youo because we want the sun to come back we want the light to come back we're celebrating that even in the midst of all this Darkness There's Hope and there's light and the days will start to get lighter after this point and they'll add minute by minute the days will gradually grow lighter as we enter into the light half of the year and so there is joy and beauty and happiness in that even though it looks like we're in the middle of the dark part of the Year we're actually entering the light half yeah but that particular day I feel like I've been slighted on daylight oh yeah oh we all do there's that whole Seasonal effective disorder that's terrible take your vitamin D please and get outside as much as you can it's it's hard it's a hard time of year for a lot of people but I think right now what kind of I don't know I guess the best way to say pushes me through is that tie-in with the Christmas spirit yes I love that they have a very similar theme Christmas has the birth of the Son of God and pagans have the literal birth of the son in in the sky and uh the Sun God God we just mix and matched words it was just interpretation God of son son of God yeah it was just a mixup well little bit done intentionally to get those pagans who didn't really want to leave the old ways to come into the church a little more which is why they basically whole cloth stole every single tradition and put it right down on the Christmas holiday and Incorporated all all of them together maybe in a different podcast we'll talk about how there is actually um evidence of Jesus being born in March but different podcast different podcast we will focus on that one today but we're going to talk about some of those Traditions that are a big crossover between Ule the winter solstice and Christmas and the biggest one is your Christmas tree I was just gonna say my trees I have an addiction people some people several shell several do I actually I do this particular addiction does not have anything to do with tarot decks thank you okay this addiction has to do with I like ornaments and trees and you know I was actually reading on a a a Facebook group I'm a part of that's like this witchy wik Wiccan Pagan type Facebook group a baby witch had posted something that um this is basically their first Ule SL Christmas having come out to their family their friends whatever and welcome baby witch the story was they were very very torn because they felt that they were like almost no longer allowed to celebrate Christmas ah ha to that I say ha and ha again you know me I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what are you talking about here I is my fabulous outed self for a couple decades have had a history of putting up I don't know what was the most I put up 9 Christmas trees in my house 12 it was nine that I saw you you claim that there were 12 but I've only seen nine or 10 fully decorated head to toe ever since my children were born back in the in the 90s they have gotten one if not five or six new ornaments each and every Christmas one she says if or maybe five or six and um it got to the point where um for many many many years now my children have actually had their own Christmas trees because they have each have enough decorations to decorate a whole a six foot tree so each are those are those decorations still with you or now that they have moved out did they take those with them have you met me yeah I knew what the answer was gonna be so currently my daughter is borrowing her Christmas ornaments and I will show up for the Christmas celebrations with my son's ornaments that's so cool oh my goodness yeah I've seen those they'll all be coming back to Massachusetts with me with you yeah so anywh who um yes so I have this ornament thing and I don't think people realize I kind of look at decorating a tree as almost like a ritual in and of itself and and part of it goes towards those ornaments I still have ornaments myself not just my children but I have ornaments from my childhood I actually have ornaments um that I quote unquote inherited from that were from my father's childhood yeah when we had the flood back in 2006 one of the things that devastated me the most was the loss of all the historical uh Christmas decorations that I have and my mother brought me to tears the following Solstice when she brought out these brass ornaments that we had all been gifted when we were babies by her father that I had thought were Beyond repair and she had taken to a a jeweler who had meticulously cleaned and restored these fragile antique brass ornaments oh wow so I was she was able to salvage just a couple of them but that was one of the biggest losses was these family heirloom Solstice and Christmas ornaments but when you put these ornaments you know I got I got a kid that's 28 years old right now when she puts that baby's first Christmas ornament on from her first Christmas you know that's invoking something yes it is now I have ornaments that that my my grandparents have made for me grandparents had bought for me different friends and family had made for me that may or not that may not be among us anymore so it's almost like looking at your tree is like an altar of sorts they very well can be creating that altar of sorts it's almost like decorating the tree is like a rich ual in and of itself we are also people who each ornament has a a meaning and a history and some that we have created some that we have purchased but they all have some type of meaning and not to say that just a decorative tree is bad but in our house oh I have those too don't worry yeah we we bring in the green we because it's a it's a living thing and we alternate sometimes we have an actual living tree with roots that we go plant and sometimes we cut one down that IDE of going out to a farm and and cutting down a tree or or bringing in that green to the home is just it's so magical to bring that green that represents life even in the depths of winter into your home to kind of bring that representation of life and coming out of the dark and to have that there is who doesn't love that just the smell of it is fabulous I have a confession what's that and my confession is going to soothe the soul of witches near and far so we talk about all my trees first of all I want to be real with you people only one of them is real the rest are fake I who who the hell can get nine 10 12 real trees in their house so but I always have a real tree the main tree the present tree is a real tree last year I feel like I was on National Lampoon Christmas Vacation like we forgot the chainsaw the saw that we the Handa that we had might as well have been a butter knife there was yelling there was fighting adult children throw F bombs here and there it was it was a rough tree experience so my confession is this year we didn't let any of our adult children come with us first of all no kids keep it simple you're all adults go pick out your own tree we're picking out our tree without you this year kids picking it out without you and we did not cut it down we went to one of those precut I just handed the man Boy Scouts in the parking lot I gave the guy my money and took the tree and tied it to the roof of the car like I wasn't I wasn't up for cutting it down myself this year so I paid a nice group of folks to offer me the option to not cut it down it's gorgeous one of my favorite favorite memories I kind of translated into a current tradition when I was younger I had a lot of pagan Tendencies but I didn't know what being Pagan was and certainly my family was not about to indulge any of that you know weirdo crap so I went to a Methodist church and they had on Christmas Eve they would have a Christmas Eve service I looked forward to this every year I did too it was the best thing we would all go at midnight in the wee hours of night we would dress up bundle up go out in the cold to the church and as we went in everyone was all happy and kind of quiet and hushed and we all would get a big fat candle with a some type of collar around it so the wax wouldn't drip on your hand and we'd all go into the church and if if I was lucky I'd get to go sit up in the balcony and as I got older I used to sneak away and make sure I could do that the church would be packed because of course not many people would go on Sunday but everybody was there for the holiday you know your Christmas and Easter Christians right so we'd go in and get up in the balcony and they'd start the service the church would be kind of dark and then they'd have these choir boys or girls go down the aisles with a with a big tall lighted stick and they would light the candle of each person at the end of the row and then that person would light the next candle next to them and then you'd light and so the light would kind of go down the row each person adding the light that's cool and from the balcony you would watch this kind of dark Sanctuary start to Glow with hundreds of candl Lights from everyone and then they'd start to saying Christmas hymns and Christmas carols and if I didn't feel the Christmas spirit so big right there and so powerfully the memory of it still stir me today now my mother became Catholic at one point in my childhood and we kind of had a similar thing going on we would go to midnight mass um this was actually at a Catholic church but we lived about a block and a half down the street from the church and what the what the church would do and like I have similar memories you know the church and the candles beautiful stuff but what really is still ingrained in me is because I only lived about a block and a half away we would walk to midnight mass and what the church would do you know like a a a brown paper lunch bag yes they had white ones and that whole block and a half from about my house to the church they would have these white bags all along the sidewalk with candles in them as like a light luminaries about 11:15 you know she'd Wrangle us kids up off we'd go down to midnight mass and like just walking down the street that block and a half for a kid be in the middle of the night I mean it was it was you know midnight mass just gentle snow falling a candlelit path all the way to church there was something in the air I agree you could feel that peace on Earth that moment of peace on Earth and that all you had to do was get through church and then Santa was coming that's so true but that that feeling just blanketed you in joy and peace and and Goodwill towards all and I I love that feeling and I want to recreate that in my winter solstice celebrations and so candles feature very very prominently in my home on that day I mean who doesn't love candles anyway right but the whole idea of bringing back the light into your home is a big one and so one way that I create that is you know when we're doing our Ule ritual we'll make sure that every light in the house is off and we'll have some candles right there and we'll go through and make sure all the lights are off except for the one where we're doing ritual and then just before ritual we'll turn that light off and we'll start ritual in darkness and kind of really move through that because being in darkness is difficult for people we don't like to be in total darkness we don't like to be in total silence so that can be a difficult space for people and then when we light that first candle the the warmth and the the glow and that feeling of joy is just palpable and we light as we light more candles throughout the ritual space and then bring that throughout the whole house ritually to kind of grow that light within the house it's just such a feeling of joy and happiness and belonging I I just love bringing that into a home for the solstice you know what they used to do 100 plus years ago obviously do not do this now this is dangerous do not do this listeners I'm taking notes sh go for it back in the day like you know how we use I love lights I love freaking Christmas lights like I have trees that are multicolor I have trees that are solid blue solid red solid white like I I do this I do this up ma'am back in the day they didn't have Christmas lights they used candles they would put candles on the tree and as they were having their Christmas Eve celebrations they would light the candles on the tree and illuminate that tree do not do that that is so dous but but no that's what they did they would they would illuminate the tree with candles and that was their symbolism which now in the in the 20th century 21st century we've translated that to our LED lights yes make sure use lots of LEDs use safe candles in other places not on your tree speaking of that i' I've read that a lot of times they would do that Outdoors as well sometimes decorating an outdoor tree was something that people would do that's something that our family has done occasionally not very often but particularly when my kids were little one of the things they would love to do is we would either take our Christmas tree when it was done we would take it out to a spot in the woods where we would kind of let it cure before we'd use it for firewood that type of stuff but we would put bird seed and different ornaments on it there and we have also decorated a tree with bird seed and sew ornaments on Solstice um and an easy way to do that shell here's my hack because I don't know if you've ever made SE bird ornaments like peanut butter and SE it is the messiest it is the grossest it is the worst you know what I have done though what's that I've saved all of my holiday grease and then smeared it on the tree and then covered the the smeared grease with bird seed perfect and that's an easy way to do it but I have an even easier one for you if you're not going to make it yourself go go buy those sew cakes that you can get at the store like to put in bird feeders yeah I know what you're talking about lightly freeze them like don't freeze them solid but just freeze them a little bit and then cut those in half right down the middle so you have two thin pieces and then you can use cookie cutters to cut them into different shapes oh and make those and put put your little string on it like your cotton or your twine or whatever oh what a great idea and then put those outside on the tree any tree it doesn't have to be your Christmas tree it can just be some tree in your yard for the animals and the birds to eat so it looks like a cutout cookie that's right so it looks like a cutout cookie and it's something edible that you can make with your kids without making a huge sew it mess it's super here I am Lain bacon grease on a stump of a tree you're making cut out sew it well like I said it's it's cheap it's easy and it's something fun to do with kids and you can talk about the solstice and the animals and and the light coming back and kind of making this off ing to the land and to the Fay and to the animals that are in the area maybe the bigger issue is is is that my household eats too much bacony greasy products and lead them for Christmas maybe that's the real issue hey take your peanut butter jar that you just finished and you don't want to clean out pour your not hot but slightly warm bacon grease in there put in a bunch of bird seed and Shake It Up really good and then pour that stuff out and you basically you've got your sew right there and let it Harden yeah let it Harden and you've got it but yeah do the another thing to do to bring that that whole solstice idea of bringing back the light and and starting a new is to your simmer pots that you love to do you know use cloves cardamom Bay cinnamon rum lemonade you know all that type of stuff to to bring that that spice the new life the warmth back into your home I I definitely want to touch on the giftgiving piece of Ule SL Christmas oh I love this part there I know right there you know we we've talked about crampus um everybody knows Santa fat jolly red man that brings you presents on on Christmas if you've been good there are uh you know different versions of Santa the Old Norse St Nicholas you know and all that gifting children um I know some pagans uh say that Odin brings their children gifts instead of Santa correct correct or a cat that's gonna come eat you I don't know so get those new clothes kids you know everybody has a birthday and that's all fine and well but you know even if you even if you don't think that Jesus is the reason for the season which I personally do not so I'm with you on that what's wrong with with one time a year getting together with your friends and family and loved ones and giving them a gift that is for no other reason than just because it's not that oh it's your birthday I'm giving you a present or it's your anniversary I got to get you something you know it's I'm getting you a gift is a is a sign of love respect and appreciation and in this dark time of year when we all are kind of huddled inside and we're cold and people are having those warm dinners and those those Gatherings and get togethers and and kind of that hermitting of sorts what better time than I like a good present don't you like I love a good present I do and I also I'm one of those few people who loves to receive a good handmade present I I cherish that and if I can sometimes sometimes I prefer it exactly and for me the giving of present this time of year I never saw it as a a birthday quote unquote thing to me it was this is the time of year when we all have a little more time to work on projects you can do the crocheting or or make that project or the woodworking project you know whatever you happen to be good at beading leather work jewelry and so people would do their Hobbies more now because you can't get outside and play outside well and as you recall I've done some Nifty some Nifty Ule gifts in the past yes you have like that year I hand painted ornaments for everybody or the year I made bath remember those bath salts I made um I loved your bath salts so much I've spoken about them previously on this podcast I've made I remember I used to make individual incense Blends for each member of the coven yes we all had our own personal ones and I love those gifts I loved making them just as much and that's even I for me I thought was the better part exactly and so now what in the depths of winter what better time to celebrate the coming spring and the light coming back than by giving gifts of yourself gifts that you have made gifting your talents that's right gifting your time essentially is what's happened you care enough about this person to have spent a lot of time for them to make them something and time is something that we have a little bit more of I hope this dark part of the year so you know I would rather a handmade ornament or a handmade bath salt or an incent that was handmade as opposed to a Walmart gift card absolutely absolutely and I I love making things you know with friends also like Drying orange slices and making the really pretty Sun representation yeah decorations for a tree that is such a fun craft to do if you're into that kind of thing um oh oh here's a good one one that I've seen around a little bit for the last couple years was doing uh wishing pine cones have you ever seen a wishing pine cone no what's that this is where now what I would do with my kids is we would take some pine cones that we had found and some that we would fill with bird seed and sew it and peanut butter for the birds to hang as decorations and some we would set aside to make wishes on and what you do do is you take a little piece of paper and you write your wish and you roll it up and then you tuck it into the pine cone and you can either tie it with a little piece of string or you can drip some wax on it to make it stay inside the pine cone and you can do multiple wishes per pine cone if you'd like and then put some incense on it or put some herbs that kind of go along with your wish or that have to do with luck or or New Beginnings or good energy and then seal it with wax and then hang that on your tree to absorb good energy and to kind of bring those wishes to fruition and then on the New Year toss them in the fire to burn and to let those wishes kind of go into the air and to bring them to you in the new year inter like a little wishing pine cone spell that you can do to again do it before Solstice and before Christmas and then put it amongst your decorations to absorb all that good energy of your celebrations and then burn it in a fire to release it and to bring that energy back to you on the New Year speaking of fire so everybody has heard of a Ule log actually it's funny because my my very Irish Catholic mother-in-law has a Ule log we just don't we just don't tell her that's what it is one of the one of the Traditions that they just kind of stole whole cloth from paganism if you're unfamiliar if if you can picture in your head that maybe foot long log of birch usually with the white you know the white bark and then three candles sticking out of it so the deal with the Ule log that I just wanted to point out is that that is like one of the oldest uh Ule traditions and it was kind of Incorporated by the Christians partially because of the The Guiding beacons of Light which I would imagine are the candles but back in the old days what they would do is on Christmas day they would put the trunk of the tree their Christmas tree into the fireplace and that ulog would feed the fire through the 12 Days of Christmas which actually were Christmas day through the evening of uh January can't do the math in my head I think it's January 5th oh yeah that makes sense yeah that's an old Norse tradition and I I believe Ule comes from an old Norse word jul L Ule which was their name for this season and they legit would their U log was a Ule  tree yeah it was actually an entire tree but yeah so they would they would they would feed the fire with the tree from Christmas day through the evening of January 5th which was known as the 12th night and then they would take those ashes check this out they would take the ashes of the U logs and they would use those in their Gardens in the spring what a cool way to kind of incorporate everything and recycle and bring that energy right into your garden right so there you do see a lot of folks that that still will burn a traditional uh U log and their fireplace on Christmas Eve but there are some cultures and I love this who doesn't love cakes um some cultures took uog as a figurative not a literal and they have turned that into a logged shaped chocolate cake enjoyed as a Christmas dessert I was going to say that's my favorite U log is the edible one um and actually to me it looks like a big freaking chocolate roll it does and it is and it's delicious but it's fun I love the ones that particularly pagans make that are very very pretty it incorporates not just the log but usually Greenery to incorporate like the life when everything else is dead the red berries you know for the goddess and that life energy and then the candles for the bringing back the light so Pagan so  Pagan and I just love it it's beautiful but the edible version is just delicious delicious love delicious y I don't usually get them but they're a lot of fun and I do like them a lot well you know sometimes when you go to holiday parties people bring them and you know I'm like hey I'm so there chocolate Swiss roll cake yum I'm down I I've burned a Ule log but I've never burned an entire tree for Ule hey the north were pretty badass man they were pretty pretty big go big or go home yeah why not you know there is just there is a lot of crossover but I think that the biggest thing to remember is the spirit is what you put into it and yes there are people who do believe that Jesus is the reason for the season don't down those people that is their belief but our beliefs are so intertwined that you can be a a Christmas Pagan you can we celebrate a religious winter solstice and a secular Christmas correct I believe it was episode 46 I described our candle ritual that I created that Bridges the solstice to Christmas where we light a candle on Solstice and then one more each day until Christmas Eve and then we have four candles burning on that night and we have a different thing you know we talk about the Sun the moon the god the goddess uh each night to kind of why don't you put four candles on a u log we could we just never really did you know I don't know I was poor it was it was hard enough to get those four candles man do you know how expensive pillar candles are oh my God still are who you I had to scr couch change to get those man but they were important but you know I just think sometimes that people try to put too much into the commercials into the the Facebook groups into the news stories you know just be kind be nice light a couple candles appreciate the light coming back and I know people say this all the time but as my my kids are getting older I'm realizing more and more what they remember what I remember what we cherish are the Traditions that we made together they might not remember all the gifts there's one or two that of course they're going to remember that were very special but by far what they remember are the things we did together Y and and so if you can build Traditions whatever's fun to you whatever you like build Traditions around that and the people in your life will love that we love touchstones we like these things that invoke happy memories so you know whatever works for you I say go for it and I just really want to go to Stonehenge and see the sun on the solstice like you know how it like perfectly it perfectly shines through like I want to see that with my own eyes not online there is if you go to newrange which was like 400 years older than the Egyptian pyramids um in Ireland if you're able to go to newrange and on the day of the winter solstice the sunlight points through a specific little window in the back of that tomb and it floods the main chamber with light but only on the exact moment of the winter solstice and I have entered in the lottery I've been I've entered in the lottery a couple times and my husband has promised that if I ever win it we'll go but they have a lottery every year for people to be able to be in the Tomb at newrange on the solstice uh my husband was lucky enough to be on a trip to Ireland at one time and they simulated um he was in the Tomb at newrange and they shined a light through that that hole to kind of simulate it but he wasn't lucky enough to be there on the winter solstice interesting on our trip shell on our wonderful trip we will definitely go to newrange and we'll at least be outside on the winter solstice cheering on the lucky people that get to go right we'll add that to our itinerary for our ghosty fabulous amazing van life tour around Europe yeah our pipe dream right pipe dreams right right right but it is the winter solstice it is almost Christmas miracles Could Happen amazing things can happen right sh exactly and besides who wouldn't want you and I to be over don't ask I don't want to know right right there's probably governments plotting our banss currently as we speak they're like oh no those potheads don't let them anywhere near us uhuh them smoke too much we don't let him in that's right that's right oh my goodness all right well I have more presents to wrap I can't think of anything else are there any other memories or Traditions you want to go over sh so I want to talk about this really quick because this is a tradition that me and me and and and my sweet love have been trying to keep going and I curious I've got this like pagany wiy ulie song that I want you to add to your playlist and it's come here we come a Ling okay and you've heard the song you've heard the term you've heard wasling you've heard wasle yeah so wasle for a little Ule tied thing for folks wasle is actually a drink and I actually buy this every year um in December what the what the a wasle okay so it is called a winter wasle punch okay let me read this to you it is a festive blend of Apple cherry black currant and lemon juices infused with holiday spices and orange peel now it's like a like a like a juice okay so like a punch like a fruit punch but okay this is a personal opinion I'm sure everybody has their own opinion opinions are like you know what MH we only drink it hot oh we pour it in a pan heat it up on the stove and it's like you wouldn't drink hot chocolate cold right we don't drink L cold okay okay makes sense it's almost like you know how we we've in the past actually I did this the other day um you cut up apples cut up oranges and put cinnamon in a pot and just simmer it yeah that smell makes you think a wasel okay okay does it taste like that smell it does but again it's got the black currant and the Cherry as well in it so it's not just Apple orange and cinnamon you know sounds delicious little more to it but it is a Ule tied drink this is not something that you can obtain other times of the year unless you're making it yourself I don't I've never had that before anybody who's got a Trader Joe's in their vicinity you can get it at Trader Joe's actually what I buy it's a Trader Joe's brand oh so it's a boui holiday drink yeah but if you go back to old old time Christmas song je tide songs Christmas carols they talk about wasle and wasling like the song I suggested to you here we come I guess I never really thought about it yeah that figgy pudding bring us a figgy pudding that song never really thought about it when we were talking about the wasel thing we talked about figgy pudding and apparently he's familiar with figgy pudding and thinks it's good I don't know he is not is this a Massachusetts thing it's got to be I I guess in New York we know what figgy pudding is I thought it was pudding that was like fig flavored figgy pudding makes sense you know vanilla pudding I think that's probably what I thought it was too that's not what it is apparently not interesting okay we're going to have to look up some figgy pudding recipes here right but yeah wasle good stuff drink it hot I think the biggest thing is is this year somehow someway I'm going to try to incorp orate a ghost story other than Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol into my
