get the beauty of going to the PO box and being like  and then you have to watch me open it and I know how I am and if the situation were reversed I'd be like damn it I'm sorry I don't mind this part

not so greedy and immediately text you from the post office and they send you pictures of boxes and cards handmade cards we get seals on envelopes cool stickers  you guys have some of the most beautiful penmanship I have ever seen and I don't want to sound all I like shiny things but we get presents too and you know I don't hate that that is a lot of fun so we do get a few things now and

interrupting you and I've already open the first envelope what are who is it from now this one this personal know who they are cuz it's the coolest damn card ever has gorgeous it is Skull and a crow

haven't even opened it yet I swear sometimes I'm like a 10 year old  start a birthday cake on the front o my God this is fabulous so she says thank you for helping her get interested in Tarot let me tell you that's a rabbit hole that you won't be thanking me for Sue and I promise you she says that she doesn't have any problems so she doesn't know you know this is a good thing she does have any problems so she's not sure what to ask the cards there's always something to learn though right you don't have to have a problem sometimes I like to just see what comes up and just pull cars at the beginning of the day and just kind of you know see what they have to say doesn't have to necessarily be a question or problem I need solving sometimes it just is information or inside or you know something to think about for the day sometimes it's more about the message than asking a specific question and it definitely doesn't have to be a problem keep playing with them because that's the best best way okay  Middleton New Hampshire which actually isn't too far look at this freaking card look at them so I know you guys are killing me I wish I could give you all of the the Kudos I can I can

to love writing letters and a pen pal for the longest time actually she says she's been really into pain feeling and his met some really cool with she pen pals from all over that's awesome we're going to give a shout out to the global pen-friends is where she finds her pen pals she loves the podcast in our energy and she's been very spiritual working with guides and ancestors and manifesting and using oracle's for quite some time she loves working with crystals and she she says she wants to stay with Chi but she doesn't do spells and she doesn't know if she could count herself as a witch have to do spells to be a witch she likes to make intention candles me to that's not a spell it is and show release someone who she doesn't need  negativity by writing their name on a Bailey from burning it you're doing spells you're just thinking about it to her yeah you're modifying them to work for you in a way that works and doesn't bring on over well and that's that's perfect that's wonderful spell word that's exactly how you should be doing spell work now we're going to get to this piece in a minute but she wants to know if we have any simple low effort spells or maybe starter supposed to get in the swing of things we got to spell tonight they're going to talk about but right now she wants to do a freezer spell flying squirrels that been trying to dig into her house from stealing like that for the first time I'm paper you're just like Stags girls I'd be afraid first of all flying squirrels mention sleep and some shit dive-bombs on you but she's worried that she won't do it perfectly is there such a thing as  by the way don't know and I also am not entirely sure how well a freezer spell would work against the squirrel I'm a big believer that animals have their own magic and it doesn't exactly work like our Stars so doing magic against nature or a creature sometimes has unexpected results might not work the way you think it will she said anyway she loves the podcast

you're still it's a joke in my family that the women in my family trip over four leaf clovers and he was saying that that's not possible and as we were walking across this field and we were having the light-hearted argument I tripped over a four leaf clover soft bent down and picked it up and handed it to him and then continued with the argument as we walked across the field he couldn't move he was dumbfounded as John the floor and finally was like okay I guess you do trip over four leaf clovers and he was the first one to tell people about it after that it was so funny  I believed you and I saw

way like a light floral scent there's soy candles  and I was kind of frustrated at how long it burned because you have to burn the candle in order to get to the prize that's so not fair they burn so

to see the cards and things that you guys send me as well it's all good no worries and you know I just I don't want to negate all of the other male that  Scott we just we were going to do these tonight but every card every letter every package you guys don't even know I have some of our letters not just the ones I got for my birthday but some from you all and other times I have some right at my desk because they're so heartfelt and meaningful when I'm having a bad day I'll read through them I have a couple of them frame over on my work table because they're so beautiful the amazing things that you guys have fun and I really appreciate it I can't even begin to say how fun this is I don't even get to check the mail and I think this is amazingly fun and you know obviously you know this cuz I call you but you know I don't think the listeners realized that there has been times everybody has bad days everybody's life has been a shitshow in it and there's been times I've gone down and got in the mail and I've literally open the stuff in cried hell are we we started this  fun way for us to hang out but I think that we didn't realize the impact we were making an other people's lives and the mail kind of drives at home and yeah you guys much as we give you let me I just that's the best I can do the best words I can put to it you guys give us as much as we give you and we love you all thank you all so much we did talk a little bit so I'm just going to talk a little bit about a very simple spell that you can do and it's for your mailbox of all things we've talked in the past about protecting and Ward in your space and in the area around you I've warded Windows I've warded faucet I've warded televisions you know all the things the entryways into my dwelling and kind of sealed off my dwelling thought to kind of do that with your mailbox people are sending you mail they're sending you a package that they've touched the mail they have licked the damn stamp  I did just see that delivery guy who put the package in his mouth so you know you never know where these things have been so yes and you're getting mail from someone if you're getting maybe a bit even if they send you just some type of advertisement maybe they were having a bad day maybe they don't like their job maybe they don't like anyone that they have to send mail to and that negative energy you know maybe your great Aunt Sally likes to send you crap all the time and you just don't need that negativity in your life there are a couple different things that you can do to protect your mailbox so even if they send you some snail mail that happens to have some dripping nasty on it it's going to get cleanse before it even comes in your house good idea because you know in this day and age you never know who's going to send why and some people are just negative Nellies and that's their personality and you don't need that loose enough  and so what I would recommend is you don't want to like put too much in your mailbox cuz first of all maybe you have a PO Box like we do or you know maybe you share a mailbox and I also think it's kind of illegal in some states to a with mailboxes or put things in there so we don't want to mess around with any kind of law like that would be super thrilled with me going in burning a hole in the side the PO Box mailman opens the mailbox to put peppermint they probably wouldn't be terribly surprised would not be the first one so what I recommend mostly is oils I like oils for this in particular the other fun thing is if you have your own mailbox like I happen to have a mailbox across the street and  plant flowers around it and I think it looks really pretty and it's a very stealthy way to protect your mailbox and you know kind of fit in with your super country neighbors but you can plant mint or hyacinths our daffodils are all plants that have protective qualities and you can just plant those around the base of your mailbox if you're so lucky to have that out there and with the intention of cleansing any mail that comes into that space and then the second part or the first part if you don't have a place to plant anything is the oils you can take a little bit of salt very very fine salt crush it up all nice and fine and then oil like rosemary oil cuz you know we know Rosemary is great for protection and it's the Swiss army knife of herbs and just concentrate on protection and then his wife that around the rim of your mailbox and just refresh that on the first of the month when you do your cinnamon spell or every full moon or whenever you remember or in the case of our PO Box I took a little bit of oil dripping sand just drew a Sigil on the door another perfect way to do it  anytime if you send anything to say to us or anyone who has a mailbox that has a Sigil or is protected like that any good energy get straight through and any negative energy gets immediately grounded immediately in the Gated post office box it's kind of short notice well I think anybody would sending mail to a which is pretty sure that that's probably one of the things that's going on there you don't want to send anything that would just be silly but so yeah so you can do that and my favorite of course is the planting the flowers around the bottom because it looks pretty and it's super stealthy way to have something physical bear to enhance your protection spell but if you can't there are other options  PO Box you can just every once in awhile draw so you'll write on it or run it around the entrance to the mailbox do a quick counterclockwise to banish and then clockwise to steal and you're good to go and the person who sent us inside you know what if I do it wrong what if it's not perfect something like this again you said I had to do a banishing line and I did a regular one oh my God now what what was your intention cuz that's the one in my opinion who cares if you did it frontwards backwards upside-down tension is what my question will be in if your intention is for that protection and in such then that's going to be what you get out of it and I'm going to add to that and stay with your intention start your spell it home say we're going to let's go with this mailbox spell say that you're going to do this mailbox. And you're worried about doing it wrong you've already done an excellent spell work with a candle in a bay leaf we can keep it just that some  at home you can take your oil and your salt and if you have a mortar and pestle or if you have some way to grind that salt fine as you're grinding the salt just ask the salt to help you like she'll said it's your intentions it's Basalt intention to be cleansing and to be protective so just ask it to lens those abilities as you're grinding it all nice and fine same thing with the rosemary oil Rosemary is good for so many different things just ask it to be your protection and cleansing in this particular case as you mix it with the salt and then bring it to your mailbox and then apply it and if you're worried that you applied it wrong take yourself back to Shell said your intention just relax and remember maybe a chance maybe you have a word maybe you text two or three words to remember safety protection cleansing so if you worry that you're doing it wrong you can fall right back on those three key words safety protection cleansing  just allow those ingredients that you have chosen and the words that you have chosen to assist you and to lend their energy to your working into your intention and you're not going to go wrong with that and if you're doing this in a post office like playlist subduing a post office box or something about them watching you on camera I do this I promise you the federal government and I even got a blank twice at you rub an oil on your box  I'm leaving that in so  fearlessness Leyland shall really 12 year old boys  so take your spell oil and apply it to your post office container okay yeah so why I should fly into the container and you're good to go again if you are worried that people are watching you just don't have to be like super fancy about it she'll said she put a sign on the door it just takes a second to draw a star or to draw sujal on the door and the oil and nobody's going to care you know we tend to smoke a little bit too much prior and it's called opal and it's 30% THC speaking my language it's delicious it's very very tasty. I love it so that might be why  I found your box so amusing now real quick because you know I can't have you shared not me I am smoking what's called ozone and the you know you're going to be mad at me but I can't think of what it is but the flavor is banana know I like to pick up my alley but for some reason the stuff just makes me laugh, but I think with that I think we both need to go we need to smoke a little more have a little more tea and maybe go cleanse our box  sending in the email and if you're having trouble finding the show notes just click on any episode and the description where it says what we're going to talk about any episode at the bottom of that you'll find our website you'll find our email address to find how to donate to the show and usually that's where I put any links or any interesting information are so if I say you can find it in the show notes it's the show description at the bottom and if you can't just bombard Layla with email because that makes one more time if you want to send us stuff to make my day back on the broomstick PO Box 106 Salem Mass 01970 I love going to the box and wrapping it with you just need to keep your box with qi  thank you for listening this far as we've gotten very very silly again we very much appreciate all your letters send them to your email. We will see you on Friday and I hope you have your own Solarium to hang out and have a little tea have something a little green and herbal to smoke and stay wise and keep your box witchy people
