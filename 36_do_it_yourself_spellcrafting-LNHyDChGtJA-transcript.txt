welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I'm shell and today we've got a try it episode we haven't done a try it episode in so long I'm excited because that is all a part of getting back on the broomstick that's very true and this time we decided we were going to try our hand at taking a ritual and rewriting it to be a little more personal to work better for us I feel like that is a Hot Topic right now so as much as you and I have had experience with writing our own rituals and writing our own spells or adapting rituals and spells that we have found elsewhere I really wanted to kind of talk to our listeners today about how we do this because it is a Hot Topic right now and we want you to try it literally the best way to get good at Magic is to do it there is only so much that reading books or listening to podcasts or finding information online can do for you unless you get yourself messy and jump right into the magic it's not going to really be real for you I think the most important thing and I want to put this out there right now right from the get-go because you know I am such a  on a find out girl but honestly you can't really do it wrong as long as your intention is there like you can't do it wrong like you can't that's very true and I know a lot of times it probably gets very frustrating especially for newbie witches to hear just do it how you feel just do what feels right your intention is always right because that sounds great if you don't know what you're doing you're like well what the hell does that mean exactly exact that can be very frustrating to a newbie because they just want a set of instructions and honestly you can find in pretty much any book you pick up or any website you go to or even podcasts you can find spells and rituals that people talk about but what really need to do is make it personal for you you need to kind of be able to what did we say when we were kids take the best and leave the rest these books are great I I I love books we've been we've been reading books on witchcraft for 30 years and I love them and I still buy them but you get this great ritual or this great spell and you're reading what someone else put into it and what their intention was now you can take the base of it and the body of it and just personalize it that's all just personalize it yes and really what shell is saying is take your book look up a spell today we're going to be talking about home protection spells and how to Ward your house cleanse guard Ward your house a home protection spell and say you don't have some of the ingredients that are in it or or say that it doesn't fit the shape of your house or the idea that you want you can really rewrite those parts to work with what you have or more importantly and don't forget this piece Ila is there might be some of you guys that are also in the broom closet and you can't do some of these things as written or maybe here's another thing maybe you got beautiful kitties which Lea and I are cat lovers just saying and you don't really want to be like throwing cinnamon all over your floors because you don't want to harm your kitty kitties so we want to try to give you ways to alter things that suit your situation and your need and your intention and your want and that's where what shell says about what works for you really comes into play because magic is about your belief system what your magical brain finds magical what your magical brain makes all the little hairs on your arms stand up and gets you all excited and happy and you can kind of feel that Rush of magic that's going to be different for each person you know some people really love cinnamon for protection or money spells other people can't stand it and prefer to use rosemary or baay or blue lotus or something else and that's fine it's just like shell says it's really what works for you and you're never going to know that unless you get in and try it yourself can I just give you a really like quick aside and it's relevant it's not that I'm not veering off of course it's relevant okay I'll allow it okay well thank you so you know sometimes you can over Sage you know there comes a point where it's like gez I have oh we've been there we've gotten out of your apartment because we've over saged we actually were the things we were saging out at points that's right there are times when instead of using Sage to cleanse I actually use nag Champa why I don't know because I wna it's my favorite but because that's my intention it works for me now it might not work for you if that's not your intention but I have made nagchampa a cleansing thing in my life and you know you may read a book definition that tells you otherwise but in my magical life it does and the reason that works is because smoke cleansing is such a big thing in so many different cultures and religions and practices absolutely doesn't have to be Sage any kind of smoke and then your brain can take it one step further from smoke to steam you could do a a steam cleansing or you could go even further from smoke to steam to sound your limit is your imagination and your own magical brain and the connections that you make between things if smoke is used to cleanse something because it can permeate everything and get into all those nooks and crannies and then carry out the negative and allow good things to come in what else can do that you just have to kind of then go to the next thing that's similar that works better for you and I mean that was just you know just some random example I had but it's so relevant it's it's very relevant to taking a concept and making it your own that's what we're we're talking about you know I tend to I don't want to say be a little more Loosey Goosey but you've always been a little bit more formal than I you know I'll just do things like if if if I want to Ward stuff off it's just a matter of burning something whatever I got if I only got raspberry leaves on hand guess what's getting burned raspberry Le okay because you know you gotta go with what you got and there's been times in my life where I couldn't buy all the fancy herbs and you know even if they were just grocery store herbs I I still at one point or another might not have been able to get them and you just go with what you got and there's also been times where I've had to cleanse with a black candle because you know why that's what I had and people are like oh my God you did what yeah I did fight me I don't know a candle is a candle is a candle and the color is only as important as it needs to be for you so again that applies to a lot of things that say you're in a place where you can't burn incense you can't burn anything right when I was in college living in a dorm incense was a no no but you could use one of those oil warmers right and that's very in the broom closet no one's going to suspect you're a witch if you've got your wax melts going all day long but what you're really doing is cleansing your space and there's also battery operated candles even though it's battery operated candle it's all about the intent not whether you actually light it or not for some people like for myself battery operated candles don't do it for me if I can't burn a candle I will use something else for fire I'll use a red stone or I'll have a red flower there instead of a candle if for me battery operated don't do it but for someone else that glow that light might be exactly what they need now folks I'm gonna let you in on a little secret here Lea is forgetting a little piece of her past right about now because I recall a ritual that we did where we couldn't have a fire or didn't have a fire or it was raining I don't remember the circumstances but we used a glow stick we used a glow stick and you were just in as much into it as you always are we were camping it was the woods a glow stick was perfect still a glow stick that's all I'm saying oh absolutely there's a time and a place but on my altar if I can't burn a candle rather than put a battery oped operated candle light I might use a red rose or something else to represent that just because for my magical brain that doesn't work now to kind of circle back to our our home protection thing here I've read a lot of stuff online where you know step one you must cast a circle step two you must call the quarters and invoke deity have you ever seen me I know you have because you've shown up at my house mid doing it where I'm running around in Minnie Mouse pajamas with a broom flying the broom in the air going this better get out of my house get out cuz I say so like I done that and it's worked works great you know the neighbors think you're a little loopy but you know whatever but you know that negative energy got the out of your house though and it did and you know I'm not saying there isn't a time and place for that full on absolute High magic stuff and and and I get it and I and I love it I do but you know when when you're doing two kids as a single parent sometimes you're just running around the house flailing a broom in the air because that's all you got time for and as long as the intention is there it's just as effective if I would have sat there and done some high Magic Ritual absolutely in my opinion that's what we used to call Kitchen Magic basically magic that people could do out of their kitchen easy peasy just with whatever you have on hand you just do it as opposed to higher magic or ritual magic which we will also talk about and the reasons why I think High magic has a place especially for a beginner witch I have actually done a ritual where I've used Italian seasoning as my incense because that's where I was at in my life darn it but in my mind it was like basil and it worked smoke is smoke man smoke is smoke now what would you give as a suggestion you know I'm kind of rambling on about the the willy-nilly stuff but what would you give as a suggestion as far is rewriting a formal ritual because a lot of the the kitchen witch stuff or what we've called kitchen witch kind of the hodgepodge put it all together throw it all together stuff I find that easier sometimes than personalizing or recreating uh serious fullon ritual like the whole cast and circle quarters de the whole kitten Kaboodle I think and I might lose some people here because I know that folk magic and witchery and easier magic is a little bit is very popular right now and I love it absolutely love it and I I also tend to I like to call it everyday magic everyday magic that's mostly what I do however High magic and ritual magic has a place especially for a magical brain and don't let shell fool you we used to do very well written out annotated quarter calls deity calls you know energy raising we had the framework of every ritual written out and there was a reason the reason for the framework is because our brains like ritual and routine and that becomes magical and in and of itself the reason that shell can run around her apartment waving a broom over her head throwing an Italian seasoning at things is because she has done these other rituals right and trained her brain into magical Pathways for example say um I just heard a speaker just recently talk about being at festivals and she said that she always loves being a speaker at festivals and I know you and I have done this show where you you're telling the group in front of you okay we're going to talk about X Y and Z magical thing and first we're going to talk about grounding and you can see some people in the crowd kind of shift a little and they're grounded you can almost see them go from mundane space to being grounded and ready for whatever they didn't need to do anything and and that's because they have made those neural Pathways in their brain right that they can do those things without even having to do the ceremony around it but because they did the ceremony so many times beforehand it's now second nature you're you're right and I guess I forgot that piece that I do kind of have that trained brain so definitely there is something to be said for that ritualistic and and I absolutely still love it as much as I loved it back then I don't do it as much as I did it back then but I love it just the same but I I feel for everyday daytoday stuff the kitchen witch is yeah and the the everyday hodgepodge too is more full of ritual and ceremony than you might think like every morning when you get up do you have a cup of tea yep that's a ritual every morning if you get up and do the same thing if if you get up every morning and make a cup of tea and write in your Journal that becomes a ritual and if you create that space to be a peaceful tranquil getting ready for the day space if you make the same type of tea you can put yourself back into that situation that same state of mind just by recalling that ritual that tradition because you've done it so many times in another easier one you know maybe you're not a tea drinker boo to you or maybe you're one of those people that which I love you if you are that you wake up with enough time to do what you got to do and get out sleep is precious folks remember that time we had a conversation where I told you I never really meditated yes I figured out that I'm full of crap and that I do and Lila wins I know Mark this moment I never win okay keep going shower what do I do every day after I get up I take a shower and and I've consciously started to realize that I've done this and and that whole meditation episode we did actually Spar me keeping track of this yay I do utilize the shower for like that meditative kind of cleanse you like just kind of get everything washed away not not physically dirt well yeah physically dirt obviously I'm in the shower but that cleansing me to go out and deal with the people of the world for the day that sometimes especially if you are a parent you know I'm preaching to you sometimes that time in the shower is your one minute of Peace your one minute of alone time and the shower can do wonders for you mentally I mean obviously you're going to come out clean but you can come out in a better mental spot from a shower turn your shower into a ritual what the hell you're in there anyway anything that you do repetitively helps to make those neural Pathways and so that's why for me full rituals where I know I don't need to draw a circle I don't need to acknowledge the quarters or deity but because it's something that we have done for so long it's very soothing to me it immediately puts me into magical space I feel like I have shifted from the mundane world to the magical world when I start to do these old familiar patterns okay but riddle me this Batman so you're reading an awesome Book Like O say Jamie Del's a box of magic just saying and you find this great ritual let's say for example you see quter calls okay you know you're calling East to the powers of the East to the air to the blah blah blah whatever you're gonna say and you look at that in the book and you're like you know that sounds pretty poetic and I kind of like that but what would your first suggestion be to our listeners on how to take that statement out of the book and maybe change it into your own because I think what people misconceive is that you see these quarter calls you see these rituals you have to cast the circle and say this chant no you do not first of all no you do not and second of all if you want to make up your own chant while you do it right rock on with your bad self you don't have to read it what was out of the book but if they like what is in the book and want to alter it what is your suggestion my suggestion is to take your Journal because you know I love a journal you are a journaler from way back I am take your journal and write down the parts that you do like write down what you want and then write down what you want to change and then look up correspondences and see what resonates with you especially when it comes to writing quarter calls you should take notes I mean this doesn't sound very sexy or fun but just write down the things that work for you write down the correspondences and if you've been keeping a journal you'll know some things that you have used in the past because you got to try this stuff or you'll know and that's really what a lot of this is is try it and you know if you are all by yourself and you are a solitary witch and and you're going it alone some of this may seem intimidating because you really don't have anyone to Bounce It Off but you do have people to bounce it off you have the spirits of Earth and air and fire and water and in the God and the goddess and I'll tell you what if it works you're gonna know and if it doesn't work you're gonna know you know when when you are sitting there and and you're doing the solitary stuff just remember you're not really alone and there's so much information out there for our home protection spell look up one a book look up three online you know if you're lucky enough to know someone ask someone else what their favorite things to use for home protection are and then combine the ones that resonate with you can I tell you I'm I'm G to share my secret recipe for home protection this is Shell's secret home protection spell okay don't tell anyone I won't okay I have a bunch of like freestanding mirrors like not necessarily ones that are like on the wall like on a nail on the wall they're like more freestanding okay so with that in mind now listeners don't tell anybody because this is our secret because this is a super secret protection spell I turn all the mirrors facing out so like facing the wall as if they were facing outside to the outer greater world and I honestly say I'm rubber your glue what bounces off me sticks on you you know you said you did that and it's very effective you're you know like this this like you don't have to have like some nine line poem I mean you can and there you know if that's if that's what works for you then damn it do it because you got to do what works for you but for me I'm rubber your glue man probably one of the biggest things to keep in mind is that there are distinct parts to a spell no matter how it's written whether it's a very simple spell to your most elaborate spell there are things about all of them that are the same intention is the biggest thing in my opinion what is your intent what is your intent first of all you have to know what do you want to do what energy are you trying to attract or put out there in this case we're talking about home protection so we already know our idea our intent is to protect our home then after that you need to raise energy for that spell so you've stated your intention now you have to raise energy to give impetus to give momentum to give Force to that spell and that can be I mean you can do that in in a number of different ways I I've done it making incense and have that be the buildup everything I add adds you know that more more more more yeah and then you light it you know so so sometimes even just that you can kind of build that momentum y you can do it by chanting you can do it by lighting a candle and pushing energy into that you can do it by running around by skipping by dancing by drumming by listening to music there's a lot of ways to to raise that energy the next step is to send that spell out with the energy that you have raised push it out to whatever the universe the Earth the person your deity wherever you're putting that energy put it out there and that's it those are the three parts of a spell are there things that you should do before and after maybe I always think you should be thankful at the end being thankful it's polite yep I agree you ask for something you should say thank you so those are really the only things you need to do in a spell have an intent raise the energy send it off that's it that's all you got to do everything else is dressing including the exact words you use and and I think that's where people get caught up they think I have to say it the exact same way Leila said it or ain't gonna work no no yeah this isn't Hogwarts you don't have to say levosa instead of levosa potato potato unless you're doing certain types of magic enoan magic theic magic there are types of magic where that matters or if you're in certain Traditions correct but if you're doing a spell for yourself it can follow whatever form you like so we've named the three components of a spell intent raise energy send it off that's pretty much what shell does she has an intent she raises that energy and she puts it off in what works for her in the easiest most aand way possible but then on the flip side with the ritual aspect you know there are certain things that kind of follow a certain order you know you are going to cast a circle however you choose to do that rock on not everyone cast a circle that's a Wiccan thing it's a magic thing I hear a lot of practitioners today a lot of witches hate the idea even of casting a circle oh really oh my God that's a whole another podcast I need to hear a whole another podcast however there is a little bit of a misconception out there I hear a lot of people talking about the high magic and Alistar Crowley's reasons for drawing a circle and his idea his high magic talks about summoning entities and so they would cast a circle around themselves to be a protective barrier between themselves and the entities that they are calling that's not what most witches do um myself as a witch in the tradition that shell and I came up in casting a circle was meant to be a place not a place and a time not a time it was basically meant to be a sacred place to acknowledge to your primitive your magical brain that you are no longer in mundania mundane space you are now in magical space where magical working is happening and the reason you do that is to help shift your subconscious shift your magical brain into magical space and and honestly you know you hit this before but I want to reiterate this we did that a lot in the past and if I didn't have that I wouldn't be able to just be all willy-nilly like I am now I believe it it was that core knowledge that core base knowledge of deep serious ritual work that has made it possible in my opinion for me to just run around the house flail in a broomstick like a crazy woman in your own practice find what works for you like for shell and I drawing a circle or or putting a bubble of protection around ourselves is something that we have done a lot and it becomes easier to do instead of having to draw it physically like for our home protection spell I like to take crushed up eggshells because you know salt So Yesterday take crushed up egg eggshells and I physically make a circle around my house and as I'm physically making the circle I am magically and energetically projecting that sphere of of protection around my entire property as a bubble of protection and having the physical barrier helps to make my brain helps that visualization yeah and it helps the magic flow but I think really the most important thing that that people should take away from this episode is it sounds cliche and I know it does but really there is no wrong way and take it from two people who've done it a whole ton of different ways Anything is Possible if your if your intent and your will is there and just keep practicing the rituals do one exactly as it is written because you're not going to really know what resonates with you and what works with you until you try it until you actually do it so do one or two the way that they're written there are a million in one freely available online grab one of your books try one of the ones that we've included in the show notes and and just try it as written if you're not comfortable writing your own and then just change one small thing maybe maybe you want to change the chant or maybe you want to change where the quarters are called or maybe you want a different deity than What that particular ritual written out suggests you know maybe you have found a patron deity and they want you to work with something completely different change that and don't be afraid to change it because this this is not this is not Hogwarts where a slight different inflection is going to completely change your spell like shell said if if your intent is to protect your home you pronounce a word wrong in your spell it's not going to not protect your home it's your intent will get through and if you do have a group that you work with or some friends that you gather with and and do witchy things with I mean how we started was we just all got together and hang out and just kind of started throwing out ideas until something came together half the fun was coming up with it and everyone contributed things that worked well for them and we tried different things each time we got together for ritual and that really gives you a basis you you really do have to try it with magic there's no sitting on the sidelines in Reading because you'll you'll never know what's going to you know make your heart all happy unless you do it unless you try it try try it gez it makes me want to go try another ritual we will put up on Facebook and Instagram a couple different home protection spells one a little more formal one a little more hodge podge kitchen witch but we want you to try it with a little bit of your own flare yeah we definitely want you to rearrange something pick a different color pick a different incense cast a circle if that's your choice or don't cast a circle if energetically that feels good to you you got to take what works for you and and definitely run with it because what works for Lea and I might not work for you what works for our situation might not work for your situation and again you know for for all of the in the closet in the broom closet which is out there you may have to take what we put out there and kind of totally redo it to something completely different maybe if if if we're all good I can poke Leila a little bit to maybe add a Sigil or two to the post that that we can add to as a protection thing oh that's a good idea the thing to keep in mind is that witchcraft is one of those things that is deceptively simple we're all the time saying it's your intent it's your intent it's your intent that's all you got to do and that's true but witchcraft is something you have to do and experience in order to progress in it you can read all the books in the world you kind of have to live it honestly you have to live it yeah you just have to try it you have to do it and write about it Journal about it or at least just pay attention to how you feel what works and what doesn't but you have to jump in and make mistakes and do things that work and do things that don't work or you'll never know so with that being said guys guys we're glad you listened to our episode today check out our socials because we're
