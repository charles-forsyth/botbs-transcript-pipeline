said we are here for elements we're going to talk about Elemental Magic now we're going to start with Earth and there was some little conversation about this I want to talk a little bit about why we're starting with worth I want the listeners to do with why why Earth is our starting point so for me I like Earth is a starting point it could be from all those chance 30 years ago  earth air fire water it just a good starting point but it's that grounding it's that centering piece that comes with the element of Earth that just seems to naturally be the first the first one for me how about you elements the elements of energy in itself has worked with by pagans and has been considered to be like a building block of magic and of the universe for literally thousands of years so that's why I wanted to start the idea of elements I want to start with it with where the idea of working with elemental energies came from and it's because in a lot of philosophies people thought that the building blocks of life itself or made up of four energy sometimes five fire water Earth and air are the elements that made up everything it was even written about by a philosopher is like Aristotle in Greece it's an Indian Hinduism it's in China a lot of these for  he's talked about the building blocks of life and in ancient Greece they had one of the first examples of the idea that everything is made up of the four elements plus sometime Spirit comes from a Greek philosopher named empedocles in the fifth century BCE and medically is refers to the elements as the for roots and he assigned of each of these routes to a god or goddess he says that Earth was aligned with Hera that are was aligned with the Zeus fire aligned with Adonis and water was probably a line to the goddess nests later Aristotle famous philosopher Aristotle comes in and suggests the Aether is The Fifth Element because the stars and the gods obviously have to be made up of something more special even more precious than the elements that humans are made up of so he had this idea of ether and other place is called that spirit  persol sometimes plasma now when witchcraft had its Big Revival in the 70s it came we came through Wicca and this was created by a lot of people Margaret Marie Gardner Aleister Crowley Doreen Valiente then we've got Raymond Buckland and Alice the Alexander Sanderson Sanders Alexander's Sanders Sanders the Sanderson sisters are the Hocus Pocus people not the people who created which no no no no Stewart Jennifer Laurie Cabot Starhawk Margo Adler Oberon Zell excetera excetera odd nauseam so when we learn witchcraft in the 80s it was still very very heavily influenced by Wicca and Wiccan was influenced by these philosophers and ideas that had come from even earlier that assigned these building blocks of life these four elements plus Spirit to the  East for air South Fire West for water and North first and then in the center would be spirit for deity and that's kind of what we learned in the 80s and 90s and in Wicca you started in the East and the reason for starting in the East was because of the Dawn that's where Beginnings are its are was associated with the elemental East and so communication and that's kind of what you doing going to spell a ritual as communication so when we kind of came up in witchcraft in the 80s and 90s that was the prevailing ideas start in the East because of new beginnings because of the Dawn I do like starting in the East because of that but a lot of the chance that I taught my children was earth air fire water not just because it Rhymes better with daughter but because our family and it's that foundation in the sad faces and I like starting in the North in particular working with energies it's good to start in the north because there's that ground  an element that sound Beach let you know and and people need that you need to have that grounding first so it feels very natural to start there and I didn't struggle because you're right you know those kind of push the start in the East thing and I am I such a non-conformist I couldn't conform to that cuz for me personally it never made sense so long to get along but in my personal practice it always was Earth first I understand what you're saying about the history in the philosophy of it all but when you break away all of that it just comes down to I just feel that  to start working with the other elements I need to be rooted in and to be rooted in you start with her starting in the East because of the Dawn makes perfect sense starting in the north because you need to start from a rooted base makes perfect sense you'd also make an argument to say that you want to start with fire because you want that activation energy you need that spark to start or you can say you want to start in the west because of that movement the subconscious the emotions need to get involved you can make an argument for any of those places to start I would say that most people probably start mostly in the North or the East because of the reasons we said East for new beginnings and are and North because that Foundation being rude definitely no rule book either moisture wicking  but also know your tradition the tradition that you're in right now is Celtic is Celtic based correct in that position they also starred in the north correct someone who starts on the North like me one of the fun things about Celtic Traditions is there one of the few that doesn't really do the five elements there more big i3's Council of things in threes are more about Earth's air water the land that are and the Sea that's what they're big on but they do have fire festivals they have like the big fire festivals and everything so they like to tell you that it's free but there's a fourth one that gets in there the fire all the time so the first thing we should maybe kind of delve into his why would you want to work with us and you know you really want to work with all of the elements but why Delphine to Earth again I go right back to that grounding that feeling of connectedness rootedness feet on the ground there's that big  sing lately about earthing or you no touch grass go outside and touch grass and there's a lot to be said for that because getting your hands in the dirt or getting your feet on the dirt can be very centering it can help you to feel very connected to the Earth to your body and that's what that energy feels like it feels like belonging like feeling strong in your stance and feeling centered and grounded in your place and people will talk about grounding is something that you should do before or after any type of energy work and actually touching the ground can help you do that right there's something that I've been hearing a lot lately called Forest therapy which by the way love the concept the idea is you can disconnect from The Real World hustle and bustle and you just go spend some time in the forest with that literal Earth surrounding you and I've heard that called Forest bathing same thing different you know differ  oops, different things but there is something to be said for that Earth Energy that called I feel like with Earth Energy there comes from ancient call if that makes sense you've got trees and in different things that have been literally alive for hundreds of years and you're just soaking in that energy there is a call than that and I think the reason I always liked starting with Earth as you start with that calm before you then Delvin first gives you that chance to shut away the real world hustle-bustle just like walking into a forest and Ice called forest and it almost has you in that prepared state of mind so then move forward with magical working or whatever the case may be grounding literally gives you a stable place to start from if your mind is too busy if you're busily feeling too drained grounding allows you to come to a center  it allows you to feel a connection to that agent nastu to that great mother that will take the excess energy in your brain and help you to route that down to the ground like talking to your mom and getting all of that stuff out so that you can have a calm clear mind and then if your body is tired it also allows you to pull energy from that Earth mother like getting a hug from your mom it just kind of revitalizes you physically so now you've come to us censors when he colibrium to a stable place where you can do that magic your brain is calm and quiet your body is active and energized but stable you're at you're at a center you're at a nice clean place to start working energy and you also have that connection open so if you need to draw more energy from the earth or be more stable on your feet while you're doing your energy working you have that line that link that connection open to use during your magical working and I think that you know it's it's also good to take note that maybe you are not in an area  you know that has a lot of open space or a forest to go walk in you know maybe you're living in the concrete jungle I have found that you do what you got to do in a pinch and sometimes dirt is dirt you know maybe you have a houseplant and you know you're living in the concrete jungle there's nowhere for you to really connect with nature in your location put your hand in the dirt in your house plant you know what have a moment with your plants and I know it's so weird for me to say but I'm actually starting to form a relationship with these plants I don't laugh at me you know if you don't have the opportunity for your quote-unquote outdoor Earth space you do have an ability to create indoor Earth space through things such as house plants and you don't have to connect with Dirk physically your body is Earth your physical body is a representation of Earth so even if you're just able to clap your hands tap on your thigh  tap your hand on your heart a little bit in a drum beat you are your body is physical Earth and you can connect to that deeper Earth energy through your body you can also do it through other stones or crystals that you have with the idea is to connect yourself to a greater power than you to this idea of stability of center of ancient knowledge of groundedness all the things that you would describe a large body of Earth as that's what this energy feels like it feels heavy it feels slow moving it feels very ancient and thick and protective and solid there's also an element of wisdom to be garnered from that as well so it's not just that feeling of groundedness centeredness that peace and calmness there's also that sense of gaining that ancient wisdom back up from the earth you know you kind of ground out  energy but what you're pulling back in includes some of that ancient wisdom that can only be garnered from the earth that you do and then you can say that about each element and we'll get into that as we go but four specifically you're also not only pulling up back that Earth Energy but you're pulling in some of that that Earth knowledge we've talked before about doctrine of signatures and like-for-like Magic the Earth contains our ancestors come from the earth and we return to the Earth it retains all of that knowledge think of archaeology we go down through the Earth and we learn about our history we learn about other people's and we learn about science and patterns that came before of the earth so knowledge deep knowledge ancestral knowledge is also part of that Earth Energy and if you can visualize yourself tapping into that you can draw that ancient knowledge into you while you're doing your workings as well and I think that that  sometimes a piece that's overlooked with the elements and with Elemental Magic because you know if especially like you said you know you're you're pulling that ancient knowledge up but I used I sometimes look at that as the one element where you can Garner that was dumb because with you know with are the wind blows it away with water it takes that away with the with fire it gets burned away but with it gets compacted into an ancient tomb so to say to hold on to it and Record Keeper of elements and sometimes it's the transformation and I'm going to take this isn't really a right turn it it just kind of a little sideways curve but the way you were talking about the Earth got me thinking of how sometimes people like to dispose of their spells or dispose of their ritual items you know if they've used it in a work or something  has a way to do that and it means something so if you're looking to transform something so say you do a spell to transform a relationship stay with a relative you wanted to be better and you make an eggshell jar and into that eggshell jar you put some seeds of new growth and you put some dirt and fertilizer to Foster change and to Foster growth and to Foster blossoming of Bright New Beginnings they put all these things into your eggshells spell and then you bury it and the reason you would bury that type of spell is because you want transformation the Earth is about keeping records yes but it also is a growth and transformation agent you know you didn't put things into the earth when you want them to change so by burying that type of spell your signaling to the magic that you want transformation growth and change from the spouse so it matches the element some kind of glad that you brought that up so you can work with Earth for that  so that's the way you can dispose of your spell is well by being respectful of the elements and by working with the nature of the element to achieve your spell goals into to think of something that might end up being a listener question okay so you know we're talkin about how you can you can gain some of that wisdom back from the earth pull in the energies of the earth and all of that that ancient wisdom so you got all these which is across the planet who are now disposing of spells and bearing it into the Earth I have a feeling people are going to ask us are you pulling in any energies that you don't want back from all of these disposed of spells into you into wow that's an interesting question I want to say no to me I was going to say I would say no because as much as it is a Record Keeper of sorts it's also the Earth is a cleanser  it's a Transformer so if you are concerned about pulling up those energies and in what residuals might be left over from other folks across the land I say no because I feel like that is cleansed by the Earth itself so any energies you are pulling up from Earth in the spirit of Earth are going to be pure Earth energies the only kavya I would add to that is working with Earth in general like show said absolutely 100% not going to be a problem you'll just be pulling up General Earth Mother Earth Energy if you're working with local land energy that can very much be contaminated based on what's going on in the area so you have to be a little cautious when you say you're tapping into local energies and that land has been polluted or that land has been overworked you're going to feel that energy when you work with it it will feel like it's sad or like it's crying out for help  where to go to a cemetery Layla you know you want to be cognizant of where you're doing this obviously Mother Earth energy is very different from local land spirits and local energy just as you wouldn't want to go to say toxically contaminated land and do such things you also wouldn't go dead ass in the middle of a cemetery are always in the spirit of your working General energy that's always going to be great she's got you no problem you're working with a collective whole the whole system but if you're working with your local land Spirits is going to very much reflect what that land is like and how that land feels I very much recommend hanging out in that space going for hikes walking in your local land definitely a way to connect with it and see how you feel how do you feel physically how do you feel mentally after you've done this walk how does it feel to you  and the more you can tap into that the more you can start to feel the energy surround you of that place and I I like that you say you know Go-Go feel your local energy because there's folks out there that they are just natural healers and maybe there is something that is arrived with your local land that you may be able to assist in healing that Land one of the best ways to connect with Earth energy is to volunteer to clean up a park if you live near a body of water sometimes still have cleanup so organized for the land Near That Water you can volunteer to clean up a hiking area or a trail near your home something like that where you can give back to the land and kind of feel that energy know I don't know if you remember those this was probably I don't know what she is like 25 years ago or so when our local Pig and Community back in Upstate New York remember we did the adopt-a-highway program  our designated stretch of highway which Community chores for several years kind of do an earth honoring was we can if you don't have this in your local area I'll just explain it really quick in New York there's a program called adopt-a-highway in different businesses and organizations and groups can quote unquote adopt a section of Highway and then that is your section to kind of keep clean and keep orderly for a designated amount of time and we would go out once a month and literally walk the sides of the highway with our little garbage Pickers in our garbage bags and we would clean the side of the road I think we have that adopt-a-highway for years doing something like that in your area is an excellent way to make an offering to Earth energy is by healing and cleaning the land locally any time that you  go out and work in your local area it's really great this time of year we just celebrated lughnasadh so working with us energy honoring tall to the goddess of agriculture the goddess to give her life to create agriculture right now there's a lot of farmers markets there's a lot of food around if you're lucky enough to be in one of the places that has access to local food so one of the things that you can do to connect more locally with your land and with the energies around you is to commit to just eating what's local to you like either in your your county or your state in the United States and also to eat only what's in seasoned you know you don't have to do this forever but pick up. Of time like 3 Days 7 Days 21 days if you're really feeling it I think Byron Ballard did it for a whole season where she took an oath to just eat Local Foods just what was local and seasonal in her area and it's not easy to do but it feels great connecting it if feels very healing to connect  Brandon that way if you're able to that's definitely something you can do it it also gives you the opportunity to connect with the Earth without all of the chemicals and yak yak that gets put into Foods it gets you kind of in that more natural space physically and out at serious Rising the festival we were just at not too long ago Rush with the Floor Center they do Elemental rituals for each element all five days they started with air air fire water Earth and spirit and for the Earth Day this year they planted a tree they're starting a whole Grove whole circle of trees and they started by planting the first one this year so obviously working with trees is an easy way to get in touch with Earth Energy and we have a lot of tree meditation that help you with grounding and with connecting service energy and I'll add a short grounding meditation at the end of this episode  plenty of time for planning at least in the United States of America we have a designated birthday and this has nothing to do with religion or spirituality it is a designated national day where we collectively try to come together to do things for the Earth and when you said plan to trade that's what what reminded me of it because there are a lot of opportunities on Earth Day to plant trees to connect with the Earth to do stuff to heal the earth I know here in America it's generally April 20th or thereabouts so if you want to do something for your community on Earth Day you got a few months to plan but I feel like sometimes it's hard for me to connect to certain elements depending on the seasons I do I feel like we're winding down my Earth time and I I like that you you brought up the Harvest Harvest  because I feel like by the time we reach that third Harvest now we just we just had our first harvest we got we got a few minutes but by the time we reach that third Harvest it's almost like putting her to bed for the winter you know what I'm saying especially here in the Northeast absolutely. For like October or March I feel like the Earth energies almost go dormant for me but I think it's just because of the location in the season is the elements where you're at because here in the Northeast the Earth does kind of go to sleep for a few months you can still honor that Earth Energy within yourself by going more within a little bit working internally working inside in your home on Hearth and Home activities cozy things indoors that you wouldn't necessarily do during the summer and that's still connecting with that Earth Energy just in a different way just like it's presenting  self differently and that matches to with say when I was living in California winter looked very very different in the high desert then it looks here in the Northeast it was a nicer time it was a time when I could get out and go hiking more because the sun wasn't trying to kill me so I could get how in touch the door a little bit better walk Barefoot a little more often and then when it did start to get colder that's when you go inside a little bit and start to work inside so follow the seasons where you're at and you can still honor those elements just buy kind of mirroring how they look in your area near the energy in your personal life and you know that that kind of brings me to another really good point I wanted to make is the elements are also Associated more often with Direction we've talked about air and Earth and I want to just briefly touch on the north south east west aspect of this so you know traditional  Earth is North followed by are in the East and so on but there is some folks who say that North is are in East is Earth I can't make sense of my head but I think that your presence in place can kind of dictate how you view that as well like you were saying a few episodes back in California you felt that the directions were a little skewed just based on how things fell due to your place and Russians and the correspondences come from traditional Wicca from Gardner and his co-opting of Western European paganism ideas or whole cloth creating whatever it was based on that land mass Western Europe so traditionally quote from the late 1800s traditionally the quarters are East  South Fire West Water North however where you live should definitely dictate High those elements are pulled so in California I did still follows that traditional directional thing because the water was west of me and it did feel very very good that the water was last or definitely went with that but particularly in California north of me I mean I could say North is Earth there were mountains north of me but there was also a lot of mountains east of me and a big land mass the entire United States stretched out east of where I lived on the coast of California so I could have tried they're doing East as Earth and North as air and it probably would have felt very good as long as I was feeling those elements sometimes when you do things out of habit it feels very strange change that habit but if you can get into the habit of feeling those energies and working with those energies it's a little bit easier because if you feel  East is Earth than the Habit is easier to break one thing I've learned in the last few years of living in Salem Salem Heights have a different view of of that a lot of folks here and not everybody I am not speaking for the masses by any means but I've had conversations with folks and there's a lot of people here North we've got a New Hampshire in the White Mountains totally makes sense South the south is just hot okay cuz we're in the north and it's cold in the South is hot so fire all the way but here they flip flop East and West because here the ocean is 4 ft to the east so here in this place east is giving off more of the what I would call West 5 and we get our weather systems coming from west to east here so more often than not we're getting that wind west to east so a lot of folks here the kind  swap out east and west with East being water and West being are against can't grasp that in my mind mental pathways through have it but also feeling energy and working with the idea of feeling that energy so some of the ways that you can feel our think of times when you really felt in your body like times maybe you overate or times when you just got finished doing some work or running a marathon you really feel all the muscles in your body think of a time when you are really sluggish and tired and moving every one of your bones you could feel that push and pull of your body because you were so tired that's that have these lower kind of energy of the earth think slow moving Boulders thank big rocks kind of sitting there and weathering nature think Mother Earth herself  only slowly changing through Ian you know you've got the spirit of these trees some of these trees especially when you're looking at those redwoods up in the Northwest hundreds of years it's taking these things to just slowly rise from the Earth Earth are slow moving their deep the roots of those trees go deep the roots of a mountain go deep they reach high into the sky they're big they take up space Earth is not dainty Earth is take up space and be here now but it's also that rooted deep below but still present up above yes yes all of that so a lot of these meditations and visualizations that your work with we'll talk about routes because it's it's a very easy visualization to get you connected to the Center of the Earth if you save route to anybody around the world  we all know what you mean if you say you are rooted in the earth that is a phrase that every single person if they've ever seen a plant will know what you mean so it's an easy concept to grasp so all of these medications especially the early ones will have Roots involved in it whether you're sitting on your butt here sitting in a Lotus position and you're talking about chakras your base chakra your Moola dhara chakra is right at the base of your spine when you're seated it's touching the Earth or when you're standing your feet are touching the Earth their Roots themselves they look like roofs themselves these types of medications are able to kind of get you grounded and feeling that earthy centeredness very easily magically Earth corresponds to things like the planet rocks and crystals dirt trees and two concepts like ancestors and time transformation her home family it's centeredness and even money instead  Intero Earth corresponds to Pensacola civic Lee and Pentacles will have a lot of that same Earth flavor the groundedness the family the centeredness so you can use these energies and these ideas in your magic if you need to slow down a little bit if you need to take stock of where you are if you need to be more centered in your life you can use these energies in your now there are some deity is also associated with Earth there are different. He's related to each element they are not pigeon-holed to that by any means but a couple of deities that you might be able to connect with and work with to kind of help you feel that that Earth Energy could include obviously Gaia but there's also the M Care New nose so these are deity energies that can also help you work with these element energies can connect you with these you know what I think of Gaia I think of guy  is a big pregnant woman in that pregnant belly is the earth a beautiful woman with a pregnant belly and you'll see that represented yeah that was created by Oberon Zell and that is a that's a beautiful representation of the Earth goddess and any Earth deity we've talked about talked to a few times because it sees lose Foster mother that created agriculture you have series you have Persephone and her mother's A M I think I care new newest slash green man has that horn stop that kind of makes me feel the Earth and I just got the green man and his face is made out of the leaves of the tree any horns God any of the Gods of the word any goddesses of the earth of the woods or they're all going to have to do with that Earth element as in like you said not everything  no trees are Earth and air I think you could even say that their water some people would even say their fire because there'd be consumed by fire nothing is really purely just one thing I do know Dee Dee is really truly just want to be with one and I love how you said a couple episodes ago that when you're working with herbs or something in particular you don't have to work with every single thing that that herb corresponds to the right now we're talkin about Earth so yes these Beauties correspond to lots of different things but right now we're telling Mother Earth how it relates to Earth yeah how are they is it relates to that particular energy and so when you pick up a crystal don't worry what kind of Crystal it is that Crystal was when I'm thinking I'll follow you know I want to work with Earth let me get a crystal I'm not like okay which one I'm like allright what's close to being Mas agus or nothing  crazy witch of the wood and I will go out and grabbed myself a stone from my driveway or cute little Pebble that caught my eye when I was on a hike does not have to be a pretty Crystal anything that has to do with the earth works all I can think about us last year when we went to Central New York but I remember when we were there last year and I think you and I left with like three pocket polls of acorns falling leaves are falling Branch here there I mean I am the witch that grabs some Fallen branches from the 200-plus old Willow Tree to make us magic wands with Tara Woods which we do this it's okay I also I'm a little more glitzy though sometimes I love my shiny things I really love my  so there is something to be said for swinging by your local metaphysical shop witchcraft shop Stone and Gem Faire whatever the case may be in picking up yourself some nice pretty shiny stones you haven't met a pagan Jeweler you haven't liked yet it's not a lie but it doesn't even have to be jewelry you know like just a chunk of quartz crystal and I just happen to grab it cuz it's closed but quartz crystal is always something that I'm thinking you know you hold that in your hand and you hold it tight and you got that energy just starts flowing through you but I say courts cuz I just grabbed it first but I can also grab you know garnet and feel the same exact way it's not about what type of stone it is because all of these stones are a part of the Earth have come from the earth no matter what their color their shape or what some book online or ticktok or tells you the correspondence  bottom line that came from the earth and if your intention is to work with the Earth Energy of it you're going to get Earth Energy flavored with whatever the energy of that Crystal is and one of my favorite ways to work with crystals is with something called a stoning meditation a woman did this that I meant a million years ago in Salem and then met again at Brushwood so high Kate but she did this great thing with stone she had all these crystals and one of the things that she would do is have me lay down and she placed a crystal on my third I know I would get into a nice quiet ready to meditate space however that works for you and then put a crystal on your third eye and think about it in relationship to the Earth let it feel like it's heavy on your forehead feel the weight of it it was done this before Layla and it's almost like the longer you leave it there the heavier it feels yeah those crystals can start to feel really heavy so pay attention  you do that you know that energy just let any feelings go through you but really feel the weight of it on your third eye let it kind of flow through your whole body feel the Earth or the floor or whatever is underneath you feel that connection because somewhere even if you're in 75th floor of an apartment building the Earth is somewhere beneath you and some of that building is created with parts of the earth and it's connected so you can you can trace it all the way down to Mother Earth so feel that stone as it connects itself back to Mother Earth and then feel that energy as it flows through you then after you've done that for a few minutes take it off your third eye and write it down in your Journal write down everything that you felt how did it make you feel did you feel heavy did you feel light did you feel happy or sad right all those things down and then look up what the crystal is and write down the meaning of that particular Crystal and it's okay if it doesn't match because your idea is to connect to the Earth to connect to the Earth Venus  not necessarily to connect to the specific energy of that crystal that's just kind of a side quest but just let it help you feel or see and then remember that the next time you work with that Crystal because it'll have some of those kind of patients in it we do we have talked a little bit about about crystals but I also want to mention and I'm going to plug a friend of ours we have a friend wonderful wonderful guy from Ravens keep Forge check him out online people he's got a book he's got a website check out Ravens keep Forge Thompson our friend Sam does metal magic and metalworking and I've always felt that I get that same feeling not just from crystals but from Metals as well because again metals are all part of the earth so jewelry I always feel that Earth connection with you know I have I currently have a amethyst ring sterling silver so between  Stone in the middle I feel you get that feeling that your fingers and compassed with that Earth Energy so I just wanted to mention not just crystals alone but metal is well in metal magic is it's a beautiful wonderful thing and it again we've got a great friend who is a metal magic wizard and you should check him out because it's not just  maybe you don't have crystals you know maybe you can't get to a crystal store or for whatever reason in your life you know it's it it it could be dangerous for you to have any sort of quote on quote witchcraft supplies around you everybody can wear a ring without judgment and you're still getting that Earth energy from that metal I'm not a good thing I like about metal that matches with Earth Magic is that the Earth holds onto things the Earth doesn't tend to give things up easily and his brother keeper of metal metal does not let go of things easily so if you want to set a spell setting it into the Earth setting it into metal is going to hold on to that spell it's going to remember it much longer than say a candle or writing it on a bay leaf those things are much more easily lost think of a plaque that's written and metal as opposed to a plaque that's carved in wood the metal one  going to last much longer through much more adverse conditions than the would would well could be disposable is less apt to be disposed of so that's going to make your spell your energy last much longer so Earth moves slowly it hold on to things and so does metal so that it is a beautiful representation of that and it can help you hold those energies if you need if you need are thinner G you can push into that metal things but it already knows like staying true staying true to the shape that it was created in staying steadfast strong you can enhance the things that it has to help you in the future so whenever you touch that ring you remember to stay strong to hold fast whatever energies you put in there and you mentioned to ring you no say there's a stone in it like I ain't like I mentioned I have this amethyst ring you can come by and the Earth energies of the Moon and the Earth Energy Service  with maybe some of the other correspondence is of that stone so you know maybe you wanted Tigers I rang to get the other aspects of the tiger's eye stone with a metal together or you know like I have the amethyst and again different Metals maybe you're using gold with a garnet you know so it's almost like I used to do this with herbs to your kind of piecing together which correspondences you're going to use from each ingredient to then create your spell and again like you said before you're not going to be using you're not pulling on every intention from every ingredient you're going to say okay you know so I know that I can use Bay for protection and I'm going to use you know basil for the protection obviously these two things have altitudes of other uses for your focus  is around you that match your intent so if your intent is to connect with this Earth Energy and you're talkin about Care New know she's talking about Demeter you got your plants that you're repotting right there next to you you got to a stick and a stone from your yard you've got a a ring that you really love that helps to make you feel, or whenever you touch it you're putting things around you that remind you of Earth that fit bring forward that energy so when you bring in your tools like you said with the bay you want it for for protection so you've already got your mind set towards protection and now you're bringing in the bay just asked if I want you to continue this feeling of protection in this idea protection and it will lend that particular energy more strongly so you don't have to focus on all right right I love that so you can connect with us very easily very simply walked Barefoot she'll likes to pick on me for walking barefoot all the time but it's a fantastic way to connect with the Earth you can do  meditations will include a meditation at the end of this episode that you can use to help get connected to Earth do a tarot reading and just pull out cards that make you think of Earth as a whole bunch of Pentacles Paul maybe the empress that makes you think of the Earth or the world just told cars and just focus on those while you do meditation spend to get you into that earthy mind it if you are able to visualize if you have that ability just sit and kind of visualize yourself being that tree informing those routes into the ground and dig and deep your route into the Earth because you don't have to be touching the Earth you know like you said you could be on your 75th floor high-rise apartment and you can still visualize yourself burying your own routes into that are connected with that deep-seated energies so if you are able to visualize and meditate that's also a great way to just tap into the  if you can't go Forest bathe or walk barefoot in a field or whatever the case maybe even if it's in the concrete jungle or just go for a walk somewhere that is an excellent way to connect with that earth-type energy don't go fast go nice and slow feel the Earth feel each step walk with intention I love that and if you do have a labyrinth nearby that you can walk Walking The Labyrinth is a phenomenal way to feel that Earth Energy and to walk with intention to a walking meditation and at the central New York Pagan Pride day coming up here in September up in Syracuse New York shell and I will both be doing presentations and one of the presentation so I'll be doing is to teach you how to draw a labyrinth whether you. I'm paper and do with your fingers or Draw and chalk or in cornmeal to do in your backyard so that anytime you need that type of walking meditation connection you'll know how to do that and I'll be kind of doing  Earth Splash are saved Workshop I will be doing a workshop at Central New York take him Friday I'll be mixing some herb energies with some tarot energies and herbs are very earthy and my mind until the point of burning everything else but harvesting herbs that shell and I have been doing a lot of this lughnasadh season this first harvest season we've been Gathering me herbs both planted and wild and drying them you know that's a little air and about to be fire once we burn them but it's very earthy Harvest and just doing that Harvest feels so good you know she'll you mentioned doing you pick and I just found a U-Pick blueberry place near me so I'm definitely going to be doing some of that there's just so many good things now one last thing before we kind of clothes off creating Community is also a wonderful way  to celebrate Earth and that Earth Energy do Layla talk to us about creating Community because you know we've said in the past how it took my sweet wonderful witch in another state to find me my beautiful cousin here in Salem that I love these guys so much it is finally finally become your turn, turn it yet again it seems like I am in a position where there is no groups around me to get to any type of pain cuz I have to drive to h plus can you be the only two hour radius I do not buy that bullshit for a hot second I don't buy that bullshit for a hot second either which is why I managed to hook up with a lovely person in my area I'm going to say her name Shannon hi Shannon you're going to run to whether you like it or not just giving you the heads-up so much alike it's not even funny so but Shannon and I are starting the Crystal City Pagan group Crystal City Circle I think that's going to be the name where we  have a monthly meet up meet and greet classes workshops will be doing Sabbath and S B and our first one will be later this month in August so that's going to be happening in Corning New York and I am very very excited Shannon's amazing all the people that we've reached out to have been amazing so I think this is going to be the start of a fantastic community so if you can find a community near you mandragora magical is a great resource for that go to your local you you your local metaphysical shop or if you're you know like me maybe start your own but communities a great way to celebrate their Central New York or North East Pennsylvania and you are in the Elmira Corning Regional please reach out to Layla cuz she's trying to form this group and she needs some witches around her cuz I feel guilty that I'm such a lovely group of Windows around me now and you need a level but that doesn't negate that we're still The O'Jays man and I do love your car I have not met them in person yet but  you love them all and I can't wait till we all hang out it's going to be my best friend so you're harvest season thank you so much for listening to us talk about Earth and Earth energies and next week we'll be doing our next element which is are because I'm an air-side I am also an air sign so yes it's going to be all about us we're going to celebrate our Ernest that a thing anyway are headed this wispy nature our wisdom house that and her wisdom a communication abilities that's what we talkin all things are shell and Layla so part two are be there or be are and in the meantime stay wise stay Wicked and keep it with you folks
