welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy best friends from way back delve into their magical history discuss Pagan Theory and provide magical inspiration for the neoy The High Priestess and everyone in between join us as we explore ritual Craft Spells celebrate the Pagan way of life and get back on the broomstick I'm your co-host shell I'm your co-host Lea and today we're going to be talking about the greatest I've done recently I attended witcon 2023 and we're going to chat about that I unfortunately did not attend witcon but I am very much looking forward to hearing about Shell's experiences there the presenters what she liked what she didn't like and uh get into some of the things that she learned you know I I wanted to do this episode about this partially because I'm still psyched as heck after it ended also to give some perspective on a online Festival I've never participated in an online Festival before and I'll give you my honest thing I was a little apprehensive well we are Festival goers that's one of the ways we first met that's how I first met my husband you brought him to a festival that we were at a pagan Festival so it's something that we have done with camping and Outdoors we did go with Phyllis kirat to an indoor Festival uh one time at a hotel in y was that Blessed Be and meet me in DC yes it was as a matter of fact so we've been to a couple different kinds of festivals but you know there's a first time for everything and an online Festival why not you know like I said I was a little apprehensive but I was apprehensive the time we went to the hotel festival and that was great too so this was called witcon uh 2023 basically it was on crowdcast if you're not familiar with crowdcast it's think of it as like Zoom but with rooms and a Lobby so two and a half days of workshops seminars druming opening and closing ritual it was fabulous and I was actually taken a back I had a great weekend it was hard to pull myself away from my computer I kept getting updates and you were so excited it seemed like every class or every Workshop was better than the one before there is something to be said for that sense of connection you know being a solitaire it has its pluses but connecting also has its pluses I think the biggest advantage to an online Festival you are literally getting people from all over the world you're getting presenters from all over the world you're getting participants from all over the world it was fabulous yeah being able to see perspective from people not just in your local area and and like you said even though you are in Salem Massachusetts you're still having a hard time connecting to local pagans finding local community so something like this where you can gather with people from all over is really really wonderful there was a couple that stood out that I just wanted to mention just to kind of give folks a glimpse of the kind of awesomeness of an online Festival first of all the dragon drummers you know you and I have seen them in person at F always a good time always an amazing experience I was like oh how's this going to go a drum circle online there's no bonfire you know there's no dancing Barefoot in the dirt you know but let me tell you I was getting my groove on in my computer chair yeah dancing in your own room why not you got to stand up you have to at least stand up when they start playing you felt it you know how you feel it in a drum oh yeah you felt it even though it was online it's the dragon ritual drummers how could you not one of the workshops which is relevant to our other podcast uh the stoned Witches Hour and oh my God you'd love this one there was this woman Madam Z using tarot in paranormal investigations no way two of our favorite things tarot that you and I adore right and paranormal investigations which we like so much that we have a whole other podcast that talks about paranormal investigations and hauntings how amazing is that you know one thing I learned is that there is a deck of cards first of all you and I need this deck of cards it is called Kari cards K NX a r i cards oh that sounds interesting what are those it's basically like a portable Ouija board really we'll have to see if we can obtain a deck of them not tarot but similar they were described as basically like I said a portable Ouiji cards she talked about things like you know Court cards can represent male Spirits so you can flip through the cards until you get a court card and say it's the queen of Cups you can be like is there a female you know it it can elude that there's a female Spirit there that is similar to the queen of cups very interesting very interesting it sounds to me like she's using the tarot cards as a a ghost hunting tool like another ghost hunting tool in her Arsenal much as someone would use the EMF or like a Spirit box or yeah some type of Spirit box kind of a communication tool you know the the flashlights that turn on and off so these cards she's using are just another way to let the spirits kind of speak give them a way to talk fascinating absolutely fascinating has she ever used them herself for investigations and has she had any experiences oh my God she's a Paranormal Investigator so like she does a spiritual based business you know tarot things of that nature and then on the side is a Paranormal Investigator using her tarot like all wrapped into one oh wow fabulous I'll have to uh get you Madame Z's information yeah yeah we'll put all of these presenters we'll make sure to put links to all their information in the show notes absolutely and a link to uh the witcon so you can track it for next year another good one this one was by Brie Bella cabbat who is a part of the cabat Hermetic Temple cabit Kent hermatic Temple I'm sorry under the most glorious Lori cabbit who just turned 90 this week so Bri Bell cabbit did one on healing light and how to send it again fascinating it's defin Ely for folks into energy work um and things of that nature they talked about you know how you can pass energy through stones and just kind of project it I don't know what the word is um visually project it into the universe all different methods of projecting healing and that was absolutely fabulous did she have any examples of any particular stones that she liked to use or any techniques that were good to use well you know it kind of depended on the situation she kind went through a bunch of different Stones as well as stones to not kind of suck up people's ick which is another good thing that energy workers need to do if you're doing tarot readings or any type of energy work for someone having stones to not suck up their ick are pretty important you need to protect your energy that was definitely kind of a Cornerstone of a lot of these uh workshops was get yourself in some Sacred Space to begin with and then release that and if necessary do some cleansing right afterwards topnotch presenters absolutely another great one I want to mention is by another High Priestess in the Lori cabat tradition Jack shipes did fairy work in the cabat tradition now you and I have have kind of loosely based some traditions over the years on on Lori cabbage Traditions so power of the witch was one of our first books absolutely so this one was almost like visiting an old friend we did some background conversation about the dos and don'ts of fairy work how to appreciate the fairies but not suffer the fate of the fairies talked about offerings and things of that nature but what made this one really stand out is at the end not at the end but like the the second half of the workshop she put everybody into a meditation and and kind of quote unquote went to the fairy world Crystal countdown down visualization of talking to a fairy bring him back up uh using the crystal countdown method absolutely fabulous absolutely fabulous oh that sounds lovely were there what were any dos or don'ts that stuck out to you don't thank a fairy do not thank a fairy that is a big one whether you're working with the she with the Fay whatever type of fairy creature that you're working with that's a big one they take that as a binding promise and you don't want to be bound to a fay don't give them your name if they say what is your name you want a better respond with well you may call me by um so that was a big one offerings um we talked about whiskey honey I think someone even mentioned sprinkled cupcakes um things like that you know just remembering that they're just as much of a trickster and not all fairies are like that Tinkerbell hey and I'm sorry but Tinkerbell is no princess if you look at the old movies if you read the older stories of Tinkerbell she's not exactly a sweetheart be appreciative and be Stern I think being stern was probably you know clear confident speak like you're the one in charge and that was very similar to what we talked about in our last episode where we talked about elements and quarter calls when you call in Elementals or the Fay it's important to be forceful it's also important to be just as forceful if not more so when you say goodbye to them and tell them it's time to go goodbye you know you're are no longer welcome and shut the door behind them so with the Fay or with the Elementals it's very important to be very clear in what you're saying and what you're asking and be very clear when it's time for them to go absolutely this kind of circles back to the tarot and paranormal Diana relle I I think is how you pronounce the name r a j c h e l Spirit identification intriguing is Hell by the way nice how to tell what kind of haunt you have I love it again goes along great with the stoned witches yeah I mean go check it out where you get your podcasts not all haunts are human you know it could be it could be a fay um it could be a Jin it could be your pet cat that just doesn't want to leave your sight like not all quote unquote ghosts are human and this was a very interesting how to kind of tell you know is it trying to communicate are you seeing an apparition orbs versus black blobs out of the corner of your eye yes they hold on if you listen to our other podcast you know I do love me some orbs so they mentioned orbs in this class as well yeah and orbs have a big fairy Association interesting now we have again in the other podcast talked about how a lot of orb photos are lens flares or dust or uh insects a lot of times but then there's the ones that you just can't explain and they seem to show up around energy sites like the battlefields in Gettysburg they show up around graveyards and cemeteries they show up in houses that have hauntings or hot spots but not in places like right next door those are the ones that intrigue me so since they are kind of found around powerful places I wonder if they're very heavily related to the faay that would make a lot of sense but some interpret that to be Angel Spirits as well there's a lot of crossover between what people might think is an elemental slash F slash angel slash Spirit of a place I think that's really going to depend on what your culture calls that right right so very good good very interesting obviously there was I don't know 96 other workshops um I can't get into them all but those were like standout awesome time made it so worth it workshops that I attended it was great and for whatever apprehension I went into it with I was sad it was over okay so you're online you're in a video Zoom type situation did you feel magic yeah you know was there anyone in particular that felt you know magnetic or magical you said they did like an opening ritual right yeah that was done by um the hosts of the event hex oldw World witchery folks and that run also Omen both stores located in both Salem and New Orleans they have a what they call their Salem coven that did the opening ritual they are followers of the alexandrian tradition so very Wiccan very traditional right right very potent their elements in deity invocations phenomenal absolutely phenomenal again just kind of hearkening back a little bit to our most recent episode did they call you know East air yes s traditional yes and then a god and goddess for Spirit deity was a little less traditional multiple goddess names under the guise of one okay I with that yeah yeah cool very cool closing very similar but just kind of backwards thanking all the elements in De uh doing the release but like I said very alexandrian so very traditional Wiccan structured fantastic 10 Stars man nice recommend another beauty of it is being online if you did attend and purchase a ticket you pretty much have lifetime access to all hundred workshops so you can go back and watch them a gazillion times and take notes pick up anything you missed pick up any workshops that you weren't able to attend live 10 Stars Man 10 Stars I am sad that I did not attend you know I I was glued to my computer wake up to go to bedtime all weekend there are ones I missed that I am working on going back at right now there is a whole one on Spirit dolls I am very interested in that one by the way that sounds really intriguing there is one about hedge witchery again very very interested I'm going to go back and be watching that one how to be witch was style and have magical presence everybody knows especially if you listen to our other podcast I'm So Into spell bottles they have a container magic class that I'm going back and watching you know they have Voodoo spiritual baths for luck success abundance so as you can tell an array of different things there's household Magic want to go back to cabala for witches the magic of keys they have one on animal skulls uses in Witchcraft and spiritual work it sounds like a festival that our listeners will definitely want to look into for next year was there anything that you took away from this one that you went to that you know a spell of the meditation you know honestly for me personally what I took away from it was getting back on the broomstick nice so definitely reconnecting and finding non-traditional ways to reconnect you know if you can't find people locally you can go online you can find Community there you can find something with you know such a wealth of information as this Festival that you went to you said you were glued to your computer all weekend and now you're you're diving right back into it so it obviously if you're looking for it you can find it impactful very impactful there were several hundred people in attendance you know and as I listed off just a small portion of the workshops you can tell there was an array a huge diverse group of witchy Pagan folk just having a good time we'll put a website in the show note so people can you know take a look in case that's something that they're interested in looking up for themselves for the future the website is uh witc con.com I'm not sure if you can if you can access this most recent one but they're already set and have a date and have pre-ordered tickets set for next year worth it so we didn't discuss magically things per se but I just thought a good Festival review for everybody would be a good thing because sometimes when you see these things online you don't know if they are worth the cost and I think when you go tell people if it's good or bad and this was a thumbs up and and definitely worth it so I thought it was a good a good break from the magic was to give a nice review join us next week as we delve into the magic of egg cleanses and divinations and try some of the newer fads that we're seeing online so join us next Friday as we get back on the brck see you then thanks for listening bless it be witches
