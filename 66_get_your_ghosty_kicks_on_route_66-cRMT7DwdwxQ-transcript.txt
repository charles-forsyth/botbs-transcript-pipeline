last week you had the great idea to talk about Route 66 so let me get all set up and do an introduction y'all set for 66 sh yeah as ready as I can be I'm not ready for 66 what do you mean you're not ready I had a good idea to do this and then I had some Mercury retrograde in my life and totally forgot about it uh oh all right let me do an introduction and then we'll we'll delve into it hold up it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 66 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends separated by way too many miles get together to smoke copious amounts of the greenest ganja in the land while telling each other's Supernatural Tales from across the USA and today for episode 66 we're coming at you with some true crime and ghoulish Tales from the Mother Road herself Route 66 so get your ghosty kicks on Route 66 and I'm Leila I'm a a Mercury retrograde sufferer named shell get your kicks on Route 66 wasn't that a commercial maybe I think it might have even been a song and I'm pretty sure it was in a movie too I've got to make a confession to everybody right from the gut Club you were started something before we did this intro and I have a sneaking suspicion I know what it is I have a confession dear listeners Mercury retrograde is kicking my ass in every way and shap same girl and I forgot we were doing it on Route 66 my B it was your idea you know you said hey I've been having a bad minute here like that's true I forgot like I totally forgot like I remembered that that I remembered that we were recording today but I was about to give you points for that that you at least remembered we were recording and you have a story ready you do have a story ready right I do have a story but it has it has nothing to do with Route 66 I'm sorry oh man so wait minute like a bad I was grappling last week I'm graveling this week what the hell's up with me am I the one who showed up to the costume party in regular clothes or are you the one who showed up to the regular party in a costume I think I'm the one who showed up at the regular party in a costume because I'm feeling like a jackass right now okay well then I'm prepared I'm the prepared one how weird is that wait a minute isn't that like a weird twist of fate how you're absolutely you're prepared and I'm just like what is going on it must be a Mercury retrograde thing because obviously if I'm the prepared one and you don't have a 66 story then and shit's definitely flipped on its and I'm really glad this must be why we were talking about it and you said we should talk about Mercury retrograde for our other podcast back on the broomstick now I know why yeah I mean I did like right before we got on I did do like a quick Google search of some stuff I think's cool that I know nothing about like did you know there's something called a zombie road on Route 66 wait what yeah this is why I wish I remembered this yeah because you obviously in just a short period of time found something pretty cool part of it's called the zombie road yeah in Wildwood Missouri so I guess it was like a hot spot in the 1950s for quote unquote paranormal zombie sightings you know infamous ghost lights uh spirits on the street you know you're you know how you like those ones of the what are they called the ghosty hitchhikers oh yeah some of that on this Zombie Road that's why they call it I guess the zombie road I'll have to delve into that next time I remember so this time it was Mercury retrograde and not the super good weed you're smoking that caused you to forget the weed is really good I'm not gonna lie like it it it is it is so what are you smoking this week sh I went back to that banana remember like I don't know like a month ago banana puding Tain oh I did do I do remember that I got that again but then I did a I did a I did a fun take it back to like 1995 thing so I took the banana pudding Tain and then I also took some of that midnight that I had last week and I I ground them together and I made a Sal salad I did nice nice that's an old school salad now that's the way to get really really high nobody's sure why but we all know that weed that you mixx together is more potent than each individual cultivar alone somehow it's better damn it it just works it is that's a known fact yeah there I don't know the science behind it but it works it totally works well I am smoking some gush mints oo how come they always call it mints and it doesn't taste minty damn them no there is no mints at all this is uh let's see gush mints heavy indicia usually has a THC around 26 to 30% depending and I would say this is probably on the lower end of that 26ish percent as if I could tell you like the difference between 2% or not I can tell you I'm getting pretty high but I wouldn't say like couch locked high so now because I mixed like a 29 and a 30 together I'm just going to sit here and pretend that it's like a 40% wait wa wait no that's not right a a 59% so we're going to pretend I'm smoking a 59% today well I think between that banana PUD intin and the Mercury retrograde you probably are at about 59% but you know what it's kind of piny tasting which it's not like I care and it's not like I'm not going to smoke it but I'm just pointing it out kind of piny not your favorite you've said that before you don't like that green kind of pine flavor that piny yeah I'm I love the Citrus the best but you know weed s weed I don't give a [ __ ] it tastes like ass I'll still smoke it let's re we have smoked it have let's be honest we have absolutely we have well today Shell's bright idea was for us to talk about root 66 for our episode 66 and we know that there is a ton out there on this road it was a hugely popular road back in the 1930s and 40s let's see in The Grapes of Wrath John Steinbeck called it the Mother Road and it was involved in carrying a lot of people during the Depression from Central America all the way to California Route 66 itself is a roughly 2400 Mile Road it was originally commissioned to be I believe it was 2,448 mil long but it fell short of that a lot of that was due to the fact that it wasn't federally commissioned each state was kind of in charge of making its own portion of Route 66 that was was envisioned to go from Chicago Illinois to Santa Monica California but it doesn't go to Chicago all the way does it it did at one time it doesn't now oh started in 1926 it opened in 1928 it wasn't fully paved until I believe like 1939 A lot of it for a long time was um Gravel Road or dirt road but then when the New Deal came through the states took all these unemployed young men and put them to work on the roads and so they paved the whole thing and it became this gleaming Highway diagonally across the entire USA all sorts of things popped up around it motels pulling in with your car to eat you know these huge amazing gas stations and little that's where you have that vision of like that 1950s Diner in the middle of nowhere yes exactly like that and these roads were made to kind of bypass cities so that they didn't have to stop they didn't want stop and go traffic they wanted it to just be able to get on it and drive and you know because of that it had this whole Mystique it was the time when when America was trying to drive everywhere the whole car culture became a big thing there was even a TV show about Route 66 with these guys in a Chevy Corvette I believe that were driving back and forth I don't know what it had to do I don't know did they solve Mysteries I don't know if they like were criminals I I don't know was it buddy comedy not sure but they were driving upout and down Route 66 in a Chevy corette oh my God I think that's where that song is from is that TV show maybe pick on Route 66 but it it just had this idea of freedom you know the open road you could go to California from anywhere just hop on this road and you could just go one of the stories that we did not too long ago was about a hotel called the Monty Vista meet me at the Monty V and that hotel was just off of Route 66 and it's haunted as hell well Flagstaff Arizona you know if you ever watched the stand gez you already got this vision of Flag Staff to begin with right and so there's a lot of this along Route 66 there's tons of hauntings like shell mentioned Zombie Road why does it seem like a lot of the stories you do hear about I mean obviously I know a little bit about Route 66 and some of the hauntings but why does it seem like a lot of the issues on Route 66 are more on the California side as opposed to the Illinois side population density the highway portion of it spanned through pretty desolate areas for quite a bit of its of its length but in California and New Mexico in Arizona in Arizona there was a ton of cities all around and so the population density was bigger there there was actually three men I'm not sure of their name now but I'll will definitely be doing an episode on them that were all three of them were called the freeway killer because they hunted in that area Arizona New Mexico California because of the proliferation of Highways and freeways and and just roads in that area they just had an easy population of people to pick from that's shitty it is shitty it is shitty and actually the stories that I have today are all three True Crime one of them is unsolved and they all took place along Route 66 did they take place in that area that Arizona to New Mexico California portion of it they did yes let's see here the first one is in Arizona let's see the second one happened in Arizona and the third one happened in New Mexico so Arizona Arizona and New Mexico note to S stay off Route 66 in New Mexico and Arizona and California because again the freeway Killers I believe a couple of them hunted along the Santa Monica Boulevard which is is or was part of Route 66 so there there's quite a few stretches that are pretty you know back in back in that time the other thing with Route 66 is you have to remember that it it was this shiny Mecca only for half of America only for part of America only for really white America if you were black and you had to travel down Route 66 it was not recommended because most of those places were very hostile to Black Americans at that time including um what's called Sundowner towns have you ever heard of these no they were basically towns where it was literally unsafe to the point of murder if black people were in these areas after Sundown and they were called yeah and it was such a thing that they actually have a name Sundowner towns and there were quite a few of them along Route 66 oh you know when we talk about this whole Mystique it was really only for certain people not for everybody I didn't realize that I obviously for obvious reasons I did not either um until you know you start looking and you start digging into it and that's when you you start to find these things I didn't realize how many murders had occurred along Route 66 and part of it follows the Trail of Tears I mean this this whole I guess it's the country I don't know but this whole route has a lot of bloody history to it well nowadays isn't it really just I mean not a ton but isn't it a lot of like abandoned diners and abandoned gas stations and abandoned like how do I describe it Noel hotels yeah the Heyday of Route 66 really was in the 30s 40s and 50s and it was actually decommissioned I believe in the 90s let's see by the mid 30s it was being called The Main Street of America people just loved it and let's see here a lot of economies were transformed motor inss there was roadside advertising became big at that time a lot of rural people from that dust bow area migrated to California during that time after World War II there was just a [ __ ] ton of traffic everybody was driving a car Nat King Cole wrote uh from Chicago to La more than 2,000 miles all the way about Route 66 you're also talking when cars started becoming popular you know in the 30s and stuff people had that first opportunity to on their own travel you didn't have to go get a train or get on a boat you know you had a vehicle that you could go do what you wanted where you wanted just go exactly and it was that popularity that explosion and popularity that actually caused the demise of Route 66 I didn't realize it was literally Dirt Road in some places in the beginning and even after it was paved it was only single Lane like two lane road one on each side you know right right and it was very narrow it wasn't created with a lot of the modern safety things that we have in place today and so by the mid-50s it had already kind of been replaced by roads that newer wider faster you ever see the the Disney movie Cars yeah you kind of see some of that happen in the beginning of the movie Cars yeah it got bypassed by safer faster straighter roads and so it got kind of disrepair and some places uh some places it got either changed into the newer Road or just bypassed entirely you can still drive most of historic Route 66 it's not always called Route 6 6 but you can find maps that will show you where it is now and you can kind of follow most of it um there are places in California I have driven on parts of uh historic Route 66 you would think they would like make a thing out of it instead of not promoting I I don't know do think they' promote it it's getting even better now there is a lot more promotion to it now a lot of States uh have picked up because it has always been a state-by-state thing and a lot of them have picked it up and made it historic in either um like I said either the segments that have been repurposed to New Roads they do designate as part of historic 66 as well as the new name and in some long stretches they're thinking of making a bike route for Route 66 where you can ride your bike along historic Route 66 oh but parts of it do exists especially in California New Mexico and Arizona I believe it was finally decommissioned June 27th 1985 and so that was it it was no more Route 66 but again in in current times it is being dived especially historic sections and in some places they're going to construct a very large bike path on Route 66 uh let me grab my bowl where is my bowl you know you're high when you lose your bowl all right so let's see we're pretty old but we are not old enough to have been back when this first crime happened H this is in the 1960s so in February of 1960 right along Route 66 near High hi Park Arizona a trucker found the body of a young man on the side of the road his body was propped up against a fence post and he had dirt and blood all over his face and he was resting in a pool of blood around his body oh when the police got there they identified him by his wallet as Jacob nicholos Ken who had gone missing out of Phoenix his wife had reported him missing after he had been gone for about a week she says he had left with two other men in her car to go look for work and he would call her after a week had passed when he didn't call she reported him missing it was shortly after she reported a missing that they found his body he had been killed by three shots to the Head from behind oh [ __ ] so the police put out this information stating that they had found this this murdered man and just a couple days later a gentleman walked into the police station and stated that he had been there when Jacob cren had been killed but he hadn't done it his name was Charles Francis Caldwell he says he had been driving on Route 66 with Ken with Jacob in the passenger seat and a man named Joe Brown in the back seat with them and he says that Joe for some unknown reason shot Jacob three times in the back of the head and that Jacob's body had then fallen into Caldwell's lap and they pulled over and dumped the body a trial followed um each man accused the other man and even though there was a lot of evidence against Joe Brown as the murderer for some reason they were both acquitted Joe Brown was then retried under a different charge it was a huge mess the trial was a mess Let me just put it that way but it ended up being that no one was ever charged for Jacob's murder even though everyone kind of knew that Joe Brown was the murderer it sounds like Joe Brown had a friend that's possible because there is a lot of uh rumors that that area is Rife with that type of kind of you know cronyism and also it doesn't help that K who had been murdered was also kind of a small-time criminal himself so the local police didn't really care that he had been killed that's shitty yeah just saying yeah I agree Brown was tried and found guilty of being accessory to a felony and he served two and a half years in prison for that what the H does that charge even mean I don't even know it basically means we know you did it but we're going to let you go because we don't care I guess we're going to we're going to give you enough punishment to squash the public but we're not going to really punish you for what we all know you did that we're not g to talk about exactly and as much digging as I did I was never able to find a motive for the murder there seemed to be no reason it's just Joe Brown was drunk and had a gun on him and just kind of decided to do it no reason so that occurred on Route 66 as I pack some more of this lovely sticky gush mins into my beautiful little Pentacle Bowl I'm going to tell you a second murder this one is even sadder in this case a young family had decided to take a trip across Route 66 in the June of 1961 and this family the Welch Family and they lived in Spencer Oklahoma and they decided to hop on Route 66 and drive it all the way to California to take a nice vacation with family James and UA Marie Welch they were traveling with their four boys Jimmy who was 12 Billy 9 Tommy 8 and little Johnny who was five now they're traveling and as many families did at that time they're trying to save money right well yeah James senior purchased a 1959 Oldsmobile sedan specifically for the trip one of those big huge boat cars right I mean you got four boys you need a nice big car to travel from Oklahoma to California right so they were gonna try to travel 1400 miles in 2 to 3 days so quite the trip with four little kids they left June 6th 1961 and they spent the first night in Amarillo Texas they had a little tent for the kids to sleep in they would pull over to the side of the road put up the little tent and the four boys would sleep in the tent and Mom and Dad would sleep in the car and worked out great and then they traveled on to ashfork Arizona and they were going to stop and get a motel but Dad decided it was a little too expensive and they kept traveling they went about another 13 to 15 miles away Dad pulled over was too late he was tired and they set up the tent for the boys tucked the boys in and then went to sleep in the car now the spot where they had pulled over was kind of safe JD James senior had picked a little spot off the side of the road that had like a rocky outcropping that protected where they were camped from the main road they're kind of behind this big rock right mhm in the morning the littlest boy Johnny woke up and went to the car to get his parents who wouldn't wake up a so he went back and woke up his brothers he said there's something on Mommy's face and the oldest went and found that they were not breathing covered in blood and no one was around it took those four boys hours hours to get somebody to stop on Route 66 to help them a man named Don Kramer stopped to check it out and called the cops the police officer named darl berno got there around 6:00 a.m. and discovered that UA and James JD Welch had died from gunshot wounds oh [ __ ] they'd both been shot in their sleep they're pretty sure that UA had been shot first because JD had defensive wounds like he had put his arms up to try and stop it so they're pretty sure he heard the shots that killed his wife and then tried to protect himself but was shot too quickly yeah they're not sure why the couple was killed because UA had her purse and it still had everything in it including quite a bit of money they had stolen JD's wallet but that only had about $60 in it so the kids's aunt came and took the kids to stay with her and found the only evidence that was found was some 22 caliber slugs the only reason the killer was caught was because a young man had gone uh to a diner right off of Route 66 and wanted some coffee and this waitress whose name was birdie served him and it turned out he didn't have any money not even 5 cents for the coffee and she felt bad for him so she just gave him the coffee for free then a few hours later that same dude who had no money at all came back in and ordered a huge dinner you know he got juice he got a hamburger he got fries he got salad he got everything and gave them 20 bucks to pay for it weird yeah she was a little suspicious and she told her husband who just happened to be a police officer who had just come back from helping to cover the crime scene where JD and UA had been murdered he's thinking maybe this guy is the one who killed them and stole their money because it wasn't that far from the diner so they put out a description of this guy it turns out after he had killed JD and UA he had or he' gone to Phoenix and robbed and shot a gas station attendant there then he fled to Kansas and was apprehended so he was tried and um found guilty and received the death penalty for a different murder a liquor store owner and then he admitted to a cellmate that he was the one that had killed JD and UA but he did brag to fellow prisoners about how he didn't kill the children at least there was that I mean you know I guess if you're that big of a piece of [ __ ] and you didn't do all the things you're accused of you can at least point out the things you didn't do brao but because he was already on death row they never tried him for that murder so that's murder number two so the third one is a mystery and I'll try to be short so the third one is in 1935 uh two couples in St Louis Illinois decided to go on a road trip George and Laura Laurus and their best friends Albert and Tilly heer got into Georgia's 1929 Nash sedan and decided to take a road trip and sight see all the way to California I totally want to do that on Route 66 you and me and our two beloveds hopping in a van and taking a road trip with like a pound of weed exactly lots of lots of weed I'm pretty sure this couple did not have weed that was their first mistake right they did have a kick-ass car that was in tiptop shape and had brand new tires and was very well taken care of because George Laurus I believe was extremely wealthy even during the Great Depression he was like a probably had those white walls yeah yeah he had lots and lots of money including he left with $400 in Travelers checks which I believe at this time is pretty close 8 to $10,000 in cash it's a lot of money to be just lot of money yeah eight grand for a vacation that's the dude you want to go on vacation with so nice car packing a lot of cash pretty flashy that was probably their second mistake after not bringing a lot of weed so they go on this route 66 trip so they start in St Louis they go to Oklahoma City Oklahoma Amarillo Texas and they're sending along postcards back to family and friends along the way from each stop right having a great time just little onliners doing great so basically what you're telling me is at this point they're trackable very trackable including George Laurus is tracking like every time you ever I'm sure your dad probably did this on road trips you stop at a gas station he would write down the odometer reading how much gas bought and how many miles he put on the damn car because you know you had to calculate every freaking oil change right to the 3,000 that's right I knew your dad did and this guy was no exception he wrote everything down in his little car Journal so that helped track them as well and I think these postcards were kind of like the 1930s version of texting basically yeah yeah yeah having a great time in Amarillo wish you were here drop it in the mailbox you know next city same thing it's pretty cool here awesome drop it in the mailbox you know just slower having fun without you hahaa no that's Facebook that's what people post on Facebook right postcards are the old version of Facebook because it comes with a picture exactly you just get better pictures well that's yeah so the family is heading off and they're in New Mexico and they decide to go to vaugh New Mexico which is where one of them had a an old family friend that lived and they wanted to go visit now vau is only about miles north of um the alien Place Roswell vaugh is only about a 100 miles north of Roswell New Mexico the alien place the alien place now you know it's Mercury retrograde and we're [ __ ] up because we can't remember that alien place they head to vaugh on the 21st and they check into a hotel they have breakfast the next morning and check out and that's pretty much the last time anyone ever remembers seeing them oh my God were they abducted by aliens maybe that was my first thought because they're near that weird alien place they reported missing because they didn't check in when they were supposed to uh they discovered that the car was involved in an accident on May 23rd near sakuro New Mexico and it was described as a young man with dark colored hair now both of these couples were in their uh late 40s early 50s so definitely not a young man not a young man right with tattoos and not one person because there was four of them and exactly so this young man took George laius's car to a gas station and a repair shop and had a tire changed and the gas filled up and he paid using these Travelers checks that he signed again trackable again very trackable then they found the vehicle abandoned on the 26th with the keys in the car but no luggage and no sign of either couple now the FBI gets involved and they're searching everywhere for these people they're searching all along Route 6 6 the next stop they had written friends and family that they were going to go to quote the Boulder Dam which is what they were calling the Hoover Dam which had just opened up so they knew where they were kind of headed but they'd never made it there so they're searching all along this route all along where the car is found and then they find some luggage that belonged to one of the women burning in alberquerque New Mexico oh they then find more luggage belonging to Tilly in El Pas a few days after that and how far away are those places like a couple hundred miles apart from each other Albuquerque and El Paso so somebody was traveling with the luggage obviously right and dropped it off in multiple different places but their bodies have never been found and they've never identified the person that they saw in the car although they did discover that he spent most of that money The Travelers checks you said that were trackable they did find forg Travelers checks that had belonged to George Laius all over Albuquerque and the vaugh area but never were able to trace the person never that's [ __ ] up there are a few theories none of which involve aliens sadly damn I love a good alien story in 1963 a woman who said that she was a waitress in vau New Mexico said that she was there in a diner when the couple was brought down to the basement and murdered oh and then concrete was poured over the bodies [ __ ] that's all El Capone and [ __ ] some of the remaining family wanted to search for it but the the diner itself no longer exists and there's probably a lot of concrete slabs in the area it would take a while to find them I mean I'd look but although I will I will say this it is now the year 2023 if there's any folks that really are that interested I believe there are those sonar things where they can actually look through the concrete and see if there's a body in it just saying don't know the cost but the technology exists but they have looked for them like I said the FBI had gotten involved at one point they said that the case file on this missing couple in paper was six feet tall FBI holy [ __ ] they did put the effort in is basically what you're saying yes they definitely did there's another theory that on along that Highway like I said there's a couple different Highway Killers freeway killers that operated around that time and in that area one of which was a man named Chester comr who was a murderer that had been released from prison in Texas and he liked to kill multiple people at a time he he kind of got off on the thrill of murdering more than one person at once and he was kind of in that area at the time that these two couples went missing now he had gotten shot in a battle with some sheriffs from Oklahoma I guess and went to the hospital with all these wounds and on his deathbed he was supposedly talking about four people four bodies and some trees so some people think maybe he was confessing to the murder of these two couples so that's another theory now it's funny that you kind of say all that because I think there is definitely there's something about murder in Route 66 yeah they were murdered possibly for um carrying roughly $8,000 on them it's possible they were murdered for the nice car in the cash and and maybe jewelry and you know and their bodies could have been under the slab now there's one little piece of paranormal information this confession from the waitress didn't come until the early 60s but in 1935 Laura's sister woke up from a dream and she said that Laura appeared to her and said that she had been murdered and was was buried beneath flooring where it would be very difficult to find her which would go along with the cement thing she had this dream on the 22nd which was a few days before people were even aware that the couple was missing but it was actually one day after the last time they were seen alive so probably it was HP she was having the dream at the time of the murder or shortly after the murder so she could have had this dream like the day after the murder and then it wasn't until this 60s so that wasn't common knowledge and in the early 60s this waitress sent that letter saying that she had witnessed their murder and that they were buried in concrete so I don't know there's a lot of different things but like you said Route 66 has a lot of mysteries along it partly because it it winds through so many old places and you know along all these different areas and and also partly because some stretches of it are pretty desolate and it's pretty easy to hide out there sometimes I love being a Gemini because even in the most calm and wonderful if not crazy and frantic situations Geminis can always switch gears true good point you've always been good at that I actually do have a Route 66 story wait what I do I do guys you know how I get so it is a surprise I will admit I might not have had one when we started but here we are H what did you find so I got on this Zombie Road thing like why I need to know why are you calling part of Route 66 the zombie road I need know this there is a lot of murder in Mayhem along along Route 66 because you know this stretch this this couple of stories goes to a part of Wildwood Missouri which is a little outside of St Lewis so this is like a whole totally different part of the road but kind of that same murder in Mayhem awesome give it to me what happened first I got to know could this all be because not that my spiritual beliefs align with the whole 666 concept but I'm just wondering it is Route 66 there are some people that say that 666 is potentially some sort of evil doing we we'll talk about your thoughts on that in a minute this Zombie Road thing like I said there's this stretch now this is what got me you are not allowed to be on this after dark what and it's like heavily heavily patrolled and you can get up to a thousand fine for being on it after dark no way that leads me to believe that there's something going on what the hell does the local town sheriff in freaking Missouri give two rat's asses about this road at 2 a.m. unless there's something going on so that's kind of what drew me in to to to check in this out you know very interesting so they call this actually the mo one of the most haunted stretches of Road in the world no [ __ ] not just the state of Missouri not just America the world so you're already making you're making a bold claim right out of the gate here it's the most haunted stretch of road I love it I love it in the world in the world okay that's great you're making a bold statement people and here's the funny thing you know where I found that quote where on a website called dangerousroads.org that right there should start freaking you out yeah sounds like they know dangerous roads first of all who knew there was a website about dangerous roads um second of all but yeah so dangerousroads.org does list this as one of the most haunted roads in the entire world all on Earth which already I'm half laughing and you've totally Peak my interest what can I say it's like world's most famous roast beef yeah okay everybody says that I don't know what to tell you so what happened was this is in like the eastern part part of Missouri and it's also known as Lawler Ford Road and this particular stretch is about 3.6 miles you know how you said there are parts of it that are desolate and kind of going through these nowhere places that's exactly what this is this goes through a valley of the Forest Oak Land Hills kind of near the U maram River okay so this part of the road was built in the 1860s and it provided access from the river to nearby railroad tracks it kind of became a part of Route 66 after its original intention was basically to connect a Waterway to a railway yeah a lot of Route 66 was like that they they utilized existing roads and kind of repurposed them to be part of 66 and then a lot of that was later repurposed to be other roads to the point where nowadays this is actually it's not like a car Road this stretch this whatever I said it was like 3.6 Mile Stretch this is actually present day more of a like a pedestrian bicycle path okay like what they're thinking of doing of other parts of 66 and making it more of a bike path yeah this already is but this thing like they got this [ __ ] on lockdown it opens 1 half hour before sunrise and closes 1 half hour after Sunset they know it's really haunted and they don't give two shits basically they put all over everywhere that nighttime visitors are going to find police and they will be getting tickets wow so there's serious about this nobody after dark thing like they're hardcore this is where I could potentially see why I think it might be considered I don't know what they call it like a heritage site or something it is the site of one of the largest and you know we are we are very much trying to be respectful here one of the largest Native American burial mounds in the country uhu yeah so they definitely want to keep people away from historical sites when they can't be supervised so it kind of would you'd think of it you know like a park you know the park it's open from sunrise to sunset or like the cemeteries they try to have sunrise to sunset so they have a logical reason for saying no visitors after dark not just because there's ghosties as you can imagine one of the country's largest Native American burial mounds all right so we're talking spectral American Indians here because of the area like I said you're talking like right outside of St Louis Missouri so you also have confederate Civil War Confederate activity in there yeah and there are reports of they call it packs of child ghosts wait a minute roaming packs of child ghosts all I can think of where do they come from Peter Pan or something also tortured Souls of working men killed in industrial accidents um in the 1800s at that point it's it's got some activity I'm still stuck on roaming packs of child ghosts I was stuck on the fact that they referred to it as packs of child ghost like that's just that they exist what's going on that's kind of horrific I mean come on what would create a pack of children ghosts here here was another phrase that really kind of stuck out to me um it has a reputation for being a a place where there's shadowy figures in other nonhuman entities I love me a good non-human entity oh wow yeah I'm hoping that means like orbs and plasma and Shadow People I know right but no they don't call it an orb they oh I I'll have to find what they called it but they called it something but there's basically like a green like a green orb like fantasm or plasma or something oh plasma I think they called it spectral evidence or something basically the picture I saw it looked like an orb but was bright green o fun I don't know what the green color sign signifies I'm not sure but anywh who not to get off track so this so a lot has happened on this road going back you know again all the way to to it being a Native American sacred spot where did the zombies come in okay it kind of I could see where they would think zombies back in their day so as I had said it connected a area connected like the river area to the railroad track area so there was a person I don't know his name I could find it but I don't know at the moment so this guy gets hit by a train and he was mangled pretty bad so this was back in the 50s actually so back in the 50s this guy was near the tracks got hit by the train I'm not sure if he was uh one of the people working on the road working on the railroad no idea where he came from he got mangled so bad that like people back then it was described of they couldn't look at him a that sounds awful it took um something ridiculous like 40 minutes to die oh oh [ __ ] I thought you were going to say he lived but people couldn't look at his scarred face oh that's terrible no like like his Skin's ripped off and ey hanging out of the socket but like awful but like lived for like 40 minutes before he died that's even awful now here's the [ __ ] it gets worse he happened to be a killer so after being I feel bad that I felt so bad for him after being hit and killed by the train that's still a terrible way to die killer or no killer that's pretty horrific and for it not to be instant for a long time I mean on the one hand e and on the one hand he is known to roam the area to this day and you know the drill with the ghosties they like to kill young lovers yeah and anyone parked on the side of the road wait he doesn't just haunt them he kills them oh yeah this guy tries to kill you in real life he's a killer ghost they call him the zombie killer oh that's awful you first you take a murderer bad enough and then you take a murderer and you kill him in a horrific prolonged terrible accident that's right I I guess I'm not surprised he's a killer ghost because that's that's just terrible I mean yeah so he's killed people in their car they literally say that he lurks in the woods ew that's creepy well that's a good enough reason not to go there after dark that's fine that's okay I'm good with that there's rules for a reason shell yeah but I'm confused on why the police care the police only care if there's something to keep under wraps come on now let's be real well obviously they cannot pin a murder on a ghost so they don't want you to get murdered there because then there would be all these unsolved murders and they can't just get on national television and say oh the ghost guy did it because then we'd all go oh do your jobs and then everyone would be mad here's the thing if they actually got on TV and said the ghost did it that might be the first time I actually believe them it would not be the first time ghost did it is in a police report however so we've talked about a few of those on this show before obviously we know how this all came about so it's not like I was able to put hours in hours of time into this so I don't know where the the packs of children come from Shell takes Mercury retro grade way too [ __ ] seriously and says I'm going to do my research at the literal last second [ __ ] you Mercury see if you can screw with that I can do this here Mercury hold my beer hold my bong um but I just don't understand where the packs of kids came from and I ended up seeing that on two different websites um those exact words packs you're going to have to revisit this that's your punishment for doing your homework late is you're gonna have to find out who are the packs of children yes why are they there I need to know now are my children a part of this pack of children what's going on if I go there at night are my children going to then become part of this wild Hunt I mean come on we need to know the rules here I do really have a legitimate question on you know in all seriousness what are the police trying to hide because here we are you know we know parks are sunrise to sunset cemeteries are sunrise to sunset but you don't see that [ __ ] being patrolled you know like they're not dishing out fines if you're walking through the cemetery at night you know that's actually a good point you know what I'm saying like why why are they I feel like this is like one of those small Midwestern coverups why care that why do the police care that much you know you're right when I first thought about it I was like well you know it's a historic site of course they're going to police it but you know you're right that's an overp policing I've been to a lot of national parks how many parks do you know that say sunrise to sunset prohibited entrance and and who is watching nobody yeah a lot of them say that but I mean but why are they watching this place right I've been in a lot of them after Sunset okay not really in theory I've been in a lot of them after Sunset and never seen anyone so why does this one have an actual Patrol yes yes so I am intrigued so if anybody lives in Missouri do we know anybody in Missouri do we got l no one lives in Missouri actually when I was traveling through Missouri on one of my great cross country road trips back in the day when we went through I met a young free spirited person at some campsite we were at and he said that the state was actually called Misery and everyone who lived there wanted to get out you know why that's because they have the zombie road that's probably why that's probably why so yeah it's the most haunted road in the world the world Leila I believe it I believe it haunting roving packs of children I I need to know more I need to know more so so I need to expand on this story and find out who these packs of children are but I think you know for coming in blind I didn't do too bad that's a pretty fun story sh and you know with orbs and haunted hitchhikers murdery Jack the rippery type ghost and roving packs of children ghost I'm super intrigued I'm intrigued enough that we need to put that whole section of 66 on our haunted USA Road Trip the only thing this thing is missing is a crypted in an alien sighting legit I'm pretty sure it's there and I'm fairly certain aliens were involved in The Disappearance of the two couples in my story pretty sure they were so close so close to Roswell it's mysterious I honestly think that maybe some of the big issues with the zombie place the zombie road portion of Route 66 you got some serious [ __ ] when you got one of the country's largest Native American burial grounds like you're talking some [ __ ] there like some like some heavy duty Next Level [ __ ] yeah anytime you get like a large barrial ground and you said there was also some industrial accidents were War sites there Civil War um Civil War Confederate stuff going on yeah so that that's a Confluence of things plus there's a river right near there right I I was going to say I'd be very interested to know what type of rock and stone is underneath and knowing that there's water nearby yeah I mean that's that's a lot of things to happen in a site you're gonna get orbs you're going to get that energy you know just look at like Gettysburg and some of these other sites that are well known have big cemeteries and that type of thing makes for very powerful psychic activity or some type of energy for whatever reason these places cling to that energy but it sounds like on this zombie this Zombie Road portion of it it's it's really kind of more of the negative persuasion well the entire Route 66 the historic Route 66 from Chicago to Santa Monica California is filled with mystery and Intrigue cool little towns and beautiful scenery and amazing things and some shitty racist towns too so I mean you get the whole American Experience I think from start to finish certainly something I would love to try and piece together and do is part of our haunted America road trip I feel like we'd have to I feel like you have to do Route 66 and a convertible though I feel sure it's a envirment yeah so we'll just make sure our RV has a big convertible top when we go through but yeah if anybody knows any more information about this Zombie Road portion of Route 66 I I need to explore this further and you know my bad on that I'm interested if you know anything let us know email us at the stoned Witches Hour at gmail.com and tell us what you know about zombie road I got to know why are the cops there what is going on at the freaking police are hiding right and have you ever traveled on Route 66 have you ever seen a ghost have you ever picked up a ghostly hitchhiker have you seen a lady in white have you seen that zombie guy tell us where's
