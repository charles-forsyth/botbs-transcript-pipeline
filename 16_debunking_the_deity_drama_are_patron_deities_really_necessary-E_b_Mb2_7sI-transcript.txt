welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hey I'm Leila and I'm shell today on back on the broomstick we're talking about Patron deities Patron gods and goddesses you know actually does it really have to be a God or a goddess your Patron doesn't have to be your Patron could be a damn fairy King it could it could be an ancestor right and I think honestly if you substitute deity for whatever type of energy you want to work with you'll get the same thing out of it because it's the same idea across all all of it you're basically looking for an energy to work with to work with you but a patron deity itself particularly gods and goddesses is kind of a Wiccan concept and I know not all of our listeners ascribe to a fully Wiccan idea so why don't we just kind of Dive Right In with initially what is a patron deity Lea well back when I started in witchcraft again with buckland's big blue book in the book he describes from a wiced point of view that everybody should kind of work with a deity a God or a goddess preferably both that are kind of like you're Pagan parents maybe they're your goto your go-to they're the deity that you Vibe the most with that you have the most in common with that you feel the most connection to or that you feel you could learn the most from sometimes it's a deity that you feel like is calling to you or that you feel you have a particularly strong connection to I like how you said it was like like a parent because I kind of look at your Patron deity is is the the one who kind of gives you that boot in the ass the one that kind of gives you that reality check you know are you still headed in the right direction or did you around and find out and now you're off course so I feel like they're kind of also the one that kind of I don't want to say guides you but kind of guides you yeah there are a couple different ways to look at having a patron some people will say Patron or matron the idea basically being that you are choosing an energy greater than yourself to either follow or learn from or to be your guide I did describe them as being a parent but that's not how I personally see them in my practice I do see having a patron deity as more of an energy that I want to emulate or energies that I want to have in my life agreed agreed now let me ask you you did mention something about um the God and the goddess necessary to have both I say no I say if you want one go with one if if two call to you answer the phone to two but I do see sometimes on on the old Tik Tock where they make it out like you have to have both you have to have a patron God and a patron goddess or you're screwed are you screwed because I say no I also say no I think that kind of goes back to a Wiccan mentality which to be honest you and I kind of came up in that a lot at the beginning everything was flavored with wiah and with those types of ideals and we've expanded beyond that in the whole Pagan movement you don't need that you don't even need it to be like we said in the beginning it doesn't even have to be a God or a goddess but a lot of people feel comfort in that anyways they like to have something to look up to someone to Aspire to I do think there's value in having a patron deity but is is it a requirement like do you need to have a badge or like a passcard in your wallet to get in no no but does it is there value in it absolutely yeah and that gets back to the duality of it there's duality in all of the deities pick any deity I don't care who it is pick from any Pantheon and that energy that being has Duality within itself so if you need to find that balance and some people do find Value in that in finding that balance between light and dark male and female positive negative active and receptive however you want to put it some people like to have that balance but you can absolutely find that within just one deity you don't need to have two or within a whole Pantheon you can have more than one you know or like you said before just pick an energy it's a lot like manifesting when you pick this deity say you pick Hestia you're going to start to find that you want to Nest at home more often maybe you're going to want to bake more maybe you're going to be working literally on making your house more comfortable or taking care of your family more if you pick kedwin maybe you're going to find that you're going to want to learn more be more involved in witchy activities whatever that deity or that energy represents you're going to bring that into your life what is your thought because I also have a thought on this what is your thought on I've also seen on the Tik Tock I like that I call it the Tik Tock I've also seen on the Tik Tok that once you have a patron D once you have found them or they have found you because it really can go either way you can find them or they can find you oh yeah is this is this like some lifetime Bond some lifetime commitment um because there was a point in my life where when I was a baby witch yeah I don't even know how this came about but uh my my Patron deity was P very tumultuous time in my life as you can imagine yeah it then transitioned into hkat and had been for for a very long time but I'm almost feeling like after all these years of maybe maybe I'm being called into a different direction as far as a patron deity so do you think this is a lifetime thing or do you think that depending on your age and stage and what's going on that that your Patron could or can or should change I think for some people it can be a lifetime thing but I think for most of us EX exactly as you said depending on your age and Stage things will change and I think that's natural kind of like we talked about in a past episode about magical names and taking a name for different stages of your life you can also have a different Patron a different deity or energy that you follow as your main guide throughout different stages of your life when I started out my first Patron was kedwin she's like the mother of all witches she was perfect for me I was learning I was beginning I I was in that cauldron of knowledge and wanted all of these things I love that you start off with Cara dwin and I start off with P those are opposit absolutely then there was a time in my life that was also tumultuous and Lilith called to me and she kept calling to me until I finally was like fine I'll work with a demon you're scary but okay I'll face that and that's what I needed I needed to face that at that time but funnily enough throughout the whole thing it's always been Quan and I have always denied her and the reason is so dumb it's so dumb and you know I remember way back in some Glory Days of past we did some coven activity like 20 years ago and you did something on Quan Yin I remember that so you have been tied to her for a long time a very long time and just like with Lilith it was always signs and things would come to me things that would represent Quan someone would come talking to me and have a word of wisdom for me wearing a quan pendant or you know different things like that would happen but I denied her again for the dumbest reason I didn't think she was cool enough everybody I knew bad Lea right everybody I knew had the dark goddesses everyone's calling these powerful goddesses and that everyone's just like I worship the all powerful Samaran goddess of the moon trembl before me and I'm like wow that's very P like that's pretty impressive and I'm like that's cool and I felt like I needed to keep up I felt like if I didn't have a cool Patron deity and so I didn't have one for a long time because I I didn't feel like Quan was cool enough for me to work with and so I denied her and I didn't want to lie and be like yes I am following no no yeah who ever I am a I am a disciple of Anana I knew if I said that I'd be in deep with whatever goddess I picked so I wasn't going to go there but I kind of denied that part of myself for a very long time and it's true I not only denied her I denied that part of myself and so I think sometimes we kind of have to pay attention to why we're attracted to a certain deity you know what is it about them you know and I think that's super funny that you just said that in all the ways that you said it because there's been two goddesses that I've always felt drawn to but they I'm not going to lie and if I'm an I'm an but I just kind of felt like they weren't me or weren't cool enough they both have just been in the Forefront of a lot of stuff lately and I do find that interesting that you had a similar experience but as much as it's two it's two goddesses it's not even necessarily a god and goddess it's interesting how even though I I have kind of always felt this t with these two that they're both goddesses and not necessarily one one of the other god or goddess and I think that gets back to us talking about how there's duality in all things even within us I mean people are not all one or the other we all have qualities of everything within us so you don't have to pick multiple deities if you don't want to I kind of like The Duality part but you don't need it you don't need a deity if you don't want one but if you do pick one make sure it's for real make sure you're interested because it's going to start coming up over and over again and if one picks you I would recommend answering because they get insistent how do you find your Patron deity that's the dying question that everybody has oh and see that one's the easiest one of all just pick one you know how I you know how I equate finding your Patron deity like dating oh okay how's that shell well because sometimes you got to try them out give them a little test run and you know kind of like when you're dating sometimes it just doesn't work out we don't see eye to eye we don't have the same mindset we don't have the same end goal so you know it isn't just a you go try something and you're stuck with it it's like dating you know you got to kind of give a couple of them the feels and see where you're at and some of them are marriage material and some of them duck and run baby yeah I like that that's probably one of the best ways I have ever heard it put ever this perfect absolutely and and yeah sleep around try a couple of them do a couple different rituals you know try them a few times if you liked it go back have a little more do another ritual but basically the way you find a patron the way you find a deity to work with is like shell said speed dating date a whole bunch of them try them in spells or rituals call upon them meditate on them research them or sometimes you feel drawn to a certain Pantheon or a certain deity or or maybe you're drawn to a particular type of Witchcraft you you're an animal witch or an herb witch or maybe you're drawn to a certain type of energy maybe you are looking for that Warrior queen or that Hearth based type deity so it could just be maybe what their aspects are even yeah and then you can just look at all the particular deities or energies that have that aspect and start to look for one that interests you or maybe you're meditating on who is my deity and you start to see certain colors or certain flowers you can find signs everywhere and once you start asking the universe who is my Patron energy who is the deity I should work with you will start to see signs and just start looking them up and you'll be attracted to something and if it's not adding up maybe you just need to kind of play around with a few of them and like shelle said maybe go on quite a bit of dates you don't need to marry anyone right away you can date people for a very long time and you know I have I have two good um resources for such Endeavors you know how I love my tarot cards this is an oracle deck actually and it is called the goddess Oracle and it has 50 52 or 54 cards so 52 or 54 goddesses there's been times where I just kind of meditate on that deck and look at the cards and you know feel the cards feel the the energy and the goddesses in those cards another good resource if you're if you're looking and and don't know where to turn two books 10,000 goddesses and 10,000 Gods I love those two bucks I do too but I I do think that dating quote unquote is is a good way to kind of get your feels around and see what and who matches your your energy your focus and your end goal it's okay to just work with a bunch of them you don't have to pick right away you don't have to decide on one immediately there's no law or rule that says you have to work with one deity or two deities and those old well and here's the thing you can have a patron deity and still work with a billion other gods and goddesses absolutely I me it's not like exclusive it's like you have a friend but you have lots of friends you know what I mean and there's going to be times when when you want an entirely different energy like like shell said she used to work with P very transformative energy big energy that might not work for you if you're doing a spell for tact with your boss it's not for the light lighthearted either exactly that type of energy you're going to have that if you if you start working with a deity with a universal aspect with these archetypes if you're going to start working with this this ancient energy you're going to start to see it in your life and so I wouldn't do it lightly right if you're not looking for love don't ask Venus to be your Patron right if you don't want to you know if you don't want to like learn the dark Mysteries of the universe and of your soul don't start talking to hkat if you don't want your life full of chaos don't be don't be all ping up with Loki exactly and so with that comes the idea that when a deity chooses you or you choose them don't bubble fairy them don't turn it into a fluffy bunny don't take out the parts that you don't like because it's inconvenient for you right A lot of these deities are prickly they have what we would call good or bad Loki has some troubling aspects you know they Lilith is a literal demon and she has some issues don't pick these deities and expect them oh well for me this deity is as tame as a kitten no honey that's not how it works I wish wish it was I would have had a lot less life lessons if that was the case and so if you do pick a deity definitely research it don't just pluck them out of their history their culture their very being don't just pluck the parts that you like you need to learn all of it and accept all of it because there's lessons there in every single aspect and you know it helps you grow yes we have to face sometimes the things we don't like about ourselves and if we look at Our Heroes and our deities and you know our gods and goddesses and accept that they too have flaws maybe it'll make it easier to accept your own and to face your own flaws and work on them and maybe they chose you because you got some to handle doesn't mean you want to handle it but maybe they chose you because you have to handle some stuff in your life now do you think someone could make a wrong choice like what if I said oo I picked kedwin is my Patron deity and I think I made the wrong decision what do you think about that because you know again a thing I saw on the Tik Tock um if anybody feels that way then maybe you're not opening up to that to which you need honestly there are no wrong choices if you picked cared wind and you feel it's a wrong choice my advice would be to meditate on that figure out why work with that for a minute do a ritual with that you know write it out in a journal and then pick a new deity but I would guess that for whatever reason you're going to probably come back around to kedwin at some point in your life because there's a lesson there for you if you picked a deity and then think it's the wrong one figure out why and then pick a different one you're not locked into that another piece to having a patron deity I wanted to address is there's a misconception this is a misconception all around Witchcraft and paganism but there's a misconception that you are not properly honoring your Patron deity if you're not spending thousands of dollars on statues and other Trinkets and knickknacks I love statues and trinkets and knicknacks do not get me wrong right but not necessary and I just I actually brought one of these out because I wanted to show you just because they're so cute I have worked with hiate for a long long long long time and all over I have these little they're not like real Keys they're like decorative Keys like they like those old skeleton keys love those those are so cool looking they are but just little tiny things that aren't something like would I like the $350 h statue I would trust me not in the budget though but a little tiny metal key that I believe was about 50 cents yeah so I don't want people to think that if you don't have the money for the statues that you're not properly honoring them I love the stuff I'm with you pretty and shiny I love it if it's aesthetically pleasing I want it I want not necessary not necessary I feel like the internet makes people feel like if they don't spend a gazillion dollars that they're not really a good witch and that's I think there's that whole trend of making things look really beautiful and and I love that that makes me feel magical and witchy you know but it can be done on the cheap so easily I mean one of the things I used to love to do with my kids is to go on a walk in the woods which we were lucky enough to have and find a rock or a stump or a fallen tree and then we would pick up leaves or Twigs or Moss or stones and put them in just like pleasing little shapes in a little circle on the stump and that is a perfect little altar in your backyard take a flower an acorn a stick a stone whatever you want you don't have to spend a penny draw a circle in the sand you know do it for free you don't need any of that is it nice sure it's great to set up your altar to a specific deity with all the trappings but you don't have to pick things in their color pick an incense that you like that's in their wheelhouse and go with that it's enough I feel like the internet makes people feel like they're not good witches if they're not spending a ton of money you don't have to have all the bells and whistles magic is within you it's not within your damn wallet and it's not in the deity that you choose if that which you need you find not within yourself you will never find it without right correct dorine Valiente correct and and I just I I feel bad for some of the baby witches that don't real ize that this is not as materialistic as the internet makes it out to be yeah and it it's not a contest and you don't need a patron deity you and I work a lot with a a manifesting idea of magic and having a patron deity to work with helps us to get into a magical mindset helps us to follow a magical path or have a goal and so a lot of times our deity is really an idea of what we want to be or where we want to be in our magical practice and so I'm not surprised that that changes sometimes for us you know as we change as people and grow as witches well and you know like I said before different ages and stages like you might have different focuses and different priorities and just just life is in a different direction than the last time you dedicated yourself to a deity yep and so change it as needed find ones that work for you I think it's a fabulous way to get in touch with yourself to look at aspects of yourself that you might not know or like enhance the good ones and and work with the Dark Side of yourself by working with the Dark Side of these deities that you choose and uh like shell said date a few
