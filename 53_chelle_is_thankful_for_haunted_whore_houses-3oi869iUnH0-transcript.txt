it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 53 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends who were separated by fate and distance get together to talk about all things Ghostly and paranormal while blazing the sweet chronic in the US OFA representing the spookiest of ghosts and the dankest of weed I'm Leila and on the East Coast that is as far as weed goes the Beast Coast I'm shell you got the Beast weed today is that what you're trying to say I do I do I think I do today you know you've always got like the highest THC I'm smoking some blue cookies which are beautifully purple and gorgeous and tastes phenomenally smooth with a nice 28% th right up there but if you've got some Beast weed I'm guessing it's probably higher even than that what a smoking shell this is weird it's called Crescent Sun what the [ __ ] I thought Crescent goes with moon but this is Crescent Sun like what are they using that AI program to come up with weed cultivar names now you know they probably are I mean I'm intrigued by Crescent Sun but you know normal naming conventions say you take one of the OG names and you combine them in fun ways blue cookies is probably Blue Dream is blue dream and Girl Scout cookies combin together you know its history you know its parentage based on the name you know this is I have no idea what this is I don't know where it came from I don't even know what they mixed to put it in I don't even know but what I do know it's 32% THC I knew it when you said beast I knew you were going to be bringing the THC to the chat show and it's making me really want these snack fact pretzel crisps by the way oh I'm so not surprised you and your snacks what do you say you can't go 10 minutes without munching on something pretty much pretty much possibly all the weed that you smoke but you know hey I'm not who am I to judge I'm sitting here with my Triscuits and cheese so I can't say that I don't have the munchies exactly but you know it's it's better than the last the last stuff I had was really good um that Michigan mouth but little too sleepy for little too sleepy for me you you know sometimes I need to be able to do stuff and yeah you you like the you like the high THC but you don't like the Sleepy weeds you know you like the weeds that allow you to get things done not if it can be like the hybrids I know you've mentioned before you've had a weed where if you want to sit down and be relaxed and chill you can and if you want to be up and do things you can but you don't like the ones that like make you couch lock and sleepy for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about please go back to the latest episode episode 52 where I had the Sleepy weed and was probably dragging ass in that episode now I'm okay I'm going to admit Crescent Sun weed had me curious did you gole I did Google it there's nothing I've never heard of it okay the only thing I see here is um sons of blood a vampire romance novel Crescent son Sons of blood a vampire romance novel so what you can do is get that book rip out the pages and roll your weed in it I don't know this was not my normal store so this could have been like a local yal farmer I I I went to a more non-mainstream store is it just me or with the the legalization in a lot of states that we're seeing are we seeing Growers like local Growers just doing that kitchen sink thing we've talked about before and just growing whatever and then naming it whatever well it seems like a lot of the stores around not a lot but there's a bunch there there's a handful they create their own product is that what I'm saying they grow their own product yeah they grow their own create I would think assumes breeding I you know I always talk about Happy Valley generally I love Happy Valley up in Gloucester they've got a facility let me tell you like this place is huge and they have their own huge ass grow so like they are growing their product for the most part but then you might go to other stores let's say insa they're a big huge store across Massachusetts um several locations insa also grows their own but they also pull in from other Growers whereas Happy Valley they only sell their own product whereas at insa you can buy Happy Valley Product at insa I see I see they grow their own but also buy from other Farmers to sell so you know some of these stores who are they are are they buying from a local farmer are they buying from a commercial farmer like I don't know I ain't asking these questions to the cashier the cashier probably doesn't know either yeah it really depends on the location you hear all the time about Bud tenders who can tell you where that particular flower came from you what location how it was grown how it was taken care of but for the most part you're not going to get that unless you have a store like Happy Valley that's seed to sale right right and I'm I'm just wondering if there is now as legalization gets to be bigger if there's a proliferation of these seed to sale places or just local farmers that are growing their own cultivars that are saying you know instead of doing the tried and true cultivars that everyone is familiar with you know Gorilla Glue Girl Scout cookies wedding cake Afghan Kush White Widow Pineapple Express Pineapple right instead of all these tried andrue familiar ones if more people aren't going the backyard mut puppy route and kind of just breeding their own whether on a from a backyard scale to a professional breeder scale and then just selling the output under whatever name you know and so what little genetics information that we had from illegal days gone is now completely gone and I think we're going to need to rely on science and testing to really give us a good idea because now you whatever you buy it could be Crescent Sun what the [ __ ] is that I don't know I can't even tell if it's you know an indicia or a sativa most likely it's a hybrid because that's an indicia leaning hybrid because that's what everybody does but the name gives me as an OG smoker gives me no idea of what's in there and and and I think that that is where we're going to find some more laws come into place um before Federal legalization and that's going to be there's going to have to be some standards there's G to have to be some standards and it's not that I like standards but figure your [ __ ] out and do it quickly if that's if you legislation just get it done yeah it's going to need to tell us the THC CBD major tpin you know Aroma flavors and and I think that that's where you know like you said testing and legitimacy and having good bud tenders is really going to come into play because you know what little information that we used to try and keep through the names we've kind of lost right right but make no mistake those OG names are still out there oh yeah they definitely are I can make a 20- minute drive right now I can I can get right off of this Zoom call right now and make a 20-minute drive and get wedding cake no problem absolutely but you know and that's the joy of legalization you know I'm always up for trying something new though so I hear a new name and I'm like what is that well let me give it a go oh that's the THC content definitely in the bag I think I've really started to be on a hunt in the new places that I go to you know anywhere that I'm staying for any length of time I'm trying to connect with local Growers you know hop on the local Reddit find the the people who are Growers and it's it's still difficult it's still difficult everyone's still kind of secret no one wants to talk about it but that's where you're going to find the fire that's where you're going to find the dankest weed you know the best pot you have ever had in your [ __ ] lives is going to be from those small craft growers in your area and if you can find them hold on to them and cherish those [ __ ] because that's where the good stuff's at and where it's going to continue to be at especially as commercialization makes everything kind of a factory process right you're gonna you're going to lose some of those better things those better Aromas the better cavars the better flavors you can't have your cake and eat it too man you want legalization you're G to have to give up some things you mean you can't have your wedding cake and eat it you can't have your wedding cake and smoke it too that good that good I like that well as much as you know me I absolutely love to talk about weed all day long and I will sit here and talk about it all day long I'm pretty sure shell sometimes gets me talking about pot when she's really high you know maybe she's too scared of her story for the day and she's trying to distract me because she knows I'll talk weed for hours so what are you so scared of today shell what are you talking about today you know I'm about to throw you for Loop and I am going to I'm going to talk about something that is totally unlike me out of character o I'm I'm intrigued you know sometimes we chat beforehand and tell each other what what we're going to talk about sometimes we plan it and then there's days like today where you do not know [ __ ] about what I'm gonna talk about last episode at the end of last episode when we were talking about this episode we both said so what are you going to do do you know what you're doing for next episode and both of us said I have a list did we did I'm gonna pick from the list and so I have no idea what you got from your grab bag I I also picked from the list and I wouldn't say this is different for me but uh it's it's definitely interesting I I'll laugh at I I'd actually laugh if by some Cosmic fate we we had the same damn story I doubt it now You' really got my curiosity heightened I'm dying to know what state just tell me what state and now let's say I'm at the same time we'll say our states at the same time time you ready one two three Massachusetts okay Massachusetts again I should have just said Massachusetts because I I should have just known usually I'm like a a crypted whor let's just say it for what it is you are the queen crypted the sacred [ __ ] of the I do I love them anthropomorphic set and whereas you are like this true crime crazy lady thanks Shell I think I'm going to take that is a compliment it is it is it is a loving compliment oh thank you thank you we meet in the middle with the ghosty paranormal that's true that's true okay I did not pick from my list as a matter of fact I have been so wrapped up in this um I can't even I can't even I'm following it every day I'm going the True Crime route there is a current story what I'm going True Crime shell is telling a True Crime Story oh my freaking Gods oh my God I feel like a proud mother I told you I was throwing you for a loop you did Head Over Heels oh my gosh oh my gosh hold on let me get my bowl get my blankie all right go ahead you're gonna need to because this one this is [ __ ] up so this is a current story you know I I've also you know I know you're you're enthralled still in the Idaho case which we talked about a few episodes back that's still ongoing so [ __ ] sad so hard to turn away from this one's [ __ ] up too well I can't say I'm happy about it I am curious to hear but like I said um this is a story going on currently in Massachusetts and I have like a I have some personal tidbit that I want to put in here and it's what made me kind of catch on to following this story if you have been watching any of the national news this has been all across the world news Anna Walsh and she has oh yeah the Miss Missing wife yep the missing wife she's been missing the last time she was seen was in the early hours of New Year's day but she wasn't reported missing until January 4th you know we've talked about I'm I'm in Salem um what here in Massachusetts we like to call the NorthShore um basically that means we're on the shore North of Boston and Anna Walsh is from what we call the Southshore area um so a little south of Boston okay so I've heard of this story and I've followed it somewhat because of the twist and turns so I am super interested to hear you know your analysis of what's going on and get more details but one thing I did not know is how close to you this was I had no idea no no you're gonna you're gonna freaking you're GNA fall off your chair I hope you got a seat belt on that chair because you're going to want to buckle up buttercup I'm grabbing a Tenny bear to go with my blankie because this is a sad [ __ ] story now before I get into the story itself I want to tell you how I got caught up in the story okay like I've been following this like literally every day oh [ __ ] please don't tell me you have some type of connection to the story because that would make it so much sadder no no no not that bad but one night I want to say this was maybe two weeks ago I can't give you an exact day I smoked too much weed but me and my sweet love decided we were going to Costco one thing you never want to do high is go to Costco folks because you go in there we went in there for orange juice and we came out like $200 later I love oh no shell the last thing you want to do is go into a big box store like Costco [ __ ] hi why what whatever possessed you side note they sell Cinnabon buns there oh well Cinnabon yeah I mean you probably smelled that from miles away oh my God it was horrible so anywh who you know we're we're driving to Costco and we have a couple Trauma Centers locally so there's like a medflight helicopter that we see frequently you know you can to tend to be like oh there's the helicopter so we're driving to Costco and we're going up route one and I'm like wow look at that helicopter it's like really low circling and there's like no that's not where the hospital it's not near any of the hospitals locally oh no so we're driving and I'm like that's so weird and I'm like wait babe there's like five helicopters circling I'm like look like they were circling a refined area a very outside of La in Southern California where I mainly live that's not uncommon like we see helicopters in the sky a lot of times they'll do announcements like to tell you why why they're there but seeing yeah they missing child you know they they'll announce that they're searching for a missing child or a missing person or yeah they don't do that here but it's common enough that that that would not be unusual to me not common here okay not common here now you might get the news helicopters like doing traffic and you know maybe police helicopters here and there never ever in the time I've lived here never in Upstate New York have you seen four to five helicopters circling a very refined circular area literally going in circles relatively low interesting and it was getting to be dark so like you could see their lights and it was like what the [ __ ] is going on here and all we could think of is that there was a huge huge accident sure logical assumption you know we got 95 running through here so you know there's always an accident right so we go into Costco we spend way too much money we come out of Costco and the helicopters are still there and I mean we were probably in Costco a good hour and I'm like what the hell we go home not knowing what's going on next day I I've always told you I'm fascinated with dailymail.com it's where I go for my news I'm a we that's true don't judge me so I get on Daily Mail the next day and this is primarily run by the British media so when you see you and your obsession with Britain and the queen and the the whole royal family well they do have they do have a whole page that's that's basically American focused it's interesting to get your American news from an outside Focus I do think that's very interesting to do that's why I do it first thing that pops up is this this Anna Walsh and I'm like oh wow you know that pretty lady and unfortunately you know I know what's up lately but it seems like there's been a lot of missing people so I'm like that's really sad and I'm looking you know how we always joke about my pronunciations of towns around here it's Massachusetts fault not yours I swear I had that conversation at work yesterday I'm not the one with somebody got really really drunk when they came up with those names and we trying to tell the indigenous people of the area wait repeat that again slower and then tried to write it down I'm pretty sure that's how it went I am reading all the letters in the words it's not my fault I just kind of glanced at this article because it said Massachusetts woman and I was like oh wow and you know it's not like this is a huge State and so I kind of look at it a little bit and they said that evidence was found in uh Peabody and I'm like PE PE I'm like what because you know you've been here you you've shacked up with me you know that's that that's like the next town like right there and I'm like what so I I pull up the article and I start reading it you know the helicopters I had seen the night before yeah so what this what this man had done supposedly allegedly somebody has put bloody rugs like a saw some some bloody clothing and stuff and it ended up in a garbage disposal area about six miles from my home are you [ __ ] me like I can't even so the night at Costco [ __ ] kidding so the night I'm at freaking C the helicopters I saw you know what they were doing oh [ __ ] sh what were they doing they were all news in police helicopters that were watching the FBI sift through our freaking garbage area for evidence oh my [ __ ] Gods oh my wow wow and they found it that poor woman so that I think what they found um the night I was at Costco and saw the helicopters I think what they found at at the garbage that night was like the bloody rug um I think they found a saw some sheets that were bloody some clothing that was Bloody yeah they they they found evidence but what the helicopters were basic doing yeah so you know let me back up a little minute um you know we'll back up a second so Anna Walsh mother of three Serbian is her is her original nationality her and her husband and their children have a house in kasset Massachusetts which like I said kind of Southshore area her husband which I do want to point out has been charged with murder in the last day or two um his name is Brian Walsh basically what the theory is is that he murdered her and dismembered her Jesus [ __ ] and then God what the deal is with my local area and how he went from the Southshore to the NorthShore is his mother um lives another town over from me in swamp Scott and he drove the evidence we'll call it um he drove the evidence up to his mother's oh [ __ ] a and put it in her garbage so he he brought like the bloody rug and all of that and brought it up to his mother's garbage in her dumpster she lived in an apartment complex they do wait wait hold on hold on so the killer let's just allegedly the husband who has been charged [ __ ] he hasn't been he hasn't been you know convicted right the husband allegedly took these bloody items and had the idea he was smart enough to take it away but he took it to his [ __ ] mother's house we'll call it about a 45 minute drive north his poor mother's house yep that [ __ ] [ __ ] and put it in the dumpsters in her apartment complex oh my [ __ ] Gods what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] they also found on video surveillance footage that he had dumped a couple other bags it a it a Walgreens and a CVS on the way from the Southshore to the NorthShore but that the bulk of the stuff that that he disposed of he disposed of around the NorthShore so wow the FBI and the police had had found this out and basically the night I went to Costco was when they had the warrants ready to go through um because obviously the dumpster was picked up by the garbage man and then the garbage man went and dumped it so then they had to go dig through that um garbage dump so they were doing that that's what the helicopters were doing when I was at Costco wow so then of course I'm like oh my God you know it you know between seeing the helicopters so kind of having that finding out what was happening at the moment that I saw something happening and then and then you know that being imp peid and then on the other side of Salem and swamp Scott and that's where the mom lived so like he brought the stuff to one side of Salem it got disposed of on the other side to Salem so like it was so close to home to me that like I just got like I've been following this thing yeah so you know Bas she was last seen like I said on New Year's Day and this guy is like he looked up some some not so good stuff on Google what do you mean shell I know exactly what you mean but tell us what you mean shell this is the part that really gets me I mean the the [ __ ] audacity really he looked up he looked up stuff like 10 ways to dispose of a dead body if really need to how to stop a body from decomposing oh my [ __ ] how long before a body starts to smell like stuff like that I'm sure this was all for his novel that he was writing right the [ __ ] sick bastard you know and here's the thing this is what's weird this guy was already on the FBI's radar wait what you're not even wait wait wait before she even went missing what the [ __ ] no not not for anything related he he like some freaking illegal art Smuggler or some [ __ ] no [ __ ] so he's already like a bad dude from the dark underbelly of art smuggling yeah like you know like the Priceless art type underground [ __ ] oh wow wow so he like not NE think he'd be smarter than to Google [ __ ] and then appear on [ __ ] cameras what the hell like I said earlier um a couple days ago or yesterday he was charged with murder improper transport of remains and misleading police in connection with her disappearance and presumed death they have not found her yet but the presumption well he Googled how to [ __ ] hide a body so he probably got some good information left a trail but got good information I'm sure they believe that she has been scattered in various garbage bags between his house and his mother's house oh man oh [ __ ] he has pleaded not guilty all three charges like I said initially when I started she um is originally from Serbia and that is where her mother is from and I think this is the saddest part in the whole world her mother it gets sadder her mother is probably around 70 or so oh [ __ ] her mother just thinks that she might have just left and disappeared to get away and she won't accept it basically I mean honestly would you bring break that 70-year-old woman's heart and tell her or would you let her have some sort of hope that her daughter's out there alive somewhere that breaks my [ __ ] heart the problem is is the investigators retrieved 10 trash bags of evidence and the evidence includes parts of her necklace her vaccination card cleaning products a hacksaw a hack a hatchet and Anna am Brian's DNA was found on slippers and an industrial full an industrial full body hazmat suit Now isn't this the same guy that didn't he also appear on a local like big box store or something buying cleaning products and things or was you know he was seen buying like cleaning products and and maybe even the saw or something but like he he even had a full body hazmat suit and it and that and that hazmat suit had both his and her DNA on it oh [ __ ] don't they have kids they have three small children no no no you know what's even worse I think the it gets worse the oldest child I think is six oh [ __ ] literally po kids six years old damn you know I was talking to to my my boyfriend yesterday about this and I was like you know what do you do like sorry kids your dad hacked up your mom these kids have lost both parents both parents that is horrific not only not only even imagine not only did they lose both parents but one of their parents is currently charged with the gruesome murder of their other parent now things get a little sticky Wicky because you know so I told you about the art dealer thing yeah that's bizarre Anna owned multiple properties worth about $2 million and there was the potential of issues that were leading to divorce so did she own them or did that scumbag put them her name so that he could hide assets no she owned them and he wanted them because one of the Google searches was um how can he inherit the stuff basically I don't know I wonder but basically she kind of had a high- powerered job based out of DC and she'd kind of go back and forth between Boston and DC for her job and he didn't like that she had an Escape Route I think he was getting Jelly Little jealousy here from what I gather and you know am not the popo here but from what I gather she was becoming the main source of income she was the one that oh what there art smuggling was drying up apparently but it seems like you know she had a couple properties in DC and a couple properties up here kind of thing she was going places and he was just kind of the loser husband right I mean that's really what it sounds like is that basically he was the loser husband but unfortunately beautiful boys yeah and you know that type when they start to lose power you know they absolutely blame the people in their lives and would totally blame the you know their wife for the reason why they've lost that power even when it's entirely their own [ __ ] so she was like she was like a a real estate investment manager um like I said out of DC so like she was like getting getting up there in the financial world you know her paychecks were doing nothing making her own way buying some [ __ ] taking care of her own money making Investments because basically this this real estate investment organization um assisted immigrants coming to America and because she had been an immigrant you know it was her thing very cool oh [ __ ] even worse and you know when you're in the real estate business you know you got work parties and you got work functions and this guy was just getting I think just downright jealous she was beautiful social and he's just like I said kind of the the loser toe along husband yeah he's a he's a down andout former art Smuggler with no prospects and uh she's jealous streak and she's an upand cominging real estate investment manager right so and but you know I mean they had kids literally every two years two four and six which unfortunately this in the worst part is because the grandmas in Serbia the children are currently um in the custody of his parents the Department of Children and Family Services they're under the custody of the state of Massachusetts those poor babies I hope they get an excellent foster home yeah yeah I it's heartbreaking all you wonderful foster parents out there more power to you you need more money yeah but you know I guess where this guy started going wrong was trying to sell his fake Andy Warhol paintings so isn't that where we all go wrong right he did at one point um plead guilty to wire fraud Interstate transportation for a scheme to defraud and possession of converted goods and unlawful monetary transactions in that particular case I I have to wonder was it the Maryland one or was it the tomato soup can one like which which warhall do you think got him in trouble like I know there's more than that but bet it was one of those two so the even more [ __ ] up thing about this is at the time of her death he was actually wearing an ankle bracelet and under house arrest under the art deal and [ __ ] what the [ __ ] yeah how does someone under house arrest wearing an ankle monitor dispose of a [ __ ] body because the hell his ankle bracelet was not equipped with GPS tracking first off damn that's almost as big of an oversight as this whole Kia being able to be hacked by the end of a USB cord [ __ ] [ __ ] that's going on right now like who made these design decisions that's not a good idea yeah yeah you know like like you stated you pointed out Mr Walsh was seen on security camera footage um he bought who the hell okay I have I've gone on cleaning Benes before we know I've gone on cleaning binges before you've gone on clean if a man shows up at a store and buys $450 of cleaning products r flag red flag okay a man in $450 cleaning products dude preach it shell a murderer and and he also got tarps buckets disposable masks and gloves so like this guy was setting himself up and and no one thought anything of it if I was a cashier and a man bought 450 I I I don't know I'm calling the Poo I'm call I'm pretty sure I'm fairly certain that there are I vaguely remember from back in the day and I would love if any of our listeners have ever heard of this to let me know but I have heard before that there actually is like a signal like a bat signal that goes out if somebody comes through a store and buys like bleach a hacksaw duct tape rope and tarps you know that sets off like a signal at the police station or something I've heard vague rumors of this so if anyone has ever heard anything like that please let me know if it's true or if it's not true um should if it doesn't right as much as I hate the nanny police state at the same time I do love when it's used for good yeah yeah yeah but but officially um locally to me within like 10 miles of my house so [ __ ] creepy um investigators found in in peid I'll say it right for all you folks I'll say it right this time just because I'm serious about this but in in peid um investigators found trash bags with blood they found a hatchet a hacksaw a rug used cleaning supplies and multiple other things at a transfer station in peid and where imp peid is roughly 45 miles um like I said away from kasset they impounded the guy's car and it shows signs of being recently extensively detailed of course it does of course it does this is crazy sad and and like I said he was just charged but he pleaded not guilty so like what you know I don't know all right process I'm going to say a name and tell me if you remember this because this has given me strong Vibes of another case that happened very similar also very very close to where you lived at the time Michelle and Harris and C Harris oh my God yes Michelle and Harris is a woman that disappeared the night of [ __ ] September 11th like the September 11th 2001 that same day she disappeared that night and was never seen again right her husband at the time she was separated from and was trying to get a divorce from it's rumored and he has been tried multiple times and was in jail multiple times for her murder nothing has ever stuck and her body has never been found and so this case was giving me huge Michelle an haris Vibes and I had no idea you live so close to this one too well you know you bring up a good a good point that I wanted to just touch on um actually can Brian Walsh be convicted of murder if the police don't find Anna Walsh's body yeah is this is he gonna Cal Harris this no he's not gonna Cal Harris this and I'll tell you why we're gonna have to do an episode on calar since we're talking about it but the the reason why is um this guy in particular and and what this was irrelevant during the Michelle and Harris murder trial this guy's Google searches are incriminating as [ __ ] yeah those are very difficult to get around they happen the same time where she disappeared they're from his computer you cannot explain those particularly in light of her disappearance because here's here's unfortunately the problem the Quincy district court has said that they believe that the dismembered body um was disposed of and possibly incinerated at the trash facility before police could retrieve it DN wow unfortunately the working Theory at the moment by investigators is that um the bags that her dismembered body was in were incinerated before they got to the trash facility in PE but they did get the other evidence like I said yeah it sounds like they got enough bloody evidence and and physical evidence from some of the other things that they were able to retrieve they might not need a body they also got blood from the family's home so it wasn't just the stuff they found up here up in the NorthShore they got blood in the family's home they found a bloody knife um in the the family basement and you know they also again got the video of the expensive purchase of cleaning supplies the Google searches you know he he even Google searched how how can you throw away body parts you know a body you got to love the stupidity of most of these criminals I mean we wish they would not have committed the crime in the first place but at least they're [ __ ] up enough and stupid enough to leave a trail like this so that they can be punished for the [ __ ] that they've done so the the thing is is that you know yeah maybe they don't have the body to convict but everything else in this case they're not going to necessarily need a body to convict him you know what I'm saying I exactly you know I mean I think he goes back I think he's set to go back to court on febru AR 9th but at this point like I said he has pleaded not guilty those poor poor poor innocent two four and sixy old children are in state custody right now this distraught mother is over in Serbia holding on to hope that this is all one big [ __ ] lie and that her daughter just needed to disappear and get away wow every time I read more and more about this all I think about is that drive to Costco and sitting in that Costco parking lot and watching those [ __ ] helicopters when they're apparently recovering all these bloody products from the damn PE garbage Center this whole thing is so heartbreaking that's just so [ __ ] heartbreaking show I feel like ever since the new year because you know like I said Daily Mail has a section that's all US News like every time I go on Daily Mail it's another us mom missing another us mom like that's like the title us mom missing pull up daily mail right now you'll find three of them what the hell is going on I I read a story about a dad shot him he he murders suicide in Upstate New York he shot his 14-year-old daughter in the head and then shot himself in the head what is going on right now I don't understand yeah everything really is really [ __ ] up right now whole different podcast but yeah I mean there's a lot going on the world is a very scary place right now it is very [ __ ] up but like was this guy mentally ill was he trying to get all the money because he did look up how to get in in inheritance he did look up what's the best state to get a divorce in did he do this just because if I can't have you nobody can like what I don't understand what mindsets are they do say that the most vulnerable times that a woman is most likely to be murdered is when she's pregnant and when she's trying to leave a relationship you know maybe it is it could be any combination of if I can't have you no one else can or pride is bruised or whatever it kind of sounded like her life was starting to take off without him as far as her professional career and her military worth and I think he was jealous as all get out I don't even know where the kids played in it doesn't even seem like you wanted the kids you know what I mean this wasn't like I want you out of the picture so me and my kids can go live a happy life I don't get it it's a high percentage of women who are trying to leave a relationship particularly any type of controlling or abusive relationship the significance of them getting hurt worse or killed is higher when they try and leave that's a very dangerous time for someone in an abusive relationship and like I said she was to the point where she had four separate properties in her name worth just under two million right so maybe she was feeling like she had the the ability to leave you know she had you know her own worth where she could take care of her kids and take care of her family so she was able to leave him and and it [ __ ] sucks it and and that's the other thing you know like she owned two apartment buildings um in Lin Massachusetts which Lynn that's a five minute drive from where I live like like all of this is just didn't we get pizza from Lynn or something yeah yeah I think I think I took you to the beach in Lynn this is just so close to home that it's disturbing and like you said just as disturbing as how close to home the the Harris case was back back in the day yeah and and when these things kind of happen like you said so close to home it's a wakeup call it's a reminder to pay attention not only to what's happening in your life but to your friends too maybe you know pay attention to what's going on in their life and maybe help them leave the situation give them the number to a domestic help hotline and people need to be taken more seriously when they say that they're in a situation like this that's dangerous because it is and you know there need to be I don't know something needs to be in place to help people leave these situations and that just [ __ ] sucks man you know what I think we need to look at this from a different direction everybody talks about you know talk to your friends get out do what you can we need to look at it from the perspective of you need to talk you need to tell someone tell someone that you are in trouble tell someone that you are frightened no one can help you if you don't tell someone there are so many people you could walk up to a stranger in the grocery store and if they know that you're not safe they would more often than that help you but if you don't tell someone no one can help you if they don't know so if you are in a situation if you are afraid if you are fearful for your safety you have to tell someone that's the first step to getting help and getting out I think we also need to start looking it from the perspective of if your friend is abusing his girlfriend or his wife you need to say something if your friend is being a [ __ ] all the time to his romantic Partners you need to say something if your son silence is compliance that's right if it's your son if it's your brother if it's your best friend you need to say something the people in that person's life need to tell that person that that's not okay because most of the time you [ __ ] know you know that your best friend is an [ __ ] when it comes to women say something tell them he's being an [ __ ] and and we need to check that behavior from the other side too it can't just be the weaker person in the relationship has to be careful and say something which we should and but it can't just be that we need to tell these people that are being the abuser we need to hold them accountable way way sooner before it gets to this point because you can't tell me people didn't know there's one one connection you know along this this thought process and I want to interject this is just as in the Idaho murder Cas is with this there was a older parent somehow some way involved you know in the Idaho case the dad drove the suspect across country in this case um suspect took evidence to the mother's uh dumpster area if your adult children are acting like a [ __ ] you are still their parent say something you are still their parent it doesn't matter if they're 50 years old and you think they're abusing their wife you are their parent put your kid in check man right and say put your kid in check and people need to say it early we need to say it early before it gets to this point so anyway God damn that's a sucky Story show I'm sorry I had such a downer sad story but like I had go in this true crime Direction because this is just oh it's right in your face how could you not you know I I had to I had to go in person

go the True Crime route today I had to sometimes it's good to talk about it you know and get it out there and kind of address those fears and address those things because you know and and it and it's not just women that can fall into this it's it's men women trans anybody can find themselves in a in a relationship that that you you don't need to spend time making a plan you need to get out now yep and sometimes we think we can change them or it'll get better or I've spent so much time with this person I'm just going to stay [ __ ] that start over it's never too late if you're ever married to someone who's trying to sell knockoffs of Andy Warhol paintings get out now yeah that might be a sign that things are bad but I I do want to just say all of my love and prayers to go out to that two four and six year-old children oh and the mother oh my heart breaks for all of them those those kids got a long road ahead and I hope that there is some Massachusetts family out there that that has

that can take these three kids in together and love them because those kids need so much love right now damn well sh please tell me that got something Spooktacular well sh I'm going to take you to a wh house thank you thank you taking me to horror house right now is the best thing you can do for me thank you I appreciate anytime anytime shot you know me I love a good wh house especially a haunted one this is why we're best friends because she knows how to bring me out of a slump I go from murder and she's like horror house and I'm like yes yes that's right I got you I got you girl so we are going up into Alaska the Wilds of Alaska right around the gold rush time to a town called Skagway can we name this episode shell is thankful for horror houses yes that is the title of this episode shell is thankful for horror houses that'll be it you're welcome anytime well aren't we all I mean seriously first of all I'm going to just say Legalize It On a legitimate level I'm being totally deadass here listeners why would you not be thankful for a horror house I mean why really for real I am totally down I'm just curious about an Alaskan horror house to begin with because all I'm thinking of is it's got to be cold well well yeah all the more reason for a wh house well you know anywhere there's gold there's going to be mining towns right and anywhere there's mining towns there's going to be lots of miners looking for that gold and they all need a [ __ ] that's right so what year are you taking are you taking us to like gold mining times like 1800s like when are we talking here that's exactly right well in 1896 gold was discovered in the Klondike region of the Yukon in Northwest Canada by the time the news hit like the west coast of the US like San Francisco and Seattle that area all of those people were like there's gold in themar Hills and like ran their asses up to Alaska right right now a lot of these people had families not all of them but quite a few of them had families and so they would bring their families this treacherous way all the way up to Alaska and Skagway was one of the last populated places on the way out to the Wilds of Alaska where they could find this gold so some people would leave their families behind in this town and then these dudes would either die or find someone else while they're hundreds of miles away from their lady love and these poor women would be left in town with no means to support them M themselves and possibly support their families so there's like a whole town of just women well no you know where the miners go at at one point there was over 15,000 miners that lived in this town and there was about 300 prostitutes in the town at that time damn so it was a very bustling Town filled with minors but what I'm saying is that there was enough women that would be left there without any means that they would quickly get caught up into the like the prostitution in order to support themselves you got to feed yourself and keep a r for your head right and like in many Toms there was a couple different levels of prostitution there was your you know your high class prostitutes that were in the bordellos like the place Sports sure like the place that we're going to talk about today which was called The Red Onion Saloon you know the higher class women would be in a nice Bordello all I can think of as onion is peeling back the layers okay so I'm going to show you this picture and tell me if this doesn't look like an upside down vagina all right hold on we got the VJ right here oh my God it does right like if you flip that upside down you got like your lebia you know yeah no it does it totally does right so yeah I'm pretty sure they do that on purpose anyway so that's the Red Onion wait wait wait wait the most important question I have throughout this whole story I have right now this place is this place still open it is really not a bordello any longer you know you can't go get yourself as far as I know prostitution is not legal in Alaska but you're getting me you're get me confused sh hold on all right take it back to the 1800s so uh yeah Gold Rush lots of Miners and three different types of of prostitutes right you got your Bordello prostitutes then you've got your uh slightly poorer women who were in like small Shacks or in little rooms off the alleyway that they called those cribs and they were usually very very small and dirty and then the third one even lower than that you had your prostitutes that literally had a mattress strapped to their back that you could have for a few pennies in an Alleyway they would just lay down on that mattress and you could you know you're low class your middle class and your high class [ __ ] that's exactly right so the Red Onion Saloon was a very high class Bordello Skagway saw its population go from a few hundred people to over 30,000 at this time and in 1898 The Red Onion Saloon opened up so they had a big gold rush basically they did they did which what does that attract Mormon exactly so it's a two-story building and it had a saloon and a dance hall on the first story and if you went up the stairs to the second story like many of them it had these Second Story rooms there were 10 different rooms upstairs where women would work this brothel had a very interesting system for the patrons to come in and pick which prostitute they wanted to be with for that night you'll never guess I was going to say is this like Amsterdam where they stand in front of the windows oh no even creepier they used dolls to represent each of the sex workers they each had a doll corresponding to the woman that would work upstairs and so downstairs in the bar area like a Barbie sort of well an 1890s kind of Barbie probably I'm thinking like a raggedy an kind of I already got a feeling I already got a feeling of misrepresentation here I got my I need more stuffing there take that stuffing out of there right right everybody wants their doll to have a little bit more up top a little more in the booty A Little Less in the waist but so they had 10 dolls representing each of the women uh that worked upstairs at at the bar and when a patron would come over if the doll was laying down he would know that she was currently busy and if the doll was standing up he would know that she was available to provide her Services now at the time you know it had very good working conditions there was a Madam that took care of the girls they had bouncers that would help make sure that that everyone treated the girls well that they didn't overspend their time and of course they had like the bartender this rle had built into it a system for payment in each of the rooms upstairs in the floor how technologically savvy of them right they were so ahead of their time in the floor next to where the bed would sit was a little like a hole with a tube that went down from all 10 rooms that went down and connected so that it would go into a um a box at the back of the bar so that when the man would pay for the services of the woman she would take the coins off her nightstand and then drop them down into this hole at the side of her bed and then that way the bartender would know that that woman was available for the next Patron that's weird right now there were so many men and so few sex workers in this town at that time that each worker had roughly a 12h hour shift seven days a week and each Dam damn each customer was only allowed about 15 minutes to to uh get his groove on damn that makes me sore right just thinking about it didn't get a break it was wham bam I'll pay you ma'am every 15 minutes for 12 hours which would mean these women would have sex with as many as 48 men a night and not even shower in between probably not what 48 yucky yucky now at the time from what I understand each roll in the hay each 15 minutes was worth $5 I need I need a conversion on that before I react okay because five dollar but it's only 15 minutes but you know you're getting a little nookie nookie here $5 in1 1898 is worth $165 today oh hell yeah oh hell yeah that's worth 15 that's not bad that's not bad right 15 minutes you get to you know climb The Stairway to Heaven and go get a little happy ending of your own in in room number whatever with the doll that you picked downstairs she drops the five bucks down the shoot well actually she didn't drop the whole five dollar so out of that $ five dollar each woman got to keep about a125 each so what's that in today's money what's that do25 so a125 is about $30 so so they're they have to charge 160 and they only get to keep 30 of it okay less worth it and they only get to they only get to keep 30 of it but that means they were making $120 an hour but this is where shell would come in and teach these women how to go into business for themselves right now at the time women at that time legally the best job that a woman could legally have would earn her about $3 a day holy [ __ ] so these women are earning more than that in an hour so you know hey if you can stand having sex with 48 sweaty miners in a day might be worth it I don't know you could do it put away for college education and be out of there in a couple months I imagine or they probably moved away and bought huge ass houses and became like you know the lady of the house I hope so I hope so where they never knew where she got all of her money but she had this big rich house that's what I would [ __ ] do be like Oh I'm a widow and he left me so much money I would hope I would do that but at the time you know dick right so there was a a very high turnover of women but at least at the Red Onion women were treated very well and they did have the bouncer if anybody if any client took longer than the 15 minutes the bouncer would come up and make sure that he was thrown out promptly what if she liked him and wanted to give him a little extra I don't know I guess he'd still have to pay or she'd have to wait till after her 12-hour shift can you imagine wanting to even look at another dick again after seeing you know 48 can you imagine going home afterwards and be like you know honey I'm I'm a little tired from work I don't think I want to fool around tonight I'd think after day two I'd be like okay I need a minute yeah that's some hard work right there they earn that money [ __ ] the way money was back then I would have only worked like two three days a week the sex workers here were treated relatively well for the time this place is not haunted by anyone that was killed by like a a jealous client or a a really particularly shitty vindictive or mean client or anything like that which you did hear a lot about in the wild west back then sure some you know sometimes these women were treated as as less than human or as just property it sounds like this was a classier joint though very much so it does have the reputation of having been a very classy joint but the most famous ghost of The Red Onion Inn is a a woman called Lydia she was a prostitute there who was very popular very beautiful petite woman her ghost appeared to one of the employees there quite a few years ago and unfortunately the manner in which she appeared was the way that she died and poor poor Lydia had an untreated case of syphilis and you know sex sexually transmitted diseases obviously were a huge problem back in that time particularly days a day yeah particularly in a you're gonna have the creepy crawlies after a bit yeah exactly and ghost even appears with pock marks on her face and so that's one of the ways you can tell that it's Lydia because she'll be wearing a long dress petite woman you can see the pock marks on her face from um the disease that's ravaging her and she took her own life in her bedroom she hung herself in the corner oh she's very often seen there hanging in the corner a yeah her ghost is also a very considered to be a very friendly ghost particularly to women and she is a very prevalent ghost people will often report hearing her walk down the hallway and they can smell her perfume as she passes there'll very often be cold spots and employees will talk about like hanging out with another employee and then a cold spot will go between them and the one looks at the other and was like did you feel that they're like yeah I totally cold spot it's always corroborated you know one woman talked about restocking some shelves and being up on a ladder when sudden she she felt this overwhelming presence behind her and smelled the perfume that they associate with Lydia another employee came into the room while this is happening and said oh wow I see Lydia right behind you oh wow and so you know it's things like that that kind of corroborate all of it Lydia is also known to be a very mischievous ghost she likes to much like some of the places I've stayed where I've talked about little gremlins hiding things and then stuff showing up in other places yeah Lydia does this very often she's one of those people is she'll steal things and kind of jokingly hide them or or they'll just disappear for a short period of time only to reappear in a very unusual spot one of the more famous Tales of Lydia doing this is a red bra now the whole top floor is red bra yeah bra bra like an actual bra bra the whole top floor that used to be the brothel is still decorated in some of the actual items that were there while don't even tell me one of the beds are there are one of the beds there I think so quite a beds I'm pretty sure I don't know if it's the same mattress but the beds I believe are there and there's I sleeping on a brothel mattress I don't think you can sleep there it's just a museum oh but they do still have a lot of the same items the Antiques and the clothing and the the decorations the wallpaper everything just historically that would be cool very cool but as you and I both know items hold on to energy to people and places and things that's right so all of this energy is still kind kind of there and sitting around waiting and so it's not surprising that Lydia's ghost is still seen there and is very very strong it's rumored that she doesn't like men very much and she will play tricks on them particularly if a man is mean to a woman Lydia is known to do things like men will go to sit down or sit back down in a chair and she'll have moved it just enough that they'll fall can we bring a Lydia up here to Massachusetts for Brian Walsh right take care of that dude right she only does things like you know she'll make expensive drinks will kind of disappear or you know she'll she'll kind of particularly focus on them in a negative way like moving their things you get the black velvet she's leaving it alone you get the Jack Daniels say goodbye to it right now so the staff that's there sees her often and feels her presence very often and so do visitors and they mostly consider that she's she's A Gentle Spirit a kind Spirit but a very active Spirit not so much a um a record like some of the other hauntings this seems she killed herself but didn't want to die right she didn't want to leave now there is one incident that seems to play over and over again that might be an incident of Lydia as a recording ghost and that's particularly one of the hallways upstairs uh near where her room is people very often will hear footsteps going down that hallway and one night in particular the sound of footsteps or even possibly a scuffle from upstairs was so loud when it was supposed to be empty that the staff called police to come and investigate no [ __ ] so the police came and when they went upstairs they saw the figure of a young woman run away from them down the hall and into one of the rooms and that room used to be a woman named Diamond Lil and we'll get into her a worker a sex worker The Madam oh The Madam oh and when they went into that room it was empty so where do you get to the point where I hear in noise to I call the cops because I've heard noises we've all lived in houses where we hear noises I'm going and looking were they freaked out enough that or or was it to an extent like when do you call the cops right it sounds like they were freaked out enough and from the accounts that I've seen and I've heard the employees there are very very familiar with unusual noises and footsteps and strange should be right so this was a was unusual enough that they thought that someone had broken into the supposed to be empty second floor so tell me about The Madam one of the madams there is a woman rumored to have been a woman named Diamond Lil and Diamond Lil is actually famous for having been a Madam in the United States back in the 1800s and she's called a legendary cortison she immigrated to the US when she was a teenager and to Montana actually she married there and when that marriage failed she started going across the country singing and dancing kind of doing like a Vaudeville act to support herself and became very very famous doing that during that time she also supported herself by going to brothel and being a sex worker she ended up in Skagway during the gold rush and became Madam of The Red Onion Saloon for a short period of time now Diamond Lil was 6 foot tall and had a diamond in her front tooth she was known for being outspoken big body and Larger than Life nobody crossed Diamond Lil she spoke her mind that diamond was like her status symbol that's right she worked at Bordello CU she wanted to she sung and she danced because she wanted to and nobody was going to tell Diamond Lil what the [ __ ] to do or what not to do and so she was a very popular Madam at the Red Onion for a short period of time and it's rumored that she was The Madam at the time that Lydia was there and that possibly that recording ghost could be Lydia or one of the other young women uh who was abused by a um there's a a guard that's also rumored to be a ghost at the Red Onion that was murdered by one of the sex workers there oh he was a pretty bad dude I mean I guess he used to regularly abuse the women rape the women and cause problems and would U blackmail them to not tell anyone and so this went on for a little while right under the noses of Diamond Lil and I guess the the bodyguards that were the other bodyguards that were there until one of the women had enough and murdered him oh wow oh wow it's thought that maybe the ghost that's seen running down the hallway to Diamond Lil's old room might be one of the women that he was abusing trying to get away from him and running for like the safety of the Madam's room so the male ghost that's also seen his name is John and he is a former bodyguard that was there and although this was an upscale brothel and everyone was supposed to be treated you know as well as I guess you could be treated for being a prostitute in the late 1800s he would abuse the women and kept them quiet by blackmailing them uh he would threaten to hurt their children and he'd threaten to cause all sorts of problems get them fired and throw them out this sounds more like what I'm used to hearing about as far as 1800s brothel type situations exactly and so this went on for quite a while I guess and and got more and more sadistic he was not a nice person I mean really shitty and did Terrible Things to these women and I guess they got had enough and rumor has it that they kind of got together and tricked him and one of the women murdered him with a Cleaver wow so his ghost is still there and he's mean that ghost you need to stay away from he's often preceded by the smell of like stinky feet like a dude who has like bad foot odor taking his shoes off his sneakers off at the end of the day that kind of smell oh Lord if you smell that get the [ __ ] out because he does hurt people oh and like like like you actually like hurt hurt like actually hurt hurt like he's been known to leave bruises scratches cause people to fall down at one point he appeared in front of two construction workers two guys that were working there and he pushed them down the stairs and they both suffered um bruises contusions broken bones oh wow he is not a good ghost he's a very violent Spirit oh wow there's even uh there's stories of one of the employees that was there who didn't know about JN who didn't know the dangers of him appearing and she smelled this terrible odor and she's in a room alone and just all of a sudden this stinky foot odor appears and she's like kind of smelling around the room trying to find the source of this odor right and it's just like in a spot in the room there's no vents there's nothing there she couldn't figure out what was going on so she went and she got her boss and brought her in and she's like you know I'm smelling this odor and the woman was immediately like you're smelling what let's go check get out now so they went to the room and she's like now tell me again what you smelled and where so they went to the spot and it wasn't there anymore but they caught whiffs of it it had moved 5 feet closer to where the woman normally stood to work oh and the boss was like get your things we're leaving we're locking up for the day and and left and wouldn't talk about it wouldn't say his name wouldn't even discuss it until they were well away from the property so the common knowledge is I guess it's not really a rule but they don't talk about him he's not to be talked about on property and some people that work there who shall not be named right because he'll retaliate if you don't talk about him he'll stay away for a long time but if you talk about him he's more likely to come around now let me ask you this you said this was a museum they talk about him at the Museum no they try not to employees for the most part don't talk about him even former employees have a difficult time off premises talking about him I want to go to this place and I want to talk some [ __ ] about this guy because you know me I am so [ __ ] out you're gonna bring that Ouija board you're be like hey John shitthead [ __ ] is your problem John hey douchy douche come talk to us you're like I'm a woman come here talk to me or I'll like don't talk to me like that I'll [ __ ] you up [ __ ] that's right that's right and then I'll probably end up with like cuta across me I've heard some employees are like yeah people have said before why don't you try to get rid of him if he's so bad and you're like you just don't [ __ ] with that you just you don't understand you just don't know until you've been there he's that bad have they sent any like um like psychics mediums whatever ghosty people like professional ghost adventure oh yeah people love to go there they're constantly getting photos and possibly one Other Woman there's rumors that Diamond Lil is there she did not die there and I could not find any employees who would corroborate that her ghost has been seen there but some people say that they think they've seen Diamond L there and I would think a six foot tall ghost with a diamond in her mouth would be pretty distinctive so I don't know but employees are pretty adamant that her spirit is not there Lydia's is another woman's is and the bad one the guy that former bodyguard he is also there and they get pictures of them all the time orb photos uh fuzzy ghost figure photos and so it's a very very active place where you can get lots of photographic evidence and even EVP evidence which is online if you want to go look for it oh interesting I just I just think it's I just think it's it's a little I'm surprised there's not more ghosts there I guess as my point I I would have assumed that a brothel in Alaska lady 1800s with a Madam called Diamond Lil that that place would just be creeping and crawling with with with hookers and hoes you know like man [ __ ] all abound and hookers everywhere you'd think you would think I would expect I would expect to go there and hear a bed going you know I would be I I'd walk in there with the expectation of you know this whole chick typ he apparently the noises upstairs are very common walking around the Creeks yeah even the sound of money going down that special you know money shoot that they had that's pretty convenient I have to say all I can think of is Eon or Scrooge sending your money down right but they got to keep a125 from each one right I suppose as long as you didn't get syphilis or some other Gara some other ter right you you made bank but yeah so that's my ghost story The Red Onion Saloon in skaguay Alaska I want dos I want to go there I want to take a Ouija board and I want to talk to John I'm really surprised honestly that the dolls are haunted I kind of expected when I first looked into this story to find a story of haunted dolls in the BR in Alaska that's what I figured that that you were gonna allude to like the place was just crawling with ghost haunted dolls haunted hookers I thought I thought this was a haunted hooker story I really did yeah I thought it was a Robert the Doll story but with worker dolls and you know I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't but very good story nonetheless and creepy ghost we could actually make a good story about sex worker dolls that are haunted that's a different podcast show I think we need to write a book on that one I think I want some of what you're smoking right right you know my mind just it just takes me there sometimes but yeah I I do want to go [ __ ] around and find out at this place because that would be so fun um I I probably regret it but right now in the moment I think it would be fun I I do think that um before we close off here for the for the day I do want to point out that maybe in another episode or two both Leila and I will Circle back and give an update on both the Idaho case as well as the Massachusetts case because they are uh current event stories and and we are each intrigued by these stories and in the Spirit of we do touch on True Crime here um we probably at some point will Circle back with some updates on both of those yeah definitely give you some updates hopefully some closure you know with some convictions and find out what happens when these go to trial but I'd also at some time like to do an episode on Michelle Anne Harris because her case is mysterious and creepy and so way too close to home for both of us way too close to home and there have been trial after trial con evictions and overt turnings and and it's one of those cases that's heartbreaking and mysterious and definitely deserves a very close look oh my God you know what I just thought of what's that sh the day that Michelle Anne Harris went missing in Upstate New York September 11th 2001 a day of infamy you and I lived together then holy [ __ ] we did remember I do remember oh my gosh yeah we were I had the bong called the over tooke fairy you
