it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi and welcome to a special stoned Witches Hour wheel of the Year llamas 2022 Edition llamas is August 1st in the Northern Hemisphere and I believe August 1st is imul in the southern hemisphere that's correct so for those of you in New Zealand and Australia our listeners down there happy imul and happy llamas here in the northern hemisphere llamas is a celebration of the sun it's a celebration of the god Lou it's also is well known in our old Pagan Community known as the first harvest the first of the three Harvest festivals often called the Festival of first fruits back in the day shell we would all gather together on or about August 1st and people would bring the first harvest from their garden and I loved this part there'd be cucumbers and of course zucchinis everywhere and tomatoes you know what I love most about our our old Community llamas rituals is it was like a feast of food it really was I mean you ate yourself fat at this ritual you really did on all sorts of fresh wonderful abundance from people that you cared for and it was so fun seeing people come in every year with their big platters of vegetables their fresh bread that they had baked their sunflower seed bread their their big sunflowers to decorate the tables and the altars with and all their Bountiful yum yums and everything that they were so proud of these seeds that they had planted and cared for literally through the season now they're harvesting and outdoor weed growers August is very often the time when we're harvesting when we're harvesting our sun grown Bounty so it's a good time grow in the do you really grow in the on do you do any outside growing like is that as lucrative as inside growing lucrative is a not exactly the term I would use because I don't grow to sell but Su grown weed is the best you cannot beat the power of the Sun the power of Lou you sound like a raisin commercial because they say sundried raisins are the best they're probably right the sun is so powerful and it provides so much energy and and artificially indoors when we use lights that's great because I can control all of that I artificial is artificial artificial is artificial and it will never be as powerful as the sun in the sky and so outdoor grown weed where the roots can be down in Mother Earth and get as big as they want to and they're absorbing that summertime Sun here in the northern hemisphere these plants get as big as trees I don't know if you've seen some of these outdoor Gardens or outdoor um Farms but one one pot plant shell could be 10 12 feet high and and even bigger in diameter that's crazy that's crazy to think because that's pretty big you can get pounds and pounds off of a sun grown plant so it it it depends there are people who throw some seeds outside and are gorilla Farmers essentially and call themselves outdoor farmers and and they'll have varying levels of success but yeah anything grown in the Sun for the most part if you do it well it's going to be it's going to blow anything indoors out of the water and there's some people who say they can taste a difference I think that's going a little far but there's definitely differences so one thing I think that people you know this this holiday llamas I I I don't think people always realize that there is actually like a heavy Christian tie to this particular holiday yeah it makes a lot of sense there there's a heavy Christian tie to the Sun God yeah I guess we can't deny that the parallels between Lou and and Jesus is what I think you're going towards they actually they actually um in in Christianity they call it llamas day go them for even acknowledging well doesn't llamas in Old English comes from I don't remember what the old English words are this is what I was getting at it comes to loaf Mass yeah this is where this is where folks would bring like so they have their first harvest their first grains and whatever of the season and they would take that first loaf of bread to go get blessed because obviously if we're talking about the first harvest you must anticipate there's a second and a third they would have that very very first Loa of bread they baked from this year's crop be blessed to kind of magically Infuse the rest of their harvest season which will go until like whatever the end of October beginning of November so it was a way for them to kind of be like thank you for what we got now but we really want you to bless the rest of our crops that are still growing so that they flourish as well well a lot of these ancient Traditions are what you and I like to talk about as intention and we we do a lot of that now and that's what they were doing with that loaf is they sometimes would even say that any grain harvested before August 1 was unlucky because it showed you were harvesting too early so may hungry you were too eager so if you har harvested on August 1 it's a it's a symbol to show that intent that we have we have Bounty and then baking that bread is another symbol of bounty here we've we've made something plus Lou is the god of craftsmanship and so making things Honors that Sun God and and what better way to honor a sun god of making than taking something grown in the Sun that represents him and cutting it down again in that tradition of the god bringing Bounty and then getting cut down to give back and baking it into that symbolic bread to show that you have Bounty you have these things it's that intention baked right there in the CR right and and and so that was that was actually something that even early Christians did they would take that first loaf um to the church mass hence loaf mass and they would have the priests bless that loaf um just as is the the Pagan folk would have similar things so it's it's just really you know we always say that this holiday you know equals this Christian holiday and so on but this there's actually I think a closer tie in and it's just because what we're celebrating is Harvest Harvest isn't about religion it's about survival very much so very much so a lot of these Pagan rituals were about survival they were they were all encoded rules on how to survive the winter you honor your harvests because even though it's we're in the fullness of Summer it feels like we're in the fullness of Summer the days are super hot right now and the Sun is beating down but this stuff is what you've got to put together in story save for those long winter months right we're noticing things are starting to die things are starting to get brown and die off in California everything's already dead but as far as growing things they're starting to die and you're starting to notice it the nights are getting a little bit longer and cooler and we're starting that Harvest so we're starting to realize oh [ __ ] we are in the dark half of the year and I better prepare for when it gets really dark this is actually when folks like you know like you and I we've done this in the past not that we do this every year Faithfully but we've done this in the past um canning this is the time of year where folks start canning because you're bringing in that Harvest those first fruits you do need to kind of make sure you can spread that through those long winter months this ritual is outward I mean the sun is very much about shining and showing yourself and being outward sunflowers and the color yellow but it's also about Hearth and Home siries and demer you know the goddesses of of household and the ritual of baking bread and I guess you can kind of extrapolate that into other parts of your life you know your the seeds that we planted back in imul here in the northern hemisphere the ideas we should be starting to see some glimmers of those coming to fruition the first beginnings of of what we planted then starting to come and and how is it how's it going we should do a little self-reflection are we where we thought we would be are we on track are things going well are they going bad it it it's it's one of those uh times of year also were you still want to make it for me personally based on our our our experience a fun summer celebratory gathering with that background intent of honoring the Harvest you know in in things of that nature welcoming that first harvest anticipating the second and third but it's still kind of in that playful space is maybe a good way to say it I love this holiday partly because is it's a little weird on the surface you have the Sun and like you said we're celebrating everyone's bringing we loved the feast everyone brought soup that they had made gaspacho or whatever that they had made you know all these salads and strawberries Andes and yeah yeah people are starting to to ferment wine and beer and and everyone's bringing all these things and we're celebrating we're sharing with each other and and the Sun is warm and we're comfortable and we're happy but the nights are getting colder and we did just cut down the grain we did just cut down that God and make that sacrifice you know there's that underlying tone of we are sacrificing things another shift yeah shift another tick in The Wheel of Time and on the surface it's bright and sunny and warm but on the underneath side we're preparing for death we're preparing for that dark and cold it's a good reminder that that's never far away even amongst the abundance of Summer and that's not necessarily a bad thing being able to prepare for that and being able to go within is a really good idea and I love that you brought up canning because how wonderful in the middle of the dark time to be able to open up a jar of something that you canned in the summertime and have that freshness and you can do that with anything you know write something for yourself now about all your hopes and abundance that you hope for the rest of your year in a journal or in a note seal it up and then open it in the dark time of the year or wait until you need it later in the dark and you know I think that's that's the spiritual aspect of this holiday that that we also want to point out is that it is harvesting that first crop of harvest but on a a more spiritual level that's more translated to reaping what you've sown so all the seeds that you've planted physically mentally spiritually whatever you know you're starting to reap what you've sown good B and different on that level you're harvesting your hopes and dreams and wishes so all those things that you hoped for back it at belaine ostara and litha are starting to come to fruition now so it's not just you know physical crops that you are harvesting you are starting to harvest the results of the seeds you've sewn personally very good point very good way to put it which can be a rough pill to swallow sometimes none of us like you know but we have to do that self-reflection is is a wonderful tool and you know we don't love to do that I don't love to do that but it's good to do but it's a great time of year for it because you know the Summer's winding down and you know you're kind of starting to make that shift again between my life as a beach and you know that go back to school go back to work time of year so it gives you that time to kind of reflect on all the seeds you've sewn and it's a good point too that it's not the end this isn't wintertime even though it's the first harvest some people depending on where you live are now planting seeds to harvest for a late fall crop or an early winter crop so you have to remember that this is a good time to reflect and to take stock and do that first harvest but there's still time to change the trajectory there's still time to put fertilizer in that Garden or to help those pumpkins grow a little bit better or even to plant new seeds for a short-term Harvest coming up at the beginning of winter it's not the end there's still abundance there's still time and if you can do that self-reflection right now take stock of where you're at honestly that will give you the energy to fix the garden that you have or even to start a new one it's never too late to start a new Garden you just gave me chills I got chills and as an indoor and outdoor Gardener of many different types of plants not just cannabis it's true it's never too late you can always start something new and sometimes you know there's that sunk cost fallacy maybe we've got a garden and I am the worst at doing this sometimes I will plant a batch of cannabis I'm a terrible saver I will save seeds out of bags I still grow bag seed and I shouldn't I really shouldn't but I do especially if it's something that I bought and I really enjoy so I'll grow the bag seed and when it comes out crap and it's going hermaphrodite and everything is bad I get advice to you should just chop it down you're putting in too much energy too much electricity too much money on something that's just going to be bad cut your costs now and I am usually so attached at this point and so invested in making this right you would never do that I double down I put more energy and more money into this going full well it's not going to turn out right and then it finally Dawns on me oh yeah I this isn't going anywhere I need to get rid of this and I should have done it back when I first knew that it was a problem and that it wasn't going anywhere but it's that sunk cost fallacy where I think I've put so much energy into this I have to keep putting in energy and that's just not true sometimes if you do that self-reflection honestly you'll know that marijuana plant is a big pile of [ __ ] and you should just cut it down put it in the compost heap and move on and we don't we don't with jobs we don't with relationships we don't with relatives we anytime we've put a ton of energy into a project or a person we think we need to continue long after the point when we should have said you know this first harvest is also the last one and we just don't and we should is is is a species we have a hard time letting go and we have a hard time admitting failure yeah um because the perception is if I put in more energy I'll keep it from failing [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it's still gonna fail Sometimes the best things you can do is to realize that something has gone as far as it's going to and for your mental health physical health Let It Go just Let It Go yep so well that's that's some good advice cut the weed plant man cut the weed plant Let It Go shop it down when you know it's bad and it's not going anywhere just cut your losses and move on you'll be better for it and happier for it and so will your garden for more metaphors please contact Lea stoned Witches Hour at gmail.com she'll give you all kinds of great metaphors for Stuff absolutely will and now Lou is the god of creation of making things of um craftsmanship yeah he's a craftsmanship God all I can think of was I think Alou is like some guy like Whittle in a stick oh yeah that hot like woodworker guy yeah that's like sitting there with their jack knife whittling a s this is a great time to make things we talked about bread people make corn dollies which honestly do people really still do that you know I think they do because you can kind of uh I should not give people bad ideas but you can kind of manipulate a corn dolly and kind of turn it into a voodoo doll as well anything that looks vaguely like a person could be used in that type of ritual so actually around here you can you can buy them at multiple locations why am I not surprised I have a corn dolly that I have had for a good 25 years maybe wow it was given to me when I moved into my first house and it's a witch she's dressed up like a witch and and the corn Hustler dyed black and orange in some places you know for orange for hair and black for her dress and I still have her in my kitchen she's kind of she's lost her broom she's lost some of her facial features but she comes with me she's my kitchen witch she goes with me from Kitchen to kitchen and she's part of my my home my Hearth and Home type of altar you know she represents home to me I have one right here you do too my little my little C and she's flying her broom and oh I love that no I love your little corn dolly witch I have a little corn dolly witch too sweet corn was a tradition in New York State this time of year east coast probably still is remember Mi High by the 4th of July so by August 1 is not ready yet no I believe there are I have relatives out in the fingerlakes area hi fam but they're all doing the uh sweet orn stands right now they've all been raiding them so I guess the little bit of first fruits shell are trickling in you know what I miss about New York state is driving around on any random road on a random day and all of a sudden there's a big huge corn stand oh yeah stands are the nobody's there you just walk up you take your 13 because in New York you can take 13 for a dozen it's How We Roll you take your 13 and you leave your money in the little box thing no harm no foul I'm miss that you can't do that here in Massachusetts no one has corn on the road one of my brothers and his wife have a little farm do they sell corn on the road they do they do it's adorable they sell eggs from their chickens and corn and they make jams it's just adorable labar farms in um penan New York go see them everybody from all across the world go there go there they have excellent stuff and they're just adorable my little nibling Sullivan and Fisher are the farmers and they have a little sign of you call them niblings yes niblings is the instead of saying nieces and nephews niblings is the all-inclusive term for niece and or nephew and and I love it it's the cutest word so I just use nibbling now it's just adorable okay I just wanted to clarify it's so cute and they're so cute and they're the farmers and there's a little sign up in the farm stand with their pictures on it description of the farm it's freaking adorable a yeah so those are the fruit first fruits there but I personally I bake bread that's that's my crafty thing I like to go pick sunflowers because I love to have sunflowers to represent the Sun and Lou as well as the goddess's you know demer in my home I love sunflowers anyway so it's a great excuse to have them and they're huge this time of year and I like to bake anyway so I'll bake some sunflower bread or some other type of bread and that's kind of my Makey thing but I I know there's other crafts that people do that are magical and you had mentioned to me a craft that you're into lately that also fits in perfectly with this time of year I uh I actually have been diving into uh spell jars I love those they're so fun they're so cute um you know I was walking around one day on my lunch hour from work and sometimes when I'm bored I wander into some of the you know I was reading on trip advisor I think there's 20 n or 30 witchy pagany stores here in town I am so [ __ ] jealous you get bored go wanding around your [ __ ] neighborhood and can wander in any one of 29 different witchy shops so that's what I do sometimes on lunch because I don't need an hour lunch I I I could eat in 15 minutes here people so sometimes I just wander around and I go from store to store so I was in by the way no I was in Lorie store the other day hey she liked one of our things hi Lori hey girl how's witchy things and her daughter penny is also hi Penny Lori and Penny perfect Salem witches so anyway so Simon Enchanted their beautiful little shop down town and they have all these spell jars and I was like oh my God I love these things these are so cool so then you know my little mind starts a chugging I'm like huh I could make these well yeah spell jars are one of my favorite types of spells and you know also being close to the beach I have access to sand I have access to ocean water ocean water to Moon water awesomeness so I'm like oh I could really make what is a spell jar shell probably have some listeners who've never heard of one what is a spell jar and real quick side note I'm going to go grab a lighter I'll be right back go ahead so while Ila's getting a lighter to smoke luscious weed um spell jars so basically if you're thinking of of a spell generally it is a collection of either words objects mixtures of things what have you similar concept but you just dump this all in the jar what I'm doing is I am making for example I'll use a great example a protection jar everybody needs a protection spell jar who does it right so I am going to take my little spell jar and I'm going to put such things in it as I actually got some from my awesome fun Enchanted Store in saem Massachusetts they have an online store shop it great stuff so I got me some ground malachite oh for any listeners that don't know malachite is a that that green and black stone I don't know how to describe it with the wavy lines so and look at the jars they sell the ground malachite in oh how cute now ground Maliki is great for protection it's F but I never in my life heard of it ever ground like this is like see how it's like ground like sand it's pretty and it's in a cute little test tube jar with a nice little cork stopper and it's all like black and dark greenish it's beautiful it's really pretty it's beautiful sand how great to have that you can sprinkle that anywhere for protection I love that right but being in a sand form also I can put little p is in my spell my my little spell jars because like I said I was using the example of of a protection one so malachite perfect put a little couple sprinkles in now this is where you're going to get super super jealous like I'm not already I understand that some people fib and make stuff up but even if they're fibbing and making stuff up not that they would because they are awesome folk so enchanted sells graveyard dirt oh now even if it's not from an actual graveyard it's got these people are from Salem so this has to be from somewhere in Salem graveyard Salem dirt it's Salem dirt good enough for me how much do they charge for a cute little cork stopper vial of Salem dirt they call it graveyard dirt $7.99 and I mean this is a this is a pretty good I'd call it maybe what a 4 inch high jar good four five inch cute little like what do you call these like test tube size jar with a flat bottom with nice little cork in the top almost like a skinny elongated pot jar the malachite the ground malachite was $12.99 same size jar totally worth it come on now now those are excellent things to put in a spell breaking or a protection jar or keep away jar that type of thing I love that and also um I had gotten little I was able to obtain little tiny uh squares of parchment paper so what I would do with my spell jar is like for example if it was a protection one I might write out a little protection poem or a little protection blurb of words my own little spell so to say write it on that and then roll it up real small and shove that also in there I also I don't know if I have them right here to show you but I got some Crystal you know you can get those like Stone flakes yeah I have like a variety of a bunch of different Stones including um some of obsidian some uh clear quartz crystals and they're like chips that's what they're called chips so I got a bunch I got a container full of them and a variety of of different Stones so that I can use them and and depending on what it is um I can put an Associated little chip Stone in my little spell jar I also got some oils one thing I like to do is I like to make my own herbs and oils remember when people used to call me the herb lady I do I do do remember do I make I I I don't necessarily go out and like Buy protection oil or love oil or money oil or happiness oil you know you know how you can buy those pre-made I have a plethora of individual oils and I kind of make my own so I would blend up something with the intention of whatever my spell jar is for if it was protection so to say you know I might put like some eucalyptus and stuff in there some five finger grass oil or something yep or in a pinch lemongrass even works but um uh and and then that would be the liquid I would kind of split the liquid of the spell jar because I like to put liquid in mine some people do some people don't I do so I would make it half of the oil and half probably ocean water depending on my intent that ocean water may or may not have been charged under the full moon prior to being put in the spell jar depends on the intent and where I'm going with it it really does and I love that you have all these components that are that can be tiny because spell jars don't have to be large they don't have to be the big mason jar or they can be very very small little teeny expensive is when you don't need a freaking eight pound spell jar folks some of the ones I get you can get them at the dollar store actually and I think they're listed as like between three and five milliliters so I mean we're not talking big jars here I mean you can make big beautiful elaborate ones if you'd like but you certainly don't have to the intent of a grain of malachite is the same as a whole Rock of malachite right and and that's the point with these jars is is and I think a little goes a long way a little goes a long way and it really is about charging it with your intention and some of the first spell jars I ever did weren't in a jar at all the first one was in a Ziploc bagg [Laughter] a spell baggie a spell baggie and it was a you ever heard the freezer spell to freeze someone that's a very common one and that was my first spell jar quote unquote I took a baggie and I did a ritual where this person who would not leave me alone I was being harassed in all sorts of horrible Ways by this person and I really just wanted them to leave me alone I had tried everything i' talked to them other people had talked to them and it was just constant harassment so I did a spell and I wrote this person's name down on a piece of paper it was notebook paper I wrote it on the notebook paper you didn't you didn't use parchment paper no he in I know I know I'm so bad I was such a bad baby witch so regular ballpoint pen regular notebook paper in a circle wrote their name on it and then I just took a Ziploc and in that Ziploc I put some gosh I don't even remember I think the first time I did one of those back when I was like a teenager I think I literally just put a picture of the person in a bag a water and put it in the freezer like I didn't put nothing in it I just filled this bag with a picture in water done goodbye yep that's what I did it was their name it was water and it was a couple herbs it was maybe some Sage maybe a little Sandalwood uh maybe a little bit of Five Finger grass maybe in it and that was it and like you said ZIP that ziplock up threw it in the freezer and forgot about them and it worked they left me alone that's a spell jar right there the problem with those is it has to stay Frozen and Once it thaws you you could potentially run into trouble so you kind of have to make sure it stays Frozen unless you live in the Arctic Circle and then you're good there you go and then you have no problem the second one I was involved with but it wasn't a spell of my own and this one I do not recommend because this spell was done by someone who was learning witchcraft with me at the time and I feel terrible for this but she was interested in someone and he was interested in her but he was kind of involved and so she wanted the relationship to get physical and he was a little reluctant and so to kind of encourage him to get to the point where it's physical she did a spell jar and what she did was we took a shell one of those really pretty spiral shells uhhuh and into that shell she filled it with rose water and some rose petals a teeny tiny rose quartz uh some drops of I don't remember what type of perfume his favorite type of perfume um some of his hair and and then as she did this spell she sealed it with red wax and then round it with um tied it off with string and then put that shell underneath his bed they did end up having sex and then they were never friends again and it was a huge huge problem but it worked she got what she wanted but it doesn't necessarily have to be a jar I just wanted to show you this this happens to be one that I bought in Downtown Salem that's gorgeous six seven inches tall that looks like a a good size like whiskey bottle it it is it is it's it's it it actually is it's super cool got some sand some dried plants in here um one thing I thought was cool is they actually had mini tarot cards in here that's cute so I have a mini tarot card in here you can see on the back they have a a big red feather and then they put a little spider charm on it a little spider and exact opposite of what we were just saying spell jars can be large they can be decorative I think the point is they can be whatever you want them to be and a spell jar doesn't need to even be a jar exactly exactly especially this time of year if you made a spell jar to to bring abundance to your home to bring groundedness to bring happy family Vibes to your house if you made a spell jar and you made it large and beautiful and and put that in a prominent place in your home every time you or someone else sees that spell jar it's going to reactivate that and and put those those Good Vibes back through your home again so it can be large it can be decorative like shelle said it can be anything intent this is also as you can see a spell jar that I made I was going for my raiki master and I was trying to help myself along with some things and I created a spell jar and what I did was I took seven chips a chip from each of the associated raiki stones and made this spell jar with those Stone chips so there's nothing in here but the chips in water yeah you're holding just a little it's a small narrow half inch wide vial it's about 2 in tall it just has a screw top and I can see that it's got water and a coule like seven small stones in it's beautiful like the chips yeah so it's it's it's about your intent in what you're trying to to to put into it it's not about fancy ingredients or let me go spend $100 on this that or the other it's not about your tools all the time it's about your intention you know if I can't find Five Finger sweet grass somewhere I can go out and pick grass from my front yard and in my mind make that you know what I'm saying I do I do if going out to your yard and picking any types of herbs that's your home that's your ground that's going to be a grounding plant that's going to be a a safety a a security thing I mean whatever home means to you if you go pick some grass from your yard that's what that grass is going to do you know I was I was joking uh with with my with my boyfriend the other night because we were talking about you know the graveyard dirt and I said I had made a joke I said well either way it's Salem dirt graveyard or not and he's like then why don't you just go out in the backyard and fill a jar with dirt because that's Salem dirt too you know I was like touche man touche good freaking Point well much like when we were on the podcast um we all pod down here lived in the town burkettville where the The Blair Witch Project was filmed and people were just selling rocks out of their yard as rocks from burkettville you could just start jarring up in in those cute little tiny mason jars you know you could just start jarring up some dirt from your backyard it's salum dirt [ __ ] yeah you know I'm just hey why are there all these holes in your backyard man I Got Dirt upon that's right that's right I'm making bank you know hey if you're if you start digging for that New Garden or whatever just save some of that dirt and sell it on Etsy seriously but so yeah I've got my dirt I've got my malachite um I've got my oils I got a couple Stones I got some herbs and then I'll round it off my spell jar with sealing them with wax um because I like the whole seal it in the whole intention and idea of sealing it in so I will round off my spell jars with with the wax Steel on the top if you're going to make a spell jar at home as a beginner I recommend to a couple things one I recommend a jar that you like pick something out at a thrift store or at the store or use a baggie whatever you need whatever you have at hand then if you're not sure what to put in it pick one item from each element pick some type of herb or incense to represent air that goes along with what your intention is pick a stone or again an incense or something to represent fire it could be a picture it could be something that makes you emotional whatever fire means to you find something that presents fire and put it in that jar water could be your ocean water or your moon water it could be tears it could be saliva it could be whatever you need to put in there could be an oil yep could be an oil could be some type of carrier oil and then for Earth put in a stone put in a food put in you know put in something that represents that earthy groundedness to you and then put in something to represent Spirit or heart or soul in that jar and then seal it with wax with a string and then put it someplace where it's not going to be Disturbed out in the woods sometimes people will throw it in the water we don't really would like to not litter and this is essentially litter so make sure you're not putting it someplace where it can hurt anyone and but you also want it someplace where it's going to be concealed and not get opened or destroyed so that your intent can stay um I'm actually making one for a friend a Protection One a home protection one and I have uh actually instructed that person to bury it somewhere on their property makes absolute sense if you're if you're doing it for something at work maybe you should put it in a drawer something of your desk at work or or like you said if it's to protect your home keeping it in your house or burying it something secret on your property makes total sense let me tell you I have one at work actually I keep it right on my desk because everybody's oblivious to my you know for living in Salem and working in Downtown Salem they're a little bit oblivious to some of my witchy desk Paran but I actually have uh something on my desk for anti-anxiety because I I am in a a public forward-facing position and you know how people are so um yeah I have an anti anti- anxiety one at my desk at work just to try to keep Emotions level in my work environment because and you know my environment emotions can get high in what I do and I try to keep that calmness in my space at work yeah for me for me and everyone around me that's right staff staff and customers alike um I I do try to convey that peaceful bubble in my space yeah and spell jars are fantastic for that they're a great physical representation of the energy that you have put into some type of spell workor and they continue to kind of radiate that spell and radiate that energy for the life of the jar and I love those for that you know I do want to just as a side note because I have to tell you this because it was super hysterical I love how we've progressed you know remember when you and I had a job at the same company like Dar Pentacles or we had people be like I can't believe you wear that at work and right right you know you and I were like why wouldn't we duh but remember that like hard time we would get back then yes so the other day I'm walking around to all my witchie stores bored on my lunch I come back to work and I have this big purple bag with like the gold paper sticking out of it smelling like nag Champa like nobody's business and I go back to work and and I set it on my desk and the person who sits in the cubicle next to me was like wow that your your bag smells really good she's like oh what did you get at lunch and I just looked at her and like like I said for for being in Downtown Salem some people are just oblivious to the world around them and I just Stone coold looked her in the face and I go it's so wonderful when you need witchy supplies and you work in Downtown Salem and can just go get them on your lunch and she goes like witch stuff and I go yeah and she just kind of turned away and started typing that's so funny I got this big old bag on my desk from Enchanted I've got graveyard dirt and a little bit I actually actually later in the day I did show another coworker I'm like yeah look at this graveyard dirt I got and I mean people are looking at me like I'm not so cuckoo and I'm thinking look I literally literally work in the heart of Downtown Salem how is this shocking to you that's so shocking to you I'm surprised I thought you were all witches there I thought everyone was a witch in everyone in Salem is not a witch FYI who knew who knew breaking stereotypes all the time yeah exactly not you know and everybody in Salem is lovely absolutely lovely but not everybody not everybody in Salem is a witch unfortunate unfortunate but so spell jars are a fabulous way to celebrate any any holiday actually but they're a great thing to make for lamus and you could I just find them pretty and fun and and you know the one I showed you that I had purchased downtown that had some dried um grains in it and some dried foliage out there so you know if you are getting your crop you know taking your first crops in for the season you can take whether it be leaves off of that like I'm growing girk and pickles right now and you Lea you know I'm not a grower I know you usually kill them they're still alive cats and it's the only thing I can keep alive but I am growing these girkin pickles because I'm on this this this thing where I am dead set to can at least one can of freaking girk and pickles yay so these things are growing and I was actually gonna take a leaf off of my because obviously the pickle isn't the leaf um but it's part of the plant and I was going to actually take a leaf off and use that for for some random Rando spellwork because I actually grew this like it's a amazing you you of all people know how amazing of a feed it is that I'm actually growing something the fact that it has not died yet and might actually produce some type ofin cucumber that you will turn into a pickle I I am very impressed I cannot wait to see the canned results like if this actually pans out and works I'm going to have to like post a video or something because the fact that like I've even grown it from a seed to what it is so far is amazing it's absolutely impressive you know what better way to celebrate llamas than with your own pickles how fun so I I will actually probably use some of the excess of that plant and add it to my herb collection I might not use it right now in the moment but I will probably dry some of the leaves from that and and add it to my herb collection just for the sole fact that damn I made that grow and I really really love that because as far as I know and please listeners correct me because I might be wrong there are no known magical uses for cucumber leaves I don't well you know what I can create my own because it's all about my intention and what I want to do exactly and what is more powerful than the leaf of a plant that you grew and nurtured from a seed I love that especially since the gods and goddesses have the the for knowledge that it's so unlike me to have something actually grow yes so to have that energy that growth energy that living alive wonderfulness that that you were so much a part of that's powerful so okay there's no magical association with cucumber leaves there is an association with you and something that you grew and you put your energy and intent into my creation and and and taking something that I personally created I can manifest that into a multiple of of different intentions yeah and we can all especially creativity that would be perfect for me to use in a creativity spell jar because it's something that regardless of what it is I created it and I'm now taking what I've created and using that to project more creation boom there it is you could even go several steps further and use that as an enhancing Herb in anything where you want where your intent is to grow something grow your wealth you maybe you want a house and you want to grow that security any anything you could use that those leaves that you gathered from the cucumber plant in any spell just because you can't find a particular usage for a cucumber Leaf in a spell book that you buy at a bookstore doesn't mean you can't use it for intention and I think that's one of the things about witchcraft as a whole that I like is that if I don't have eye of new which by the way is not actually eye of new but if I don't have eye of new I can use something else and it's still going to work I just like to point out that eye of n is actually Mustard Seed they do look like n's eyes you're probably gonna put some in your uh cucumber in your cucumber Brian I bet you yeah no I'm actually really excited about trying to pull off making these gerkens they're so good I love homemade pickles they're delicious everybody so happy llamas
