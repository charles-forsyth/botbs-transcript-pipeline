join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm ilila and on this episode we'll be discussing imul a Celtic crosscar holiday celebrating the very first stirrings of life and the lengthening light and this year we'll be focusing on the Greek myth of deer and pany and I'm shell and you know imul is great the the myth of demer and pany is great but let's us not forget it is also Leila's birthday so yeah welcome here we are happy birthday happy birthday oh my God yeah it's almost my birthday in bulk February 1st is known the world over as Leila's birthday it is the day when the daylight is lengthening and the first stirrings of flowers and all the little baby creatures are being born and it's all because of me thank you that's the end of the episode We're Glad You Came and it's also when Lea is even yet older than I am that's right I continue to be way older than shell super super old real quick tangent I promise so that reminds me of a funny story now keep in mind dear listeners that I am like 5 foot nothing I am very very short and my friends I am shell included are very very tall I have like Amazon female like jeans or something I I'm tall and produce tall children and your daughter found out that I was the oldest person in the room and she could not believe it because by my height she knew I had to be the youngest and I still love your daughter the best because of that you know I I I actually remember that and I feel like at the time she was maybe 10 at the most and was actually taller than you at that point yeah yeah and now that my daughter is older and a mother herself God she Towers over you she everybody Towers I don't even know anybody who's your height yeah so the short queen that is me yes thank you it is my birthday it is also breed's day or bridgid day the goddess bridgid goddess of the wells The Hearth of smithcraft of crafting and another thing I'm totally fascinated with Groundhogs Day and it is not just a hysterical movie either I totally dig the fact that we as a people rely on a groundhog to dictate our belief in future weather I am all for the groundhog I am all for Punk Satani Phil and yeah for me that is also an equal part of him bulk especially now that I am a Pennsylvania resident St patani is definitely one of my minor Gods I would love to Boop his little nose he's so cute praise to punk saton Phil folks bring spring to us but that brings us back to why we're here and that's because it's it's not spring yet it's freaking cold right now we're in the midst of one of those polar vortexes so it's really really cold like I don't mean to be one of those hypocritical northeasterners but right now as we speak as I am on the waves of air right now a snowstorm is descending on us and I'm not happy we're supposed to get eight inches in the next eight hours and like no come on but it it is hard to kind of see those stirrings of spring when there's eight inches on the brink right exactly so this is this is the very end sometimes people say that it gets worse this time of year because the kyc the old woman winter is not quite ready to let go this is the time when you start to see the very first inklings of spring if you're lucky you know there's a visual for this sabbath that I love say you cut the sky the ground the Earth in a little side view the tree out on top with the snow covered land and then there's a little rabbit hole and then you see like this crosssection of the first stirrings of animal growth of plant growth of all of that kind of under the ground still but those stirrings are beginning they haven't popped out there's freaking snow out there man it's cold out there but on the inside on the underneath things are starting to stir kind of like magically or mentally you're starting to plant your seeds but you haven't like done the outward stuff yet because it's damn cold that's a great way to look at this time of year is through the lens of myth and metaphor because things are starting to stir even if you can't see them and the Greek myth of deer and pranie is what's called an iological an eological myth and basically that's a a story that's told to explain a natural phenomenon so this myth we've talked about it before in our hiate episode I'll link that in our old inbook episodes down below but this myth is basically that deer the goddess of grains and harvest life and the Earth basically I always felt that she was very very similar to hiate they're absolutely besties because hkat helps search for and then later protects pranie but hkat is the goddess of magic Crossroads the Knight the underworld Witchcraft and linal spaces deer is the goddess of agriculture fertility and the cycles of life and death she is very deeply tied to the Earth its cycles and its abundance and they're both goddesses of of transitions hiate at the crossroads of spiritual and the physical and deer through the cycles of Life Death and rebirth yeah very parallel panie is her young daughter just come into Womanhood she's just fairely a young woman and she is Promised in marriage by Zeus to Hades and Hades steals her away but but she really did kind of fall in love with him I understand that he kind of took her are you going there are you really going to go there it's not all kidnapping and bad I'm just saying I all right left turn really have differing views on this I never knew we're going to take a leftand turn we're going to go over the myth first I never knew this the original myth of Hades and pany is literally called the rape of pranie I didn't know that I swear to God I didn't know that that's the thing is a lot of people don't it's the rape of pranie and some people will say that the old word of rape just means to kidnap but that's just whitewashing the whole story she was kidnapped to be his bride she was kidnapped and raped and kept against her will and in the story she cried and lamented and wanted nothing to do with Hades she just wanted to go home to her mother she's a young girl 12 give or take like I totally have a totally different take on this oh my God so the historical myth is not great it's not great at all and she did want to go back to her mother there are some redeeming qualities because while she didn't want to be kidnapped or raped obviously she did grow to accept her position and became the queen of the underworld and accepted her duties there okay let me tell you the whole myth first the original myth says that deer goddess of agriculture was living blissfully on the earth with her daughter pranie in basically an eternal abundance in eternal Summer and one day as pranie and her best friend a nymph were walking through a Field of Flowers Hades burst up from the ground on his Chariot nabbed pranie in a violent abduction that was so violent that her best friend this nymph cried herself into a literal puddle of tears and when deer found out that her daughter was missing she was distraught and searched the world over for her and what she didn't know was that pran's father had given her to Hades and as the search went on demer basically stopped working and the crops and the plants started to die die the weather got darker and colder until it was only winter all the time deer was consumed with depression over the loss of her child and she pretty much stopped all work as goddess of grain and growing things and in the Underworld Hades was busy trying to persuade pranie that hey you know I abducted and raped you but I'm not a bad guy you should stay here you should like it it's a great place meanwhile panie is missing her mother she's missing the Earth she's refusing to eat or drink anything because she knows that if you eat something in the Underworld that you have to stay forever so while this is going on all the gods are freaking out over the earth going cold and they go to Deer to ask her to make the Earth alive and fertile again and she refuses she's too sad so then they go to Zeus and they're like hey deer's really depressed and Zeus is finally like fine I'll send Hermes the messenger god who also fairies souls to the dead I'll send him down to Hades and tell him to send pranie back to her mother so Hades knows he's going to lose the woman that he abducted he decides he's going to trick her into staying so while he's telling her that hey you know Zeus said you get to go back to your mom pranie is so excited and Haiti says why don't you have some of this honeyed pomegranate and she eats just a little bit of it six seeds just six seeds when she goes up to her mother her mother realizes that panie has changed and that she's eaten something in the Underworld and because of this they make an agreement that pranie will spend half the year with her mother and the other half in the Underworld and so when panie is with her mother we have spring and summer and there's abundance and life and growing things and then when panie travels down to her husband Hades the Earth starts to die and go silent and we get fall and winter so this explains that transformation of the seasons that's the traditional myth yeah I I've always known the story to be more a little different that yes that Zeus had kind of promised one of his daughters I I do get that but that Hades and panie every once in a while he would come up um from the underworld and they would interact he fell for her went to Zeus and was like look this is the daughter I want and he kind of was like oh okay you know I know I promised you and here you go now initially she was you know kind of that what do they call it the the bride you know that where you have to marry someone because your parents made a deal when you were young so she went because it was an obligation you know she understood that this deal was made and she had to go and she didn't want to go and you know who wants to be kind of sold off um by their parents but that over time he treated her very well he you know made her the queen of the underworld and kind of treated her in a way that she did fall for him but very much wanted to be with her mother actually was funny because I I I almost feel like it's like my daughter and I and that you know she really loved him but also missed her mother and he didn't want her to have to choose because he felt that if she had to choose she wouldn't pick him so he gave her the pomegranates because the myth of the pomegranates was if your captor quote unquote captor gave you food then you would always return so he gave her the pomegranates so so that she would always come back after spending time with her mother but that she told her father you know I love him and I do want to be with him but I love her and I want to be with her and it wasn't agreed upon you'll spend half your time with your mother and half your time with your husband now this is a myth and it's a myth again told to explain the changing of the seasons and I do feel that myths should be living you should know what it was but a lot of times things should adapt and we need to look at things through a different level sometimes who was the person that told this story where did it come from and why did they tell the story what did they stand to gain from it and so if it was told particularly through the lens of misogyny or through colonization you know if we've done something to a goddess to pull her power away from her we need to reframe that and look at it differently the pany myth bugs me a little bit because I do want to give her strength I do want to give her agency but also feel like the retelling now that turns pranie and Hades into some sort of L struck power couple also completely erases the fact that he didn't come up and get to know her he rose up out of the ground snatched her so fast that her belt dropped and her best friend that was with her cried and cried and turned herself into a puddle because she was so distraught but the the story I've come to know starts prior to that that he had met her prior to that and he didn't didn't snatch her up until after like I am still shocked that we have different versions of this well the the modern retelling again is basically the whole I can fix him Troke to me it sounds like this guy rapes her holds her against her will and now she's got you know Stockholm syndrome and think she's in love with him see I see it kind of like that kind of like Beauty and the Beast you know Beauty and the Beast also a shitty story he's a really shitty guy I'm taking a back I am taking a back here well the prapan and Hades myth is not a good story there is a modern retelling of it that does try to make him into a not bad guy he didn't rape her and kidnap her they fell in love and and her mother was the one that's controlling and a bad person and I don't know if I love that I don't know how I feel about that yes I love the idea that pranie came into her power as a woman she was a young girl with her mother she went through something very traumatizing and very shitty became that Queen and became a queen because of it but I don't I don't need for her to be in love with Hades I don't need for her to fall in love with her rapist in order for this to be a strong story damn damn I don't even know what to say like my perception is blown right now there are some beautiful current myths about pranie and Hades and how strong they are and what a wonderful glorious underworld couple they are and I don't want to take anything away from that because again myths change stories change as people do and I'm okay with that but understand that where the story originally came from was rape and abduction and Terror and being held against her will I seriously what I watched too many Disney movies even if he then tried to make it good for her and they did eventually have an agreement and and a relationship it's not a love story it is a woman coming into her power Despite All Odds but it's not a story damn I don't even remember what the Disney movie was called but maybe I watched that movie too much I don't think Hades is like the devil I don't think he's a bad guy I I'm not ascribing to him like evilness in that particular instance yes he did an evil shitty act CU see I always thought it was demer is kind of like the helicopter Mom right and so here you take this really great relationship mother and daughter and she is so upset that her daughter was kidnapped that she turned the world upside down she literally turned off all growing things while she searched for her daughter with her best friend hak yeah but that sounds like something I would have done when my daughter went to college that doesn't mean I didn't need to cut the cord I just felt like it was more like she needed to cut the cord and get over it your kid's grown up and yeah there's our messages there too you know if we tell the story that way there can be lessons that you can learn there you know maybe that was the lessons maybe that was the lessons I needed to learn with my own daughter and that's how I warped the sure right yeah you know sometimes we're pranie sometimes we're demer and sometimes we're Hades you know it just really depends on where you are damn so anywh who for imul this is kind of when panie takes her her underworld time her her duties however her punishment I don't even know what to call it now because my perception is Warped even in the original myth she did accept fully accept and fully perform that role of Queen of the underworld Queen of the Dead she very much did take that it's just the love story part that's a little sketchy she fully grew into Queen this is the time when she is still underground as Queen of the underworld and it's time for her helicopter mom to realize she did just fine without her daughter and that when she comes back in a few weeks they can start up Spring together yeah that's right because pranie is in that period where she's she's moving up she's heading back to her mother so her mom can get ready to bring spring back to the world so in gardening and I love this there's a thing called the prapan period and what the prapan period is it begins the last day that has 10 full hours of daylight starts the prapan period and that's right around lamus August 1st and then after that that's when pranie begins her journey to the underworld and she reaches it on sin and now on imul according to and I looked this up in Salem Massachusetts the first day that will have 10 hours of daylight February 1 and that is when pranie yes hell yes hell that's the end of the pany period so that is when she begins her journey from the underworld back up to the world to be back with her mother on oara so this isn't spring imul is not spring but it's those first stirrings it's when pranie is beginning her journey out of the underworld and her mother's starting to get happy enough to know that she's coming back that you might see crocuses or snow drops or those first shoots of grass you know honestly having been a northeaster our whole lives we we are well aware that this is actually probably the beginning of the coldest part of winter for us for some damn reason imbal to ostara is the coldest point of the Year here it's like you have to go through hell before you can get to the rebirth and growth more right right it's the it's the kiac it's that old woman winter trial by frozenness it's that old woman winter and she doesn't want to let go right this is her last gasp this is when she's the angriest so deer is pissed because she's waited long enough for her daughter and wants her to come back now you know I kind of feel that right when it's this cold I can definitely feel it when I go outside that's for sure no I was sinking more than demanding my daughter come home part but you know hey I am kind of also a helicopter mom so I feel this whole story you know there's lessons for all of us in this story I guess and that kind of fits with the groundhog myth which is not a pagan thing I think that's like a German uh weather thing but you know it's it's coming up out of the ground it's the same idea I look at it as a holy day with punani okay we talked in the winter season about going within taking this time of quiet when the earth is sleeping in cold to do a lot of inner work to go within on yourself to work on your magic work on books of Shadows but see I look I look at imul is almost like the list making you know I love a damn good list the list making holiday you know like what seeds am I going to plant for for the next however long you know what things do I need to get in order you know you've had that time to be within now let's plot and plan next steps where are we going now that could just be my Super O over organized brain but this is like organizational time plotting and planning that's the best way I can put it just like pranie is beginning her travels her Ascent up from the underworld we are also coming up and out of that plotting and planning getting our Gardens planned thinking about the spring what are we going to do what festivals are we going to go to what camping are we going to do this year what's your to-do list for the next however long right and imul is one of those times when I like to get in my basement pull everything out of the corners pull out all my camping and gardening and Outdoor Equipment and clean it up and organize it what do I need to prepare exactly list making I'm telling you I do love a good list myself I love journaling bullet point journaling is also journaling that works too don't even don't give me that bullet point journaling it's called a list lists you just try to make everything into journaling I do it's true it's very true so what are some of the things that you can do if you are wanting to celebrate imul if you're feeling that prapan energy the queen of the underworld waking up to spring for some reason I'm all about the whole candle aspect of this sabbath I like a good candle and and that fire growing because that's really what this is is kind of lighting the spark and that fire growing and Bridget is a fire goddess she's Fire and Water you know so you you've got the snow you've got the candles it's perfect and you know of the one of the names for this holiday is also candle mass and I I I do kind of like that get that spark going back to the whole getting organized you got to light the spark before you get the flame you got to have the flame before you can have the fire and if you don't have the fire under your ass where you going and February 1 is a great time to light all the candles in your house it's also a great time to re bless your house and you know light a few birthday candles that's right lighting your candles in celebration of Leila and the spirit of of Leila will come and honor your house with abundance and cannabis and magic and Witchcraft and all good things all good things to your home I do like milk so if you want to put some milk out to honor the holiday and as an offering to the land spirits and to St Leila of the weed that would be cool too now quick question what's that I'm glad you said that actually because I almost forgot we had a listener ask how do you handle because milk is a popular thing for imul how do you handle that if you are lactose intolerant or or cannot have dairy and such things well you don't have to drink it to leave it out for the land Spirits or to pour some out to honor the land or to honor New Beginnings doesn't have to be something that you drink yeah my whole thing was if you were going to drink it you know almond milk soy milk whatever whatever milk substitute you use it's all about intention it isn't about what it came from you can also use honey so honey and bees are associated with Bridget and thoughts of spring and also the color of honey that gold color looks like sunlight cheese if you can tolerate cheeses I know sometimes hard cheeses work but cheese is fantastic for this as well but baked bread baked muffins baked cookies all these are wonderful ways to celebrate honey especially because it it has that golden color to celebrate the sun and the returning of sunlight again that pany period those 10 hours of sunlight start on February 1 I can't wait I can't wait me either I am so so ready bye ulk not only am I ready to get out and celebrate my birthday but I'm also so excited to get out because the sun is coming back you can notice that things are warmer and nicer and a little bit sunnier outside that abundance of spring is right around the corner well in the calendar reminds me too last year in our episode you talked about the Salem fog and the imul drinks that you had they had Earl gry tea I believe Rosemary lavender vanilla vanilla and some cream right um actually it's like um steamed cream oh okay but again you know if you are are lactose intolerant you know it could be almond milk or soy milk or or whatever but to kind of make it the fog it has to be steamed and lavender and rosemary are sacred to Bridget so you could use those those are great and for pany there's always the pomegranates dark chocolate they represent that luscious queen of dark as she prepares to return to the fresh newness and inspiration of the spring season so you could work with those in ritual to represent prapan still underground you know the quiet and the dark that are still there and honor that as you and she prepare to move upward and into the spring you know I'm not big on like just going to the store and getting a pomegranate and cutting it and na on it but this is the one time where yes that is absolutely the case you could also take a milk bag bath if you didn't want to drink the milk you could also put a little bit of milk in your bath it's supposed to be very very good for your skin and that's a good way to celebrate as well personally I'm going to repot a bunch of plants because growing things are big for imul and since I can't grow a lot outside I'm going to repot a lot inside maybe I'll pull out my Devon Hunter book you know that reminds me I am going to have to post an update on my plants cats haven't killed them yet people y actually let me tell you a little secret here we're going to divert to the plants here since you brought them up I have been doing a good job I have been a good plant owner I have two cats I love them they are  and I don't understand what it is I feel like they're eating them just despite me I've got new growth I've got good growth but we're not expanding it at crazy wonderful rates and I swear to God people it is not because of me the cats are demons and I'm showing Lila right now to get her reaction but like she can see that there's a bite hole there's a bite hole it looks like one of them is chewed down yes but you see this one after they chewed it down it's starting to grow back like I am doing you're doing great I think they're trying to get their spring greens off of your spider plant like I've even put them by the window like I've got W look how good that one's doing like like there's new growth like I'm doing my best you're doing so good but if you look look at this Leaf right here that's like half eaten like it's not me I'll post pictures folks all right so back to inbook whether you ascribe to the modern myths of pranie where she's in love with Hades and Hades is wonderful or you ascribe to more of the original there's a lot to be learned from that myth it reminds us that rest and reflection and even the hard are essential they're part of life's natural rhythms they prepare us for growth and for Renewal and these hard situations this story offers wisdom about transformation and resilience and the power of honoring cycles and pran's dual role as both the queen of the underworld and the bringer of Spring's renewal really mirrors the themes of imul you know the the goddess bridgid goddess of water and of fire and imul really sits on that threshold in that Lial space between the darkness of winter and the light of spring you know this season can really teach us a lot about introspection and creativity and finding Harmony in those Transitions and you know I think our differing views on that is really kind of a a good lesson for you to learn and depending on the source of where you learned information can depend on your perception of it so take in a lot of different sources and and see what works you know there's something to be said for viewing these older myths through a different lens you know we want to view them through an empowering lens and sometimes in the case of some of these myths like uh a lot of the Norse myths the etas those were written by Christians they took stories that had been handed down from person to person orally someone from outside that tradition interpreted them and wrote them down and so that you kind of have to peel back the layers to find what the truth is instead of you know how it was perceived by a different person but the pany and and demer myth yes it was in Greek and we translated it but that's not something that we can peel away the misogyny from to find the real story it's not like they told the story to break pranie down you know what I'm saying yeah this wasn't told to take a powerful goddess and and make her smaller yeah so the original is a myth that explains the changing of the seasons through a tale of a mother's love and a young woman's journey to heal herself and reclaim her own power and for some reason people had to change it to a love story because I don't know everybody loves a bad boy or whatever and I love a bad boy too don't get me wrong but telling it that way takes away a lot of pran's power and her agency by reducing that Story of Survival and strength to Simply a love story I'm gonna I'm gonna read more into this because I'm just flabbergasted at our different views and it's not not that I don't like reimagining myths I mean I do I just want people to know where they come from who told them and why they were told in the first place and then also know why they've been redone from a different perspective what was the reason someone wanted to retell it I mean I I do understand that some folks in In some cultures are kind of betrothed to to others maybe against their will or what have you because of customs and and whatnot but I have heard and and not that I am any expert on this by any means but I have heard of some of those ARR arranged marriage oh wow that was what I was looking for you do hear stories of some of these arranged marriages where like you know one or both people go in miserable and apprehensive because like who the hell wants to marry a stranger that your parents made a deal about but they go into it and they do eventually kind of create a bond and create a love for one another and it isn't all horrible in the end and I'm not saying that there isn't cases where it is cu there absolutely are but there are arranged marriages that can have a quote unquote happily ever after and I guess that was how I kind of perceived that story was like an arranged marriage that just did end up having it happily ever after if you look at it through that I can definitely see you know the empowerment from it but even in an arranged marriage It's usually the son of one family is arranged you know to to marry the daughter of another family but this was even worse than that this is this is your dad's first of all your dad's brother but this is your dad's age friend this is your dad's contemporary who's like hey your daughter's hot tell her to marry me which is very different like I said maybe I just disi disneyfied it for my brain I don't know I have a hard time with disn ifying things but the the lesson about you know letting go of your daughter when she grows up that's a good one you know to look at it from that lens and I and I hadn't really thought of that until you brought it up that's a really good point yeah you know kind of cutting the cord is the way I can can think of it at the moment but kind of take that step back kind of let them be the adult they are now you know what I mean and as a parent who had to do that that's hard so all right so let's bring this back from disneying stories to like magical and Witchcraft and so how can whichever version of this myth the going within the going down to the underworld and being Queen of the underworld accepting that power and then coming back up and bringing spring with you that's a big responsibility how can we apply that like I said kind of make those lists what are my magical goals what what seeds am I looking to plant you know what are those stirrings within that I need to act on what lessons did I learn in this dark period that I can bring forward with me into the spring right you know you you had this time to reflect okay now what now it's kind of the now what phase you know take all of that and how are you going to put that into action what's your action plan and you know magically sometimes it's just going to be light in those candles and what's what's my plan January 29th is the new moon and then February 1st is the first day of 10 hours of sunlight it's inul and I love the idea of taking that time it almost seems like the Opposites it's the dark going into the light right right you can take that time the 29th this new moon that's coming up to write your list to to write down the things that you're leaving behind in the dark half of the year and what are you going to bring with you as you walk up from the underworld to the spring what are you going to plant so what are you leaving behind and what are you bringing with you I love that so take that time from the 29th to the 1 and then on the first shell won't because she hates early mornings but maybe go out and look at the dawn see the dawn come up who looks at the dawn weirdos like me who get up way too early because we can't sleep but get up look at the Dawn and celebrate the sun celebrate that actually this is a favorite time of mine for fire scrying here's why because if you start looking at so you got your candle here and you are looking at this Wick you are looking at the nothingness of the Wick the coldness as you light that and I like to look at it as you light it as you light it you watch it go from that nothingness that fire creating that glow what is that spark saying yeah fire scrying for me good time this year because I do kind of get that candl mass Vibe I keep that whole aspect of it that the light from within in fire to me is very action related uh related to the tarot very or just very action where am I going what am I doing how am I getting it done this time of year that action is what you're going to need to push you into the next phase and I also like spirals for this time of year you know represents that coming out you know start from the middle and draw spirals spiraling out combine it with fire scrying if you can have some scrap paper or your book of shadows while you're fire scrying and just relax and start to draw Spirals and just kind of let your hand go do a little automatic writing while you're doing your fire scrying you know that can really help you get in touch with your subconscious yeah and I was also thinking you know burn away the things that you've realized you must kind of get rid of use that fire to kind of burn it away yeah again starting to prepare it's a little mental spring cleaning burn up that stuff that you don't want to take with you you know that's a good way to explain it mental spring cleaning there you go see and then write it down Journal it get it away you had to get the word in there you had to get that journaling word in there didn't you I did because although it's nice to burn the things that you want to get rid of it's scientifically proven that you are more likely to follow through with things if you write them down so making your list and writing in your journal the things that you want to grow I think it's like 42% more likely do it if you Journal it blah blah blah so spring is coming even though it's bitter freaking cold right now and pranie is the badass Queen of the underworld whether her husband is a complete and total dick or a loving caring dude or not yeah and you know there's a lot of us that have been married to that guy before so you know it's true the whole I can fix him I can fix him I swear that's real you can't no you can't no but celebrate the returning of the sun celebrate these new daylight hours celebrate Bridget and deer and pranie and all these goddesses that Encompass so much more than just spring energy and let's all take a moment and celebrate the goddess Leila happy birthday I love you I love you too thanks now check us out on Facebook Instagram Blue Sky all the places back on the broomstick we're there we we've had a holiday
