welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick in this episode we're going to dive into our grab bag of Facebook messages Instagram DMS and emails that all you lovely witches pagans and heathens have been sending us and try to answer some of your most pressing questions and interesting comments because goodness you guys are really keeping us busy with this and we thought addressing it on air might be one of the better ways to let you all know what's going on and give you some answers I love when we do question episodes since we're getting so many of them now maybe we'll have to turn this into a regular segment before I get too far answering your questions today I'm Lea and I'm shell and I love this because you guys have so many great questions and comments and what do I do I love it that's my favorite part every day after especially after we release a new episode people are always sending in Facebook messages or email comments and I absolutely love reading them so thank you all before we get into the questions I actually want to do a special shout out and a thank you to a listener named Gabriella and Gabriella emailed us back at the end of December actually and sent along with it a handwritten letter this thing guys I can't even this this warmed my heart oh it touched us both so much and we are so grateful that was the sweetest thing you know I just want to actually say that we're saying how grateful we we are about it but legitimately Gabriella Leila and I not every day is a bright sunny day and sometimes when times are tough we've actually gone back and read your email to kind of perk us up kind of give us that what we're doing people want to hear kind of thing like it's inspiring to us so we reread it a lot to kind of lift ourselves up when we're a little down we actually gave you a shout out and a thank you on an episode we recorded quite a while ago that has not for a bunch of different reasons aired yet so we wanted to make sure to give you a special shout out this time time and just say thank you thank you thank you Gabriella you're a sweetheart and we adore you as much as you adore us we hope the universe conspires in your favor and all your blessings come true so thank you so much Gabriella so that being said we also have a bunch of letters and messages that we have gone through and pulled out some that were particularly interesting or we thought everyone might want to learn from Mail Time Mail Time having kid flashbacks man I know I was just like a blue Clues Lord oh no all right so what have you got over there shell now I wanted to address this this is I've actually gotten multiple questions from multiple people about this so I kind of wanted to pull all of their questions into one little tiny conversation people want to know how we get our teas and smokables where we get our te's and smokables and how to pick teas and smokables the lack of a better word how to pick what you want especially in our salarium episodes we talk a lot about we love tea um we love the smokable stuff and we all know that y'all don't have these stores right around the corner from your houses so we just wanted to kind of touch on what we like where we get it how we pick it and maybe address some of those questions what do you think about that ilila I love that one because on our Spotify I don't know if everyone knows this but if you listen to our podcast on spot sptify on each episode you can actually put a question or a comment and one of the questions that we get asked again on our solariums for obvious reasons is where do I get my smokable herbs and what Blends where do you talk to me tell me what's up well like shell a lot of the things that I get are from local shops any place that sells organic herbs that haven't been you know touched by pesticides that are clean you can usually get your lavender rose petals and things there as long as they are grown safely and pesticide free however like shelle said not everybody has access to things like that so I also like to go to a place online called herbal spirits and they sell individual herbs as well as herbal smoking Blends two of my particular favorite Blends are the revend Del blend which is Mullen raspberry leaf lavender rose and chamomile and my second favorite is floating Egyptian oo that sounds good right it is very good and this one also has Mullen again I think Mullen should be pretty much in everything you smoke Mullen skull cap blue Lily wild dager Damiana and Rose and I mix these with my cannabis sometimes for spellwork sometimes for meditation sometimes just because I like them all good reasons exactly so herbal Spirits online is one of my favorite places but there are a lot of others out there so if you have a favorite online shop or local shop you know send them on let us know maybe we'll try out their stuff so where do you get your teas sha now tea is is oh I love tea but I got to admit I am I am sometimes that harried and helpless person who has to go get my tly tea bag from Wagman's hey nothing wrong with a little Wegman's prepackaged tea no problem exactly I have come across this place recently that I am just so in love with you know the last two times I was in there I talked to the girls there and I'm like this place is dangerous danger like they should have those danger signs outside because this place is so delightful I could just die and spend a whole paycheck in that care I live in a touristy area you know we we talk about it so I I will give them a touristy no Salem has a little bit of Tourism here so this place here in Salem not only if you come to Salem you can go there physically such a gorgeous shop this place is just I can't even it's delightful I could just literally I could spend every scent I have there and not be mad woman if you don't spit out the name of this place in the next 5 seconds but they also ship and do online too so for all you listeners who don't have a good tea spot in your local area these guys do ship online they are called deal Marcus and Company DM and Co these folks make I had this tea the other day Leila it was called banana bread I you not that tea tasted like banana bread it did and banana bread banana bread now I got this one yesterday I think it was this is like an Earl Gray cream like they have put like I don't know if they've added like some vanilla or it almost has almost like this light minty like Andy's candy kind of minty vanilla I don't know but it's like they have taken this Earl Gray to the next level they have one called the Queen's blend I'm dying over that's a you thing right there it is so me thing my sweet love he got himself I have to laugh because I've turned him into such a tea lover it's kind of humorous he got one called raspberry champagne oh now that sounds great I can't describe the taste to you other than Bliss that sounds like a Sunday brunch kind of tea it's really oh and not only do they have teas there they sell accessories which you know I'm an accessory horror honestly they have all the little tea balls they have the little tea spoons they even have your own fillable tea bags such a fan of that but they must have about if I had to take a gas based on memory I'd say maybe 50 75 different blends of tea that they blend on site and freaking fabulous man I can't get over it so DM and co uh if you go online and want to check these guys out it's deal marcus.com and they are located right here in Salem and I love them they're my new place to dump my paycheck there you go I said it there I said it now we also on our Facebook and our Instagram occasionally will feature smokable Blends or tea Blends that we've come up with sometimes with a spell or sometimes just to enjoy recently just put up a tea blend that we made for Kendra from Survivor I was going to say or sometimes we'll put up a Survivor te exactly exactly um but you know we do want to point out that we're just talking about places that that we like and we frequent we have no affiliation with these folks we're just lovers of their products that's right none of these people have paid so we're telling you don't ask me where I get my tea if you don't want to know is I guess what I'm you know herbal Spirits wants to sponsor us or if DM and Co wants to sponsor us I would not say no I a't saying no to nobody but I'm just saying that we currently are not affiliated with these folks but you're asking us who we love and we're telling you yep there's our honest opinion so there's our our witchy viewpoint on that and there's today's news there's today to the next question the next one now this one I think uh we might have both gotten from the same person on our Instagram and on our email in case you didn't know shell usually handles the Instagram and so if you get a DM it's usually from Shell I take care of the email and the Facebook so you'll usually get an email or Facebook message from me but occasionally we swap but I think this person texted messag us yeah and Melanie said that she had found our podcast a few weeks ago and was binging it like a lot of you do thank you we appreciate by the way we do and she really enjoyed the ancestor episode and she did have a question because she is adopted and she has no relationship to her biological family but she does know who they are and what her Heritage is she says that she's closer to her adopted family that she calls her real family and feels that the biological family were just a vessel to get her to her soul connections so her question is what ancestors should she recognize now I love this question I I loved this question too because I think that more people deal with with this than we realize and my answer was to check out both yes and I I like that too and you know we get this from a couple different angles maybe some people really don't get along or have really bad issues with their biological family right or they don't have any connection or knowledge or you know they don't know some people some people have found their biological families but a lot of people have not or maybe you start researching your bi ological ancestors and find out that they were really shitty people well there's that too yeah and you just don't want to call those energies into your life what do you do well the good thing is is that when you start with ancestor work you don't have to work with your parents or your grandparents you could just call out to ancestors that want to work with you now Melanie says that she knows what her um ancestral heritage is if she feels a connection to that say she's got Heritage from Italy or from Syria or from Spain or for wherever she happens to have ancestry if she feels a connection to that area or to that history she could start to research that and call out to people from that part of her line but she doesn't have to she can also work with her nonbiological family as well ancestors do not have to be blood related to you they can be I think just people before you yeah they can be bound by emotional ties they can be bound by Common Ground I have several ancestors that I work with that are not related to me at all but they were teachers in this life they were people that I felt close to in this life some of them are people from history that I feel a deep connection with and so I work with that energy when I do ancestor work so there's a lot of different ways to approach it that doesn't have to be biological DNA related you know I think probably the I don't want to say shortest easiest answer I can give is kind of like how we say with everything else there's really no rules here if you connect with these people as ancestors go with that and if you don't connect with people as ancestors don't and if they are related great if they're not related great but blood relation or non-blood relation in my opinion is irrelevant to ancest work I agree I very much agree and especially if you get yourself into space where you're going to be calling to ancestors maybe reaching out to a particular one or maybe just reaching out to see who comes to you your ancestors are going to know that you were adopted so if you reach out to your adopted family and their ancestors they're going to welcome you into the family just as much as your adoptive parents have there might be some ancestors in that line that wouldn't appreciate it they're not going to come through most of the time the ones that do want to work with you are the ones that are going to reach out and come through and if any negative energy comes in you can just choose to ignore it or not work with it exactly and you know these I feel bad that so many people think that everything is so you got to be in this box you got to be in this box there is familial ancestor work yes and obviously by definition of the words probably someone in your your bloodline would be someone doing familial ancestral work with but just general overall ancestor work you know we always kind of make a joke of it and and it is kind of funny but like I truly somewhere in the depths of my soul feel like I have somehow someway been a royal type person there I said it and and and I do have that connection to like you know I have that fascination with the English Monarchy you are related to them I you know it's so far you know princess damn it when my daughter did our our ancestry DNA thing yes I do have relations that tie back to the English royal family but they're so far gone that like I just feel like if I reach out to these people and they reach back their ancestors and if there really is a blood connection who knows I don't my daughter thinks she knows but I don't and it doesn't matter to me and I love that you said that because if you go far back enough we're all pretty CL all related to each other right but the other thing is I have had adoptees ask me about ancestor work who didn't know their Heritage who knew nothing about their biological family and they were like how do I reach out to these people and my answer to them was I never met my 100 times great-grandmother yeah I have no clue who she was she has come to me in meditations and we've had conversations and I work with her I've never met her so you don't have to know who your biological ancestors are if you're reaching out to them in that space and with that intention and you're open to working with that and working through what you find you will make connections with ancestors whether you're adopted or not well I think that was a pretty good answer we gave I think so too so what have you got next there shelle so I don't necessarily like putting out people's names because the way people do their Instagram handles you don't know if that's their real full first and last name we got a got a message from a a fine lady she knows who she is frequent commenter about 666 what do we think about 666 I love repeating numbers you know me I'm a number fan I love repeating numbers too anytime I see 666 you know what my first thought is what's that where is the 333 and the 999 because it's got to go 333 666999 because everything happens at threes but the question was specific on you know is that basically do we for lack of a better phrase buy into the Christian connotation of 666 the sign of the devil you know Satan's number and what yeah well okay I I don't mean to laugh but I am not Christian and so 666 as is a Christian construct um that has nothing to do with me I don't believe in their deity of the devil kind of I guess you know they have their own place in the pantheon I suppose but that's a Christian concept it's a Christian Fallen Angel slod whatever you want to call him not our belief system not our belief system for me 666 is is a triple number like 111 some people call them angel numbers some people call them Universal numbers again Angels aren't my thing so I tend to call them Universal or Cosmic numbers but six in numerology is is a good number it's love it's being gentle it's like the mom number you know it's like taking care of you it's it's a great number so 666 would just mean triple that or three times that amount in my opinion and you know people always say you know things happen in threes I the 369 thing for me has always numerology wise been a thing so to me it just kind of Falls in line with the 333 the 666 the 999 but I can see how society as a whole has kind of vilified 66 and I kind of think that that's where the question was coming from is that I think a friend inquired with her you know if you believe in this stuff what do you think about that you know it's kind of you know like you said Christians have vilified that particular number for whatever reason that's not my belief system so I can't really I can't speak to that for me it really comes down to the numerology aspect which I think is badass even though I don't know a lot about it yeah the the only other thing I have to say about that is that we talk a lot about archetypes on this show and that archetypes can have power in and of themselves because so many people believe a certain way right so many people believe that Friday the 13th is bad luck that can create bad luck for people because that's Frid 13th ain't bad luck it's just Jason's day that's right but that's a lot of that's a lot of power to pour into something you know if that many people believe it gives it power so the that there is a whole segment of population that believes 666 has a negative yeah so that can give it kind of a I guess a negative vibe a little bit but there's also a whole lot of people that it doesn't mean that at all so I guess it really depends on your viewpoint on that and in my response back to the listener was kind of summed up with check out what that means in numerology um because there is a whole thing with numbers and and it's not NE necessarily something that I'm super into or super familiar with but for anyone seeking what do number combos mean what you know what if I every time I look at the clock it's like 1111 or you know there's a big thing online all the time with 11-11 oh yeah you know check out some numerology books um Google some information about numerology because it is pretty fascinating and a lot of people are into it and it might kind of open up some some more information about other numbers other than 666 and if your if your magical brain if your subconscious is latching on to these repeated numbers there's probably a message there for you and you know maybe you should like shell said look into that a little bit now before we go to the next question I got to give you a little fun thing about 666 oh jeez what six is um a Venus number very often is like perfect love right so 666 maybe that's the polyamory number oh and that's why it's been vilified there you go you just cracked the code you just cracked the code I figured it out I figured it out so there's our thoughts on that one really I would have thought that that would have meant 3 three three ha funny all right what what's the next question we got you you know what what actually I want to go to a topic okay we're going to have a couple we have a couple questions about this topic so we're going to kind of put them all together and and have it be cohesive tarot my friend let's talk about tarot for a minute all right I love this topic I I've had a lot of questions about what our thoughts are on buying tarot on Etsy about buying it on some of the other less ethical sites that I don't know if we could mention or not okay I've I've been asked about Amazon basically what are your thoughts on where to get get a good Tarot deck if again you don't have a local aroundthe Corner Shop in your town where you can get a Tarot deck or you know maybe they do have a Barnes & Noble that has a Tarot deck section but R orwe isn't jamming with them or they have you know they have three decks there and they're just like me that's not what I want so I'll let you go first since I have the tarot Obsession I could talk all day where I buy well I have also gotten some messages about this as well um including in a recent episode we touched a little bit on how to tell counterfeit tarot decks because that has been an epidemic lately people have purchased them it's annoying it's annoying you know people are getting them not only on Etsy and online but on big box stores like Amazon and even at local metaphysical shops so you do have to use a little bit of caution and what we tell people is go ahead buy your decks online I think that's a great way but even if you go to a reputable place or someplace that has sold hundreds of decks make sure that the deck you're purchasing has an ISBN that you match to the number that it should have online and ask about the booklet that comes with it if you've checked out this deck online you should know if it comes with a booklet or a full-blown book and if they say it comes with a QR code instead that is 100% a tip off that it's counterfeit red flag red flag red flag some legitimate decks do come with a QR code but you would know that ahead of time if you look up the deck before you go to purchase it on Etsy so in that case we'll definitely just have a QR code but most of them will come with a book or booklet of some type now I've never bought a Tarot deck on Etsy actually I haven't bought anything on Etsy that's more of a me thing nothing nothing reflective of them but I have gotten one on Kickstarter that's different which is different and I I am an Amazon fan and I also obviously buy locally here in Salem which instead of me just Fanning out places if you Google shops to buy tarot cards and Salem I swear Google will give you 50 different answers and they all do online um back from where we're from great store um IM Maga they have tarot but I think that big places like Amazon and that I like them because I can find those hard to find decks and I do have a trust factor with Amazon I've never gotten anything bad from Amazon um every deck has been real but I've also made sure of that before my purchase you don't just buy stuff based on a picture you want to read the details but I've been surprised at how many local in-person stores not here in Salem um but we that we've heard from listeners are actually unfortunately getting duped as well and they're aining fake decks and unknowingly turning around and selling fake decks so I think the biggest thing we want to put out there is be aware of what you're buying whether it's in person or online because as much as you think this inperson thing is making it 100% legit you know we've had a listener that that had an issue with an inperson store but I love Amazon I love doing small business shopping via their websites so definitely if if you can find an a cult store a pagany type store online definitely throw your money their way before you throw it to the man in blue who drives the beautiful truck who delivers me great packages and if you're local metal physical shop but doesn't have a wide variety of tarot cards a lot of times they will be open to ordering them so if you ask them to order you a deck they should be able to help you out with that I will admit I've totally thrown you under the bus on multiple occasion shell I told I've told people that have reached out to me asking how do they know if a deck is fake or not and I have told them shell has nearly 180 decks I only have a few I only have a few dozen shell has like 180 so if you're concerned about whether a deck you got is fake or not let me know what it is we'll see if shell has it in her collection and we can compare it to what she's got and tell you if Sor I have it and let you know if it's a counterfeit or not but you know I think the most important thing is is that always check that to see if you got that ISBN number on it a counterfeit is not going to have that and you know as long as you got that number you should be golden yep and I know about saving a buck trust me I don't have 180 decks for reasons so I totally understand people wanting to go to that website that starts with a T that shall not be named you know and buying a beautiful deck that they've been wanting forever that only cost $5 I understand that I completely do that's why I am not against at all buying used decks people all the time get there's nothing wrong with a used deck nothing at all go on Facebook Marketplace go on people still use Craigslist go on Craigslist go on go to your local metaphysical shop maybe they have things posted up on a bulletin board there ask around there's actually if you have a a a community uh in your area or at a physical shop in your area some times they do free swaps yep and there's Thrift Books or places like that online where you can purchase secondhand decks secondhand books and things like that so don't be afraid to buy them secondhand if you want to save yourself a little bit of money gives some character that's how I look at it gives him character now I I am going to say that I have a deck here that is made by tarota Studios and they are an indie group and I don't think it has an ISBN number I'm looking over it right now like you said you get stuff on Kickstarter I also like to occasionally get short run decks or like personal Decks that people have made um there's a lot of printing places out there where you can print your own beautiful deck have it come in a box and everything I swear I'm going to do that one day me too I keep saying I am I have a half one completed somewhere but I don't think this has an ISBN number so if it is a commercial deck it 100% will have an ISBN number and you can look it up and see what it looks like and what it should come with online but if it's an indie deck or a personal printed deck it might not but again do your research ahead of time and you'll know if it should have that or if it's okay that it doesn't just buy all the tarot you can get your hands on fol that's right buy them all buy all the tarot that's that's all I can say buy all the tarot we will not shame you at all now someone also asked in the spirit of tarot what our thoughts are on using a deck for yourself and other people and we did touch on that on our episode with that but I just wanted to make sure that that we put it out there that whatever works for you and just because Lea and I do something doesn't make that some set in stone rule but I have used a deck for myself and for public readings and I've also kept decks where I only use them for myself or I only use them for public reading so I've done it both ways whatever floats your boat man whatever you're okay with energy wise yeah I don't have a lot to add to that I'm exactly the same I have Decks that I have used for myself and for other people and I also mentioned it a ton of times the witch's wisdom tarot by Phyllis kirat is my personal meditation deck that's my daily card poll work for myself you know do inner work deck and that's not something I would read other people with so I also do both so the last thing I want to say is from an old friend uh named Terry and I used to do tarot readings for her very often she would have tarot parties at her home and she has a deck of tarot cards from someone very close to her that passed on and she wanted to know what to do with them and now that is also going to be something that's deeply personal to each person in this particular case I was very honored that she offered those cards to me and I am very grateful and deeply deeply honored that she pass those on to me oh my God that makes me want to cry yeah um so they are cards can keep they certainly contain a lot of energy of that person especially if it's a deck like if you grab one of Shell's random 180 decks it's probably not going to be that personal but Decks that she you use all the time become very magical tools and become if you took that witches tarot from me that'd be a little different exactly exactly pry that Ellen Canon Reed out of your cold dead fingers right pretty much all three copies that I own that's right that's right but you know this can be something that you pass on to someone whether they left it in a will or whether you choose to keep it for yourself or to give to someone else that's deeply personal could you also just cleanse them and pass them on to the universe so that the next person who needs them could have them yes you certainly could whatever you are comfortable with that's right that's right in this particular case they're a close magical tool and so she decided to pass them on to me because she knows that I will take very very good care of them and cherish them so that's certainly an option do you have to no just like any magical tool that's something that's up to those of us that are here left to decide how we want to handle and honor those tools and that person so the same applies for tarot cards now I had one last uh question tarot related that I wanted to address um we had a listener ask what is the difference between the tarot the lomard and the oracle cards and I think that that is actually something we've never talked about is there are lots of cards out there and we always talk about tarot but there is the the lomard and there is oracle cards and they are all different they are now I know a lot of people really love the lerand cards and I am not super familiar with them only that they are like the more French version right it's yeah and and honestly I feel like it's a new insurgence of it because I think that it I don't feel like it was really all that popular until like the last three years four years five years so this is a particular deck that was made popular back in the 1700s early 1800s by Marie and L Normand and she was a a necromancer a fortune teller and she used cards to Divine Futures and so she created this deck from some of the original types of tarot decks and some of the there was an Italian deck that was more of a card are you familiar with that sh I'm not not necessarily um you know that was never something that was never a road I went down honestly I never heard of him until maybe 8 10 years ago and by that time I was so deep into tarot that I just never Fe I figured I've already I'm already buying too many decks of cards for one thing I ain't added to it at this point no um oracle cards I have had a LoveHate relationship with them in the beginning I didn't yeah I didn't like them when I first encountered them because I felt like they were tarot light I was a snob I'll admit it I think they're just I look at I look at oracle cards versus tarot cards kind of more like oracle cards are going to give you like The Cliff Notes the overview and the tarot cards are going to give you the nuts and bolts and the meat and potatoes of what you're asking the details yeah back in the day the ones I remember in particular were like your spirit animal cards or your fairy cards and they seem to be more for fun than for divination now holy crap there are some really good oracle cards out there there are some amazing decks there are but I still hold true to my my thought of that you're still just getting the overview with the oracle cards and if you want the Deets you got to go to the tarot I think it really depends I think it really depends on you know just like in Tarot there's some that I feel aren't giving me what I want the same thing happens with the oracle back I'm still a Tarot girl very much tarot but I think that the lermond has a place people really like that especially like you said especially now it seems to be super popular it's just a slightly different Tarot deck so it's a different system you'll have to learn if you're going to do that plus cards first of all and same with an oracle deck you're not you're not going to be getting 78 cards um in either of those two decks I think usually Oracle decks can range from anywhere from like 34 to like 58 yeah yeah and you'll see some less some more but I think that's pretty average is they're about half the size of a traditional Tarot deck roughly yeah and just like with tarot decks I recommend that you buy as many as you can no no shell I'm such a bad influence I recommend that you look through it if the shop that you're in allows you to sift through the cards look through the cards see if they feel right read through the book look at them online watch someone online do a reading or an unboxing I've actually bought Oracle just because I was so enamored by the artwork that I couldn't walk away oh absolutely that's one of the best reasons to buy it because that's when you're really going to find meaning is when that artwork and those cards are speaking really speak to you yeah yeah we've talked about the daily practice of doing like a one card poll or doing a journaling practice you can do that with oracle cards you can do it with runes you could do it with whatever type of divination that you like we just happen to talk about tarot more often yeah so those are the three things tarot lerond oracle cards we'll have to do a a Tarot specific episode at some time we'll do lots of tarot specific episodes that's a quick overview L Armand was created by a woman in France in the early 1800s late 1700s it's kind of tarot esque um and toochi I think uh possibly I think they are yeah I think it is related to the toochi if I'm not mistaken and then there's the traditional tarot which comes in 10 bajillion different flavors which shell is going to try every single one everyone and oracle cards which are coming in more and more different flavors some better than others but a very good tool to use just like tarot but differently I think I just can't help it that I can't get enough of tea and Tarot there you go hey that honestly that sounds like my favorite way to spend an afternoon so I'm not going to complain all right so one last question what you got for us this one I really liked because we had an episode entirely about H hak and we got some great questions and great comments and this person cat emailed us and they said that they found us on Morgan's podcast busy gritty in and witchy love Morgan from in goddess Creations over on YouTube so you can check us out check her out there but this person found us through Morgan's podcast and says that she is also back on the broomstick and the HEC episode really got her intrigued she has a confession she's been putting off studying hiate for a few years and she's met her in Crone form and keeps seeing the keys popping up here and there and at the time she wasn't up to what she knew hkat was going to demand of her and she says I'm still not if I'm being honest but maybe that's the first step so none of us are ready when hak calls ding ding ding and she's looking for some books other than the ones by cind Brennan there are some very good books that I do recommend Serita desty is an excellent uh historical author on hkat and she wrote circle of hkat and Lial rights both of which I do highly recommend if you want to learn more of the historical aspect of hiate I actually um back in the day I read a book this was a little bit ago but I read this book and I thought it was it was all right it wasn't horrible because here's the thing I want to preface what I'm going to say with this there wasn't a lot of books about hkat when I was really delving and Diving but I kind of liked it's called I don't even know I'm gonna have to look up I'll have Lea look up to where you can obtain the the author's name but it was uh keys to the crossroads that ring a bell keys to the crossroad hiate keys to the crossroads that was a good book in the day that's deest is it yes it is hiate keys to the crossroads is by Serita deest she is fantastic I got a lot of information that I had to piece together because back then you know there weren't a lot of dedicated books to to her I always recommend the witches goddess Janet and Stewart Ferrar can't hate that book um but it's not obviously about about any one particular deity but you're going to get a good little story and overview on each each one hi included one other book that I'm hoping to get uh to do a review on uh so I personally have not read it but I've heard other people mention is Jason Miller's protection and reversal magic and from what I understand he works a lot with hiate and there's workings in that book mentioned so we will be getting copies of that book to do a review on in the future but uh I have heard people mention that book when asking about hiate as well um another book I read back in the day that I think it's hard to get now maybe expensive to get um but it was a little more educational I guess is that the hon no it was hkat and ancient Greek religion Rob Von ruol kind of more of a historical perspective more so than a religious perspective but yeah hkat and ancient Greek religion definitely a good one but I think it's old enough that it's going to be expensive yeah and so while I really do like Cindy Brandon you do kind of have to weave around the you know join my coven and that type of thing I guess it it's a little somebody in every crowd that's right but Ser dest shell and I both very much highly recommend I didn't even know that was the author of that one book honestly I just knew it was a good book yep it absolutely is so we do highly recommend those books if you want to learn more about hkat but here's the other thing you really want to learn about hkat do you really that you need to do some take those keys do do that work because you're going to get more from her individually than you're ever going to get out a book and it's going to hurt and I'm just going to say you love it sounds like she's given you a little leeway and it's time now so my guess is she won't lit up answer the call that's right hell hak right all right so I think that's it for this round of ask the witches anything and uh if you have any questions
