modernmagic her path as a house which and how we can all bring more seasonal and Soulful magic in you are home I and welcome to the show Lacey hello thank you for having me I'm so excited to be here and I can't wait to talk about  witchcraft it's one of her favorite topics to talk about your latest book natural Modern Magic but we do want to give you a second tell us a little bit about tell us about you and your your magical journey it started I guess from birth old wives tales and my mom was always so there was just a sort of are of looking at things differently and ever since I can remember and when I was about five I found some tarot cards in my mom so you started very young but I've been doing it almost all my life and now I help which is developed a practice that lives with everyday life and how to learn while practicing because that's what witchcraft is is your practice unless that Lacey one of the things that I really love when I heard about your book and I started finding out about you with I found her YouTube channel naturally  which YouTube channel and you have videos on there about the wheel of the year and you show how you celebrate and what you do in your home and they are just so magical and just filled with so many little things that people can do in their own lives you make witchcraft very accessible can you tell us about that Journey how you came to do that thank you thank you for that feedback accessible is definitely what I'm all about something that slows with your life and for me living by the seasons in the Moon is that foundation and connecting with your natural world you are a region in your environment and then taking inspiration from that so you know we use the plastic wheel is the wheel I use those words because that's what people are starting out at or for often times how do I celebrate All Star at how do I celebrate you know whatever whatever is coming up next then but what it really is about inspiration from your experience with your environment  have you seen magic how you look at things differently you know you're not a witch because you do things differently you're a witch because he's see things differently everyday life so that's really where the inspiration comes is what were the things that I felt most magical doing or that I could see a deeper meaning and that I was already doing so I'm already a frosty Martha Stewart type of home homemade bread type of person I resemble that remark I love all of those things that Encompass what we might call gymnastic magic stuff Kitchen Magic House magic and I love that term domestic Magic  what we are domesticated which is at this point you know it's not that which living on the edge of civilization in the woods and that's kind of that energy you know how would I do this if it was just me and connecting to Magic how would I how would I celebrate this and whatever I was already doing I was so it would start very small you were talking about you during your intention into your teeth brushing your teeth with intention you're cleansing or you only want to speak sweet words or you're eating something and you look at that keeper meeting that correspondence or symbolism until I would do that with my YouTube channel is big for grain and so if we can do that but where is what grows most easily and is native to where I'm at where I live in Las Vegas in the desert  that experience and then make something with that type of brain candy that was the bigger connection other than just reading is to look at the deeper meaning and for one of her got ideas and inspiration for people who are crafty who like to cook like to be in your garden but also see that deeper connection history was very similar to Shell and I you started out very Wicked bass and we likes us laugh and say we have with his DNA we don't practice Wicca right now but it's still influences our magical practice in a big way and I also resonated with when you said that you moved and found that your new area didn't really follow the same seasons the same wheel of the year that you were used to so that really helps kind of ground you and more of us a local animistic type practice can you tell us about that Journey a little bit  in 1999 or early 2000 which is of a Scottish I was a couple books from Barnes & Noble you know that little section needs to have them religion there's like seven books on witchcraft the complete idiot's guide to something like that something really early on I remember when she got first and then she got something like that and she thought Every Woman a goddess or something about those really the first times I really like it I really truly learned about it and she didn't take to it as much but oh I ate it I got onto the internet in the early days on  I found the learning circle and its roof and we meet at a coffee shop and I receive youngest I was 11 12 I don't even know if they are but they're all older than me and there is some some grown-ups there too so it was a nice next about 10 people would gather and we three different books and just talk and people are quite open to everyone I think at the time most people for the last decade or so had access to which in information that was what was easily available and I think I have the jumping-off point for a lot of people often start there if I'm entering someone or we're learning about it you know what we'll use those, but we speak that language a language I speak  yep we're with you yeah that plays very heavily into how I write spells and I wrote that the cells in the book and crafts at them are those correspondences because I learned that from my which in route but it is about adapting it you know what we're looking at connecting with nature where where is your connection so yeah it did have to eventually adjust that looks different here spring is beautiful in the desert come here in May and it is just gorgeous when you find a wild flowers but it looks very different in the winter but you really have to look at those and that's the magic is a big part of it is the presents in observing that's a lot of Witchcraft I'm going to inject real quick I know she'll have a question but coming from the East Coast I live  Southern California for time at in the desert and Joshua tree is one of my most magical places but when I first went there it was so different it felt so alien it it took a minute but then once I felt the magic of the land and connected with the life there it was so amazing different but absolutely stunningly amazing so I just had to share my love for the desert for just a second actually I was going to interject I I have not been to the desert and I'm just going to put that out there bucket list thing but I did have a drastic move within the last 5 years that did change my perspective a little bit I went from the heart of the Deep Woods of Upstate New York where are you know Forest magic is abound in that location to Salem Massachusetts where water magic was very prevalent here you know I'm I'm a mile from the ocean the wind is a whole different thing are it  self is different here than it was back in New York and it just has this different the only way I can explain it is a different soul feel like that that Forest which two kind of like that ocean a water witch five changes like that happen and we have to adapt to those and I think yeah that's a big part of your story is how you adapted to all these changes and beautifully from what it looks like you know you have this website and you do teachings as well I do so we have the best free anyone can find one with a thing you can do everyday to connect to your craft and you know where is a little more magically but the patron has the coven and that's where we get into more resources with living by the seasons in the moon and then I'll do periodic inventory mentorship so sometimes it will be on patreon sometimes it'll be 10  once the book The compendium of spells and rituals for health happiness and prosperity I love how you almost start from scratch and going through the book is like a work through like a progression what inspired you to make this beautiful thing because I do have to also point out that visually I love this book more than any book I have seen in a very very long time for someone who sometimes has a hard time sitting down and swallowing a whole book just visually this makes me want to turn the page and turn the page you've got little Graphics a little pictures and the pop up ideas I love your little pop-up ideas what inspired the book and kind of the format that you that  went because I love that more than anything I've seen in a long time don't you that's quite a compliment it really has come together beautifully visually what is a scrapbook you know I can junk Journal sort of feeling sucks but it reminds me of they had a certain vision and I wasn't sure how much I could speak up and I've learned to advocate for myself now that's a great lesson so in the beginning I took a couple pictures of some scrapbooks and books that we were put together in that for style and I told him this is what I'm most inspired by even before that in 2019 maybe 20 20 eye when I first started really diving into this and offering teachings and things like that  it looks like this was my witches Journal I just opened it up and you saw Pages me nature journaling and there is a pressed flower in there or you flipped it over and there's a sketch of a buzz or some symbol in my coffee when I was interpreting clouds of creamer and how it's laid out the way that it is I wanted it to be something that you learned witchcraft while you were practicing it because so many of us get wrapped up and you can sue me information information information and there's no shortage of information we just need to know what to do with it so the introductions before every spell is to tell you this does that sisters that is why were using it and then if you don't have an ingredient that's okay we're just stacking the odds in your favor things together if you don't have it a little bit do what feels right or slip to the substitutions in the back so we started with what was what was the bare-bones let me tell you about grounding  tell you got protection and we move through anything that I thought would go through your life I wanted it to be a spell book is like a cookbooks do I wanted it to be a go to you needed a recipe for cooked chicken you pull your favorite cookbook out and you flipped you a recipe for cooked lemon chicken and so you need a spell to get your dream job you just failed to attract the right love you need to spell stop gossip you need a spell to protect yourself while you're on a road trip you know I wanted them to be everyday situations that we all go through like you said we get so consumed with info overload that okay now that I've downloaded all this info to my brain now what do I do with it I like how you have small chunks of very important information you need to know about this particular thing now let's put it into practice I very much enjoyed how it does look like a scrapbook cookbook to me and I like  color tabs at the top where you can see all the different sections very easily one of the things that you said about doing magic is something that shell and I think is very important as we think even if you're not going to do it right or you don't think you're going to do it the right way to do it got messy get 30 first of all I loved your medication I think it was in the book if it was so fun and so cute and so personal I want to hang out with your brother by the way because it's really well known in their well I am shout out to Don t forget. I have four of them and we get along very well so I'm big fan of Brothers but I did like your dedication to your dad I wanted to call this out because he had a saying to shoot for the stars and if you make it over the trees yeah and I I appreciate that because you  we should try even if you don't think you're going to get to the Stars you still need to try and you still need to try to do it and not making it to the Stars doesn't mean that you failed it just means you learned something it means you learned what to do next time you got as far as the top of the trees there's so much there and I think magic needs to be less I mean or needs to be the cerebro part you need that part but you also need to get messy witchcraft is being outside it's being in the woods walking through the mud is trial and error recipes doing all this it's living it's being alive and and that's can be messy and I think we need to embrace that a little bit how do you add that process of not being afraid to make mistakes or not being afraid to not quite reach the Stars how do you how do you work with that internet I say my biggest lesson that I learned that from an experienced in my experiences with gardening especially out here in the desert I love a good Garden but it has taken me quite some time  at one point I looked around and everything was dead but I know looking at it a little bit longer I thought well this probably could have gone over there and gotten better son or less son and you probably needed or maybe if I can pandan plant with some shade or this might have needed more water. This isn't a yard full of dead plants because they are full of lessons and everything has season and so even looking at those dry crispy plants at one point I realized this is just the plants is this just what early fall looks like in the desert we don't have leaves falling but we have things getting dry and Christy maybe this is just that cycle in this is what it looks like here so  try something see how it feels see how it works and what is the deeper meaning what is the thing what is the magic magic is what connection to the Divine whatever that is for you and so what is that thread you know what you mean learn because that's a lot of the wisdom in the knowledge the difference between just taking in information and knowing what to do with it I have another question I was also taking a look at your website and on it you have a Beltane love spell cake yes and part of that recipe is for some lavender honey butter yes yes so delicious so good just the lavender honey butter how fun to mix a little magic into that and drizzle. On my loves toes do you know on a on a little bit of something sweet to eat and just kind of add a little bit of that I love you magic to it so what's your favorite way to add you know I love you to food I would say that  the go to that I I do the most is during an intention so clockwise attract or something like that and I use my numerology number is a lots of things and she has a cell 3. Use of whatever that ingredient might be that I'm using you just look at that face I think of a couple ingredients in any mail that I'm making pick one meal that we pick one ingredient slime that meal and then learn about it like it's actually your use it enough you'll develop a relationship with that ingredient it'll become what I call a spiritual can do just no longer tool it's that relationship know if you do Italian seasoning a lot well pick one or all the ingredients in Italian seasoning and learn about them  take that to Green magic and use those herbs and other spouse you can even get rid of those little arrow Gardens I think that have like Italian seasoning pods that you can just grow in your little AeroGarden that would be fun yes Layla mentioned love magic I have a question I feel like everybody's looking for a love spell you know how am I going to get this person get the person I love whatever the case maybe it's a buzzword always has been I want to point out that I love the fact that your love and relationship section was more towards the back of your book I want to ask did you feel compelled to have to add something about love and relationships because it is such a hot thing I I added it because it just seems like something that people would go through so I would start there and I was very careful not to include anything that was a low  spell on a specific person because if I had to look back on the people I would have cast Les filles on I would have picked the wrong one of those things before you give it up to the university Give It Up to mystery or whatever your Divine Essence is for you that I might pick up something out there might know better and so and styles with this or something better or some laws that okay this is what I'm communicating that I see with my mental World in my physical world and maybe are not as connected to the spirit world to see what something else be so this is what I have I think I want with the resources that I have but let it be this or something better and I I trust that the trust fall which is difficult but there is a part of that you don't need to control everything sometimes we need to let it happen and you evolve into an eclipse  we don't need to control everything because I think that sometimes people think that doing magic is controller yourself my control freak friend I have a control to control everything I guess is my point and I like that you kind of convey that yeah well in the interesting part is there is a spell to keep you from wanting to control situations  so it's a bit of a spiral down the circle the air down our down the rabbit hole was not going to go down that one I think the Spells and rituals in a way they help you to release recently done a lot of work with my cognitive function and limiting beliefs and things like that and I think that's very important to your focus and attention when doing still work or any type of magic that really Groton Center your energy and be able to focus on the feeling that you want in The Circle at that time in your working at that time being able to get out of that monkey mind and should release and trust that you've done what you can and still work really helps with that we have that symbolic action communication  I think communicate as much as she'll really like that the love spells were at the end I very much enjoy that that your energy work grounding and censoring you talk about that very in-depth at the beginning was front and center because that's so important it's so important to everything from that point on I feel ya and you have charms to ground you have cleansing ideas in here and then you really give people a great grounding and how to ground and how to work with that energy how to center yourself because if you can't round and Center Andreas that energy is very difficult to venture X it and try to work their will that way so I love that you had that front and center right there now it was speaking of cleansing I noticed that as a domestic which is now she'll and I talked about this weekend to talk about the wheel of the year we do a lot of cleansing weather is an ulcer whether it's our whole house and you talked about that a lot of your channel and your website so I have a personal question  do you have sitting around your house and the unlabeled bottles of moon water and what do you do with them solutely absolutely okay so it's not just us I gotten better over the years I used to have everything unlabeled cuz of course I'm going to remember this I don't usually okay as hard you don't really know where it came from but at the very least I will use it to wash clothes I put it in my laundry so if I don't know how long it's been around and you know I don't consume it or something like that at least put it in my laundry put it in ice cubes in Springs at keeping your freezer that way you know if you wanted to drink it or something like that I like to do sprays I like to put it in my water and drink it and do things like that so you know  safer than you have ice cubes so it might brew iced coffee before then he's not moving water in your ice cubes and water so I find ice breathing underwater to be really handy I have a problem I think 9 bottles all unlabeled and I do remember that one of them that I feel like is in a Snapple bottle but I have a few of them was from like thunder and lightning struck the first big storm when I moved and I'm afraid to open any of these Snapple bottles cuz I don't know which one has that chaotic energy in it I would probably sit with each of them and see how they energetically feel to see your pretty face and then if you still were a little unsure maybe a little salt in them  careful, those energy used to clean the area under your least favorite co-worker is chair yeah you could actually you could spend at the other out yeah we're not the only ones with a few unlabeled jars with things kicking her out I always say I'm going to remember and then I never do never ever I'm getting a little better if you had to give one piece of of starting advice to someone who came to you and said look I'm very new to Witchcraft I don't know where to start I don't know what to look at and don't know what is your advice to play very new which the first thing you need to ask yourself is if you are looking for a new religion or spiritual beliefs or Israel  Bernie practice because you can practice Witchcraft and Magic no matter your religion or spiritual beliefs you need to decide where you want to start start with learning about symbolism responses and practice do you want to start learning about spiritual beliefs and religion do you want to do a little bit of a particular or exercise that you do teach your students first is there something that you give them to work with in the beginning the first thing we work with is their personal daily Rhythm and then crying about because if you're trying to make your practice fit into everyday life even if you've never done any type of Witchcraft or magic or studied anything you need to understand how you work are you a morning person or are you a night person I'm a morning person so I like to do a lot of my stuff early as the sun is rising so they're certain correspondences  different kinds of your energy is feeling different ways you're going to know your your Rhythm and your schedule so that's one of the first things that I get people to look into when their evaluation before we get started and then started when I read a book called How To Read Literature Like a Professor and they explained that when you're reading for example mythology or your reading different types of literature and stuff like that to look at the symbolism so in this case what is the collective symbolism in what is a personal symbolism that you have with things that might show up in your life so it's a butterfly passes You by you might use that as your subject symbolism there, not its transformation but maybe you have a particular connections and butterflies and then that comes to memory what are your memories associated with this and then where is it showing up  over again one really chain into your awareness your presence in natural environment and energies around you and then it's also going to help you learn to interpret signs and symbols in the future if that's something that you got more into and also it's going to help you learn about correspondence this so it's going to help you learn about the energies with your tools which will hopefully become spiritual students in your Mentor used to journal I was just going to say I heard all over that we do mostly due nature Journal so we start with nature journaling and you'll pick us up Jackson you'll look at the deeper meaning of that subject that's outside and you study it for an entire year and each season you learn something from that tree and that eventually becomes your seasonal wheel or your New Year wishes we all your waking me up in a year  personal that really brings it down to you I love that so much I love it because it gives folks butterfly mean to me maybe something completely different to you so it's teaching about download of information that's so wonderful but then personalizing it to what does this mean to me personally how do I feel personally how does this affect me personally and kind of give it that spent I love that yes absolutely more longer when I say I say Brisa How To Read Literature Like a Professor that's one of the first ones I say to read the next one I would say is history of Witchcraft and magic and something that's a good well-rounded bit of a timeline of magic and Witchcraft so that you can see that it's been practiced throughout history and beliefs  dumb in some form they're just different rules around who and for what reason why those two are really good foundations and so that you can actually get your hands and what their day looks like because in magic all of it as Cycles the wheel of the year is the wheel of the month is the wheel of the day is you know what the the cycle of you and it reminded me of a book that I read when my kids were little with called seven times the sun it's about finding TV rhythms with your children and not a pagan book I believe say Darien is the author but not a pagan book but I think finding those rhythms and finding what you do naturally during the day that you can make magical that you can make part of your practice helps to make it easier to do if you're trying to do something completely out of the norm to you completely out  your Cycles in your rhythms you're less likely to keep doing it that's why if you cook everyday cook a little magic into that you know work a little magic into that are there any things that you do during the day that used to be quote-unquote normal are mundane that are now magical for you is there anything like that and your daily practice oh absolutely absolutely I say once I really started the grounding and I bought them Ashley modern which method and I I looked at what I did to get more connected to my craft and have a practice that just really slow and then I wrote it all out and then I repeated what I learned everyone has their own slow magic energy worksman Cycles in ribbons just like you were saying and what we often times will do is it just becomes brick  go on autopilot and life shouldn't be automatic you know I shouldn't be so being more present one thing that you can talk about cleansing that I find really helpful is to look at that correspondence of things that are cleansing so when is water being used washing the dishes like you just said or taking a shower you can make that into a cleansing ritual if you're doing something with your hair braiding it or putting it up in a certain way if you're already wearing at Scott's at day know if you need to Shield yourself and those things can be really helpful that is the star of Cycles around it and I was working on sort of a time of self-love when I got  and I still got this downloader this message that was I needed something that made me feel sacred so that's something that I always charge it every day where I put water on it so I know I'm wearing that regularly include that in my practice I know I'm showering regularly some parts of the book you'll see a recipe and my editor even sent me an email about it she said I just realized this is fire cider making interest out if you first learn the deeper meaning of course you can make all of life life naturally Modern Magic next door inspired to be the crazy witch in the woods but which next door works to either one  life but we have that connection you know we have that that yearning that fool to natural magic with nature in some way but you know we live in front of screens book definitely gives folks a good idea to how to bridge that Gap thank you so much Lacey for joining us at your book
