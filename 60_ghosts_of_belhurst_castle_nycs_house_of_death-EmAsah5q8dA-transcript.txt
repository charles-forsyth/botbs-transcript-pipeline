bubble bubble bubble bubble double bubble boiling trouble somebody should make a bong spell I swear right it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi welcome to episode 60 of the stoned Witches Hour grab a seat pack a bowl and maybe turn on a few extra lights listen in as we smoke more than a little cannabis and tell true is Tales of paranormal events ghoulish crimes and Things That Go Bump in the night and bringing you a blast from her own haunted past I'm Leila and I'm going for 60 bow hits on episode 60 cuz I'm cuz I'm shell and that's what sh does that's what shell does so we're going 60 for 60 I love that holy [ __ ] all right shell if anybody can do 60 for 60 it's me it's definitely shell that's true are we gonna keep a tally running I mean we could are you gonna start now I'm starting right now so well I take my first on air hit why don't you talk about what you're smoking all right well today actually I am smoking some weed that was grown from clones one of my brothers got this from a friend don't remember the name of the cultivar but I do remember where he got it from because I love the name this is a place called hippie chick farms and I met these people a while back at a festival and they happened to be growers in Upstate New York and as you know I'm currently in New York which is where some of my stories are going to be for the next few episodes I saw their website and apparently they are getting into the Clone market so what they do is they grow cannabis make clones from their photo period plants and then they sell the Clones so that other people can grow and they help people grow and I love clones they really take a lot of the work out of photo period plants because that whole first six weeks of growing is over and done with you can go straight to flower and it it's much faster that sounds complicated it's probably because I'm high and chatty this is a sativa dominant hybrid and again I don't remember what it is I'm sorry but it's very light green super crystally very fresh and sticky you know the kind of weed where you might want to let it sit out for a second before you pack it in your bowl because it's just too resiny and sticky nice very nice and as you can tell by my glassy eyes and my fast rate of speaking I am high as a kite and having a great time well Mark me down for my first five hits all right I am actually I don't believe what I'm smoking so I'm going to call it mystery weed oh so for your 60 for 60 what's this mystery weed like and what do they say it is and why don't you believe it okay so I got this from a friend first let's start okay so we're both smoking friend of a friend weed so this is not like tried and true tested by a store type stuff so I'm told that this is sour diesel oh I love me some Sour Diesel so if I handed you something and said sour Diesel and you smoked it you'd be like either yes it is or no it's not right yes correct no it's not no it's not I'm telling you no it's not so it's one of those things much like some of the Jack hair that I've complained about that it just does not have the distinctive notes that you would expect from a sour diesel none of that gas none of the lemon none of it no none of that completely mule kick you between the eyes you know make you super high Sour Diesel no like I'm not saying it's not good because it's good and it's making me chatty and it's making me eat my Snack Factory pretzel crisps who still haven't sponsored us so weird [ __ ] but anyway no we love them because they make AET yeah we love them but like it's good weed and I'm high and I'm happy and I'm chatty I am not agreeing that this is sour diesel though so I am going to put it in the category of mystery weed we're still in the wild wild west I can't tell you how many times I I grew out bag seed of something that I bought but I made up a name to give it because nothing that we smoked back then had names right you know something had a good flavor I would grow it out but it was just either good weed or dirt weed right that was it so I would make up a name for it so I don't know somebody could still be growing you know ilila cookies that I made up the name for back in the day I don't know but I think this is one of those things where people call it something thinking if I call it Sour Diesel people it'll sell better it'll sell better it'll sell more I can raise the price what have you they don't understand there's people out there like me where i' I've smoked my fair share of legit Sour Diesel so I know that this is not Sour Diesel right they're banking on the fact that people will have heard the name before and know it's good but still be inexperienced enough to not know that that's not what really what they're getting and it's not what really what I got I gotcha I I'm happy I'm happy with it but it's not what they said it was I Goa yeah I've had that happen most particularly with Jack ha not as often with gelato but I have had some gelato that didn't have that right taste or you know quite the right High I think once we get into more of the labeling with the Tarpin and everything we're going to move away from that because we'll know better what we're getting but I did want to speaking of labeling I did want to point something out to you what's that show Circle back to a previous episode I do have some store bought here here I it's just not what I'm smoking right now but I do have some store bought here and on this particular label they do break out the thc's like we've talked about in the past thca THC 9 they have cbga thcv cbda CBG and then regular CBD but then they have a category called total cannaboids yes I like that I do too give me the total right I don't give a [ __ ] about your breakdown just give me the total and I like that as well because some people want the breakdown some people just want the total so having both is a perfect compromise we need to when when when we can get the federal government to legalize everything we also need to standardize labeling well they need to make you and I the empress and the Zarina of weed so that we can tell them to nationalize the labels that all needs to be consistent everywhere you go needs to the exact same kind of breakdown so that you know exactly what you're getting now another thing I wanted to mention to our listeners while we're talking about the weed the devil's lettuce I sent you an article this week and I was like what the holy hell here's the title of the article and um this article was posted on I don't even know what date this is uh March 9th 2023 dailymail.com anybody who knows me knows I have a fasination with daily Ma so the title of this particular news article cannabis completes its coup more Americans now favor legal marijuana over legal tobacco survey shows woohoo the percentages actually lie down to 59% are favoring legalized marijuana whereas 57.3% are favoring making tobacco smoking illegal I love that I love that illegal so I'm gonna have a flip-flop in my life here I'm gonna go from smoking my freaking pipe is gonna be legal as [ __ ] and smoking my cigarettes I'm going to prison for that is quite the flip-flop for you now I am someone who has zero skin in this game because I've only ever been a pot smoker I like whiskey I like wine but I don't really drink and I have never smoked cigarettes the occasional clove cigarette you know back in my college days we thought we were so cool smoking so cool but you know the occasional clove because I like the taste the occasional blunt same thing other than that zero tobacco so I don't really care I just know that it's bad for people it's bad for you shell it's terrible for you I know and unfortunately I do have skin in the game because I've been a pack a day smoker for [ __ ] probably 30 years now since before I knew you yeah that's been a long time I started smoking a long time ago and so I I I do have some skin in the game and you know here's the funny thing about smoking I could quit and I could be okay with quitting but when you're in a relationship and you're living with someone you both have to be in it to win it because one of you can't quit if I could convince my love to quit I could actually quit and be okay with it but yeah 57% of Americans want smoke like I would have expected news article to be like oh yeah they want alcohol to be illegal again and here we are we're going underground no we're going to have to go underground to have a cigarette wow what a flipflop what a flipflop yeah who would have thought remember when we were growing up the damn maror man now now 57% of Americans want tobacco to be illegal that kind of reflects that the fact that people are realizing that cannabis was illegal for racist and political reasons but it was good for you now they're realizing that tobacco was legal for racist and political reasons and now they're realizing it's not good for you and so I think that's where the flip-flop is coming is you know with more knowledge we do things differently and and I want to point out that the way the survey was done it is actually to be very specific the question was asked legalize marijuana for any use and 59% said yes so we're not just talking medical um or things of that nature it was specifically listed for any use 59% of Americans well go go weed that's very telling because if you would have done that in when you know Nancy Reagan dare days oh yeah right you know we we've come a long way in our lifetime it was really the devil's lettuce back then it really was I mean in in God bless Nancy Reagan but geez she had it out for the pot smokers yes she did so to now see 59% want it legalized for any use we've come a long way and I I'd love to see that happen I'd love to see that happen I was hoping it would happen in our lifetimes and I glorying in it right now but while I continue to suck this down and shell continues on her quest of 60 hits on our 60th episode how you doing there shell what are we up to okay I'm gonna take another I'm gonna take another couple hits here real quick and I want you I want you to tell me while I'm puffing and puffing and piping what are you talking about this week I got two things for you again one is a very short personal story that I learned from my sweet mother as I've mentioned I'm in New York state right now and my grandmother is about to turn 100 years old no [ __ ] no [ __ ] that's [ __ ] awesome it really is she's amazing very great lady now to celebrate one of the things that we did recently was she went out to have brunch at the Belhurst Castle in Geneva New York which is where our story is going to take place Belhurst Castle is a famous hotel and restaurant that is on Route 14 as you're heading out of Geneva just past Hobart and William Smith colleges you'll see this gorgeous Stone Castle on the shores of senica Lake I grew grew up in Geneva New York I've never heard this story oh my God I want to oh wow keep so my main story is going to be about Belhurst Castle since I knew that my almost 100-year-old grandmother April 4th by the way is her 100th birthday so Grandma Jenny happy almost birthday happy birthday Grandma Jenny wooo so because they were going to the Belhurst I told them all about the ghost story that I had heard growing up in the area and we had to talk about the lady in white because this does include a lady you and your damn lady in whes Jee you always end up back to a lady in white maybe this is why because I grew up with this story and I grew up just down the shore on senica lake so it's kind of in my blood so I had to explain what a lady in white ghost story was so my mother turns to me and says oh I was that once wait what what because like I know your mom so what that was kind of my reaction to I I'm thinking did you not understand what I just said but she then proceeds to tell me that when she was pregnant with me I don't get my nomadic wandering nature from you know out of the blue my mother and father lived in quite a few different places all over the country before I was even born so while she was pregnant with me just before I'm born she's hugely 9 months pregnant they rented an old farmhouse it hadn't been lived in in decades that sounds like such a thing your parents would do absolutely my father has written poetry about it that has been published they lived very simply Barefoot hippies basically and we're kind of trying to fix up this Farmhouse clean it out so she's living there there's no electricity in this house so she's using like oil lamps and candl light and after I'm born I guess I wasn't a very happy baby in the evenings so she would very often get up at night and light a couple candles and walk holding me in her long white night gown now the windows in this Farmhouse had long since broken out because it had been unoccupied for so long and they had stapled up some of that plastic sheeting that you can kind of see through but not really well after a few nights of this the owner of the property came over to talk to my mother and he couldn't stop laughing to tell her the story Apparently one of his neighbors had come to him oh no all sorts of upset and scared and shaking because he and his wife had seen a ghost a lady in white walking back and forth in the unoccupied farmhous that no one had lived in for decades and it kept happening night after night the light would suddenly come on at 2 a.m. and a woman in a long flowing white dress would Pace back and forth in The Farmhouse after the third night of this they were so frightened that they called the they called the owner to tell him that there was a ghost at his farm you have been wreak in Havoc since the beginning of your time since the days I was born so yes so my mother literally was a lady in white ghost story that is hysterical oh my God only your parents ma' right only your parents my dad is enough of a character that our friends group had the Leila's dad stories time at any party that we would go to we would have to tell Leila's dad stories because he has gotten up to so much crazy things but that's a different podcast what are you talking about we still do so the bellhurst castle that started this whole my mother was a lady in white ghost is a very historic place and it has a long history of being haunted it is an absolutely stunning spot on senica Lake it's right near the Glenwood Cemetery which is a place that I spent a lot of time in as a as a teenager no well I loved photography and quiet places and it was a beautiful place to go and take photographs so all my early photography history is just filled with pages of Graves and creepy trees over at Glenwood Cemetery but um I would sometimes sneak onto the grounds at Belhurst Castle and they were known for having peacocks that roamed the entire grounds and oh that's wild birds and I learned in my research of this story why so we'll get into it but anyway so the history of Belhurst Castle goes all the way back to Native Americans as you know the fingerlakes area of New York state was a very well populated area is it an actual castle it is an actual castle oh how can I be from New York State and never have heard of this oh good gracious sh we are going to stay there this is definitely going to be a [ __ ] around and find out place we'll bring ouri boards oh yeah we're gonna take in the gorgeous views and we're gonna find us some ghosts well the Finger Lakes area if for anybody who's never um been in that area or knows nothing about it other than the wine gorgeous gorgeous like gorgeous people do stay there for the wine trail they also serve some of their very own hard ciders I believe that's made just for them but anyway Belhurst Castle is located on a spot in senica Lake that was the site of um where the Council of six nations of iroy would come and beat oh okay it's an absolutely beautiful spot now it was originally part of the state of Massachusetts really the castle itself the land that the castle sits on there was no castle at that time it was just but that's way over on the other side of New York right so I didn't know that either that parts of New York were originally Massachusetts in the early 18th century it was purchased by some land developers uh 17 in 1738 it was it changed hands a few times between 1738 and 1810 um in 1810 it was uh purchased by two men who built the Ontario glass manufacturing company which was the first glass company this side of Albany but they bought the land they sold it to a man named Joseph fellows so it changed hands a lot of times before it was ever actually built on it was sold to Joseph fellows who was a native of England uh Warwickshire England and in 1830 he built uh the first modern what they're calling a mod residence on the land it's a house called The Hermitage and he never lived there a man named Henry Hall lived there and the no locals knew him as Buck Hall and he didn't really like the locals he didn't do anything with anybody kind of kept to himself he lived there by himself with just one servant it was rumored when he had come there he had come with a woman but most people just knew him living there with a servant alone how many hits are you at anyway let's see I'm actually keeping track on my little piece of paper I'm at 16 well on track well on track so Henry Hall lived there very you know mysteriously had come with a woman who was no longer there just lived alone with a servant and kept to himself in the spring of 1836 it said that buck hall fell over something and broke his leg now he didn't seek any type of treatment for this his like desire to be alone went so far as he didn't want any doctors there uhuh un fortunately he died of like sepsis blood poisoning shortly after breaking his leg oh you know that's horrible because like not PE people don't realize that you can actually get sepsis from a freaking Boke and Bone right he didn't even worse after he died it all came out that his name was not Henry Hall his name was actually William Henry buck and he had been a treasurer of the Covent Garden theater in London who was he hiding from because that's what back then when people changed their names like that they were hiding something well as the treasurer he stole a ton of money from the theater shocking married his stepmother and then ran away to the United States and assumed the name Henry Hall to try and hide now it's rumored that the woman he traveled with to the US was an actress that he was having an affair with and she was never seen again so the property when it was built had a tunnel a Secret Tunnel built from The Hermitage to senica Lake the way this whole land sits it it doesn't go down to like a nice Beach up to the lake kind of a hill with pretty much a sheer drop off almost like New York's version of Cliff yeah like a like a big Cliff I mean it's not like the White Cliffs of do high or anything like that it's just a good-sized hill High New York's version of Cliff exactly now William Henry Buck known as Henry Hall after this house had been built for him had had a Tunnel built from The Cellar of the house the Hermitage down to the lake so that if people came for him he would have an easy way to escape so after he passed away it again changed hands a few times and it was purchased by a man named Harrison Otis and he's the one that named the property Belhurst and it means beautiful Forest his family transferred the property back and forth a few times and a woman named Mary Otis sold the small rocky strip of land that goes from that drop off down to the lake she sold part of that to a rail road company that still operates a railway line there but she managed a like a contract with them to allow her access rights across the tracks to the beach and that contract was so strong it's over 150 years old and it's still in place oh wow yeah so that the pelleur castle still has access to the be Beach across the tracks in 1878 after the Otis family moved to Virginia and they sold the property it became part of the United States Trust Company and it stayed vacant for a few years and the Hermitage kind of went into disrepair and during that time the residents of Geneva started to use it like as a picnic area and would kind of hang out there and that's when the stories of the hauntings first began people would regularly see a woman around the Hermitage that would disappear when a approached and sometimes they'd see a man that would disappear and they say that it was the Ghost of the actress that had fled England with William Henry Buck the rumor has it that the tunnel underneath the house that went to the lake was used by this actress trying to flee Buck because soon after she came to the US with him she didn't want to have anything more to do with him and wanted to go home and after one of their arguments she was trying to run away from him in the tunnels and fell and died there then he just kind of disappeared her and no one ever heard from her again you know I love that I love that term that they used back then and and and you've said it twice now disappeared her like why don't you just say murdered her a dumpster disappeared her right well it sounds like it could have been murder or just an accident as she was trying to run away a quote unquote accident right because no one you know he didn't say oh my lover had an accident come quickly no they just never heard anything about about it again it's also rumored that his fall was caused by the ghost the fall that broke his leg that killed him oh so now it's used as a popular spot people see these ghosts on occasion on May 13th 1885 a woman named Carrie M young Heron obviously wealthy she has like 12 names she's the wife of Samuel V Heron of New York City came up to Geneva and went to what was being known as Otis Grove where people were going to have their picnics and immediately fell in love with the spot she asked the price purchased it that same day can you imagine being rich enough to go someplace on vacation be like I love this place I'm buying all of it I want to do that we've actually talked about that place as we've gone on vacations yes we have yes we have that's true that is absolutely true but we didn't have the money to do it well no no so a few years later she uh she divorced her husband and moved there with the gentleman that she had actually gone there with to purchase it I don't know how that worked but anyways in 1888 she and her new husband came up to Geneva tore down the house that the Otis family was living in and started to construct what is now called Belhurst Castle now when I was growing up I heard that an entire Castle had been imported from Europe Stone by Stone and rebuilt on the spot oh wow the truth of it is pretty close almost all of the materials that are used in the bhur castle came from other constructions in Europe every stone every piece of wood everything oh wow I I can't even imagine the cost in 1885 to have all that stuff brought here from Europe and then rebuilt so she and her husband had 50 men working full-time rebuilding this Castle on the property during that time one construction worker fell to his death while building the tower and another one reportedly went insane while building the roof and I couldn't find any more information or details on what they meant by went insane but apparently it wasn't very pretty is the best I can find now she also built on the property several other out buildings like a carriage house and a fowl house because she loved Japanese golden pheasants and had several prize birds in her possession and so she was known for having all these exotic birds that would roam across the grounds and that's true even when I was a teenager there were quite a few oh hence the peacock so there's peacocks and everything that were well known for traveling the grounds and and we would all as teenagers of course sneak on to there whatever and the peacocks would usually be a dead giveway that someone was there because the male peacock was mean as hell and would scream at you so they actually still had exotic bird not say back in your day but back in your day they still had the exotic birds they did they very much did now according to local rumor Carrie loved the secret tunnel that went from The Hermitage to senica Lake and the stories about it and she liked it so much that during construction she had them expanded it's rumored that there were tunnels that went from The Wine Cellar of Belhurst Castle also from the carriage house and they both connected to the original Hermitage tunnel that went to the lake now let me ask you this I don't mean to interrupt you being a teenager in the location I was we had different underground tunnels and things of that nature did you guys ever go to the Waterfront try to find the entrances and get in that way and if so speak to that because I just all I can think of is like some haunted water dripping underground tunnel that sketch that like I don't know I'm thinking like the tunnel from the kids and it oh no actually they'd all been filled in all bumber yeah and I'm going to get to that here in a second because the actress that died there was not the only death in the tunnels so there's a more famous ghost and we're going to get to that right now so what what hit are you at okay let's see I'm my little calculator I'm at 20 all right let's keep it going then the most famous ghost of Belhurst has a story that's very very similar to The Unknown actress that may or may not have died in the original tunnel this one has a name I only ever knew her as Isabella but in my research I found that it may have been Isabella Robinson and the belur spa in Salon is actually named after Isabella now she was a a famous actress she was a famous opera singer oh okay she was married to a high-ranking Spanish Don who was much older than her and very very powerful unfortunately as sometimes happens in these May December rances Isabella fell in love with another man she was caught by her husband and he locked her in her bedroom and threatened to kill her lover so Isabella and her lover managed to escape and fled to America and I'm not sure how they ended up as the at the bellhurst castle some people say that she was friends with Carrie some people say that it was a hotel even at that time so I'm not really sure but she ended up at the bellhurst castle with her lover and they were hiding out there unfortunately her husband found her and sent men after her to get her back when they came to the bhur castle she and her lover fled to the cellers and into the tunnels intending to escape down to the lake to a boat that they kept there to get away but unfortunately the Hermitage tunnel was so old that it collapsed on Isabella oh [ __ ] there's two different endings to this story the first one that I don't hear as often is that her lover managed to escape to the boat and was away and just grieved her his entire life the most common story that I heard is that he was distraught and trying to dig her out when the rest of the tunnel collapsed and kept him there within inches of reaching his hand through to his love oh [ __ ] so she's the ghost that people see and they'll regularly see her walking along the cliff Edge in her white night gown searching for her lover that wasn't able to get to her she's also sometimes seen flying into the windows almost like a banshee type shrieking ghost in white going into the windows of the tower room and some people think she might also be the ghost that sings lullab that make people fall asleep throughout the castle there's not much this isn't a super well-known ghost story so there's not like a ton out there but I did find a YouTuber who who had actually gone there and stayed with some friends they did not know about the opera singer and the lullabi ghost uhuh so while they're trying to do some different readings one of them says he kind of heard the singing and the next thing he knows his friends waking him up and it continues to happen throughout the night to each one of them they would hear the singing and then pass out as he said and that's been reported by other people it's also rumored maybe she was pregnant because some people report hearing children playing or crying in another room even when nobody's there so I don't know if the Opera lady was singing L maybe to her Lover's baby when she ran away not sure or maybe it was your mother walking you up and down the H maybe so Belhurst Castle passed through hands again and it actually was passed to a man in in the 30s a man named Cornelius J DWI and he was known as red so red purchased the Belhurst and turned it into a Speak Easy and gambling casino oh our kind of place that's right the upstairs was a gambling place and downstairs was the Speak Easy and where everybody would go to drink the liquor came from Canada it all came down through like the Eerie Canal system and then would come down to Geneva I don't know if that's when the wine Taps were installed in the walls but when I went to prom there I remember that the staircase the spiral wooden staircase that they have there there's a wine tap in the wall that you just pull the tap with your glass underneath or as us teenagers did pulled the tap with our mouth underneath that was actually a black velvet tap sh's favorite cheap lowbudget Canadian whiskey there you go yeah that was your black velvet tap the wine Taps from what I understand are still there and we had a lot of fun discovering those when we went to prom there your prom was at this place it was oh [ __ ] man that's too cool and I didn't exactly see a ghost but I kind of had a spooky experience while I was there oh I was kind of a loner as a kid you know I had a group of friends but I was still kind of quiet and shy and I was there with my boyfriend but I needed a minute you know we weren't fighting or anything but I don't think I particularly was like woo I love you we're at prom and so I kind of kicked off my high heels and was walking in my bare feet through the dark lawn out to behind the Belhurst you know there's chairs and things there and as long as you dodge the birds you're fine and you have a beautiful view of the lake and so I go back there and I'm sitting in the grass and I'm rolling up a joint it's gorgeous I love this Lake I love Cal Lake and so I'm hanging out having a better time by myself smoking a joint behind the bellur that I was with the party because I'm a nerd so I'm like hey I wonder if I'm going to see the lady in white maybe I'll see the opera singer and you know we'd all been told that the tunnels were filled in people had snuck down there past the tracks and I've never seen any sign of a cave entrance or anything like that so I'm like maybe I'll see her and wouldn't you [ __ ] know it right after I think that over by the trees on the edge of the cliff I see what looks like a silvery white Shimmer and I'm like holy [ __ ] it might be a ghost and then I'm like okay maybe it's maybe it's someone else from the prom so I'm like hitting my joint all quiet and I'm and I'm looking peering through the dark and it starts to Shimmer and come a little closer I'm like that is not a person that is definitely not a person what the [ __ ] is that oh [ __ ] and it gets closer and it starts screaming at me and chasing me it's the [ __ ] peacock I never got up faster and started running faster in my freaking life I thought that peacock was going to bite my ass I was so scared you know that's the thing about peacock is um unfortunately it actually could have bit your ass oh no so my stoned ass was smart to run away is what you're saying they're actually believe it or not they're they're beautiful but they're violent Birds it was just apparently the male peacock's tail maybe catching some of the light from the prom that I had seen and yeah was not a ghost very scary not a ghost yeah but I do have friends that did say that they saw The Ghost and including the lady in white on several occasions when my about to be 100 Grandma Jenny went there they asked the waitresses and no one had heard of these Legends so I was a little surprised but I talked to a couple people who used to work there years ago and they all had stories of bottles flying off of shelves by themselves and the lady in white Walking The Halls there's also a very sweet story about a caretaker a long-term caretaker who lived there and he passed away in 1972 but he apparently loved the place so much that he hasn't left and numerous people will describe him walking through the halls or up the stairs and I guess he had a chair the lobbies that he would sit in it was his chair and people will regularly see an an older man in like a handyman uniform sitting there I also found um someone I know who worked there as a you know they did they cleaned the rooms they said that sometimes they'd go into a room and start cleaning it and then the shower would turn on just by itself and other times they'd be cleaning a room go in the bathroom to clean and come back out and the sheets would be tied on the chandelier oh wow that happened more than once where an item of clothing or some type of bed linen would be up high like not where it was supposed to be like tied to a light or up on the top of a the curtains on the windows so I don't know what that's all about but a little strange that it happens so often now about the caretaker a woman named Suzanne Horman worked there quite a while ago and she said that she was speaking to some guests this couple was having breakfast on the porch and they said while they were having breakfast the day before an old Gardener had come up to them and was talking to them about their stay you know he was very very nice and seemed a little distracted then wandered away and they had mentioned him but there was nobody that worked there that looked like that and they found out that he did match the handyman that had passed away in 1972 so apparently the ghost had walked up to this cup and they'd had a little conversation with him without even knowing he was a ghost oh another guest uh one time was checking out and wanted to mention that the person that was staying in the room next to them had had the most beautiful singing voice you know that they had heard this woman singing to her child because they had heard them talking and she just wanted to comment on what a gorgeous voice this woman had had but the receptionist said no one was staying there was no one else staying on that floor there was no one staying in that room Gail B was staying in the tower suite and she said she woke up in the middle of the night because the floorboards were creaking and she could see a shadow figure pacing back and forth in front of the windows in the room and she was staying in the turret room has anybody had any encounters that would Trace back to the Native American meeting point that was supposedly located there not that I've heard no they were all centered on the man who ran away from England you know Henry Hall so-called Buck uh they centered on him sometimes people will see him but mostly they'll see the woman in white it's mostly Isabella that people see and I don't know if the actress story is somehow like a pieced off of Isabella's story you know like some people have heard one and kind of conflated the two I'm not sure but people do mostly see the woman in white but sometimes they will see another woman an older man and then also the older handyman or the particular specific G that they see but a lot of poltergeist type activity happens there well and that's that's kind of some of the problem you have with locations and and hauntings and paranormal activity that goes back a hundred or more years these stories kind of get past down word of mouth and can kind of get jumbled into one big story you know where there might have been like say three instances 75 years later that's only one instance you know think get J together over time yep but you know they're pretty interesting stories and people continue to this day you know some of the comments that I've seen and some of the people that I spoke to have had very recent experiences particularly with Poltergeist type activity so I wonder if wherever they got this Castle from these stones and this wood if that has anything to do you know with the ghosts and with the energy that's there have they brought in a professional psychic paranormal person they have not and it seems almost seems all I got a job for you for us we need to go it seems like the current owners are kind of downplaying that just a little bit it looks like they're trying to kind of cash out more as a wedding venue yes and I imagine wanting to be a wedding venue two tragic love stories involving women that died and are now lady in white ghost aren't going to be good for business no so while I did see initially a little bit of interest in being on like the national haunted registry and that type of thing for the most part it seems like they're kind of downplaying that it's a very haunted castle I would have no problem going there and getting married in the morning and doing a ghost hunt at night see I think they're completely missing out there's a niche for this people Jennifer a woman named Jennifer said ghost and wine yes please I mean you've got ghosts you've got hauntings you've got wine on tap in the walls what more could you want other than a little bit of weed and you have a cast it's a castle on Sena lake so yes we need to go there and conduct a thorough investigation yeah yeah and you can hold my hand so I don't get scared by the peacock who's to say I'm not gonna be scared of the peacock we can hold hands and run away together then Lord I feel like we would have to have like one of those little netting things on so they can't like poke at your head they have built extensively onto the castle there there's um an addition that was built on the food there is fantastic world-renowned uh you can stay in the original Castle you can stay in some of like the carriage house and some of the other buildings on the ground it's yeah it's basically like a hotel BNB kind of thing now if you stay in the original Castle there's no elevator oh the rooms are very clean and very nice and very unique some of them have balconies that you kind of climb upstairs to go out on the balcony some are in the turret room you know they're very unique don't go there expecting to have your typical sterile Hotel experience expect to climb some stairs with your suitcases and have an amazing gorgeous day in a castle on freaking senica Lake and hopefully see a lady in white ghost send me pictures or maybe it's just Lea's mother walking her up and down the Halls because Lea's being a cranky infant maybe that very well could be I've lost I I didn't even keep count of how many hits I've got but where are you at sh I'm up to 34 all right well we are about halfway and you are more than halfway so let's keep it rolling what story have you got for me shelle so I'm also in New York state with this story but um a little far away from cica Lake this is down in New York City oh okay I'm gonna talk about what's called the house of death the house of death I feel like there's there's probably multiple houses of death in well HH Murder Castle comes to mind but but yeah so okay what makes this one the house of death in New York city so this is actually in Greenwich Village which is in kind of the heart of New York City the house is located at let's see 14 West 10th Street please do not go to this location it is a privately Lo owned location don't harass the people if you do video it I want to know what's this is like one of those things you know the gates of Hell the lady in white we're the only ones we're the most haunted we're the most haunted so even though these people are are calling themselves the Death House some have had it listed as the most haunted house in New York City but again the most haunted house in New York City is like saying you have the only portal to hell and your Cemetery right the most haunted house in New York City on this street just like there's only one world famous roast beef stand in Massachusetts that's right or one world's best cup of coffee in New York City you know I'm not necessarily saying I buy into the most haunted house in New York City but there's some ghosts here and some shitty things have happened at this place can you kind of vision these old like those Brownstone houses oh yeah cute yeah expensive and cute very expensive expensive um very expensive not for the likes of us no no dirty witches need not apply this is one of those um like revivalist Brownstones in one of those like oldfashioned New York City neighborhoods like the kind you see on Facebook that it's like oh New York City in the winter time and you're like really it's so beautiful and then you go to New York and you're like where's that this house was built in 1856 so we've talked a few times how it seems like the mid to late 1800s spiritualist Central yeah so this was built on West 10th Street and it was built by the founder of the Metropolitan Underground Railroad and the Broadway Underground Railroad his name was uh Mr James Borman Johnson he founded U reading rooms libraries in the fame 10th Street Studio which was uh kind of like an art gallery type thing he had ended up dying and his his wife and his daughters ended up with this place when they lived there things seemed kind of okay like they had the place built lived there for however long everything was fine it was the second owners I've even seen articles this is so weird because I've seen articles kind of liking this to the Amityville hor house because it was fake or because of the stuff that happened negativity perpetuates negativity I gotta okay so like you know how in the Amityville house they say that because there was negative energy in the house that that negative energy influenced the owner to do more negative things I gotta right um so negativity kind of perpetuates negativity um and this has that kind of cycle in it so it kind of really started earning the reputation as the house of death in 1897 we can imagine this was kind of more of a upper class neighborhood in New York um even back then there was a famed celebrity cyclist Fred Andrew and he was the occupier of this of this location so you think to yourself a famed psychist so this guy can ride a bike like nobody's business okay sure maybe where you and I couldn't this guy can so on August 9th 1897 Andrew had a moment of Reckless bicycle riding so no that's what the police report called it Reckless bicycle riding and it caused him to hit an eight-year-old boy no and the boy suffered a broken leg and Andrew was actually arrested now Reckless bicycle driving sure now the boy didn't die but he did have a broken leg and that kind of was the downfall of his celebrity cycling career you know freaking takes one Scandal hit a k freaking hit a kid you [ __ ] so that's kind of where the bad luck started now granted nobody died in that but that's where the bad luck started the next owner this might be a name from our neck of the woods that may ring a bell to you the next owner was Samuel Clemens oh no way really yeah for those of you who AR familiar with Samuel Clemens Mark Twain himself Mark Twain himself our mustached Legend who's buried in Elmyra New York by the way actually that is very true um he was a resident of the House of death three or well no he was a resident of the House of death for 12 months but he moved in three years after Fred Andrew's cycling accident okay so when he moved in he was kind of like at the height of his career so another famous person staying at this house another famous person at the height of their career and then all of a sudden he started battling bankruptcy um oh no he was fighting depression I mean wouldn't you be sad mustache right like I can't eat my soup properly this sucks but he also was churning out some of his most rushed but classic works so he was fighting he was good when he moved in and then all of a sudden shit's Fallen apart for no reason took a complete turn for the worst right Twain was a noted ghost skeptic yes yet he wrote of a clear and plain paranormal experience he had in this home no [ __ ] this guy was like very I don't know super serious for him to even entertain the fact that he could have had a paranormal experience is very telling so one evening he witnessed a large piece of wood move in the air all by itself he thought something had to be moving the wood so he shot it with his gun that sounds like the people in Florida shooting the Hurricanes I know right the wood suddenly fell to the ground and was surrounded by a few drops of blood so it worked apparently he maintained that the blood had to be the blood of a rodent and not a ghost because at the time well not that anything's changed but rats outnumber people in New York even though the house was not known for having an infestation how would a rat make a piece of wood hover in the air though when he shot at it in it bled all of a sudden he changed his story I don't know he didn't really have pleasant memories at this house it was kind of where things started going ay for him he left the house after 12 months and then his Works started taking off things started getting better but then as we know he came back to Upstate New York and died and well there he's buried he has seen roaming all over that house so he did not die in this house but there have been psychics and and and mediums that have said that he's connected to that house because he felt like his whole career took a downturn once he moved there and that he was never able to fully recover his career after living at the house and it was the same thing with the cyclists so the cyclist is a booming cyclist who knew that was a big thing back then who while living at that house had the bad luck of hitting a child and basically lost his career after Twain moved out there was a a sighting there someone bumped into what they C what they called a ghost perched on a window seat and the ghost nonchalantly turned and said my name is Clemens and I got a problem here I got to settle wow and then disappeared moments later Into Thin Air one of the problems that he started having after he moved into that house was like I said he um was starting to go bankrupt so some people think that he was his ghost is there because his Spirit isn't allowed to settle and rest in peace because he's got Financial issues and that money is keeping him from resting happily maybe unfinished issues in in his mind keeping here and so much energy tied up you know when you're having a hard time or whatever there's a lot of energy expelled a lot of emotion and so I'm not surprised that he would return to a place where you know that was very heightened right so again it's not the place where where he he met his demise or anything but it is probably the place we had the most stress people hear him pacing up and down the Halls they see apparitions of him and they see the mustache which is so distinguishable that's why they know it's Twain such a distinctive you know feature yeah another family that moved in after that was um the Bartell family Jan Bryant Bartell and her daughter moved in um to the top floor in 1957 it was basically turned into a partments at one point Miss Bartell and her daughter moved into the top floor 1957 um and she was a famous actress and psychic she moved into an apartment which once housed the servants back when like Twain and them would have lived there that would have been like the servants quarters and it has now been turned into an apartment Bartell like I said was a was a one of her things was she was a psychic so she reported almost immediately after going into the house um that she had a she saw a monstrous moving shadow that would often follow her around ooh well that sounds pretty negative one time she said that she saw a ghostly figure of a man standing in the hallway and she reached out and tried to touch what she was seeing and she said she felt something but nothing like she had ever felt before she actually ended up writing a book about her experiences really yeah because like I said you know she was an actress and a psychic so for her to write a book wasn't necessarily A huge stretch right but to include this place right but she felt that she had contact with Twain she also felt contact UM your lady in white must have taken a trip to New York City because she mentioned additionally that she saw a woman in a white dress they're everywhere they're everywhere they're like orbs they're everywhere a young girl and a gray cat so she had multiple encounters um and her book uh I don't know what year it came came out um but the book was called spin drift spray from a psychic sea she she vividly recounts what it's like to live in a possessed house and that's how she described it was a possessed house and that's where kind of the tie into Amityville is because I mean after doing our story on Amityville which was like episode like what three I think that that might have been a fake story but it's like the same sentiment of the house being possessed so that's that's kind of how she portrayed it in her book was that the house was possessed she wrote about unexplainable sounds this is an excerpt from her from her book and I wanted to read this to you because this is a little crazy like a game of 10 Little Indians deaths began to occur in the house the first to die was a dog Jan's own beloved Penelope but within 24 hours she was to learn of the death of the first human tenant whether by heart attack suicide or murder the deaths came in Rapid seccession in Terror with nine little Indians gone the bartletts moved away from the Greenwich Village but the hauntings followed them after the completion of Spindrift Jam Bartel became the 10th no yeah like right after she finished the book she died whoa whoa that's weird Bartell died shortly after completing the manuscript under mysterious circumstances figures she was a sufferer of depressive episodes and rumored suicide attempts but her death totally LED Credence to the legend wow wow but unfortunately you know New York city so many unsolved deaths you know it just happens so who knows what happened to her yeah especially if you have depression they you know they write it off pretty quickly now I don't know if you remember this uh the name kind of rung a bell with me vaguely so fast forward to 1987 this was a genuine tragedy at the house of death this was the murder of Lisa nus bomb I believe her killer was her was it her stepdad or her dad it sounds Vaguely Familiar I vaguely remember that case from when I was a kid I can't remember stepdad or dad but but it was a a famous Lawyer Joel Steinberg so 1987 they got a pH 911 got a phone call it was um H nus bomb uh she said that her six-year-old daughter Lisa wasn't breathing so an ambulance was sent uh to the house when the paramedics arrived they found Lisa lying naked and unresponsive on the kitchen floor her brother Mitchell was tied to a play pen and soaked in his own urine and uh nus bomb herself was covered in bruises and had several broken bones they discovered marijuana cocaine um hashes crack pipes $20,000 in cash unfortunately the six-year-old Lisa died on the way to the hospital um her cause of death was blunt force trauma to the skull that poor baby her father like I said he was a famous Lawyer Joel Steinberg he was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and it was charged that he basically went on a cocaine binge and violently abuse both the child and his wife they were GNA actually charge his wife as well but she avoided the charges in the end in exchange for Testimony against her husband oh it sounds like she was being abused too yeah yeah yeah he was found guilty of manslaughter in the second degree and he was actually released in 2004 com to find out e he stopped being a lawyer and became a construction guy basically well yeah I don't think anyone would want him as a lawyer after that yeah I wouldn't want him as a construction guy I wouldn't want him as anything after that so I mean it's still a gorgeous house in a rich neighborhood for very affluent people it is still currently privately owned but it seems like people move there at the height of their careers and then tragedy strikes [ __ ] happens like on a serious level serious [ __ ] yeah wow but I mean it's a beautiful house but like between the lawyer killing the daughter Twain never leaving and that's the thing remember I told you they saw ghost of a little girl the ghost of the little girl was seen before this little girl's murder yeah I wonder where she came from um I saw somewhere where they said that there were 22 deaths in the house but I wasn't able to trace back 22 deaths in the house but when I read you that excerpt from the book that talked about nine deaths right there right right so there's nine people or animals too but finding all 22 rumor deaths in the house has been proved difficult for me but but there's a lot you can see a history of either horrific luck or monstros mon bad [ __ ] yeah yeah shitty shitty shitty luck but for some reason Mark Twain is probably the most prominent ghost interesting the most often seen it's possible it's because he's so distinctive like you see a ghost you're like oh I saw a ghost but if you see a ghost you recognize you're more likely to talk about it that could yeah if it's just because he's more it's easier to say I saw the ghost of Mark Twain Samuel Clemens right you know just I saw some random little girl that I don't know where the Ghost came from right I would just be happy to see any ghost I just be like guys I saw ghost what's up what's going on so there has been stories basically from the late 1800s up until this girl's unfortunate death in the late 80s the people seem to want to keep it lowkey it's probably still owned by very high society folk so it's not a place we can visit or check out but if you live there email us at the stone Witches Hour gmail.com and tell us of your paranormal experiences or invite us over to [ __ ] around and find out right but in the meantime I think this is going to be one of those we'll never know yeah wow I'm intrigued I really wonder because you know once you know people have bad luck all the time but it sounds like this is consistent people that live there you I wonder I got to wonder if the people that are there now have done any type of blessing or cleansing or or if their life has fallen apart right I would have a hard time moving into a place first of all I'm very very sensitive to things like that secondly I'm very imaginative and thirdly I'm very emotional so I would have a very hard time living someplace where a tragedy occurred I would have to be doing blessings and cleansings that's only been about what 30 35 years since that little girl was killed oh that's so tragic that's that's horrific so I I would imagine if it was a hot spot before there's got to be activity yeah there's got to be activity interesting places so two very interesting houses today different types of energy and hauntings both tragic mine somehow yet again has a lady in white involved hey no wait that I had a lady in white oh yeah that's true they both did your lady in white came down to my place to visit in New York City there's going to be like a lady in white convention somewhere like I know hi where do you haunt what's your backstory are you a wedding ghost are you a night gown or are you a ball gown ghost now

them separate right or don't forget the either you just got married or you were just about to get married we have the brides and Brides to be over in the northwing right right right yes it could there's got to be a lady in white convention somewhere I'm sure I would love to go if there is ghostly ladies contact us because we'd like to be there Lea's next venture is she's gonna have a lady in white convention well yes we am because next week yes we am yes we are that was good yes I am yes we are we're going to have a lady and white convention because next week I am staying in New York
