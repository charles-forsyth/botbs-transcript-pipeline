welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick as we get back on the broomstick today I'm shell and I'm Leila and today we'll be talking about the pagan holiday of belaine that's coming up on May 1 unless you're one of our southern hemisphere friends and then you will be celebrating sin on May 1 belain and sin are two of the biggest holidays I would have to say you know how I would explain this like you get a lot of the Christians that are like you know what are the big holidays and I'd be like think of belane and sin like the Christian version of Christmas and Easter it's like our Christmas and Easter the two big ones the big ones not that they have any relation to each other but just the significance of the two holidays I thought you were going to describe them as you know hey what are the two big holidays I thought you were gonna say Sex and Death I mean it's pretty much where we're at right that's those are the book ends of the holidays here that's kind of if you want to still them down yeah yeah uh okay so that has nothing to do with my my little metaphor from a minute ago well no just what you're saying is they're the two biggest ones like Easter and Christmas are two of the bigger Christmas Christmas holidays for for Christians and for us yeah and for us it's it's belane and sin so as far as the significance of each holiday for the different groups they have the equal weight weight yeah yeah that's definitely a really good way to say it I do know several belaine sa pagans just like you've heard the term Easter Christmas Christians they only come out of the woodwork at belane and sa you know it's like you go to a litha ritual and there's like 50 people there you go to a belane ritual and there's like 350 people there it's like where the hell were you people the other seven holidays the summer holidays were very often minimally attended people were at other festivals there were bigger festivals people would travel to but things like Bel and S we could have upwards of 300 plus people there they were quite large Festival celebrations Even in our small City that we lived in and then you try to get a llamas ritual with more than 40 people and good luck sister right how many of those litha and llamas rituals were we sitting in the field with like 10 other people being like nobody called this ritual all right let's whip something up really fast and but actually those were probably some of the better rituals that on the Flies super personal and super fun I I liked those smaller rituals but belain was amazing for so many other reasons it is the first for our community it was the first outdoor ritual and in some parts of the country it's the first time of year where it's comfortable to get outside where you can go camping and celebrate the new life and the new beginning freezing your ass off and belaine is all about celebrating that it's about celebrating life not just it gets a bad rap as being a sex Fest which it's not exactly that that that is part of it we'll touch on that in a second yeah well I just wanted to kind of reiterate the the the vibe of belan which especially for you and I from being in the in the northeast of the United States that is really almost like our coming out for the year because where we're from it is damn cold up until not saying that belan has always been warm but it is damn cold up until about belan belan is where we kind of always UNH herited we've been Hermits all winter you know wrapped up in our fleece blankets and this has like always been like the first weekend we were out in the weather out in the sunshine kind of breathing that new fresh life that was always a big thing for us was where we're from you can almost count summer being from Bel aain a sin it kind of followed that whole Irish mythology which is where the holiday comes from it's a a holiday that marked the beginning of summer in Ireland being from a similar climate I don't know if we treated it that way intentionally but it just kind of felt that way it's belan it's summer it's not the official beginning of Summer but it definitely marked the beginning of camping season outdoor season you know hooray hooray the 1st of May outdoor camping begins today substitute camping with your verb of choice you start to see flowers you know the birds are out like it's just it's unlike I mean ostara yeah those little pings of Life are going but by belan we're like full force and and and ready to burst out just like the flowers just like the grass and you know even the animals you start to see the robins around belan you start to see the rabbits you know it's a very fruitful time yeah it's a celebration of life and all of that Force returning to the Earth and to us it's the first time of year you can literally run outside barefoot up here and and feel like summer has begun and all those energies are starting to kind of Quicken within each of us too so speaking of those quickening in us you know belane has been known as a fertility time which yes absolutely not going to take away from that and with fertility yes does come sex but to say that belan is a sex ritual a sex holiday I would say is very untrue but does it happen absolutely yes and I think we shouldn't we shouldn't separate that there are a lot of meanings to fertility and to sex and to this life and new beginning but I don't want to demonize sex itself because sex is a joyous act it is a wonderful part of life and so we need to make sure that that is honored as well you know there's going to be belain for kids and there's going to be belain for adults and those two things will be different in honoring that there's more to it than just sex I I do also appreciate that pagans are quick to also say we also honor the sex part you know there's the beginning of Summer and the new life and the new beginnings and then there's also sacred sex and that's just as respected and good but I also want to point out that that is absolutely not a requirement you know maybe maybe you're one of those folks that that's not your Vibe that's not your thing and that is okay you can celebrate belan be a part of belan and have none of that involved that's okay but in the same respect you need to be respectful of the people who do choose to have that be a part of their ritual and their celebration so you got to respect everybody's opinion on the sex part you know I love that you brought that up and I'm going to go on a little bit of a tangent and bring up our old Pagan Community yet again because I think they were very ahead of their time in a lot of ways and one of the things that we did every year for belane was we had men's and women's Mysteries oh I loved that me too where the community would separate into a quote unquote men's group and a quote unquote women's group and I'm putting verbal quotes around those words because even from the early 70s I think when this group first started you went to the group that you chose to not necessarily the one that your body or your birth certificate said it was called men's and women it was called men's and women's Mysteries but you could have gone to the men's Mysteries if that was your choice and no one would have flinched an eye I believe they were quite proud of saying that their very first May Queen which is the May queen and the May King are chosen at these men's and women's Mysteries their very first May Queen was a biological male and they were quite proud of saying that because that's how it went here you yes they were men's and women's Mysteries but you went where you felt called to and I know several people that would change from year to year and that was fine and you know it's funny because no you know it was never something that was thought about or questioned or mentioned nowadays it's such a Forefront in everyone's political mind but back then you just went where you went and everyone was like oh yeah come on let's go at least in the Pagan communities most of them most of them were like that and and I love that our home Community was and continues to be like that it it was has always been inclusive that way even to the point of like you said sometimes this can be a little bit too sex centered of a holiday right children do come to this holiday and we want it to be all the different levels of fertility and and all the different things that this season means and so after much discussion the community came up with a third third group that they called the fools and we had the fools mystery and people could go to the Fool's mystery if they didn't feel called to either the men's or the women's mystery or if they were a child and they didn't feel that they were grown up enough yet to go to one of those Mysteries they would go to the Fool's Mysteries and oh my goodness do I love that group they brought what was missing I think to the belan ritual I don't want to call it chaos energy because that makes it sound disruptive but they brought this beautiful chaotic energy to that space and it was desperately needed and it was perfect it was perfect they did and I've also seen the fool not just be chaos but also be wisdom because a lot of times the fool in a court was The Bard right they were the wise one right you know we've seen many different sides to the fool just like we've seen many different sides to the king and the queen of the May so maybe let's explain what a May king and a May Queen is just want to point out before we before we explain what a Mak king and a May Queen is I just want to point out I was never picked to be a May Queen I was the May Queen I know and and and that's why I had to point it out real quick aside there was a legend in our community that if you stood next to this one particular beautiful wonderful goddess of a woman who will remain unnamed but it's Danielle um if you stood next to her you would be the May Queen when I was there I think it was my second belan I happened to be standing next to her and she was telling me that like three years in a row the person next to her was May Queen and wouldn't you know it I picked the bean to be the M queen that year and I think it held true for the next two years after that so there was quite a long run she had like a six or seveny year run with someone standing next to her was the May queen with the May Queen our local community didn't have some like deep-seated like definition of the May Queen per se kind of the legend of the May Queen is being a symbol of that fertility that vessel of potential growth kind of the nurturer in our community and also in Pagan lore she was the holder of that energy she held the energy of growth and of the Fertile one and yeah she kind of she kind of carried that energy for her community and in our in our tradition in our Pagan Community that's what she symbolized as well we used chant usually it was a bean or a stone or something um non-toxic that was baked into a cupcake or into a cake and then randomly someone would choose that and I believe if you got the if you got the cake with the bean in it you were cosmically chosen by deity to hold that energy of the community to carry that growth that fertility energy for your people there are some groups that that pre select a May king and a a May Queen I really like how our community did it and kind of made it like a Divine picking you know it was it was very random and the thought process behind it was that the God and the goddess chose the Mak king and the May queen and I really liked that but we are not negating in any way if you go into it having a pre-chosen one because that may be tradition and that may be the way you do it and that's great just our experiences was random and fun I liked it it was fun even though I never was picked and I loved the Mysteries the Mysteries themselves were always very meaningful and helped me connect with the other people in community and I loved the belain ceremony for that and then afterwards we would have the May Queen who embodied this fertile energy of the community and the May King who embodied the energetic side of that energy would come together and we would do a mapole dance before the ritual let's just talk real quick about the mapole because I think a lot more people are are familiar with mapole dancing than maybe even belaine itself um for those that don't know if you see you know that big tall pole different colored ribbons around it um and people holding the ribbons and dancing isn't there something where you're supposed to actually weave them into a pattern because our community we had a issue with weaving it wasn't our strong point everyone would bring a different colored ribbon that we would attach to the maple which was usually a tree that was cut down from the property by the men's ritual yeah men's Mysteries uh and the women would dig the hole where the mapole was planted as part of the women's Mysteries and we had a lot of fun rituals around both of those but anyway so the men would bring the pole which put into the hole and then we would attach all these beautiful ribbons to it we would dance in a particular way to weave the ribbons the Queen the May weaved good no the queen of the may had a white ribbon and she did not follow the pattern she was allowed to dance and weave in and out as chaos or deity dictated however she chose as that random chaos spark of Life Factor right and the idea was you could tell how your year would go by how the weaving was if the weaving was good you would have it you know an orderly good part of the year and where it was chaotic or nodded or straight you might have that kind of energy later you know our our community was used to the chaotic based on weaving exactly right exactly right and weaving is Big this time of year because again it's all about growth and it's about kind of weaving those threads for how you want your summer to go you know and kind of the things that you've already started now you're weaving together to to turn it into a tapestry for your year or for your season or your life similar to oara it's I don't want to say you're planting the seed because a lot of that seed planting was in was in ostara but you're still kind of wrapping up planting those seeds and germinating those seeds so when you think of the sexualized part of belane it's really the God and the goddess producing New Life germinating that seed exactly and you can harness that type of energy in your life in so many different ways on belane doing a ritual where you go out side with bare feet maybe with a a a ritual item that you want to charge and think of all that new energy that growth that excitement that fire energy because this is a fire celebration think of all that energy entering into the item that you want to charge you know what I've done in the past what's that I've used belan and sin for all of our southern hemisphere friends um I've used those two holidays to kind of either cleanse and reconsecrate tools consecrate new ones I've gotten or like you know how you have that one quartz crystal that you had for 20 years and God knows what you've done with it in those 20 years because it's like what I've done with an athim before kind of like your whole pole in the hole just kind of stick it in and just leave the butt out and then kind of do like a cleansing and having the Earth cleanse the blade and all I don't know I kind of look at the both of them as it might not be relevant to the holiday itself but because they are such high holidays it's a good time to sometimes get your back in order another great way to do that is because it is a fire Festival one thing that ancient people used to do is build a fire on a hill and they would often build two fires and maybe drive their cattle between those fires or walk between the fires to cleanse themselves to bring fertility to themselves a new couple would jump the fire to bring and so in your home if you're lucky enough build yourself two fires if not take two candles and you can pass your tools between them or over the flame or just ceremonially think of the flame passing around your item to cleanse it and to reconsecrate it and to bring that growth energy to it you know that Vitality is an amazing energy to hardness it can give you Insight strength it can give you the drive to move forward in projects in in things that you want to bring in into your life because it's it's passion it's life it's such vital energy that it's a great to tap into you know I think sometimes when we put too much thought into oh it's belan I got to do something huge I got to do something big sometimes with these bigger holidays I feel like less is more we've kind of been separated from that that Greater Community we used to be a part of um mainly because we moved away and I mean I know you're kind of starting to ramp up with with a group but I'm still here lonely in Salem so weird it's so weird so you think to yourself how am I going to have some sex crazed fertility ritual if I'm a solitaire that's where you kind of take what you've been working on for the last however long and use the concepts of belan you know fertilize those seeds that you planted at ostara you know you can't just plant a seed walk away and expect it to just boom you know grow into something fabulous you know if you're trying to make a change in your life and you planted that seed in ostara now is the time to start working on things that are going to germinate that idea that are going to germinate that plan that are going to get you to that next step whether it be physically spiritually mentally whatever so you can just think of sex as a metaphor absolutely you know I don't get me wrong I am all for sex at belan I'm just trying to be like the devil's advocate here I agree I am also all for sex consensual obviously sex Abol but that sex energy is Vitality it is happiness it's Joy it's passion it's heat it's that desire it's want intense Drive intense intense drive and those can be translated into so many different areas of your life it doesn't have to be just the physical acts of sex it can be passion in a relationship passion to start a business it can be that drive to go back to school it can be that intensity that helps bring you to a new level you know in your meditation practice or whatever you can apply to whatever you need in your life don't get me wrong I have gotten pregnant on belain before you know my son is my witness it's not that I'm knocking it I just want to make sure that we're given our listeners balance absolutely I met the love of my life on belain go back to our our last belain episode I'll put a link in the notes if you want to hear the story so I know the power of belain it's definitely there like you conceived a son I found the love of my life we've been together what 24ish years now and mine was very intentional which I'd like to point out you know we did rituals I I was looking to get pregnant with a boy at that time and we did rituals leading up to belain and we did a belain ritual that was around me getting pregnant with a boy and sure as three weeks later that little test came up positive yes you did and I had done a sa ritual breaking ties with all old relationships that didn't work out all the Des you know people I couldn't let go of I let go of all of that and was free and was ready to start at belain with a whole okay let's face it I was looking forward to a summer of sex I even called it that my 20-some self was going to be carefree and happy and ruined to it I ruined it for you and introduce to boy at belain you introduced me to the boy at belain and I fell immediately head over heels in love and here we are so the power of belain is real but but definitely use those energies towards what what your goals are what you're manifesting what you're looking for I know manifestation is like the hot word of the minute and this is powerful energy yeah May 1 from the 30th to the first that whole time from the sunset on the 30th till sunset on the 1 you go with your bad self and use all that energy kind of bring it into your life use it for lots of different spells start a new Journal start a book of shadows I know that on belan I'm actually going to it's it's a work day for me darn it um but during my work day because it is an an office day I am going to plan on walking down to the oceans side on my lunch break and having a little one-on-one time with the waters um on Bel that'll be really nice sometimes you got to work with what you got and I can't necessarily go to to a ritual on belane itself but I can walk down and have a few moments between me and the water Gods down at the oceans side now I am lucky enough to actually be reconnecting with our old Pagan community and going to a beltin ritual for that weekend jealous I am super excited our coven did the belting ritual for
