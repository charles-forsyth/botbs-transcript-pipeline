hey welcome to back on the broomstick today we're talking about candle magic burn burn burn not just kiding welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi I'm Leila and apparently I'm a fire starter I'm shell yeah everyone always did like to call the fire element that was always a favorite I think we all have a little bit of a fire bug in us who doesn't love to stare into the fire crackling while you're camping or into a beautiful candle as you're sitting there you know I just want to kick it off with a little tidbit that I think we all forget about we have all every single one of us no matter who you are where you're from we have all performed candle magic if nothing else on a yearly basis and yes you're right I said it birthday candles yep exactly making a wish on a candle and then blowing out that candle and putting your breath into that wish that is like the purest form of magic there is so happy birthday blch candles I think we all kind of feel the magic of candl light you know if you're going to have a romantic dinner what do you do you light candles if you're going to have a relaxing bath you light candles you know it's part of our everyday life that we don't realize that it's it's a little mini ritual that we're doing each and every time it's one of my favorite ways to do simple magic you know I love when we have a big storm because you know the power goes out and then you have no choice you're living by candl light and let me tell you it's damn relaxing I don't know if we have killed ourselves with fluoresence or what but there's something relaxing about candle light something kind of subdued it does bring a different kind of energy people feel that whether it's like you were saying the different light wavelength or whatever that happens to be people feel that when a candle's lit and and there's a reason why one of the ways people uh will introduce someone to meditation is to have you picture a candle flame it is very easy to kind of zone out to self hypnotize yourself there's something to be said about uh fire scrying you know sometimes I'm zoning out in that fire but it's really more doing some fire scrying you're kind of in an alpha State when that happens so people are very open and receptive without even realizing it's a perfect state for scrying you think you can scry only in water or a crystal ball hell no try some fire scrying even if you're not doing anything magical even if you're just just hanging out and just staring into that fire there's something to be said for that how do you fire scry personally it's just a matter of as I'm staring at the fire going to Alpha it just kind of happens for me and if you're not familiar with what going into Alpha means or or how to do such a thing I highly suggest reading lorri Cabot's power of the witch um it'll give you detailed information on what that is and how to do it just going into Alpha and it just comes but I could say that about water scrying or mirror scrying or or Crystal scrying you know it's just more about getting into that mind State getting yourself into that magical mind and letting yourself see what there is to see an alpha state in your brain is one of the many different brain wavelengths that you can get into in order to meditate and an alpha state is kind of that state between waking and sleeping is a good way to describe it and we often go into that it's sometimes called the early morning stairs that people will get you know before they have their first cup of coffee or if you've ever been driving on the road and missed your exit because you know you're kind of driving on autop you might say yeah you're usually in an alpha State kind of in a self- hypnosis State that's where you want to get to when you're trying to meditate and so some people will have you envision a candle flame because of what shell just said it's an easy way to get into that meditative Alpha State between waking and sleeping and so if you're looking at a candle flickering Flame or a fire flickering flame that can help lull you into that that Alpha State and that's where you get to when you're meditating and where you really want to be when you're trying to do spell work or ritual work because that's where you're going to connect with your deepest self with deity with nature and with the energies all around you so you're in a very magical State when you're in that when you're there and so if you're going to do divination work getting yourself centered and protected and in that Alpha state is a must and so the fire can not only help you get there it can then be that reflection that shell was talking about to see the future but then you know when you're starting to talk about candle magic um which is a little different than fire scrying it's one type of magic right candle magic is kind of like a little niche form of magic think of it as like herb magic using different colored candles and and maybe different oils and herbs in and around your candles to Aid in a spell or a in some sort of spell working or magical working I do try to go along you know there's there's a color code like a lot of things there's a color code to candle magic and I do try to stick with that but you know red courage love lust you know orange attraction encouragement but when in doubt use white white is kind of universal you can use it for any you know sort of spellwork candle magic uh candle work what are your thoughts on the colors I love colors because they do help helped us set a mood right if I have a circle and I have in each quarter a white candle it's beautiful and it's perfect and sometimes that's what I need I need balance because like you said white is like the universal color same thing with black I think you can pretty much use those for pretty much anything right but having colors there just makes it that much more special to me in my mind it feels better I like it when the color corresponds you know we've talked before about magic being a like for like kind of thing if I have a blue candle to represent water and emotion it feels right and good to me whereas if I'm using a white candle it's probably just because it's in a pinch and maybe I want to inscribe like water symbols or write the word blue on it we've even gone so far as when we were a little on the poorer side I'm trying to put together a ritual when you don't have ritual tools and you want to still have kind of that altar set up so to say we have put a blue candle in the west and a yellow candle in the East and a red candle in the South and a green candle in the north and called it good and then we had a white or a white and black candle in the center for deity and that was our Altar and those can be candles from the dollar store oh absolutely they can be leftover birthday candles they do not have to be brand new candles for each and every time that has a place and there's times where you're going to want to do brand new candles well there are spells and and we don't want to skip over this this little tidbit there are spells that do require you to burn a candle from start to finish which by the way do not get one of those big ass ones from the grocery store that'll take you eight weeks to burn if that's your intent yeah color correspondence for me is a very important thing and I think especially when you're talking about candle magic it's worth honoring and respecting color uh color correspondences I think so too but I've also been super poor and picked a purple candle and called it good enough for red well we've done that yeah absolutely absolutely so I'm going to say that you can fudge any color you want want to it's really going to depend on your intention and how well you can hold the thought that that green candle for South really does work but if you have the means and the ability red for South works too absolutely and and candles are so cheap nowadays it's pretty easy to grab a couple it does not matter where they come from but just like shell said use white or black if you don't have the correct colors come close enough if you can and then pay attention to how long they burn yeah because that's pretty important if you're doing a spell and you need to burn that candle from start to finish for the spell sometimes you'll do it over time period like you'll burn it every night for three nights and then you should be done with it but sometimes you need to burn it in one sitting and so you really don't want a 12-hour candle if then you're like I got this Yankee jar candle and it's GNA burn for 96 hours damn it so you know a little pre-planning helps little pre-planning if you are strapped for cash buy those big huge pillar candles that are a little bit more expensive find one on sale just get one and have that one candle represent all of your elements and the reason you can do that is because candles themselves contain every element which is one of the things I love about it you've got the air you know when you put it out there's the smoke but even while it's burning it represents air it's Distributing the air it has fire in the fire it has water the wax that's melting and it has Earth also in the wick and the wax and the the heftiness of itself so you can represent all four elements there and and even spirit so if you really must be frugal get like a big ass candle and something that you really enjoy but you can have that represent all elements and do it that way another Frugal idea that I've taken advantage of in the past is um so you know how you get what I like to call Candle Butts oh oh yeah so you got a bunch of candle butts melt them down and you can actually make a brand new candle out of the candle butts and you can actually make that candle for your intention for a spell or a magical working so you can melt down some old wax and recreate a new candle out of that and charge your intentions in or maybe put any oils and herbs add that to the candle when you're remaking it so that's also a good that's also a good Thrifty way to to continue on with it we have done this in the past and we have made making that candle part of the ritual or the spell itself and it's super easy get yourself a pot yeah and fun get a pot from a thrift store put a can a metal can inside that pot don't use a pot that's really expensive that you are in love with because you might not be able to use it for food after this yeah just Thrift one because you're going to put a metal can in it you don't want to do that to your good pans so put water in your pot put your metal can in inside the water in the pot and then put your candle butts in the can bring the water to a slow boil and just let that melt do not leave it alone this is highly flammable exactly but melt those down and then pour it into whatever container mold you have around with your new Wick and like shell said put some put some things in there put some herbs make it a whole ritual put a little bit of oil in there right but it can be a very powerful way to add extra energy to your ritual or spell you know we did touch a little bit about um using fire for divination and and and fire scrying but I also wanted to touch on real quick and just mention that you can also read candle wax I don't know if it's anything you've ever done I have not but you can actually uh do divination with reading the candle wax I've seen it done two ways and I've done it one are you talking about the way the candle melts or the way I've done it is I've done a spell and then poured the candle wax into a bowl of water actually the part I was talking about was pouring um some melted wax into the water tell us about it and then I'll tell you my experience you know I never really heard of um seeing the the formations as it melts down but that's actually a good idea um I've read a couple stories actually one of the ones I read I I read it and it also came with a YouTube tutorial by the way love a good YouTube tutorial what they do is they almost do it like teaspoon by te spoon drop a teaspoon of wax in the water see what it forms then drop another teaspoon of wax and see what it forms and it it seems like people do that either three five or seven times so you either drop three drops in or five drops in or seven drops in almost like if you were going to do a three card five card or seven card spread with tarot interesting yeah so it's almost like the first droppings would be card one if we were going to equate it to tarot and then the second droppings would be like card two it is not something I have actually done and after reading into this I'm actually thinking of checking out some candle divination and see what I find out because for all the Divination I do how different can it really be it was interesting when I did it now I'm going to say that I was a very young 20s something it was probably right before I met you I think I did this I was in a moment between several relationships none of which were good and I really wanted to let go of all of these attachments and I felt a calling I felt like my soulmate was out there I knew he was looking for me too you know that kind of feeling that wasn't before we met I remember that well yeah I was still going through it when we met you know it took me a minute but one of the things I did at that time was I did a a love spell uh it was more of a divination spell like who is he what is he like and to be honest the whole time I was doing the spell I was thinking of a past lover someone that I had been with before that I knew was bad for me and I knew I needed to get away from but I wasn't really strong enough to let go of you know we've all been there been there done that while I could feel this call of the right person I was still tied to the wrong one so anyway I'm doing this spell and I want to see what my future holds for me who my future love is the thing I did wrong was I was thinking of this other person part of the spell was I had a bowl of water that I had blessed and had under the full moon you know the whole nine and I had this big white candle big fat white candle in a glass jar right and I'm burning it and I'm doing this whole divination and at the height of the spell I pour this white candle wax into my bowl of moon water and I'm asking for a sign you know of course it cools very quickly and I look in the water and I see that this wax has formed a pair of legs that look like they're running run far run far that was my side and it was pretty soon after that that I did the ritual at sa to finally let go and break all of those ties and and it worked beautifully but that was my sign you know it did not give me any type of hint towards my future love it just told me like you said run far I needed to run away from what was not working for me what did not serve me so that's how I did it was just one pouring it wasn't multiple pores okay okay but I like the multiple poor idea now does it say anything that you should look for symbols or is it looking for some type of sigil does it give you any like divination tools it doesn't and it seems like it's more of a personal preference like I might see a giraffe you could see a butterfly you know part of its perspective right it seems I think so too and that's pretty much I don't remember where I got that spell from to be honest but I do remember that the Divination portion of it was similar to tea leaves in that there were some symbols that seemed to be Universal but most most of it seem to be up to personal interpretation right and I think you know and that's that's what a lot of magic is to be honest it's personal interpretation yeah you know and in any form of divination you can say the same exact thing it all comes down to personal interpretation if I were doing something like that this is where I would think colors for me would be for me personally not judging nobody would be important you know if I'm trying to do divination for love maybe I should be using red candle wax if I'm trying to do divination for my finances I might want to be using green candle wax if I'm trying to do stuff you know about communication maybe yellow so that's again where I would think for me personally I might want to personalize it more with candle wax color I agree and it's really nice to use that candle wax in multiple ways afterwards take that candle wax and pour it onto a piece of wax paper and then stamp a Sigil into it to complete your spell and then carry that as a token you can put extra herbs or or a stone into it and again put that in an amulet or keep it with you to be part of that spell if you need it to carry forward this topic was actually suggested to me by my daughter we were in the car when you said what's the topic and I'm like hey girls what have you heard lately what's like what are people talking about like Witchcraft and they talked about a candle spell where people they were taking two candles and tying them together um people I've heard of doing that as like a like a a faux cord cutting instead of doing a an actual cord cutting um they take two attached candles and light them and kind of let that that cord burn and and and separate the two entities oh yeah cord cutting this one's a binding spell oh I see how would you do a binding spell like that entwine the wax together have them burn close enough that the melted wax entwines together okay so it can be used for a binding spell where you tie the candles together burn them together and then as it the wax puddles together with the cord there's your amulet right there right or you can have them tied together so that when they burn they burn that cord and sever it and again that like for like connection is a severing so that's very symbolic of of severing that connection and letting it go yeah I can see where you could do either one of those now the fun thing with candle magic again it encompasses the elements air fire water Earth and spirit candles EMB body all of that and they're super fun to do spells with because you have all this blank surface to write your spell I used to love to Rune candles I would write my spell out in runes and then part of your spell is etching those runes that spell letter by letter onto the candle that you are then going to burn you can put in your own sigils you can rub it with herbs you can rub it with oils you can do so many things to a candle that then becomes the whole spell right and again you know you just want to make sure that the size of the candle matches the intent of your spell make sure if you are using any herbs or oils that you plan to mix in or rub on your candles I can't remember what it was and I wish I did because this would be a good PSA announcement but I remember at one point using an oil rub on a candle and that candle kind of uncontrollably sparking that'd be scary and I don't know if it was the magic I was making or how the oil was reacting to being on fire either way it was a fire hazard that's all I'm saying anytime you're working with fire make sure you're taking safety precautions have some water have some sand have some type of Snuffer nearby do not catch your hair on fire I knew a witch who did that oh yeah I remember that yeah please be careful but shell also makes a really good point about using herbs and oils to dress your candle when you were talking about it sputtering you said you didn't know if it was part of the magic that's another part of divination that some people will do you can sometimes feel I know you've been in circle when you felt very connected maybe to the flame of a candle and you felt the power grow in circle and seen that flame grow grow with the power yeah or you know called air and seen the flame flicker you know we've all felt that kind of connection with the flame and sometimes it is trying to talk to us and people will interpret it in different ways like if there's crackling or sparking that might mean that there's some type of negative energy in the area you know if it burns down one side rather than the other sometimes that can mean whatever you're doing is one-sided a lot of the stuff is very literal if you look at it and kind of interpret it like dream symbols you'll get the idea you know if if your candle's burning and it's all spiky and all over the place maybe your energy is kind of all spiky and all over the place yeah or you know look at the shape of that candle as it's burning it might be trying to give you some type of sign or some you know be responding to some type of energy that's in your circle so you can kind of look at how it's melting and do a like a little divination that way as well the other thing I wanted to mention that I have also used candles for and I know you have to you can use the candles aside from doing spells and in particular magic but you can use the candles to cleanse other tools to cleanse things I've used the flame of a fire to cleanse my athame um I've used fire to cleans Stones before and and things like that so you can also use the flame of the candle as kind of like a cleanser or if it's not something that can burn because I've done this with crystals I will like take a quartz Crystal and just kind of wave it through the flame or just right above the flame you know obviously I don't want to burn myself or light my crystals on fire but you know just that act of either right above the flame or through the flame or if the candle is got like those herbs and some oils in it if that flame is a little smoky utilizing that smoke as a cleanser fire is very much a purifier it kills germs it reforges metal it it definitely can purify and cleanse so many things many cultures have taken advantage of this just in our recent belan episode we talk about ancient Celtic people building bail fires on belan two of them and passing their cattle their you know their sheep their Newly Weds through those fires to cleanse them and recreating that by having two candles you know maybe instead of passing it over the fire maybe you want two candles and pass it between those candles between those two fires but there's a lot of different ways that you can utilize that fire as a purification or a cleansing like shell does for her tools you know for whatever if you get a new tool if you want to cleanse an old tool I I do think it's important to cleanse your tools on occasion and fire and water are my go-tos like Michelle said one of my favorites is the smoke particularly if it's incense from loose incense smoke or I do love a candle maybe it's a candle that I've made or something that you've dressed yourself with own magic exactly and once that candle is burning you know especially it has a nice scent or something I do love to pass it over that candle and around that flame responsibly like you said you know above the flame no one's trying to burn our fingers here so it it's an excellent way to purify your tools to purify your space you can walk around your new house your new apartment with a candle and again that's one way to represent all the elements and sanctify your space I think for the most part my go-to is really these little birthday candles because you can get them colored and they're small enough that you can do a particular spell or working with it and and have it burn out to The Bitter End they're the unsung hero birthday candles I do love little tapers I like little tapers but you know what I've noticed let me get on a little soap box here for a second they charge ridiculous prices for those mini tapers like you want like five6 dollar the damn thing is like two inches big it's wax as many candles as we go through I think prices are ridiculous I like it much better like I said you know go some place inexpensive Dollar Store Dollar Tree sometimes you can get them at thrift stores pretty inex although thrift stores are getting expensive nowadays too yeah but here's my problem with candles from the dollar store in the Dollar Tree that shit's like 18 inches high what if I don't want to wait 18 inches of wax melting cut them in half oh I never thought of that see Lea's always full of tips and tricks folks always full of them oh I'm a Frugal witch that's the thing but you can take those long tapers and you can cut them if your taper breaks it's not a bad candle you've got two Candles now those little mini taper candles I love them and they're super cute but damn they're a ripoff yeah they can be very expensive and that's another good reason like shell said to use you know if you have a pack of birthday candles you know you can use those if in a pinch Frugal witches here I guess Michelle you live in the witch capital of the world and you can get magical candles everywhere I mean you walk to work and you probably pass 75 different magical candle shops 76 but yep how do you feel about buying candles that are for a specific purpose like if you go to the store you can find these Like Love candles that maybe even have a little love charm on them or money candles how do you feel about those do you ever want to spend any money on those you should know me well enough to know that my true Gemini self it depends on my mood it's true it depends on my mood because if I am in the mood to not be buying expensive it ain't happening I'm GNA make and dress my own stuff but if you catch me on a pay day and I'm walking down and I'm like oh look at that candle in the window you know so it it honestly it's a mood thing it's also what money I got in my pocket at the time honestly I am absolutely going to admit I have been swayed by the pretty candle in the pagan shop I can't it had a hidden crystal inside sh come on I mean the whole time I'm paying for it I'm saying I can make this goddamn like quarter of the price I can make it just it's probably gonna be more magical because I did it myself but damn it it's pretty and smells good I want it I want it okay like I like those that you know the thick pillars that you get oh yeah love me a thick pillar and and I can't [Laughter] they're pretty standard you find them in shops all across the country and they get like a band like one is you know for a healthy home or something like that I I do like those but you know I I do pay for them thinking I could do the same damn thing but I want to buy your pretty stuff and I'm all about supporting small business and I'm lazy so if my laziness mixed with my desire to support local business I'll buy the pretty candle in the window but I also you might also catch me making my own too yeah same I am often found at my any local pagan shop wherever I happen to land and I will occasionally buy the pretty nice smelling can we're like damn fairies we just get pretty shiny things pretty shiny things you know yeah my husband calls me a magpie but yeah and Etsy etsy's if you don't happen to live in the witch capital of the world like some of us shell yeah you can find a lot lot of these shops online are on Etsy so they're a lot of fun and same I want to support people if I can but most of the time I'm just buying Dollar Store candles especially because they burn fast hey I'm in the witch city capital of the world and I'm still going and buying candles at the dollar store so yeah that's the way it goes you do what you got to yep use a white or black candle if you have to but try to stick to Colors just because it makes it magic a little easier in our opinion and you know dress them yourself they are more magical that way try a candle spell yourself and see how it goes just be careful don't burn the place down so respect the fire Elemental and uh we will see you next time if you have any ideas or if you want to let us know what you think of our show please like subscribe and send us an email back on the broomstick gmail.com and we will see you next time have a great week keep it
