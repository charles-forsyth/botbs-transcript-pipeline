talking about ity happenings dueling Cryptids and a haunted house of NeverEnding renovation you know I don't care what your story is about because nothing is going to beat tonight the duel encrypted because when the hell does that happen I have to say a haunted house is spooky but dueling Cryptids I'm so curious so let's get into our story this evening it was just the full moon let's get talking about some witchy stuff yeah I'm pack a bowl why don't you pack a bong and then we we'll we'll start off with a little it's been a witchy week all right let's do it so I'm Lila representing the west coast and of course the best weed and the spookiest stories best weed my ass because I'm and you know I always am high but I am always still shell I'm still on the east coast and loving it awesome [Music] but I think you know in in in in terms of what kind of which are you I think one thing with the millennial group and this is why I kind of wanted to talk about this they're relying on the internet for a lot of things um we did the internet was up and coming when we were what in our 20s in our 20s yeah when I first when I was first looking I it was the late ' 80s and I was in high school in the mid to Le ' 80s and I I didn't even know what I was looking for really I had read The Mist Of Avalon and I wanted something like that between so I guess if you really want my history read the myths of Avalon and the Clan of the Cave Bear and or actually um was it clan of the cap beir or the valley of horses well the whole series the whole series The the goddess based religions in that book I I knew I wanted something like that my my soul wanted something between the Mist Of Avalon and the Clan of the Cave Bear kind of thing and but there was no internet then it was baby internet and there certainly weren't any witches on it in in as far as I could find in in theid 80s and the books were few and far between so especially where we both are from upstate New York not very plentiful in the 80s on the books on paganism or witchcraft very conservative areas very conservative and so they they didn't have much of anything do you remember how you first stumbled like your first inklings that maybe witchcraft was the path you wanted to go down sort of similar I didn't read Clan of the Cave Bear until after I met you uh you prompted me to read that but I had read M of avlon and there was just something that I just couldn't shake I couldn't shake it what's ironic about it is I had read that book and was like so I don't want to say like taken over by it but kind of and then shortly after that was when I met you and that was really what tied it all together for me yeah Wicked chills you were already started on that path when I met you and was looking for a way to get to that path and I I but it was I probably read that book about a year maybe year and a half before I met you and then meeting you kind of opened that gate more I had been solitary for a long time through my the rest of my high school years and then into college I had discovered Lori Cabot's book might have been one of the first ones where I the witch power the Witch and then Gerald Gardner's the big blue book I just a big blue book I still have one of those I still do too um and so I found those and I knew that there was a word for what what I believed and so I started calling myself Wiccan and which I I no longer longer identify with but at the time that's what I knew I knew I wasn't I was a Satanist for a little while in high school cuz that was the closest thing I could find but it didn't really fit it felt too Christian to me but yeah when I I had been a solitary and I would find anything I could I was looking constantly on message boards online for other witches and then when I moved to the Southern Tier of New York and and met you and a bunch of your friends and the group of pagans there that you guys and then an established Pagan group in the area and it was Absolut was mindblowing the first I still remember it was a a Ule ritual was the very first one that I went to and I can still remember kneeling in front of the woman who was who had called the goddess and I could literally see her I don't know if she was really pregnant in real life or if I just see her that way but just like beautiful you know pregnant and and you know about to give birth any second and just you know talking to her as if she was the goddess and just feeling so connected to that energy and just so in love with the community and and and meeting you and everyone else just really clinched it and it was like one of the best things ever it yeah that those were good times they really were another another uh thing that kind of happened around that same time is um around the time I met you and and and kind of figured out what this thing was that I I was drawn to a and dialup yes that's when that [ __ ] was going and chat rooms the AOL chat rooms yeah and you know I am not any internet historian by any by any means I am personally gonna call it the oldest Pagan type website it might not be don't send hate mail but it definitely is one of them if not the oldest and that's um The Witch's voice yeah the witch box The Witch's voice and that was like what opened the door to mass information you know we had talked about in our last episode and in previous episodes about our our hometown Ian our gifts that was a great shop that that we had access to but they only had so much and even that shop called itself an unusual gift shop right it was the Pagan store they had the herbs and the incenses they had the goddess and God figurines and the crystals and the tarot decks and the books but they didn't call themselves even right up until they passed away you know decades after we you know found them they never called themselves really they they recognized the Pagan community in the area but they did not call themselves a pagan shop but but locally and in person they were our only resource for a long time and then when when witchvox and the internet came about like holy [ __ ] we were just there was just so much so much information and so much and to kind of touch a little bit on on where I have always found myself from the beginning to the end is eclectic and part of that was the exposure to options yes the exposure to options you know they talk about hedge witches and kitchen witches and green witches and Cosmic witches well let me do four different rituals or spells and I'll show you each one of those witches and each one of those spells like yes the variety is fabulous with being eclectic I love the freedom of that because I'm someone always looking for new things to learn I I consume books in media and and so witchcraft to me was a natural extension of that I could learn as much as possible about all these beautiful wonderful religions and cultures and beliefs and honor them and cherish them in in different ways and and and I I love learning about them I now call myself a Universalist witch or a Universalist Pagan because not in the Christian sense of Universalist but more because I I love all of it I I'm constantly you know looking for new things and trying to learn new things and and I'm open to all of it and and I I think a lot of us grew up in in Christian religions I was in a very uh agnostic kind of uh household until my mother remarried into a very um I guess as religious as methodists can get but into a Methodist Family where church was you know you went to church and I I was supposed to be baptized and all of that and and I didn't like the constriction I didn't like the this is just the only answer and you have to believe the answer I give you I don't care that you've read three different books or philosophers or whatever I don't want to hear any arguments this is the answer and I hated that it felt too confining to me too authoritarian you know and I I kind of I kind of had that that same upbringing that agnostic you know I had very my my parents were both inundated in the Baptist Church um up until my birth scary I know right up until my birth but the minute I was born all of a sudden you know parents hate religion hold on hold on hold on a second uh your hippie wild mother um was a Baptist prior to yeah prior to sex drugs and rock and roll I wow that's quite the turnaround my parents met like a after school Baptist grouping Gathering get together and talk about baptis Stu what happened did your mom try acid after she gave birth to you or something and then and her mind expanded or what woke her up it was called 1969 that'll do it that did it my mother became a musician she started out singing and playing a 12 string acoustic progressed into being a piano player and a a rock and roll band so yeah like sex drugs in rock and roll a little bit of weed expanded her mind apparently we expanded her mind and and and my dad kind of went into the whole you know law enforcement if I don't have evidence it isn't real that law enforcement investigative mind if I can't find it if it if it if it's not provable it's not there so he just dumped religion as a whole interesting that they went in opposite directions it's no wonder they ended up divorcing right and and and and my mom kind of went into the free love and and all that but then we fast forward forward to to the 80s you know so so my parents were non-religious um when I was young but then my mother remarried remarried a Catholic became Catholic which she was searching too it sounds like it sounds like she was really looking for something I remember as a teenager thinking you're change you're becoming a what you know like it it baffled me but um very much Christian and Easter Christian and Easter Christmas and very much Christmas an Easter Christian so she did change religions uh to to to get remarried but we were on that cycle of we had to go on Christmas Eve to midnight mass we had to go on Easter Sunday and I just I just I hated it you know I was a chubby kid as we all know and you know what I didn't like about church what's that it was like exercise okay sit St Neil sit St Neil sit St Neil like I was not not down with s Stan Neil like I was a just wanted to sit there and be left alone and it was probably boring for a kid too and in retrospect I think I had a touch of AD ADHD non-diagnosed because I just I can't listen to anybody talk about stupid [ __ ] for an hour plus I can't I couldn't as a child or a teenager like I can't now like if you're just going to lecture me about stupid [ __ ] for like over an hour you lost me five minutes in I think that's pretty much anybody even neurotypical people have the same kind of thing right I just remember those Christmases and Easter just sitting there just as a teenager thinking this is a bunch of crap I'm being fed yeah yeah and I think it was those questions those same type of questions that led me to looking for something else that did have answers you I was tired of being told because I said so or because it's in the Bible and then I'd actually look at the Bible and that's not really what it said but even as a teenager and again just Christmas and Easter exposure but even as a teenager I felt like I was being programmed and I didn't like it like it was almost like I wasn't absorbing their Concepts because I knew I was being programmed and I was like if I wanted to do it willingly great but who do you think you are like I felt like I was being programmed that's the only way I can explain it questions I remember that questions were not welcome they were not they were not celebrated they were not looked into it was not hey let's dive deeper into this and look into it it was never like that first of all they hated the question and secondly the answer was usually very Pat very simple and it was usually this is what the Bible says that's it done and and I hated that I I couldn't I couldn't reconcile that with my mind that needed more answers more information and and wanted multiple sources I wanted to hear things from different sides and different perspectives and you don't get that right so I found I found pagans I went to I went to Salem Massachusetts for sin and I was a struck at how many pagans they were everywhere so many pagans it was breathtaking my heart was happy and full I met some beautiful wonderful amazing witches and pagans that kept in touch with for years that I still know to this day that I somehow found at Brushwood that we've talked about before some of those first pagans that I saw are now prominent pagans at this Campground that I went to so things kind of came full circle but I saw everyone there and I knew it was possible for hundreds of thousand and thousands of pagans to be together and then I moved a few years later to the Southern Tier of New York and met the Pagan Community there and that you and my other friends in college that were open-minded and questioning and and looking for the same things I was and it just kind of exploded from there it did it did and it was wonderful to find that sense of community and I love that people have that now in seconds you can get on Tik Tok you can get on any social media you can get on any internet anywhere and find witches of your particular flavor and that's the thing there's every type of flavor there's the very traditional the very ceremonial witches you know you're into ceremoni [ __ ] the whole kitten Kaboodle there's groups out there you know you're a kitchen witch who's going to throw in whatever you got in the cupboard to make a spell there's a group out there um I love it I love it so that's kind of why I always from day one was was more of that eclectic nature because I love it all agreed agreed and I I have to say that you know I wish I could think of off the top of my head some of my favorite authors and things like that I I can tell you one of the people that I'm looking at right now that I really love what she's doing is Jessica door d o r e she does tarot but kind of with a Twist she does it more philosophically she she draws a card every day and and really kind of gets into all different aspects of that card and and what it means for you for life for for everything and I I kind of love what she's doing and and she has a book called tarot for Change and she basically uses this her book says access the transformative power of symbol and metaphor through a guide to tarot that incorporates insights from the field fields of psychology and behavior change which is in my practice that's a lot of what I do for people when I do read tarot is you know it we kind of get into all of it you know what it means to them what do these symbols mean to your life right now and and I I just love how she's she's bringing all these different disciplines into tarot and it it's fabulous what she's doing with it so that's that's one person I in particular right now am kind of interested in in the field of I don't know if she's a witch to be honest but I like what she's doing anyway I just recently I I circled back to an oldie and a goodie and we we actually already mentioned it I recently circled back to Lori cabat power of the witch I love Lori cabat I love Lori cabat and and I love that I live in the same town as Lori cabat great store everybody should go to Enchanted if you are in Salem Massachusetts visit Enchanted it's Lori kabot store Primo Primo supplies it's just got a great Vibe just got a great vibe in there yeah I circled back to Power of the witch um this is something that that we'll we'll talk about in a future episode but I had a period And I I think that anybody in in whatever religion you are or spiritual belief or what have you I had a period of of of a little bit of a disconnection so I have been doing the reconnecting I wanted to Circle it back to where I started you know pushing 30 years ago with power of the witch I love that you know you mentioned like kind of reconnecting I think we all kind of go through Cycles in our lives and there have been times you and I have have been in a coven that was moving mountains at one time we were doing speaking engagements in New York state and up and down the east coast in you know into Ohio and other places talking about what it meant to be a witch at different colleges it was a time when witchcraft was really kind of just getting into the popular lexicon and so we were like right in the thick of it we were writing rituals we were hugely involved in our local coven we were involved with um Phyllis curo at that time and you know there's a couple books that mention our coven and right we I mean we were we were the bomb but then you know es and flows man es and flows and then we kind of went into solitary mode right all of us all of us not just not just me or you kind of our whole coven at that point kind of went went into like a solitary mode for a long time and you know life happens we've all had kids we've all had marriages we've all had divorces and and you know sometimes life happened and we all got dormant in that solitary rut and I I've been trying to break free of that of as a yeah I would have to say since our since our biggest time since that time at the height of us doing pretty much rituals nonstop you know we were doing Dark Moon our coven celebrated together on the Dark Moon we were doing dark moons we were doing full moons we were doing espit and sabbaths we were just busy aside from all of our speaking engagements right and then when we kind of left that and moved more into our you know our personal lives like you said kind of took different directions and we moved into solitary I would say it's kind of my practice has ebed and flowed since then there's times where I'm always you know doing rituals but very solitary and and I to have just this year coming back into you know trying to find time to meditate to do ritual to reconnect with those things and and I think it's important to do that like we just had the full moon here and and I I'm even just for a minute get outside do a small circle do a small meditation I had a small Chalice of water and Stone and some incense and and things out there that I wanted to charge just a few things that I wanted to have that energy of the moon so I just plac them outside while I did a small protective Circle you know just asked for blessings and peace you know that kind of thing and just kept it simple because I know if I try to jump in feet first and do elaborate rituals with chocked outlines and the proper symbols at the proper time which I love don't get me wrong I love that sometimes but if I triy to jump in and do that everything perfect High magic I would psych myself happening I wouldn't keep up with it you know it's it's like anything and so I'm trying to start small I'm pulling a tarot card for myself for the week and and that kind of thing and you know I I I've been trying to use it it's so funny because we have we actually haven't spoken about this aside from this conversation and it's very funny because it's been about the same amount of time about the last year and you know let me tell you there's something about living in Salem that makes you want to get back into doing [ __ ] again GE I'm so surprised that that's shocking sh I I what could be making you want to do that as we've talked before and I I posted a pick on our Instagram maybe I'll post some more here in the coming days I've been I've been into these spell bottles they're cute love them they so pretty I don't even know how I got into this to be honest it might have been the weed I've always been kind of the herb lady remember when people used to call me the herb lady I have a knack for like you have a knack for written spells okay that you shine in written spells you definitely do better at that than I do but where I shine is those spells where you're physically mixing [ __ ] you're always making the Perfect Blend of incense you always had just the right oil or just the right blend of herbs for whatever ritual we were doing we would come to you and you would come up with this amazing blend I was perfect you were the herb lady so I I'm trying to to Circle back to that but in the sense of spell bottles you know I I am adding a couple Stones here and there but I've gotten into the wax seals and which I hadn't before and you know so I'm kind of trying to do that potion kind of spells again those herbally kind of spells what I'm good at mixing [ __ ] together I love that you took something that you're very familiar with the herbs and the oils and mixing them together and you brought that to a whole new magical practice where you're making these bottles and if I know you the whole process is probably very meditative you probably gather your things together and you have you know you're doing your ritual as you're putting everything into the jar and so that in itself is a is a very meditative magical practice whether you're putting one together just to be pretty or whether you're actually doing a spell to put one together the whole thing is a ritual and I I really like that but I just thought you know sometimes the easiest way to reconnect is go back to what you know know best that's why I'm circling back to things that I may be spectacular at at one time in my life but it's been a while and that's a good place to start get back to what you know best first and go from there and there's something about spell bottles and I think it's that you see it and you're visualizing what that intent was the whole time or if you're burying it you know you're letting the Earth seep in that creation and that intention to to push back out I don't want to say the result of your intention but kind of I am not a big fan of littering I hate littering there is something to be said sometimes for for chucking one in a river or the ocean don't do it on the regular people that's bad ju guu but once in a great while it is warranted um there's just a lot you can do with them and I like that too because it's a very divers thing spell bottles are diverse herbs are diverse mix and [ __ ] is diverse I love it and I love it you mentioned that it's it's something that you can see and it's very visible magic like once you get to a certain point you can sit down and do a meditation and do your entire spell start to finish in your head just visualize it and that can be very very powerful however unless you can properly hold those Visions in your head for the whole time it it doesn't work very well it falls flat for most of us so being able to smell the incense to to hear the crackle of the Fire EX something tangible sometimes you just need something tangible no matter how little or how big it is yep and so having that physical representation in that small bottle you know you've got it all right there you can see it and so that makes it so much easier yeah so you know there there is a sense of there's a shift and I don't think it's just you and I you and I are not the only people who have who have who have tried to ramp it up a little bit in the last year so feeling that call back to to Natural to magical to the connectedness you know I think with everything that's been going on people are people are scared people are nervous and and we're wanting that sense of community that sense of connection again and so you know finding that and plus you know the Earth is hurting right now the Earth is crying out and I think we all are responding to that in different ways and and being more magical and intentional is one of the ways that we can kind of respond to that right right and and you know nothing wrong with a good meditation whether you are a witch or Pagan or Wiccan or whatever you could be a devout Christian and meditation will not hurt you sometimes they say it does do they really they do they do they they say that it can let you know Satan in it's it's one of those things where like it's it they say meditation and it kind of is is there are other religions and cultures where meditation kind of came from I guess and and so they say it's it's it's the influence of that religion and that it's an opening for demons or Satan put in your mind it peace is a opening for Satan I don't know I don't understand I I was only a c a Christian for a very short period of time I don't I don't get the mindset to be honest but one of my favorite easy easy peasy rituals is smoking marijuana to be honest I like taking the nugs I love growing it it's peaceful to me it's very Zen gets me kind of connected back to the Earth and then breaking up a a bud just kind of breaking up some of this pot still smoking on my xj13 cuz you know cheap but I like it I like the the ritual of breaking it up of making it ready to smoke of putting it into either a bong or rolling a joint those are the parts like when I go on a tea bre those are the things I miss is the ritual of getting ready to smoke and then that first inhalation and exhalation and so I will actually kind of mimic that by doing some small craft maybe and doing a deep breathing exercises if fact when I do go on a tea break which I'm contemplating doing one soon so but how about you do you have any uh rituals around marijuana or have you ever used pot in a ritual um going back to my spell jars I I that that really pretty spell jar I made last week um that I had showed you I put a little pinch in we are folk that covet the bud you know if I'm trying to to do something in an uplifting and happy uh good intentions positive change things of that nature I will put a pinchu in because it is something that because I covet it it it it has value magically to me I think it means that not just to you I remember seeing uh you could gotten a Tarot Deck The herbal tarot the 10 of Cups the happy family card the culmination of you know all these things is the marijuana card and and that stuck with me because it's so true I feel I feel that it's very very true it's such a peaceful herb so you know I I've actually in the last couple of spell bottles I've made um put a little pinch in I ain't wasting weed people don't get all upset here just a little pinch but but I will use that in spells I've used that in the past um in incense that I've made again just a couple pinches like I ain't all like abusing the weed and giving it away and tossing it to the wind here folks there's been time when I've done fairy magic where the offering I've left for the fairies has been a pinch of weed oh yeah I do that on the regular I mean it's something that I like you said it's something that I love and so giving that as an offering means more than something that you don't really give a [ __ ] about I know that you have always found a ritualistic aspect of packing a pipe and smoking it I necessarily have not mine has always been more of a using it in my Creations I think that's really interesting you know the coming at it from different aspects and we can do that you know again the whole being eclectic being Universalist is is is using things in a way that feels right to you and feels natural and honors is the thing that you know whether it's a ritual or or a spell or or a plant you know you're trying to honor that thing you know honor that that energy and and and you know when you're solitary you kind of do what you want when you want how you want it and that's the way you roll but in in terms of being in a coven you know there's been a couple of things where we're very similar but the exact opposite you can function like that in a coven situation you can maybe not always but in ours you could because you know sometimes this time we do it your way and I'd sit there and and try to ritually smoke weed and then other times you'd try it my way and use a pincher to a weed and a spell that we were creating so again back to why I love being eclectic is just because you try it doesn't mean you have to fall in love with it you know you might not have liked using it in in herbs and incense and such and I might not have really gotten a whole lot of it ritually smoking it right right but either way we you know there's always that so hey let me check this out May maybe it won't work and that's the that's the joy of it is trying to find things that fit you and and work for work for you and in your practice and helps to make you feel closer to Spirit to the Earth to the universe to to the one exactly and I can get that from smoking I just don't NE necessarily get that through the act of smoking right and and for me I've kind of you C you can make anything into a ritual you know there's there's tea there's tea drinking rituals you know people have whole types of rituals around serving food or or doing something of that nature and so any simple act can become a ritual everything comes down to intention my friend it really does it really does so what are you know we we've had a little bit of a witchy talk you kind of mentioned what you were smoking oh I have something fun today I am smoking you got I'm still smoking the xj13 but I made a bunch of bubble hash I used I used the as end of a bunch of jars I had you know when you kind of you know you're breaking up a jar or a bag or whatever and you get down to the end and it's kind of like stems and the shitty buds that you didn't you kind of picked through before yeah I had a whole bunch of jars of that left and I had a couple jars of stuff that was good but not exactly the tastiest weed not your best weed ever exactly maybe it didn't look so one jar didn't look so pretty and there were two that just weren't that tasty and then a bunch of ass ends so I dumped it all together and I froze it and then I used my little bags and some ice and water and I made myself some bubble hash and it's fabulous so probably I would have to say bubble has tends to have what's the THC on Bubble has about 60% they think it can have about THC content and about 60% in bubble hash wow could be a little higher I tend to just use the um you know I kind of give away the lower grades cuz when you do bubble hash you have a couple different grades I have three different grades when I'm done of hash and the lower grade I tend to give away the middle grade is my kind of like everyday smoke and then there's the little tiny bit at the bottom that's blow your mind has to be I know it's got to be over 60% THC cuz I just put a little tiny bit of this on a bowl Ando that'll kick my ass I am toasted absolutely toasted so and it's very very tasty so basically you're just taking the knocking the tricomes the THC Laden little crystals off of the off the nugs and that's pretty much all you're left with so it's very yummy nice yeah so some so some boring xj13 with some super tasty bubble hash so basically you took your mediocre weed and gave it a shot of Awesomeness that's exact I put awesome sauce all over the top of it it's fabulous I have a new one today I love it what' you got this is called melon baller oh melon baller does it taste melony I was just gonna say it doesn't taste anything like melons damn I have had weed that had kind of a melon taste before and it was nice I'm sad that doesn't no actually it's more I almost want to call it a weedy taste oh okay your weed tastes like weed gooded tastes like weed that I don't know how to describe that greeny weedy taste I know pretty much what my XJ tastes like just greeny weedy smells good not as compact as I've been getting lately okay so this stuff I don't actually have to grind up but unfortunately I've gotten in a Groove for the last several weeks where I've had weed that had to be ground up so now it's almost like habit so I'm gr so instead of your traditional stuff and shove you kind of got used to the whole grind and pack uh you know you do something 21 times and that sh be a habit now it's a habit but it's it's definitely it's definitely not as compact it's a little more fluffy which I haven't had fluffy weed in like weeks and weeks so I'm not all upset about that but good taste good high I got to admit though that as you can tell and as we talked about when we got on it's given me the kind of high that I actually didn't want to get out of bed and sit in my computer chair so I'm actually recording today in bed I'm sitting and I'm dressed but like very relaxed time nice like I mean I like I said I'm sitting up I mean I I'm got I got clothes on but I am just propped up with pillows kind of lounging out in my bed today and it's all M and baller well I have to say thankfully we are recording on a Saturday today because this awesome sauce I am I'm very happy and I can but I cannot focus so I find myself sitting over here just smiling I'm like noding at what you're saying like yeah that's so deep man and then I forget what I was going to say so so I'm having a great conversation with you but I might lose my train of thought that's okay you're losing your train of thought I'm laying in bed we're having together we got this girl we got this so you know it's actually um it's a 31% THC nice so you're really high and really comfortable you don't want to be this isn't like I got [ __ ] to do weed this is like I'm lounging on the weekend I gotcha that sounds like a great weekend weed I love it actually it sounds like we're kind of maybe different weeds with maybe different levels but but we're definitely in the same Vibe of well I have to say by putting the the bubble hash on top whether it's 60% or or what percentage it has to it very much did take my mediocre weed to the next level for sure I do think it's kind of interesting though that adding something like bubble has can really turn a a mediocre weed into an amazing weed point to ponder and I I've been doing that lately with like Keef adding Keef to the top of some mediocre okay stuff so yeah maybe it's mix and match time I'm going to get you introduced to the wonderful world of hand held torches so that you can get over your fear of the GI I don't know what's

a little bit longer so you go first with your brief one and then I'll get into mine now you know I love Cryptids you do you're you are like the crypted queen you're always coming up with spooky scary creepy Cryptids is this one going to ruin yet another one of my cherished paranormal things you could die with this one again oh no but this one has an Archen enemy oh okay it has a nemesis we we we we have a crypted like crypted Archen enemy Nemesis thing going on here I love it I love it oh it's like a it's like a Battle Royale in the crypted world it is it is in the names they'll just kill you oh boy they're both kind of brief I'm going to kind of talk about both of them in in their history all right first off we've got the Deo I hope I'm saying that right if you are from the state of Maryland please tell me if I'm saying this wrong so this is from Maryland um the Deo and it is actually Maryland's wolf man why is it called the Deo where does the term Deo come from that I'm not sure since asked it sounds like some mixed up term of like when to go I'm wondering if it could be um Native American just because of the the area Maryland was also much like most places on the East Coast very active with Native activity back sure yeah they lived all over here but this is described as having features similar to a wolf with dark fur over its entire body long bushy tail doglike nose but it stands like a human and it use utilizes its four legs like arms and it is said to be about six feet tall like that thing in Texas kind of yeah but this one's from Maryland oh well maybe it was on a road trip we all do it you know it is hey some of the ones the Sasquatches travel down the East Coast maybe deos go from Maryland to Texas it it actually it actually could be um because you know when you look at the whole grand scheme of the world they're not that far apart that's true okay so they stand six feet tall now this is where gets kind of funny about this this this mortal enemy thing so according to Legend the Deo is the mortal enemy of do not laugh at this uh oh oh don't tell me that the Deo is the mortal enemy of the SN gaster the the SN gaster [Laughter] we smoke way too much some of these crypted names the SN gaster okay that's my new favorite crypted okay okay the SN gaster okay I'm not laughing see I'm not laughing the snallygaster yes shell go ahead and tell us about the SN gaster the SN Gast is another area crypted Maryland must be a hot spot another area crypted that is described as a listen to this [ __ ] a flying blood sucking reptile whoa seems excessive that's like a lot of creepy things all in one for real um and it has been cited in the Maryland portion of the Blue Ridge Mountains okay stay out of the Blue Ridge Mountains I gotcha the Deo and the snallygaster have had vicious encounters reportedly dating back to the early settlements of the Middletown Valley what so actually like not only has there been sightings of the Deo way back to the early settlement days but also the snallygaster as well as their vicious encounters their vicious SN Gast encounters with a Deo you laugh but that damn thing is a flying blood sucking reptile that's attacking the six foot tall wolf standing on its hind legs wolf do we get a pay-per-view of this cuz I would totally buy that I I would pay for that I want to see these battles are they singular is it like an army do they like like how do they how do these fights happen dive bombing from the SN gaster what's it called that's scallywag what the [ __ ] it called again SN gaster SN gaster Okay so the first mentions of the Deo come from a sighting in 1944 so like this isn't like super old okay okay and the first sighting comes from West Middleton in Frederick County Maryland and Witnesses heard the creatures frightful screams and then Footprints attesting to the claims of the sightings oh the tale did not come to prominence until a newspaper account in the Frederick News Post on November 27th 1965 which gave a d detailed account of the creature and what they what this newspaper article says in quotes near the woods of Gabriel State Park John Becker went out in his yard to investigate a strange noise it was getting dark and he started back to the house when he saw something moving towards him it was as big as a bear had long dark hair a bushy tail and growled like a wolf or a dog in Anger as it got closer it stood up on its hind legs and attacked him Becker fought off the creature until it ran into the woods leaving him his wife and his children in horror deciding to remain anonymous until the Alias John Becker he filed a report with local state police telling of an attack by a mysterious monster that he called Deo interesting so it sounds like this guy John Becker um is actually kind of the person who named it but I'm not sure where he did he pull that out of his ass is it something a name that he had heard like I don't know where Deo comes from but this guy named it basically that's the first known like written account of something called a Deo but once he once he talked about his story in the Frederick News Post in 1965 then more stories started coming out in area newspapers where other sightings were being reported in nearby areas once somebody admitted that they saw something [ __ ] up then other people were willing to do it no one wanted to be the first one to sound like a crazy one it sounds like maybe this is something that they had known about for a while this is something that people had seen and obviously had a name for to but wouldn't talk you know they talked about amongst themselves but it wasn't really something they were going to go on the news and say until this person under an alias told the newspaper and they did a story on it and then people were more willing to talk but that sounds like they had known about it already yeah it it definitely was something no one wanted to be the first one to talk about it publicly kind of thing but in the summer of 66 the creature was cited again on the outskirts of the Gamel State Park when a man who was only referred to as Jim a encountered the Deo as he was heading towards his campsite he described it as a Shaggy two-legged animal the size of a deer that had a triangle-shaped head with pointed ears and a chin dark brown in color and when he approached it it made a horrid scream and backed away from the man oh wow Jim went on to say that the creature had an odd walk as it retreated like its legs stuck out from the trunk of its body and its movements appeared almost spider-like as it backed away didn't people say that's how the Texas creature moved kind of yeah as a matter of fact now that you mention it I didn't even think of that maybe it is AO on a family road trip then in the fall of 76 another that sounds like a song another sighting of the Deo took place in Frederick County near thurma where two men were driving on Route 77 onto a private road and there they saw a large creature run across the road in front of their car and they described it as and I quote at least six feet tall but inclined forward as it was moving quickly its head was fairly large and similar to the profile of a wolf the body was covered in brown or brittle colored fur but the lower half had had a striped pattern of noticeable darker and lighter banding the four legs were similar and held out in front as as it moved the back legs were very muscled and thick similar to perhaps a kangaroo this was not a humanoid type creature it did not have the characteristics of an ape it was much more similar to a wolf or a ferocious dog however it was definitely moving upright and appeared to be adapted for that type of Mobility creep yeah I was particularly impressed by the size and strength of the back legs and the stripes on the lower half of the body and the K-9 wolflike head so detailed I know right um so later in 78 two Park Rangers near the Cunningham Falls area encountered a large hairy creature running on two legs now this is where it kind of I don't know if you've maybe heard of this but more than uh two centuries ago another creature in folklore is similar called a hexen wolf a hexen wolf yes and in and in the late 18th century the Pennsylvania Dutch had started I was gonna say it sounded like a Pennsylvania Dutch term the Pennsylvania Dutch settled in Upper Maryland Carol Frederick and Washington counties of upper Maryland because you know Maryland is the first sign of civilization once you get through Pennsylvania and almost immediately people started talking about wolf light creatures back then wow describ similar to the Deo you know feature similar to Features similar to a wolf but with a stance and stature like a human so maybe the hexen and the Deo are like the same crypted same thing the legend of the hexen wolf had long been known to inhabit tracks of land across much of eastern Pennsylvania and they even talk about the hexen wolf and German folklore which is kind of like the underlying basis of Pennsylvania Dutch so you know there is a back history of What's called the hexen wolf that is very similar to the Deo but I can't sit here and tell you that they are the same exact thing but it's possible from the sounds of it maybe people had brought you know this legend of the hexen wolf with them when they came to Maryland and maybe that kind of joined in with some local tales and and became the Deo so where did the fight with the with the scallywag s Squatch thing come in Sally gaster so this is right the snallygaster no this is actually where I was going to kind of kind of wrap it around here the first written reports of the see I can't get like an exact date of when they started talking about the Deo other than a couple of centuries ago okay here with a SN gaster the first written reports of the SN gaster date back to 1735 when you guessed it German immigrants to Maryland makes sense Pennsylvania Dutch right there German immigrants to Maryland talked of a scheller gist or fast ghost a flying Beast that was alternately described as being like a bird a dragon a harpy or a demon or a combination of them all creepy creepy I love that Gees only cited at night and was unbelievably fast was it lizard like though well it said dragon likee I mean oh yeah that's kind of that's lizardy yeah sure different description but same kind of meaning you know sort of kind of yeah most of them agreed that it had wings a razor sharp beak with teeth tentacles on the face scales and a scream like a steam train whistle and you guessed it an extremely bad attitude bad attitude all right well you know when you look like that I can't be surprised right so most sightings of the snallygaster were in land but it would sometimes this is so funny and and I'm reading this word for word just because I want you to know how funny this is most sightings were in Maryland but the snallygaster would sometimes fly to other states to terrorize local people for just for fun just for fun sometimes it likes to go sightseeing basically don't we all don't we all but this is the [ __ ] with a snallygaster it would steal children and livestock it would [ __ ] that leave the kids alone you nasty little thing did Theo Ste kids adults no see what it would it would try to pluck you out of the sky like a freaking Eagle oh like that video of the golden eagle trying to steal a little kid yeah except it's a snallygaster and actually in 1909 there was an hourong confrontation with three men on a train platform with a snallygaster and they were actually able to get away and Theodore Roosevelt was contract was contact to try and hunt it down what wait wait Theodore Roosevelt the teddy bear guy the president guy freaking Teddy Roosevelt was contacted to try and hunt it down hunt down a snallygaster the former president went hunting for big game that's why he the I I don't know you're [ __ ] me I I'm not making legit legit a a dude who became president hunted a crypted I will sh my goddamn screen with you right now I love that that's fantastic he's now my favorite President like in his presidency he had a lot of animal heads in the white he was a big hunter that Big Game Hunter so yeah no they legit reached out to Teddy Roosevelt to try to hunt down the snaile guest that's fantastic I love it but even better in the 1920s federal agents were able that the federal agents actually got to look at them they actually one of them got so drunk one of the federal agent drunk I wouldn't have believed it they managed to get a good look at one as it had been attracted to a still and drank so much moonshine it fell down dead the agent or the crypted the crypted the snallygaster freaking smelled the shine and was attracted to it drank it all until it died um the the agents were pretty surprised to find the snallygaster in the moonshine mash e but you know what they did what they blew it up ew well no evidence I guess the only real check on snallygaster is the Deo so basically it takes a lot to kill one and the Deo is our only hope but they don't say where the feud started they just say that they Feud because they're in the same area they're trying to share the same territory yeah I think it's a territorial thing it it is really kind of the problem the Deo try to steal the SN gaster's eggs oh I see oh it's an egg laying creature you know dragon flying laying eggs makes sense makes sense and the Deo tries to steal them okay right okay yeah that would start a you know the whole you're stealing my babies I gotcha that would do it so they kind of they have a a mouthwatering taste for the snallygaster egg they just can't stay away from those eggs it's the best omelet in town right I just want to take it back to Teddy for a minute I just want to point out to you that the the Smithsonian institution offered a reward for the hide and the US president Teddy Roosevelt was actually considering postponing an international trip to actually go hunt the Beast so he could get the hide that's wow wow hey who knew a presidential crypted hunt it's not even a presidential the crypted hunt the US president is gonna put international relations on hold okay well it's probably a good thing that he didn't I suppose or maybe he should have and they wouldn't be running rampant today but here's a and and this is where I don't think it might be exclusive either of them exclusive to Maryland there's actually been sightings of them having a fight the snig gaster in the Deo fighting in not only New Jersey but West Virginia oh so they're migrating someone also claimed to see a sighting of both in Ohio that leads me to believe now I know we have a lot of listeners out there who are totally IND Cryptids and I might even like like try to ask you guys questions on Instagram so be ready crypted people but has there ever been a battle so we got the SN gaster and the Deo and they like going into Pennsylvania and Ohio and New Jersey and all that has there ever been like a battle of the Cryptids like has the Jersey Devil ever been like dude this is my freaking State and you need to go back to your own States because the Jersey Devil thing is me here yeah have they ever run into a Congress of sasquatches right right are we having some crypted con vention sure maybe they're friends maybe they get together and it's a big old reunion that's what I'm wondering because if I was the Jersey Devil I'm thinking to myself that's my state that's my territory I'm named after New Jersey what are you doing with your crypted ass in my state yeah exactly I would think it would be bad maybe they pretty much try to stay in in their own little territories so both of these things the SN gaster in the Deo pretty much make Maryland their home but we'll say as well as surrounding states just a little bit though not into anyone else's territory as far as we know it seems like the big war between the two is really a a egg and food issue gotcha just much like any other predators in an area you know they have these nests and the nests are where unfortunately the Deo can get them and they're tasty treats man wow I like tasty treats I have the munchies right now actually oo what are you eating you eating anything no sadly I don't have any Munchies I just want them so that's that's my big crypted story for today I just thought you know I think the the most hysterical part is the fact that there's two they're Waring and that Teddy Roosevelt was like I love the presidential angle that's fantastic you know you don't who no one told me that in social studies were you sitting in 10th grade history hearing about the SN gaster because I wasn't no if they told I would have learned way more about President Roosevelt if I had heard that you know the Educational Systems here need to pick the facts they're telling these kids because you want to interest me talk about the snallygaster and I will remember what president Teddy is all exactly I would have remembered all of it I would have so my story goes back in time a little bit to roughly the same time period late 1800s early 1900s a house at 525 South Winchester Boulevard in San Jose California the Winchester Mystery House oo this is a good one this is a great story so what year was do you know what year this house was built I do tell well it started in 1884 and it didn't stop for 40 years that's like some [ __ ] like if I'm going to contract you to build me a house it better be done in my lifetime here people like 40 years what the hell were they taking a lot of lunch breaks like what was going on that it took 40 years everything was going on the construction did not cease it is rumored that a hammer was falling every second of every day for that 40 years that some type of construction was going on 24/7 365 days for 40 years why well the rumor is that it was a curse that well we'll get there let's get let's start at the beginning I love curses let's start at the beginning so we're g to start with a woman named Sarah Lockwood parie she was born in 1839 in New Haven Connecticut to an upper middle class family and she was the fifth of seven children she was very well educated she spoke four languages she was beautiful and quite intelligent she was practically a genius in math and science and was very well educated even though back then women weren't really considered whatever that's right so during that time you know women educating women was seen as not necessarily something important but it was it was good for a woman to to speak languages and and to appear educated so she might not do anything with it but it was good to have knowledge Pioneer man she was a Pioneer exactly now she married a childhood friend who just happened to be William wart Winchester a man who was heir to the Winchester repeating rifle company oh so like the actual what we know today is the Winchester rifle then correct the family that created that that started that that designed it and then started manufacturing it and became extremely wealthy oh wow so this is this is the heir to that company's wife correct Sarah is is the wife to William who is the heir to the Winchester fortune and they get married things seem wonderful and around 1868 she gives birth to to a little baby girl that they named Annie unfortunately Annie had some type of wasting disease and she didn't live past six weeks old oh that's horrible and it devastated Sarah and William their grief was extremely hard they they took it very very hard and they were so depressed and despondent over the death of Annie that they decided to never have any children that's horrible that's heartbreaking it was about 12 years later William's father died in 1880 and as the only son he was the heir to the Winchester repeating rifle Fortune which at that time was about $20 million that's a lot of money in nowadays monies do you want to know how much I know you know I do know over $700 million damn and in addition to the $700 million Fortune it was also 50% share in the stock of the Winchester rifle company which generated a daily income of over $1,000 a day wow which back then was a lot of money do you want to know how much it is today how much $35,000 a day a day so not only does he have basically the equivalent of 700 million but he's raking it in every day that is correct then just a few months later he died of tuberculosis in March of 18 81 oh my God now this woman lost her child and has now lost her we'll call it high school sweetheart yes I see this taking a dark twist it does it does indeed you'd think that she would be happy she has this huge Fortune it it's so much money I can't even imagine spending it how do you spend $35,000 a day it's if you want to do an experiment give me 35,000 okay I'll show you I will try I'll try but yeah so she has unimaginable amounts of money and unfortunately unimaginable amounts of grief she still has not gotten over the death of her daughter Annie well that's the thing you know you can't you can't buy those losses all the money in the world and this poor woman is shattered exactly and so at the time spiritualism was extremely popular contacting mediums was very very popular and so she did and she contacted a medium who who got in touch with William's spirit and William told her that he was being tormented in the afterlife by all the souls of the people who had been killed by Winchester weapons oh gez and you know one thing that was big back then in this same exact time period and and I just want to point this out because you mentioned the the spiritualism movement the spiritualist movement that was happening at the same exact time is what sparked the modernday Ouija board which we are going to do a full episode in September um totally focused on the Ouija board and all of its loveliness but that spiritualist movement at that time period the Ouija board became a big thing because of women exactly like this she has had devastating loss and all she wants to do is connect with her dead loved ones because all of a sudden the new fat is just because they're dead doesn't mean you can't ring them up and she she wants to ring them up you know wouldn't you I would too if I would same situation if that happened to me today I'd do the same thing one of my saddest memories as a reader shell is I was um I had a booth at a a fundraiser and it turned out to be a a fundraiser for a woman who had lost her young daughter to cancer and at the end of the fundraiser I'm I'm getting ready to pack up and a woman comes in and wants a tarot reading and I could I told her I knew that she was trying to contact someone and I said that they weren't there they had passed on and she kept giving me money and asking for another reading and another reading and I kept telling her and it wasn't until about the third time she asked me that I realized she she was the woman that the the fundraiser was for and I told her I I said I know you're trying to contact someone and they're not there they have moved on and and that's and that's what I think you know especially with this Winchester woman part of that spiritless movement was and it still happens to this day if I give you more money you'll tell me and she did she let me give you another $20 and then you'll tell me let me give you another 20 so you can tell me you could throw all the money that you've got and it isn't going to make that connection her grief was palpable and I I I tried to give her the money back and she wouldn't take it I I ended donating most of it back to to the fundraiser I I couldn't do it um I wanted to tell her something I wanted to lie and maybe I should have I don't know but anyway Sarah was doing that with a medium and this medium contacted her husband she was just so grief stricken she wanted something to hold on to to her child and her husband and her husband said he was being tormented and that she was going to be haunted and possibly murdered by these Spirits if she did not do something to appease them wow talk about giving the girl some Terror quite a bit of it and who knows how many people then or [ __ ] now have been killed by Winchesters and weapons kind of the nature of the business exactly and so this medium said that William told her to go west and to build a house that would hold the spirits of all these people all these angry spirits that had been killed by Winchester weapons and that that way she would be safe but only if she kept building to appease their Restless Souls so she moves out west It's Like a Ghost Motel basically Sarah moved out west to San Jose California and she bought an eight room Farmhouse and then began the wildest the biggest home renovation of all time she started building in 1884 and never stopped until her down the Hammers never ceased at one point the house was seven stories high oh [ __ ] and an earthquake in 1906 damaged the house extensively and Sarah was trapped in a room and they actually had to pry her out using crowbars and it took hours oh [ __ ] so she was terrified and she took off the top three floors and then decided to go outward it eventually took up 26,000 Square ft of space holy [ __ ] one of the rooms was a grand ballroom that cost $9,000 at the time to build so she took basically the whole fortune and was using it to build onto this house never-endingly oh honey she just used a drop in the bucket of the fortune even though the house at the end cost $5 million at the time oh wow total that's just a pennies pennies of her Fortune to build this extravagant house and she spared no expense it was beautiful the outside of the house is in the queen an style which is ornate and gorgeous turrets and balconies and all of that Queen Ann deliciousness and the inside is something called the aesthetic movement and what the aesthetic movement is in Home Decorating is even useful items should be beautiful so the door knobs are carved and intricate the there's little details in everything it's all just beautiful stunningly beautiful who lived there with her no one she lived there alone in that big huge house in that big huge house so she has this Grand Ballroom I'm going to tell you one little tidbit here she built a grand ballroom in it is something very very mysterious in a house full of mystery this was really mysterious there's like a secret door in the ballroom oo and behind the door is a metal door like a security door yeah and then behind that door is a safe and once you get into the safe there's yet another security door and inside that security door was a safe what talk about being paranoid about your goods so something special was in there and it wasn't open until after her death what was in there what was in there what was in there I'll tell you later yeah all right so something very very precious so she had this beautiful Ballroom she had a seance room she was huge still in the spiritualist movement and had a seance every single day wow wow she was always asking what she could do or what she could build onto this house in order to appease the spirits in this house there are I don't know if you've ever heard of it but not only are there tons of rooms there are let's see there's three elevators six kitchens 13 bathrooms and the number 13 is really prominent there's 17 chimneys 40 staircases 47 fireplaces 52 skylights 160 rooms 2,000 doors and 10,000 Windows let's just circle back to one person lived there and also the windows to kind of put that into perspec Ive for you the Empire State Building in New York City has 6500 Windows wait and how much does this House have again 10,000 oh my God you have to have a full-time crew of window washers she did literally the the work never stopped on this house and she built it all out of Redwood she said it had to all be built out of Redwood was that what the ghosts told her I think so but she hated the look of Redwood so she had them paint it complete with a faux grain to make it look like a different kind of wood oh Lord I guess they use like 10,000 gallons of paint rich people problems right so build it of Redwood but make it look not like Redwood make it look like Pine right so the number 13 I mentioned was really important and it's all over the place there's like 13 panes of glass in a lot of the windows or or 13 blue jewels in the window that makes that makes sense with the whole spiritualist movement and some of the ideas that they were following at that time so for her to be engulfed in that movement totally makes sense yep there were 13 hooks in the Seance room uh 13 overflow drains in a sink in a room called the Hall of fires and 13 parts to her will which she signed 13 times superstitious much yeah just a little bit the house was filled with Innovation she had two indoor conservator she loved gardening and she had indoor plumbing and faucets built into almost every room which indoor plumbing was not really a big thing at the time she had push button gas lights she had forced air heating through the whole house she even had like a pneumatic tube communication system through the whole house so she could communicate with the servants that worked there which in this time period all of these amenities were like only for like not even the 1% like the 0.5% exactly she had a shower when at a time when everyone just had bathtubs and this house is wild to put it mildly there are staircases that go up to a blank wall there's doors that open to the outside or to a brick wall there's rooms built inside rooms the staircases sometimes will have little tiny stairs that switch back and forth and in odd spiral patterns some of the rooms will have Windows that are installed and used to type of glass so that the outside world looks upside down oh no [ __ ] there's balconies on the inside there's skylights and Floors that look down to the room below it's just a really unusual house and some people say it was built kind of mazike in order to confuse the spirits that came in oh like Hotel California once you come in you can't leave pretty much and and again the the thought was that she was trying to outrun all these angry spirits that had gotten her husband and her daughter and some people say that she thought that if she continued work on the house she might somehow achieve immortality that if that she and the house would just continue on forever kind of Mel into one basically yeah and it's also said that in order to confuse the spirit she would sleep in a different bedroom a different one of the 40 different bedrooms every single night so really honestly it sounded like her grief turned into paranoia very much much so very much so construction happened every single day for 40 years wow until September 5th 1922 when she died at home in a bedroom of the house so she dies 1920s what happens to the house well construction ceased immediately like workers literally laid their tools down got up and walked away that was it never went back ever ever ever never ever ever her kn was the sole heir to her fortune and um the house wasn't mentioned in her will at all oddly but the I believe all the objects were sold off and it took six months to empty the house of objects and then the house itself was auctioned off now remember I said she had spent about $5 million at the time 1923 money which is about 87 million today do you want to know how much the house was purchased for just five months after Sarah died oh Lord what $135,000 wow wow and it was purchased by a gentleman I believe who did Carnival he was known for doing carnival rides and he immediately turned it into a tourist attraction 5 months after Sarah died the doors open to the Winchester Mystery House as a tourist attraction and for hundred years it has been an open house does the man still own it the same or not obviously not it's been hundred years but like does the same family own it that got it at that auction I don't believe believe so the people that own it now do run tours and there's some pretty amazing Halloween Time Tours that happen there in the gardens outside are quite beautiful I keep meaning to get up there whether around Halloween or or elsewise the house is rumored to be very very haunted that's what was my question was going to be you know she's saying that she kind of built this house is like the hotel California for ghosts pretty much where the ghost's there if she's still there are there any paranormal activities noted give me the goods okay so Harry Houdini even went there after Sarah died and was unable to debunk supposedly the spirits in the house he at the time was well known for going around and and uh debunking mediums and seances and things like that so he reportedly was not able to disprove any of the The Haunted Happenings in the house nice most of them are auditory people hear footsteps uh someone coming towards them and there's no one there uh they'll see shadow people that shadow people are very often seen in rooms where there is no one they'll go into a room and you'll see a shadow Dart into a room or down the hallway and and there's no one there there's a few pictures online of the empty house but you can clearly see a figure of someone standing in the window looking out one of the apparitions that's seen pretty often is one of the like we call it like a video haunting or like a residual haunting this is a work one of the workmen I don't believe he died there but he must have worked there for so long that people people see him walking through the ballroom or working at the fireplace in the ballroom and they'll also see him pushing a wheelbarrow in the basement and people will describe the same man the same wheelbarrow in the same actions he doesn't try to talk to anyone or do anything but they'll see him going about his workday and he's seen very often there he basically forgot that he died and is still getting up and going to work every day pretty much even though I don't believe I couldn't find record of anyone other than Sarah passing away in the house which was surprising to me considering that there were 40 Years of construction you would that's what I was thinking after 40 years there had to be especially in that time period there had to be some construction accident there may have done but in my research I wasn't able to find it so if someone knows maybe let us know the stoned Witches Hour at gmail.com but people they do hear the auditory hauntings they do see people quite often and and just the feeling of the house it it's just really creepy there's a lot of hidden rooms and tunnels it was even in 1972 found a room they didn't even know had existed um W there I believe there was some damage to a wall or something and when they went to repair it they found a door behind it and opened it and there was stuff in the room it was almost as if she had ordered them to start building around it and had just forgotten that that room was there so even the family didn't know about it when they emptied the house after her death then correct and there was there have been numerous rooms that they have kind of found that way that are just plastered over and and just kind of Forgotten there is no floor plan to the house now one of the other non- ghostly theories for this is just that Sarah was an eccentric brilliant mind Who Loved beautiful things and loved architecture and she didn't have a clue how to draw a plan or design a house and so she would just give these ideas to the Workman and just wing it and go with it and then just fill it with gorgeous beautiful things and did that to kind of appease her sadness and and spend money man CU she had it to spend I would I would have to guess that it's probably a little bit of both you know and she was alone and eccentric she didn't go out she stayed in her big huge weird house and just continued to build on it and and so I think rumors kind of kind of flowed but she definitely was into spiritualism well she had a staying room for God's sakes that's right and after she passed away they did break into to that many doored safe and do you want to know what was in it tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me in it was just a cple simple things it was the obituary for her husband and her daughter and a lock of each of their hair ooh and that's it those were her most precious things that she kept the safest that's pretty safe that's pretty safe yeah so yeah she she continued to build and they say you can still hear the sounds of building and just wandering through the house it's stunningly gorgeous and it and it had so many Innovations for the time and and the the story itself is really sad and and the fact that people consistently see shadow people and workmen going about their business and and hearing the workmen hearing Sarah walking up and down the stairs it's it's creepy but in a nice way right right I mean and we see that a lot there's a lot of stories you hear that houses castles buildings were built out of out of love whether it be love of two people still alive or love one of them passed away but you hear a lot of these stories about places being built out of love that get abruptly ended due to death and then just are kind of hanging there with that same residual NeverEnding Workman yeah it doesn't always have to be like a bad energy just because Spirits are attracted there and and this type of maze I imagine it reminds me of a spirit bottle like a witch's Spirit bottle that has like broken glass or something to trap Spirits in stuck right this is kind of a house this is a a giant Spirit bottle that kind of traps things in it because it's just that confusing Maze and so I I wouldn't be surprised that it it it holds things there and and you know maybe that is what her intent was because if she locked the spirits in the house you know they couldn't get get to do the do the things that the spirit of her husband said they were gonna maybe she did manage to appease them maybe she did manage to to build a trap for them I don't know hopefully at least she was reunited in some way with her husband and her daughter how'd she die in the end was it natural causes did the G causes the ghosties finally got her I know it I think she was 88 when she died she was in her late 80s octogenarian I've I've seen her called I know she was in her 80s when she passed away and I believe it was natural causes in the house and she's the only person I could find that had passed in the house I would love to go check that out it's got me too gotta be super cool it's a little far away for me to go like going to the wh house but we're going to do it one of these days for sure nice well I think we had a day we have had a wonderful night I love talking about witchy stuff I am so excited to
