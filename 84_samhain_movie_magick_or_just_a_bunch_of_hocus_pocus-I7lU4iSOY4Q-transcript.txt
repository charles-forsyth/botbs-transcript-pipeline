the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and in this episode we'll be talking about Witchcraft and magic in movies sa is the perfect time of year to curl up with a favorite witchy movie is there any real magic in Hollywood shell and I watched a few classic Halloween favorites to find out but here's what we're gonna kind of pick apart what's real and what's not in these Hollywood movies because I'll tell you I've got a couple movies where I was like you know hey I've kind of done that before so we got some movies we're going to chat about what's real what's not where we at we are deep in the Season of the Witch heading towards sin so we will also throw in some sa tips and tricks for you from some of these facts in the movies and the movies we'll be talking about today are some of my favorite to watch this spooky time of year we are going to be talking about magic from Practical Magic I can't wait for part two to come out me either the craft the original not the Remake great movie and Hocus Pocus a seasonal favorite I feel like Hocus Pocus in October is like Rudolph in Frosty the Snowman in December yes it really is my kids and I used to have a packed that we would not watch Hocus Pocus until October 1st but as soon as October 1st came it was No Holds Barred we watch that thing over and over again I love that movie me and my sweet love what we do about the end of September every year is we pluck out all of our what we call Halloween related movies and then we watch all of those movies each night throughout the month aside from Rocky Horror always being at the top of the list uh Hocus Pocus Practical Magic The Craft they always get pulled out I mean obviously we feel witchy all year long but you know is the season to be witchy we've been having a lot of fun with authors and pagans that we know some amazing witches that we've had on the show so it was kind of fun to relax and kick back and watch a couple movies well and honestly again is the season I don't know about you but here in like New England it's like 40 something at night now it is like time to hunker down cuddle in have a movie some hot tea and just yeah like yeah it's movie season it got dark and cold really fast so the idea for this episode came because you know I was watching Practical Magic and the midnight Margarita scene came on and I was like hey that sounds awfully familiar that sounds like a spell and it is lime and the coconut you mix it all together first of all why do you only you can have Margaritas any time of the day by the way true Margaritas are more of like an anytime kind of thing but you know in the Owens house got to listen to the aunties can I just say how can you not like a prone type witch played by record Channing I love the aunts so much oh my goodness I can't remember the other aunts real world name she's been in a billion movies The Amazing Diane West the two of them together spot on and who hasn't loved stalker chanting since Greece oh seriously but one of the things that the sisters the aunts say is a poem and it's a poem actually from MC Beth Shakespeare's MC Beth do tell eye of N and toe of frog wool of bat and tongue of dog adders fork and blind worms sting Barbados lime is just the thing frag salt like a sailor's stubble flip the switch and Let The Cauldron bubble and that's when they they make the margaritas and that poem is actually mostly from MC Beth until the lime part and then we start singing putting the lime in the coconut that's right but I love that scene because those are actually really truly herbs that are they're like code names they like secret witchy sounding code names for real herbs now I just want to point out since we're starting with Practical Magic this came out at a time which was kind of poignant for for me I don't know about you this came out in 1998 so I was only really maybe seven eight years into witchcraft at that point in a small town in Upstate New York where knowledge is limited I was like oh my God a witch movie oh my God to see witches portrayed as pretty and not ug old and ugly not old and ugly that was the thing it was like they're not portrayed as like these evil hags you know but there are some things that aren't quite so real and then there are some things that are maybe not real per se but are based on real things so let's sh about those things like the herbs that I was talking about those are Act ual real herbs that they speak of Eye of noot is mustard seed and that's used to protect against evil it's for increasing courage and strength toe of frog is a buttercup which I had no idea and that is also for protection wing of bat or wool of bat is moss and that provides grounding and stability and it's often used to connect to Nature and to manifest Prosperity can also be protection tongue of dog is Hound's tooth and that flower is used for loyal Y and communication adder's Fork is dog tooth Violet and that's for transformation and change blind worm sting is wormwood and that is a a very powerful protection herb as well Barbados lime that's for purification uh fragas salt like a sailor stubble uh also black salt can be used for protection fragile salt is actually a black salt not a magical black salt but an actual colored black salt physically looking black salt so you could use that for protection as well so basically when they're doing that spell for the midnight Margaritas the aunts don't know it but they're casting a protection spell even though they were not yet aware that there was an evil spirit in their midst so you can use those if you wanted to make your own protection spell for sin or I like the idea of putting a bunch of those things in like a spell jar or or a spell vase you can put your salt and your moss in the bottom and build it up like a little spell jar but that's a real thing in the movie the next thing I kind of want to just bring up they're in the car remember when they were in the car with Johnny was that his name in the back seat back seat yeah and they used the badana because what they used it for is to kind of knock them out yeah and that really has a magical use for kind of I don't want to say putting you in like a dreamlike state but they have used that as like a hallucinogen I don't recommend taking it at all Jee no just like in the movie it can kill you but I think that the premise of that is valid yeah so the herbs that they use in that they talk about in that movie are correct the other thing I really liked about that movie was the aunts in the beginning when the sisters are very young and the the woman comes to the door and she wants a love spell because can I just tell you that scene annoyed me and let me tell you why I'm interrupting you and I know that okay tell me why I'm curious that is the epitome of the people who kind of pick on us and and make fun of us and when I say us I mean kind of witches and pagans as a whole there are people in the world that will mock the out of us until they want something magical that's 100% what happened in the movie you're you're absolutely right yeah and I feel like the the representation of that woman was like someone who might scoff at them out in public until she wants the love spell you know what I mean yeah that's exactly what they were trying to portray there I mean with the town's people constantly picking on them but you know of course they come around to the back door in the shadows there's a damn line out back of them well what I really liked was the one Aunt jet said are you sure this is what you really want there are better ways to find love she literally tried to talk her out of it and she also gives her a warning so the whole spell they take a lock of the person's hair and they have this Dove and a long long pin that they give to this woman who then has to kill the dove as she asks for what she wants that's not real people by the way not real poking a dove with a pen who the hell does that nobody does that well I haven't done that not in our tradition not they jet even tells her when that happens be careful what you wish for so they tried they done night they gave this woman every opportunity to back out and she was insistent on doing this shitty spell anyway so I don't know I just liked that they showed that aspect on the flip side of that fast forward to when Sally does a love spell for herself yeah she lists all these qualities that she says are impossible so that she'll never have to fall in love I want a man with two different colored eyes right the Stars his favorite symbol you know all of the things that's the kind of love spell I agree with and that that is a more realistic view of Witchcraft I agree that's putting out there the qualities that you want in a lover flowing the Le Fountain to the wind into the universe and you know not onto a specific person right be careful what you wish for now we also reference quite often there's a lot of broom lore in this movie including of course everyone knows that when a broom falls down compan coming my grandma used to say that so that one's there plus they also invite all the women of the town over to let their inner witch fly and tell them to bring brooms because they form a circle with the brooms and then later they sweep out all the bad energy out the door with the brooms all of which is true I just kind of laugh at the I don't know Gathering all of the again gather and all these neighborhood women that mock you and but yet come to your back door like that was my biggest complaint about the movie and it's not the movie it's just that's a realistic thing that's it is it brings to light an issue that annoys me I guess is is what I could say yeah and you know that Circle supposed to show that once they were included you know once those towns people were included on that inner circle they tended to let their guard down and be a little more accepting I think that's what that was supposed to show I I think the possession part of Johnny was a little Hollywood I'm not saying I disagree with possession but not how they portrayed it yeah but as far as like broom lore what you can do for sa I know a lot of people like to decorate brooms in fall and Practical Magic is a good point to show you you don't have to go get some3 $400 broom they're gorgeous don't get me wrong if you can get one get one but you can also equally as effective use that Dollar Store plastic broom and I'm G to out Leila and let y'all know that Ila actually has a magical broom that is plastic from the dollar store and I actually call I call it her Practical Magic broom it was given to me by the coven that I worked with in Rochester I adore that broom we used it in circle just like Practical Magic and I use that broom in my magical space I love it very much but if that's what you got and that's all you can get your hands on decorate that damn thing yeah exactly and and do cleansing spells use your broom whatever kind of broom even if it's just your household broom imbue it with your intention to clean for the witch's New Year for sin and sweep all that negative energy out your doors so that you can be ready for the the new year after sin you know in the movie they were sweeping a bad man out the door don't we wish it was that easy yeah right but you know we all have a little excess dirt in our lives that needs to be swept out and it's time to dust off your soul and broom magic is is a good way to get that accomplished yeah and sin is sometimes thought to be the witch's New Year some people think and and there's a little contention about this but some people think that because the Celtic people separated the year into two halves summer and winter like literally so this is sa Summer's end literally what it means and so summer ended the winter began and so that space right there was the New Year like New Year's Day so a lot of witches just do celebrate it as a brand new fresh start and what better way than to do some broom magic and to do some sweeping and cleansing absolutely so I I think there was some really good parts of Practical Magic obviously there's a lot that's not real witchcraft but all in all it was good and I love when the aunts talk about when Sally's running off the first time and the aunts say that they'll take the girls to festivals and and Sally's like you have to cancel and they're like we can't cancel we're on the committee we're presenting you know that that part was like a flashback of you and me okay I see us every time they do that scene I totally see you and me there another time where I see you and me not that we're out there trying to kill cross lovers where they're looking in the rearview mirror at each other and talking without words oh yeah yeah we've done that on more than one occasion to not that we're trying to kill men here but often to the uh frustration of our significant other companions so so let's bounce to another one of my most favorite movies our next movie is a '90s icon classic love this movie The Craft the craft came out in 1996 and starred my love fua bul I have the biggest crush I was going to say had but I think I still have the biggest crush crush on fuab ball can't help it what are you now this movie a little bit darker than Practical Magic it's definitely a scary story but again you know I love the craft and the one poignant point of that movie when I think of the craft that really sticks out in my mind is when they're on the beach you know where they're doing the ritual on the beach and the I was going to say the same thing you know they have like the snake in the jar and like the yeah I could see me doing that on a beach somewhere yeah now when it comes to walking on water well we're getting a little Hollywood here but up until the Walking On Water part but like that circle on the beach yeah yeah I love that circle on the beach as well okay so here I've got some interesting facts for you then shell did you know that that circle on the beach that initiation that they all did that was written in specifically because of the onset Wiccan advisor that they hired Pat Devon oh my God I have a point to ponder with her didn't she didn't she curse the set did she not that I know of I've read a bunch of stuff and apparently it was all very good one of the sets was cursed was it Practical Magic or was it the craft well hold on let me look it up now the consultant witch got pissed off and cursed the set I just read it today Practical Magic oh the 1998 movie Practical Magic was cursed by a witch consultant who was offended that she wouldn't receive a share of the profits you know how like movies will like hire Consultants to help them like put like some legitimacy into it they actually hired a witch as a consultant for the movie and the got pissed off I think she wanted like 3% of the royalties or some I don't know what it was it was about money anyway and they wouldn't so she cursed it cursed the damn thing the movie made recurse didn't work so I had to look this up so apparently the witch consultant was key on set Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman asked her a lot of questions she wanted three points and publish a Practical Magic cookbook oh wow so quote the director says quote she left a curse in some sort of tongue on my voicemail that was quite chilling actually and threatened to sue Warner Brothers they gave it to legal apparently so yeah she um she said some weird did actually happen I guess one of the like producers his dad ended up dying even though he was older and had an illness and like everybody freaked out that the witch made him die and like all this weird stuff was happening and they blamed it on her and it didn't do well initially at the box office you know it has grown in popularity but it did not do well originally at the box office so seems like her curse at least worked a little bit she must be kicking herself in the ass that they're making a part two all these years later but I laugh at that because you don't know with online Is that real or was that just something to give it a little more publicity yeah I don't know but in the craft I do know that Pat Devin that adviser was quite happy with their role in the film and did did actually I think a lot of good for the film one of the things is that beach scene that we were just talking about is an initiation scene where the four girls are like forming their coven and she had that written in so that later when they talk about how one of the girls has betrayed the coven they needed to establish something for her to betray correct and so that was written by the consultant the god Manon was made up but they do call quarters one of the things I thought was pretty interesting was they do I call upon the watchtowers of the powers of the East and that's a real thing yep now because I have to have an annoyance with every movie I do have one annoyance with the craft and it's it's Petty I know I don't like how they portray if you don't have the money for supplies you just go steal them don't steal that's not right I don't give a  what religion you are don't steal that shit's not especially not from fellow witches in the craft don't steal from them I mean come on PSA don't steal from a witch you know everybody talks about being cursed right now your ass will go down if you don't steal from a witch that's like playing with fire I do like the witch shopkeeper I think Lio Santana is the character's name which we're gonna have to we're going to revisit her in a few minutes because she reminds me of a character that we're going to talk about in our next movie she has a quote that I also think is very real and she says quote true magic is neither black nor white it's both because nature is both loving and cruel all at the same time the only good or bad is in the heart of the witch life keeps a balance on its own and I think that's pretty cool life keeps balance on its own I loved that character that that character brought a whole lot of realness I thought to to that absolutely and I love that shop I wish it was a real shop I'd go there and spend money absolutely go there so watchtowers we've called watchtowers before in a circle yeah that we do that when it's more formal absolutely those are definitely more considered high magic or in some Wiccan circles those are more formal circles but that came a lot from um the enoan tradition John D the Hermetic order the Golden Dawn a lot of that's from like the Lesser key of Solomon like shelle said High magic so that was real and having the girls each represent a different quarter a different element that's real oh the other one I loved do you remember when they said uh they they cast the circle and then they had each girl enter the circle and they would hold an athame to her chest and say it is better that you should Rush upon this blade then enter the circle with fear in your heart how do you enter and the response is love and perfect P trust ask me why I know that ask me why do you know that shell because we've actually used that in our own rituals eight billion times exactly before and after the movie came out because that's also a real thing symbolic death challenges things like that challenges to come into a circle being asked to come in with perfect love and perfect trust those are all real things uh we were much more Wiccan based back in the day and those are all more formal Wiccan type challenges in a lot of magical circles it's pretty common to have some type of challenge or even some type of threat upon your life uh if you break an oath before you come into the circle so those are all real I want to mention one more real thing that I like in the movie the one girl did The Binding spell against your favorite girl crush character of ball and she took um what was it like a her name on it or something I would if it was me I'd take a picture wrapped it up in in a ribbon and thing and said you know what' she say something to the effect so and so from harming yourself and others yeah that's legit yeah that's definitely that is a good representation of a binding spell in my opinion so thought that was a good one you know the glamour I'm not saying that glamour magic isn't real it doesn't work like that that was some CGI  okay it don't work like that no but what you can do for sin is be a little more formal cast yourself a circle I love casting an actual physical Circle take some loose incense take some sand draw a line around you in chalk but do a ritual where you actually physically make a circle pull around yourself and then face each quarter each Direction and Call formally to that element yeah formally you know try that for your for your sa ritual or for you know any spell workor leading up to just be add a little bit more formality to it and see how that feels for you and also conversely for S it's a great time if you need to maybe bind something of yourself that you want to stop causing problems or you know maybe that coworker needs a little binding you know kind of almost exactly what they do in the movie I I prefer taking a picture I've done it a couple of ways I've burned the picture you just write their name if you don't have a picture i' I've written their name when I do the name thing though I write their name nine times yeah it's a thing I'm weird I have actually put it in a jar of water and froze the picture but I do agree with the movie on how they do it wrapping it in a chord and stuff but I I'm big on burning things if it were me I'd wrap that picture up in a in a little ribbon and say my little Chanty chant and then light that on fire yeah freezer spells are definitely a type of finding spell wrapping them up in something also a great binding spell so those are all real things from the craft so last movie that we were going to talk about is Hocus Pocus we love Hocus Pocus I am in like freaking Hocus Pocus town right now do you know that every time me and my sweet love go driveing down this certain area in town There's ocean a Ocean AV is where the what was it Max's house the one that was the beach house and for some reason I always start singing that song There's a Place on Ocean Avenue but I am like you know I have the house where the Halloween ball was at that's in town I I go to work every day in my mundane job and I must see 86 sets of Sanderson sisters and I yes I'm so glad it has gotten better and Spider-Man Spider-Man's big this year downtown by the way I don't know why men are dressing up as Spider-Man to come to Salem but it's happening right now I love that yay I'm so glad they're finally starting to dress up I was getting a little worried that it was going to be so boring this year the costumes are picking up I'm seeing a lot of more quote unquote realistic wit costume I don't even want to call them costumes what do you mean by realistic wi costumes is it like a short chicken jeans and a t-shirt that looks like me a short girl in a T-shirt and a flowy skirt that looks like you oh okay yeah that sounds about right now people are still tending to stick to the black but people are coming and they're wearing the hats but I'm all I'm all for a hat but people are coming looking like everyday you and I witches okay all right they're not doing the Spirit Halloween Sexy witch costume that's okay I'm I'm cool with that which I've done that before and I'm not criticizing I have done that before Sometimes some days I'm a sexy witch it just you know it depends but if you're looking for the Sanderson sisters 86 different sets of them love it I love it someday I will have a really good full authentic Winnie costume with the teth be happy sure even with the teeth so in the spirit of talking about what is real and what is not in witchy type movies I gotta I gotta break some news to you Ila yeah I know what's not a damn thing unless I am riding my freaking vacuum to work okay yeah I came to the same conclusion I mean we could stretch it and talk about grimoires that aren't alive and candle colors that don't require virin but yeah for the most part even their history is fake um fun movie I absolutely adore it not going to knock it but there's not a lot real there it is the Frosty the Snowman of October there you go so what are we going to talk about instead okay so you've twisted my arm you've pulled my hair and I sat down and I binged Agatha all along yay yes yes finally thank all the gods I didn't do W division yet but I am going to circle back and do W division because you know I like having the whole story and not a part of a story so I will I will soer back to it okay so before we get into the witchy I'm going to ask you the same question I ask everyone who has not seen ju division first did the first episode confuse the hell out of you it did but as I watched episodes it in retrospect became clear so like in the moment I was like well this is weird but then as things kind of unfolded I was like oh I understand why back then this and that happened so they explained it well enough that even without the backstory you were still able to follow along yeah yeah um and then about Midway through the episodes I did go and Google a synopsis of w division but I didn't need to to keep up with Agatha I just chose to because you know I'm nosy very cool all right so I'm gonna start out with the very first thing that I noticed that was witchy and that is Agatha's charm her maiden mother Crone charm I want that thing oh my God I need so pretty right so all of the witches have their own magical charm so as they go through each episode you'll notice that their magical talismans stay with them in different forms so sometimes Agatha's pendant is a pin sometimes it's a necklace sometimes it's a bracelet but even though their costumes change to match the challenge they always have their protection charms before I forget I need to mention something about this movie that felt very real to me or not movie TV show whatever want to call it minseries that felt real to me that was like an instant flashback to the craft oh the lady so remember you said in the craft remember you said in the craft you liked the lady in the store oh oh right the the apothecary lady the Apothecary witch yeah the freaking Terror or divination lady not freaking remind you of her like the minute I saw that scene the minute I saw that scene it literally took me back to the scene in the Lilia is the Divination witch like was that the same actress like it was that close very similar I even thought in my mind at the time was that the same actress but like that whole session when her and the the boy the Teen um go in there and get that first initial tarot reading when they try to get her into the coven that a struck a cord from the craft and be kind of felt real like a realistic scene what struck me most about that scene and actually made me start keeping notes was Lilia her whole issue is people don't believe her I don't think she even believes herself sometimes when she has these psychic flashes when she has these visions and throughout each episode of Agatha all along she has Visions some of them relate to tarot cards and the first one happened when Agatha and teen came in and asked her to write down some names for the coven and she said three of P Pentacles and I was like that's like the collaboration card that's like the working together card I'm like that fits perfectly and then channeled the names to the point where she didn't even realize she wrote down her own name exactly exactly and one of the names she wrote was a black heart but that's a whole different theory for a whole different podcast episode now one thing I didn't like about a portrayal in this that's also equal to a portrayal in the craft is they do portray that you have to have a group of people and form a coven to be magical and that I don't agree with that's not the case you can be a solitary witch and make some happen you don't need a group of people to make happen that's right and and in in the Marvel world there's a few witches that don't and Agatha is one of them Wanda's another I know but like you know in Practical Magic in the broom scene they have to get all the neighborhood ladies to do the broom thing like I get the whole having to have a group but I also for certain things yeah it's not like make or break in my opinion oh yeah no so in W division or in Agatha all along that part is you have to have a green witch and you have to have a divination witch and you know you have to have all these different types of people to make a coven no no no no you absolutely do not I mean to open the road I mean if you're GNA open the road then you definitely do but for coven nah like that trip to Avalon we took there you go well we did have a whole coven for that one so she does mention tarot cards a couple more times she mentions the three of Pentacles when they form the coven and that does mean teamwork and collaboration then when she first meets Jen the root worker witch the potions witch she says High Priestess and Jen is very much about Divine knowledge wisdom spiritual enlightenment I mean she comes very much across as a high priestess and then later when teen is hurt and possibly dying she says three of swords and that is a sad experience um a lost relationship accidental death uh betrayal so that fit and then the last card she said was in the most recent episode which is completely up but anyways she said Knight of Wands when Alice was blasting Agatha with her energy and that usually means uh impulsiveness you know passion Kudos I I would assume they had a consultant kudos to that person I thought so too too and as I was you know kind of looking these cards up to see if there were any hidden clues that maybe I had missed I realized that the bitty tarot and the labyrinthos meanings online very closely matched what I thought when I first saw them and what the episode I think was trying to portray so I think somebody either was looking at labyrinthos or bitty Tero to get these ideas I liked that it wasn't as fluffy as I expected know when I saw the opening credits and saw like flashes from the craft and you know all the you know Bewitched and all that I was like oh Lord what's Leila getting me into now it had its Hollywood fluff but I felt there was a little bit of realisticness to it and you know okay so maybe we didn't travel down the witches road but we did take a a a astral journey to Avalon in the past and how different is that from what they were doing in my opinion so I kind of saw a lot of similarities to real world experiences that are legit and honestly that is a ritual that I I don't know if I would have done alone it was better because group scared to do that alone yeah that one so in that particular case I was glad that we had a group there so I I can see where you might need some extra people for a bigger working okay you're right but no I I also I love your point that you don't need a coven to be magical you Wich but if you're if you're doing some sort of traveling between the Realms like we were you know it's kind of like going to a bad side of town lock the doors and don't go alone you know very good point very very good point the other thing I noticed with Agatha all along I think it was like episode two or episode three where uh Jen The High Priestess the potions Witch is called upon to create a cure for a poison that they've all taken and again same thing with the herbs they mention the witchy weird names of the herbs again we hear eye of noot is one of the ingredients which is mustard seed toe of frog let's see this one the ingredients for Jen's spell are a corpse decaying for 30 million years frankincense guts of a you social insect eye of noot a hair from everyone's head and it needed to be sted with a dominant hand counterclockwise that's pretty intense  man right but it breaks down pretty easily the corps decaying for 30 million years is z Plankton which turns into petroleum jelly so you can just use petroleum or petroleum jelly for that frankincense easy enough the gut of a usocial insect is what the hell is that as teens so eloquently put it a gross way to say honey I see it I see it eye of n again is Mustard Seed and then the hair from everyone's head that is an excellent thing to add to this spell I've done that yeah that's what's called a tag lock by putting a piece of everyone's hair into this potion you're tying that magic to the people so that will work more powerfully for them and that's something that you can do in your spell work is add a tag lock for you or for the person that you're casting the spell on or for and that will make it more powerfully attached to them or more powerfully work for them them yeah and we we've actually done that before yep so tag locks are a pretty common part I just I like the fight scene which fight scene when she first uh sees Rio like episode one or two or something if witches could fight like that that would be badass bad ass but like I would say as the years go on the movies are getting better but I do want to address real quick there's this weird onine thing where people are kind of pissed it's like the internet is divided over Agatha all along really what are they saying I have had I I go all over the internet I see all kinds of weird and there are people who are kind of butt hurt because they think that there are people who are interested in witchcraft just because they watched it I have an opinion on this by the way oh okay you know I was at a young age when Practical Magic and the craft came out and I had already been practicing witchcraft for several years at that point but I'm not going to lie I was enamored and I kind of felt included in society knowing that there was these new blockbuster Hollywood movies about something that I was interested in who gives a if people are getting interested in Witchcraft and paganism because of Agatha all along who cares how what road did it you take to get here I agree it doesn't matter how you get exposed interest is interest and I just don't understand the people that are mad about it I'm not sure either maybe they're afraid that I think they're afraid it's an insincere interest correct and I think that the people who are insincerely interested will fall by the wayside they always do they always drop off they weed themselves out but like you said you were enamored I was too when I first saw these and it was really nice to see even if it you know I I knew it wasn't going to get it all right I knew that it was going to be fictionalized and that was okay well there's movies about Jesus that aren't all right right and that can still spark interest and I I do I agree with you I think these sparked a lot of interest for people and I think the ones that weren't sincere about it would drop it eventually and the ones that are would continue to study and find out what is real and what is true so everybody needs their introduction and this is if this is an introduction for people who are we to say that brings me to my wonderful way to tie in Agatha all Bel to sin which is you know first of all it's a wonderful time of year to watch this it can't stand that it comes out one a week but you could do a simmer pot I mean they created that big cauldron in their kitchen using a suita to heat everything up but basically they made a big old simmer pot in the sink shell loves a good simmer pot I do so make yourself a nice saour in simmer pot you can use cloves and cinnamon apples and oranges cranberry throw that in there throw in a little Bay in there some Rosemary and now you have a simmer pot that's also a cleansing and protective so as that scent goes through your whole house it's going to smell fabulous and you are cleansing it for that witch's New Year for sin I need to add something to that something that I have done in the past is write either a message to a loved one that's passed or just write that loved one that's past name on a bay leaf and then put those bay leaves in that simmer pot as well I love love that and similar to that using a taglock theory you can take a piece of paper or something or you can make a a little a corn dolly or make a yarn Dolly you know the whole symbol of the Wicker man a lot of people would make that wicker Man symbol and then they would burn that in the fire and people would put their things they wanted to let go of or or to burn away from their life or even things that they were hoping to get into that wicker man and then burn it so you could create your own little wicker man like I said out of paper or yarn take a tag lock of your hair and put that in the Wicker man and then burn that yourself for your your little releasing ceremony for sa but I do like the simmer pots though and that kind of goes back a little bit to Agatha all along I love these movies and and I love that Practical Magic is having a a Practical Magic 2 coming out and I can't wait for that and Lea how do we get ourselves on the list of which consult for Hollywood movies I don't know it sounds like it's either hit or miss you're either going to like curse the movie or or have a great time it sounds like it's one or the other I'm willing to around and
