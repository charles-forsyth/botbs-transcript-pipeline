welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and today we're diving into the enchanting and sometimes treacherous world of fairies the Fay the fair folk the she or as some like to call them those we don't with I'm scared I'm just saying I'm scared I'm shell and we're gonna talk about the Fay today I love the Fay but definitely this is this is a around and find out kind of thing what we're talking about is fairies some people see them as Elemental forces or animistic forces but fairies are mythical creatures that are anthropomorphic which means that they they look like people they usually have human form of some type either smaller larger more grotesque more beautiful but definitely human in nature and they appear all over the world in folklore most European countries French Germanic Celtic Slavic uh they've been Norse Traditions native American traditions they have been in history separated into different classifications like the cely and the uncy court which is in most like Irish Scottish and Welsh folklore a lot of this is going to be very local and very traditional to the area that they're in because again these animistic forces but in I guess it was like the 13th century according to Wikipedia a gentleman named Thomas of Canton Prix classified the fairies into water fairies earth fairies undar fairies and air fairies yep at least by this one guy right I think some people especially I know sometimes we give Tik Tok a hard time but I think online the Fay have kind of been blown up into even scarier than I think they are that I would agree with I think that there's been so much caution put out there that people are like being like overly the Fay are being overly villainized I think a little bit Yeah at first I mean you should have some caution and we'll get into why later in the episode but having a a little bit of caution when dealing with the Fay is wise especially considering their history but online the other day I think I saw a mom tell their child that they don't do the Tooth Fairy because in this house we don't with the Fay and I thought that was taking it a little far that's kind of Next Level I think I mean I don't with the Fay either but let me tell you the Tooth Fairy was presentent accounted for for both of my children's lives there you go I think as long as you learn the folklore and things around fairies it's okay to allow the Tooth Fairy into your house and you know you could say the same thing about you and I like you and I are like are like the Fay you know there's a limit there's a line in the sand and if you want to around around and find out let's do this but the Fay can be wonderful magical Partners I think is the best way to put it a magical partner same with hiate you this ain't no take take take take take there has to be a give and take or there are consequences bottom line yeah I think that's an excellent way to put it because what we're talking about here is mainly Elemental forces animistic forces you know and and that's something I wanted to point out real quick sometimes people think when people say working with the Fay that could mean a plethora of things and some people are thinking like Tinkerbell with wings but a lot of other for lack of a better word creatures fit under that Fay umbrella like trolls goblins nymphs Sprites I'm sure I'm forgetting others oh there's hundreds because they are found in almost every single culture they are if you scratch any folklore just a little bit you're going to find a fairy creature of some type like you just said there's the pukas which is like a an Irish or Celtic troublemaking Shape Shifter there's the red caps that are like evil bloodthirsty little Scottish fairies there's the russula in Slavic folklore there's the Via have a painting of her who's a Russian fairy in Japan they have a being called the yo-kai that's like a tree spirit in Native American culture some of them have these small tiny little people that are nature Spirits sometimes they're called the nahi France has of course tall beautiful fairies like meloine there's gnomes there's elves there's the shei there's banshees there's all sorts of different type of they're not just Little Tinker Bells with wings oh no no they come in every shape and size and most of them are kind of scary and I think that's a little bit where the we don't with the Fay idea has kind of come from because TV and everything kind of took fairies to this Tinkerbell like you said you know the the three fairies from um Cinderella yeah yeah there's the Fairy Godmother in Cinderella and there's the three fairies from Sleeping Beauty but there's also Rumple still skin people that's true they even took Maleficent who was one of my favorite evil fairies and turned her very good love those movies don't get me wrong I like the reimagining of Maleficent but I think we took these creatures that were in a lot of cases tricksters and things you shouldn't with and we turned them into Sugar Plum Fairies right and that don't with the Fay I think was this backlash of hello there's things like red caps they were disneyfied that's right they were disnei and now it's kind of swung back very hard the other way right but the Fay are great to work with honestly as long as you understand and the the give and take that you are undertaking I think when most witches and pagans talk about working with the Fay they're talking about one of two things I think they're either talking about the she or The Shining folk that a lot of people in Celtic and Welsh Traditions talk about they talk about the people under the hill the danu the tuad um so they they talk about these creatures and the other one is the genus lokai the creatures of place the animistic nature of a well or a Glenn or a tree or a wood you know personification like a house fairy the personification of that place so that's usually what they talk about but there like you said there are quite a few others oh know I see a lot of garden gnomes around town I think people are working with these gnomes gnomes are Earth Spirits gnomes are very much having to do with Earth and with place and with your house I mean not too long ago I lived in Rochester New York which is a hot bed of spiritual and psychic activity and the house that I lived in at first I thought it might be haunted and then after talking to some paranormal investigators I think maybe there was some sort of weird Fay activity let me back up shell have you ever set something down like your keys or your glasses or your wallet whatever and you know for a fact you set it right next to you those were right there and then they were gone and then 4 hours later guess what they're right there again even though I looked 8 ,000 times that's right and I kept having things like this happen I think we talked about it on one of our other podcasts where I made a purchase online and set the credit card down right next to me and within minutes I went to get it and it's gone gone and I couldn't find it the next morning I found it in the sink in between two dirty plates as I was doing dishes that's so weird and let's see my daughter also lost I think it was a piece of jewelry and she didn't find it until she pulled a storage bin out from under her bed and it was in the middle of some clothes under her bed so things are disappearing and showing up in weird places I don't know if the Fay wanted you to move or if they wanted to move with you maybe maybe but once we started paying a little bit more attention to the spirits of the place we made a little altar in a corner dedicated to the household Spirits this land had been owned by a man who worked it for Gardens and he had had fruit trees and he very much cared for the land and I think it was feeling neglected so when we created an altar to it started doing things in the yard dedicating it knew you were listening so it was pissed and it was trying to send you a message to tend to it and then once we did start tending to it the energy in the home got a lot better and the tricks stopped there is that type of Fay and that's something you don't want to piss off you don't want to make the trickster in your home that's making all your things disappear mad and you know it's funny you keep saying trickster because I used to always think of Loki we've all heard of Loki um I used to think of Loki as like a a offshoot of of a of the Fay because of that that trickster mindset that you get with Loki is similar to that trickster mindset of the Fay but it's like you know things could either go great or they could go Ary real quick another part that comes from that is again the she The Shining people the tuad they are much more longer lived than we are if you follow this belief system and they're much smarter than we are in a lot of cases and they love to play games now you have to be very careful with them because they do value making deals with people and fair exchanges but they don't do any of that casually and that's kind of what I was talking about in the beginning about there's a give and take like I'm talking about a materialistic give and take yes yeah a lot of times it is if they give you something and you say thank you they consider that that is now a binding agreement and you owe them something like you said give and take they gave the sock away that's it they gave them a sock and if you get it back and say oh thank you now you're in a binding agreement and you owe them something and if you don't pay up they get upset because they're very fair-minded it's like the Christian version of signing your soul to the devil yeah yeah it kind of is you got to pay attention to what you're agreeing to if you ever enter into an agreement with the Fay the good news is is most of them are your typical backyard Fay like we did we started taking better care of the overrun Gardens in the backyard right we set up a space in the home to honor the Fay if you do simple things like that clean up the creek near your house volunteer at the park to clean it up things like that honoring the land is a very easy way to appease that type of but because I'm paranoid I would take it to the next level as well and also leave out an offering of something either shiny or sweet um like a coin or whatever something shiny the F like shiny things they're kind of like me I like shiny things um or like a little thing of honey you know what I did one time and this was the cutest thing I took you know how acorns like the Caps will fall off I had lined up like four or five caps and put honey and filled the caps with honey and left those out as offerings Little Acorn Little Acorn bowls of honey for them I think those are so cute but but that's what I mean by give and take there has to be some like literal materialistic give and take and generally with the Fay more often than not you're doing all right if you do shiny or sweet that's always a good idea and also be careful when you ask them for something or if you make this offering and say I'm giving you these Acorn caps full of honey please make my garden Bountiful or make my beehives overflow with honey because be very careful what you wish for and be very specific in your wording exactly exactly because you know they might all of a sudden get your garden overrun with weeds or you know your bees will now swarm and there'll be too many bees and it'll cause problems so you do have to be kind of careful in how you word things these specific folks now Fay are very much Associated like I said with the genus lokai spirits of place with Lial spaces with magical spaces if you go to these Old Stone circles these are linal spaces between this world and the magical world and you will feel the presence of those local spirits and those Fay there sometimes you can walk into the woods and you just feel like you're being watched around every tree and every corner it just feels very much alive that's CU you are that's right yeah the Fay of that place the summertime is usually what I associate with the Fay absolutely yeah every time we would go to that ritual space in New York with our local community you could feel it particularly in the summertime when the fireflies are out you know it feels like a fay Lial space kind of time right right that was very much a that felt like failand yeah so these in between places are really where you can connect with them if you find a cool little waterfall odds are there's a local Fay there or there's energy there that you can tap into some sort of water Sprite or something yeah now you don't need to believe that these are actual human looking creatures that walk the earth that hide under Hills and in Moon beams you don't have to believe that the Banshee is a female form that will come out and scream from the rooftops when someone that you love is going to die you can believe that some people do some people believe that they are energies of place that are so old that they have almost a sensient feeling to them but however you believe in these creatures you can work with those energies my favorite way to do it is personal I very much love especially now that I'm living out in the Wilds of Pennsylvania getting to know the little pockets of my land and the different energies associated with that has been a lot of fun you know so far I'm just finding different places to meditate or maybe do card pulls or you know go berry picking and just kind of be with that place you know you don't have to do anything fancy you can just kind of connect with where you're at you have lots of spirits of your new place and I'm let me tell you they're not all Fay Yes actually okay tangent since you brought that up shell has been to my lovely new property and we have started constructing a ritual Circle in the woods in the back which is and we were being watched and we were being watched by lots of people that weren't technically there fun part with this land as I've mentioned before is it it is an old church so the house itself was the old church and it was rebuilt on the same land so there is a churchard a a graveyard not too far from where this circle is and uh shell and some other sensitive people in our group when we were out there for the first night felt some spirits in the area so we're not sure yet if it's you know people who have been here before or if the land itself is just very bike it f no no Leila is downplaying this what it felt like when we walked out to this part of her land have you ever walked into a party of like a hundred people and you weren't really invited and you walk into the party and everybody stops talking the Music Stops Stop the Music Stops and everybody just staring at you like what are you doing here that's the feeling that's what was happening we walked in on a spiritual party that we weren't invited to yeah it's definitely a very interesting piece of property I do love it here but we'll save the ghost or no ghost discussion on my property for another time but you can feel place is like this when you walk into these linal spaces into these old growth places or Wild Spaces you can feel the Fay there see know me I personally connect with them I feel like the most near water and in the woods that's just a me thing yes but I agree with that there are times you know you can go walking in the woods and it's you know you're just tooling along and then you'll hit a pocket of area where it just feels different and again you almost feel like you're being watched but not being watched by an actual human not being watched like you're being stalked by an animal not that kind of being watched but that the little people are watching you you know what I mean yeah the good folk are very common in outdoor spaces you can find them all over and even in water there's the Sprites there's mermaids are a type of Fay there's the selis which in is it wellsh tradition uh they look like seals but they come up on land and then they take their seal skin off and a woman and Legend says that if you steal that seal skin that she's stuck in human form and she'll stay with you are Sirens considered B I think so okay they're not all nice I mean these Sirens they lure Sailors to their death right well yeah any of them can turn on a dime even a troll yeah and I'm I know I'm not goingon to pronounce this correctly but I know there's a Swedish type of Fay it's called the nacken and they drown people like if you go out and you see one of these napkin I apologize we're famous for Mis pronunciations folks I tried to find Somebody pronouncing it and I couldn't so if anyone knows how to pronounce it please let me know but yeah they they drown you and some of them will make you keep dancing forever you know the Fay are associated with some very scary stories they're not all nice Grim's fairy tales if you read the original Grims fairy tales they are not the disneyi versions a lot of these are scary but again you know the appearance might be scary but that doesn't necessarily mean you can't work with them and again I I think it all comes down to that give and take I think it does too and I think it's a lot that it's not that they're mean it's that we don't understand them these energies are very very old you know it's the energies of the stones of the Trees of the very land itself they have a different wisdom level than us yeah and they have a different way of looking at things so I think that if you look at it through that lens then it's a little easier to deal with them and if you look at them like you keep saying give and take shell and that's so important you know if you look at this like a partnership you know I am in stewardship of this land with you right meditate with them what can I offer you what can I do to care for this space better because I think that's the most important thing to successful work with the Fay is is going into it with that mindset because if you if you kind of go into it you're going to do my bidding you're man you are before you start okay yeah these are ancient energies they are an extension of the earth herself you know it's very old powerful energy I'm just saying around and find out you with the Fay wants you never do it again you know you you piss off the Fay want you will work your lifetime to never piss the Fay off again I would say probably many lifetimes because they're not going to forget so what can you do if you want to connect with the Fay we did a ritual one time it was more of a like a journey to Avalon we wanted to go to the island of Avalon to talk to the fairies we called it a dream walk we did that was we did several dream walks it was almost like one a summer for a little while we would do a very elaborate intense ritual and this one involved a lot of preparation a lot of meditation the idea was we were going to journey to Avalon in this ritual slm meditation dream walk to get the knowledge of Avalon and because we were going through the Veil into this Lial space we went to this magical land and into a river to a very small small island in the center of this River where our coven cast Circle and then we each took our coven cords tied one end to the handle this was very important by the way very this was an important step by the way so in the middle of this as we're preparing to cross over this space we tied one end of our cord to our aam and one end to our ankle and then before we crossed into the circle we struck the aame into the ground each of these had some iron in them now iron is considered like tying us to the the correct World tying us to this realm as we crossed into the circle now I have chills just thinking about this ritual this was a very beautiful very powerful ritual it was absolutely amazing and while I wouldn't say that I necessarily got all the knowledge of Avalon it was still a very beautiful very moving and Powerful ritual but we did the iron thing and the cords because iron is considered like Kryptonite to elves and to the Fay to fairies and I think because it is so much a human thing you know cold iron is something we have created it's so much part of our world you know it's almost against everything that is a part of their world I looked and looked and looked while we were talking about doing this episode to see if I could find where that came from like where originally did the idea that the f are deathly allergic to iron come from and I couldn't find it there's find anything no there's a few theories out there and I think most of them are what we said shell that it's it's so human like we rip iron ore up out of the earth it's such an industrial thing and we turn it into tools and into machines so that we can you know farm and do things to the Earth to plow the Earth to go to war which is again against everything that is in the world yeah so I think it's just symbolically something that's that's like their Kryptonite so we did that to tether us here to tie us here so that was a beautiful because that's the other thing I don't want to say the Fay can kidnap you into their world but the Fay can kidnap you into their world and there's a lot of stories of that you know there's the changeling babies that they thought sometimes the Fay would come in and steal a healthy human baby and leave a weak or sickly Bay child in its place and while a lot of that was probably people back in the day trying to deal with birth defects or low birth weight or you know problems with their population rather than the Fay that theory is in many many cultures it's not just the Welsh and Celtic fairies that do this all sorts of fairies and all sorts of countries steal people away right right there's the idea that if you spend time in the fairy land that time runs differently Underhill than it does here I agree and that's why for that ritual we made sure to tether ourselves back into the real world so that we had quote unquote a path back home right and so we wouldn't get caught you know there's Rip Van Winkle or all these other people who went into the land of the Fay and danced you know spent the night and danced for hours and when they came back decades had passed right so you have to watch out because time runs differently and I think that kind of goes back to these are Earth energies these are energies of the world that are very very old soag that it runs a lot you know slower for them than it does for us right most rituals or spells that talk about working with the Fay or with genus locai talk about respect and approaching it with caution you know why wouldn't you want to approach Mother Earth or any of her energies with respect you know right so bring offerings like shell said sweets are good offerings anything that nourishes the land you know if you want to bring a little bit of moon water that you have collected or if you have compost or you know something that's good for the land another thing I've done with water Sprites is I've uh gotten old seashells and fill them with juice and put glitter in the juice oh that's pretty I would like that and there's all sorts of biodegradable Glitters out there that are super super pretty or edible Glitters things like that edible Glitters there you can get glitter in the baking aisle because it they have like glitter for baking cakes and decorating cakes so you can get that Glitter and put that in some juice in a seashell freaking looks cute and you know the water Sprites love it one of the things that I used to do with my kids I read in an old green egg magazine and it was called fairy chess and basically it's you take a stump or a a rock or just a a clear spot and you grab natural things from around you pine cones leaves dropped flowers little stones and you just kind of arrange them in a pretty way that's a really nice way to honor the fairies of the place you don't want to pick up stones that might house creatures under them or anything like that no stacked standing stones but if you take a few dropped sticks or acorns or leaves or anything like that and you arrange that into a nice little pattern that can be a nice way to honor the Fay of that area or to do a little spell create a little sitting space for them and I've seen some really beautiful mandala art done with natural found things you know don't take anything living unless you ask and only take a third of it if you do but you can find all sorts of dropped items to create little magical artwork of natural things to honor the Fay in that area I've actually seen people take um bird houses and they've modified the bird houses and turned it into like a little fairy house I think there's a cute damn idea to have a create a little fairy house in your yard you know build them a little house but I've seen some really cute ones done that were done out of bird houses things like that you can put little crystals or plants you know bird seed other little gifts for the Fay now there are some legends that say anything that you put out for the fairies should not be made by your hands the reason for that is because anything that you make holds your energy it links them to you basically so if you want to you know leave something for the Fay but you don't necessarily need it to be linked back to you or you don't want any bad repercussions to come back to you then make sure that it's something that's not made by you also kind of going along with that a little bit another caution that people have about the Fay is to not tell them your real name yes I've heard that because if you tell them your real name they have control over you you know if someone has your name they can magically in a lot of ways cast spells on you or control you in some way uh there are some magical Traditions that think that people with your name can have a lot of power over you right and your real name might not necessarily be your legal name it could be a name that you've chosen right some people think that everyone has a real name and you have to discover it throughout your life so you might not even know your true name but yeah so knowing your name is is something that the little people definitely will try to get from you in some cases so that they can have power over you don't do it people don't do it but connecting them is pretty easy you can do things like I've done which is basically to walk around in any place on my land that feels energetic or that feels like it has even if it's just pretty I'll just sit there and choose that spot and kind of meditate try to connect basically just kind of sit and do a grounding meditation connect literally do that whole Roots thing into the ground you know maybe lean against a tree or or try to touch these things as you're trying to mentally connect with that energy as well it's funny because this past week um you and I have talked about this I had my twoyear old grandson for a week whoa was that exhausting so you know I take him outside and we're playing outside and he's running around and we have this big huge tree in our sidey yard and he runs over to this tree and there's this little hole it almost looked carved it was actually kind of weird but there was this little hole in the bark and of course you know he's two and his eyes point right on this and he's trying to stick his finger in the hole and I'm like baby don't stick your finger in the hole that's somebody somebody's house and because I said it was somebody's house and he's two he pulls back and he goes hello oh how cute so then we're sitting there and I go and so then of course I go I go yes hello tree and then we sit there for five minutes hello tree hello tree but it was so cute because he tried to stick his finger in that hole and I'm like that's somebody's house baby and it probably was you know the tree Sprite slipped in that little hole and my grandson should not be sticking his in the front door right who knows what they're going to do those little knots and trees definitely look like fairy houses they do the other thing that gets me is the fairy rings of mushrooms I absolutely oh that's absolutely a definite yeah I love those and you know I I get mushrooms a little bit because I understand that underneath the ground is really where the mushroom kind of lives so them coming up in circles kind of makes a little bit of sense when those flowers pop up in circles for no apparent reasons I think those are fairy portal I'm pretty sure honestly whenever I see anything like that I do not put my feet I do not step foot in the middle of the circle it's like it's got to be a fairy portal damn it I insist oh I think so too I think those are great places to leave offerings if you're lucky enough to get one make sure your offerings are biodegradable you can leave coins but make sure they don't have iron or anything like that but better to leave something natural I like the acorn top full of Honey myself I thought that was the damn best invention I ever came up with so I think after all that after having gone through all of that you know there is a little bit of around and find out with the Fay but I don't think you really have to go so far as to never allow the Tooth Fairy into your home or or never honor the spirits of place if the Tooth Fairy is something that you do at your house you know if you're honoring that tradition in your household I don't think that's something that you have to worry about I don't think that's going to be inviting any tricksters into your home and as a magical prti practitioner you shouldn't be entering into work with something that you're afraid of right but I think if you do your research beforehand there's no reason to be afraid of Fay or of fairies there is reason to be cautious and to know what you're doing have your wits about you and certainly walk with intention with power and with purpose but other than that I think you're fine if you're looking to work with the Fay and you're kind of a big city dweller and you're like well I don't have a lot of outdoor space I have nowhere to go we get it totally if you have a little like window Garden or like little plants in your windows where they can kind of cross through that Veil and play you know create something like like a flower bed or a little like a garden thing hanging from your window you know what I'm talking about you can do that or um if you have a like house plants um I've had a couple of friends that have made like little fairy Alters within a house plant so if you don't have outdoor space that shouldn't deter you from working with the Fay you just got to maybe create something a tad natural within your space yeah and you can also check in with your apartment check in with your house even if it's in a city there still can be energies there you might have to look a little deeper than someone who can walk Barefoot in the grass but they can still be there and some of these energies are very very old and very power they just a little harder to find I think that in that environment yeah they might be harder to wake up but odds are you can connect with it you might just have to try a little bit harder you can use certain crystals and flowers to attract these types of energies to you isn't Jasmine one of them I think Jasmine is a fairy attractor violets honeysuckle daisies crystals like Moonstone Moss agot Opals amethysts I like to use the Moss agot because for some reason it makes Mak me think of like Ferns and Moss and Ferns and Moss make me think of fairies and it goes from there yeah yeah and my favorite Rosemary lavender mug wart these types of herbs can all help to bring them into your space if you want to call them or banish them I would say the first thing to do is to cleanse your space like literally clean your house and cleanse it with the intent of either honoring the spirits of that place you know calling them in or honoring them or telling them to get the out so either way the shut the door on them cleanse your space and then set up an altar to honor them if that's your intent or grab your Bome and your banishing herbs and at the end of cleansing your house sweep them away sweep them right out and then lock your windows lock your doors with your sigils you can use bird seed you could use rice you could use a broom I think we talked about this a little bit with Amy Blackthorne but mystical creatures often get distracted but if you put like a broom or something outside your door to protect from the Fay that will stop them because they have to count all the bristles before they can come in I've also heard that that's some of some of the lore behind uh folks having horseshoes up because the Horseshoe was made out of the metal that basically staved them off yeah they didn't want to cross that threshold because they didn't want to cross under that iron of a horseshoe I've also heard of some people taking like horseshoe nails or iron nails and and hammering three of them above your door that's a pretty powerful protection right there but something as simple as bird seed laid across your threshold or herbs um you don't have to use salt salt can be very damaging so if you're worried about that there's other options but basically it's tiny grains of something that you have imbued with intent and then the Fay will get trapped and have to count all those little tiny grains and then this by the time they've counted them the spell has worked and asked them to leave so those are ways you can call them in or ban them if you need to but it's a good idea if you are asking them to be in your space that you honor them regularly you know leave offerings on the altar or in that outdoor space that you have created offer them smoke offer them food offer them your not thanks but offer them you know hey this is appreciation freely given nothing that's going to make an obligation to you or to them but you know make it a little nice for them and offer them a few sweet and they'll be pretty happy and it'll stop them from stealing your credit cards yeah there's that there's so many different kinds of Fay and I know we haven't even barely scratched the surface of all the different types of Fay and folklore and legends on them that are out there but we will because we have a little surprise coming up pretty soon we're going to be doing a Solarium episode with a we're not going to tell you what kind of book book on the Fay
