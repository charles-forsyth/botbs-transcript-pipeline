you do love your salads that's true you like to mix up little bits of everything and get super potent weed that way nothing wrong with a surprise so all I can say is it's high THC and it's good and it's delicious fabulous my sweet husband has gotten us something to smoke for the weekend we got some gelato mints and La cake La cake la cake La cake La cake are you even too high to say that yes and the bud tender recommended the LA cake and said that it was a hybrid of LA Confidential and wedding cake both of which I love and to be honest I wish I had just gotten more of the gelato mints I gotta say whatever this mixture is that I've concocted it's I mean I don't want to say a downer it's not a downer but like I could just like lay down maybe cozy up get some snooze I don't know if I would melt into the couch but this is Sleepy weed oh you've definitely got like the Sleepy thing going on yeah this is this is not high energy weed this is definitely sleepy weed still good still high one of the things we've talked about before on this podcast are tpin the different types of tpin that are in weed and we've mentioned that we both really like the lemon flavor weeds that citrusy lemony yeah yeah and that tpine is lemon and that one gives you kind of like an up Buzzy High typically so if you have a lemon smelling weed usually has high lemonade tarpine content but it sounds like you probably have something that has more of one of the Tarpin called terpinolene terpinolene is a very sleepy sleepy tpine this is the one that you want to get one of those fleece blankies in your pillow and just be like oh I could lay there it's not as common as some of the other ones like the the easy to smell lemon but that makes you very very sleepy you know it is Sleepy weed but it's also a little bit munchy before you go snoozy weed so I got some French bread pizza cooking that I'm eat because yes it makes you sleepy but it I feel like this gives you a little bit more of the munchies

maybe a blankie or two grab a teddy bear curl up under a nightlight I feel like I'm gonna need my Pentacle for this one geez right so how about you where are you taking us this evening um actually Vermont I have been looking into Vermont no there's no hauntings in Vermont Vermont is just fun and maple syrup and apple cider and skiing right there's there's no ghosts in Vermont no Spirits apparitions you know maybe at like one of those old water wheels or something I imagine those could be haunted in Vermont but other than that and then you know if you really want to get me going don't even get me started on the Sasquatch sightings in Vermont but we're sticking to the ghosts tonight really there's a lot of uh Bigfoot in Vermont huh um yeah actually there is remember the top of Vermont borders Canada good point very good point I guess so and that's probably all that lives in Canada pretty much yeah all I saw were hockey players Sasquatches yeah hockey players and Sasquatch and they all put up uh Pennsylvania Dutch signs apparently so for our listeners in Canada what team are you on are you team hexine team Sasquatch or team hockey but yeah so I am going to talk about the New England paranormal investigators going on this ghosty trip to to Vermont so that's what we're doing all right well that sounds pretty cool so did you do anything for the full moon shell I know we just had the full moon recently on the 6th I went outside and did a little howling at the moon and put some candles out there you know there was something about this Moon let me tell you it was creepy creepy creepy really what was so creepy about it okay so the full moon was what Friday night Friday at 6:08 much to my despair I had to wake up on Saturday morning my day off and take my sweet darling to work I'm usually not a fan of that and I had to I would just say we left the house around 6:30 a.m. whoa not got up at 6:30 a.m. but actually left the house at 6:30 a.m. that is like the ass crack of dawn I'm pretty sure it's illegal to leave your house that early in in the morning oh my good giddy Aunt now we heard about you leaving for work at 4:30 in the morning and I we have several of our listeners crying about Michelle's mishap lots of sympathy and lots of Tears there is a contingent that says it's her own fault she should have gotten up and smoked that weed at 4:20 a.m. so you out of the house at some ungodly time of the morning but that's also about the time that the sun was Rising oh that's kind of nice you only catch a sunrise under duress this is not the time when I've even said that I even said that I shouldn't be awake at this time of day so I drive about 20 minutes away and drop them off and I'm headed back so it's like starting to get kind of light but it's still like a smid and dark and that moon was like this weird pink and just like glowing like it was the damn Sun but it was like this silvery weird kind of daylight like it was weird and Eerie I love when the moon is like that and you go outside and everything seems almost as bright as day because that full moon is so so bright I love that it's so magical I just I can go outside and just take a couple deep breaths and just feel so connected and so soothed I guess it's just a nice moment I put my tarot cards and some stones out there and have been doing some journaling and I was doing that on the full moon as well oh I love that journaling is such a magical practice I'm trying to do that also this year have a very scrap bookie Journal I'm I'm pretty good at having like the jot journals where I like jot notes down and lists I things I want to do or plans for the future and just little things like that it really helps me keep my ADHD a little bit more organized than normal but this year I'm trying to do a little bit more of an INT inal Journal an intentional magical journal and actually have it be a little bit more scrapbook and cool just for you know something to do we'll have to talk about that more at a later date we will we also need to talk about your spell jars because I have a fabulous recycling idea that I'm starting to do and I think this is going to be a lot of fun so I have these jars you know how I like to complain about packaging right right right well there in my travels I have been to a couple uh particularly in New York they like to package their eights in these small glass jars either with like a wooden cork type lid or with a screw on plastic lid and they're not that big I mean they're bigger than your typical spell jars but they're not too big and I have a ton of them some places will take them back to recycle but otherwise you have to take them to like a landfill and recycle them so here's what I'm thinking I want to make weed which spell jars out of these former weed jars you know put some crystals and spell parchment in there some different things like that and I just think they're kind of a nice size for a hefty spell I don't know something big something interesting something pretty I think they're kind of cool can put some stones in there some parchment in there yeah some herbs like you know those those super super mini tarrow tarot card in there yep you know do a spell with a candle and put the burned wax in there for the spell there's all sorts of things that we can do since it's a little bit larg ger and so I think that might be a great way to recycle these 1/8 glass jars I like them a lot better than the ones that are wrapped in plastic and cardboard and all that crap but I still wasn't sure what to do with them and I had this great idea the other day kind of modeled after your smaller spell jars these are just a little bigger and I think they would look really cool so I'll let you know how it works out I think you should give it a go because I am all for the spell jar idea I love it so much fun you can also um well depending on who your friends and family are give uh spell jars as gifts I love that idea well we are getting to the time of the year of where we're where you're going to be planting seeds planting the seeds to sew so we're getting to that time of year where you might want different spell jars based on what seeds you want to sew kind of thought process and I can see along with my very intentional scrap bookie Journal I can also see doing one spell jar on under every full moon for a whole year and then I would have one jar for each astrological correspondence for each of the 13 moons of the year and I think that would be really cool to have those I can look back and magically see what I did each month kind of thing but you know it would be very pretty to have on an altar you know what also would be just as beautiful not to sound all Grim but then ritually quote unquote ritually sacrificing all 12 of them at sin you know especially the ones that are glass and wood if I did all of them in glass and wood that's something that could be you know take all um all of them that I have made up into that point and and sacrifice them in the bonfire at sa and that's a fabulous idea right right you know depending on the type of magic that's done some might need to be kept some should be buried and maybe some should be put into the bonfire I can see different situations where that type of thing would be really useful I love that idea just just another thought on how to put your intentions out there but we're going to get a little more witchy on our next podcast about full moons new moons talking about new witchy possibilities things coming up for these stoned witches so you'll have to stay tuned and see if we have any super magical announcements coming up in the near future but as always make sure to like subscribe put up a review for

gelato you know I love me a good gelato and you do and you find them up I do they've been really popular lately and [ __ ] am I happy about that because I really do I I haven't okay that's not true I have been burned a little bit on a gelato but most of the time if I get a gelato anything it's really really good you just have really good luck with weed is the problem you really do I do better luck than anyone let me tell you the weed I've been smoking has made this French bread pizza the most delicious thing I've eaten ever all right well you're over there really high and munching out on your French bad Pizza I'm going to tell you a story oo okay what you got I'm intrigued so what was the year again remind me the year you said well we're going to start in 1847 and we're going to pretty much stay in the mid 1800s okay and we're going to go to Illinois a little town called Watsa Illinois and this is called the Watsa wonder which is the name of the book that the doctor who witnessed this whole event he dubbed the whole series of events the Watsa Wonder so I'll leave you to see if if it actually is wondrous or not or just kind of [ __ ] scary really really scary okay okay so in Watsa Illinois was a small family and in 1847 they had a baby girl named Mary unfortunately Mary as a baby started to have um what they called a cataleptic fit and she continued to have these fits as she Grew Older what is that it's like an epileptic fit B some type of fit where I I don't know if that's exactly what it is but the way it was described is she would basically convulse and her eyes would kind of roll back in her head okay and she wouldn't exactly be there but she would have these fits and then when she got a little bit older sometimes she would speak during these fits and she would speak of people that had been deceased and she would seem to know details of them oh she would say that during these fits that she would be able to talk to angels and that she had gone to heaven and she could speak to people people that were in heaven oh she even now I'm not sure how this came about but she was known to be able to read books while blindfolded and she exhibited quite a few Clairvoyant and spiritualist type Tendencies again she she would have these transes and she would speak as if she was someone else and know details of their life that she could not have known so they were able to cooporate what she was saying yes oh wow however these fits and transes would get worse and worse some of them to the point where she was having hours long shaking fits where took five grown men to be able to hold her down and prevent her from hurting herself oh wow she started to hear voices and she began speaking in in other languages that she had no way of knowing the parents took their daughter to many many doctors trying to find a cure for her because again although she would have these spiritualist transes and be able to speak to what she called angels and people from the other side sometimes most of the time they were just these violent fits that they were very afraid were going to kill their daughter so they took her to quite a few different doctors and one bright doctor prescribed what was called at the time a water cure and she was sent away for this water treatment for about 18 months have you ever heard of this shell no that sounds kind of creepy it is kind of creepy and it's one of the reasons why I [ __ ] [ __ ] hate asylums at this time because they did all sorts of terrible terrible things to people and one of them was this water cure basically someone decided that in my mind I'm picturing water boarding yeah it pretty much was different forms of that they decided that cold water in particular could shock a person out of being crazy or having some type of mental disorder so they would regularly do things like make people submerge themselves in ice baths some of them where they were completely enclosed up to their neck in very very cold water and then like you said water torture they'd have water drained down on their head cold cold water and then they'd be taken out of these baths wrapped in wet sheets and towels basically like mummified and then made to lay in a bed for hours in cold wet sheets ah they would do other things where they would put people in what looks like a fancy you ever see those showers nowadays that are like the rainfall showers that have like spig on the sides and the top I love those yeah I love those too but I've seen the ones they use in asylums and those [ __ ] are spooky and they would put those Jets on really really high and then they would have someone it almost looks like someone from a fun house they'd put this person naked in a box and have ice cold Jets of water spray on them from every direction and then a nurse or a doctor outside would have what looks like a water cannon that they then spray at the person and they would make people just stand there and suffer this for hours oh wow that's horrible this poor kid Mary at about the age of 13 went to Peoria for 18 months of water treatment when she came back her fits not only hadn't gotten any better they were much much worse and she had very angry violent fits and the parents eventually agreed to put her into an asylum that's shitty uh she died there a few months later at the age of 19 and that's the thing you know back then in that particular time period And it the same with asylums like some of the torture that they did all in the name of quote unquote mental health yeah I mean I it it's it's not it's not it really is and it's it's frightening she passed away in this asylum in 1865 again she was about 18 or 19 her father ASA Roth became um very interested in spiritualism at the time well remember that's about the time where spiritualism was starting to ramp up in America and was was becoming popular exactly about 10 years later he had convinced himself that his daughter Mary had not been crazy but had in fact been a very gifted and misunderstood Spirit medium whoops right and so he had immense guilt over following the doctor's orders at the time as he should they prescribed horrible things should have now Mary Roth's story is not over in 1877 another young Illinois another young woman in this town in Illinois named lorency Venom very young teenager about 13 also began to have seizures very similar to the type of fits that Mary rth had had these seizures would cause lorency to lose Consciousness for hours or days at a time in these transes she much like Mary rth could communicate with the spirit world her parents also were trying to find a cure and sent her to multiple doctors and they said well you know send her to an asylum thankfully they didn't suggest a water cure of any kind but they definitely said send her to an asylum yeah [ __ ] thankfully for lorency they also lived in Watsa and ASA was familiar with what was going on with luren C Venom so before they could send y away ASA decided to visit them along with a doctor e Winchester Stevens also called ew Stevens uh they visited the Venom house and told them that asa's daughter too had had similar types of problems and that they wanted to see if they could help loreny in any way so they visited with this family and they met with loreny the next day and she was in a Trans State at that moment and was saying that she could see dead people and she was able to speak with the spirits around her she also would often tell her parents that she could speak to a brother and sister that had passed away before she had been born and one of the reasons that her parents you know allowed ASA to come in was because they knew that their daughter had had information about her brother and sister that had passed away that she should not have known the siblings in spirit told leny things that had happened to them when they were alive that had happened before loreny was even born so they they were kind of ready to talk to ASA about this whole spiritualist thing Asa and ew Stevens U went to the Venom family and when they walked in they saw that loreny was kind of sitting hunched over and and her whole demeanor looked as if she was a very very old woman and so they asked her who she was and what her name was and she said I'm Katrina Hogan and even her voice sounded old and raspy oh they asked her to tell them about her and she said that she was a 63-year-old woman from Germany then abruptly Loren's whole demeanor changed and she kind of sat back she was you know sitting up she was looking much more confident and they asked her who she was and she said her name was Willie canning and that he was a young 20-some man and he immediately changed tactics and started asking them questions like who they were did they like to drink did they like to smoke what was their favorite drink she spoke as Willie canning for about an hour and a half and then fell back into a trance that's so weird over the course of several meetings with lurcy they were able to ascertain that she was able to speak to quite a few different personalities and different Spirits from the other side most of them seem to be very angry and very mean spirits and so Dr Stevens and ASA Roth told lorency that maybe she could communicate with a nice spirit it might help her you know instead of being so angry and violent because of these evil people that were inhabiting her maybe she could find a spirit that was nicer it's not like she could pick actually they asked her about that and she said there were quite a few Spirits she could see a lot of spirits around her that were all waiting their turn to talk she said there were a great many of them around her and she said that there was one woman who looked like an angel that wanted to come forward and so they suggested that she should allow this nicer Spirit to come forward and possess her instead when she did a calm demeanor came over loreny and they asked her her name and she said her name was Mary Roth oh now loreny was one year old when Mary Roth passed away their families didn't know each other and they lived in different parts of town there was no way that laurency could have known anything about ASA or his daughter Mary prior to those days of coming over so on February 1st 1878 Mary rth took possession of Loren's body and stayed in possession of her body for about 16 weeks oh wow when she sat up and said that her name was Mary rth she immediately recognized ASA and called him PA she did not recognize laurency Venom's parents she didn't know who they were that doesn't necessarily mean much you think loreny prior to being taken over by Mary Lauren C had been extremely violent uh she had been angry and constantly changing names and personalities she immediately became calm and sweet and polite and did say her name was Mary and that she wanted to go home with Asa word of this spread immediately that this girl was saying she was Mary rof and recognized ASA and some people came over woman named manura alter Mary rth had a sister when she passed away that was named manura so she heard that this girl was claiming to be her long dead Sister Mary so she came over with her mother an to see Mary and as soon as they walked in the door Mary said there's my ma and my sister nervy now nervy was Mary's Pet name for minurva and no one had called her that since Mary had died a little over 13 years before Oh So after that Mary kept begging to go home and they finally said okay the Venoms were like fine you don't seem to know who we are why don't you go to Ace's house and let's see where this goes so she hugged her mother and father and her sister and called them Ma and Pa and she said the Angels said I can stay until sometime in May they took her home and she recognized friends and family she recognized Mary's old things they had put one of Mary's um I guess a a hat with like a long Veil on it and she said oh that's my old hat I used to wear that when my hair was short and oh wow that's kind of creepy yeah she knew all these things she recognized all this stuff that had been hers when she was Mary Roth one woman came over to visit you know to to check out this astounding thing that had happened and Mary called her by name she said oh Mrs Lord you look just the same as you did when I was here before and the woman said oh honey my husband died I was Mrs Lord but my name is Mrs wager now I've remarried her husband had been alive when Mary rth had passed away he hadn't passed away and and she hadn't remarried until years after Mary Roth had died so Mary knew her as Mrs Lord even though she had been Mrs Wagoner for many many years and that's how loreny would have known her if she had ever known her so they tested by asking her questions about her life and she would tell them stories of things that had happened when she had been Mary rth and they were all corroborated by the family she even remembered people's names like she remembered the reader family and the girls that they would play with she remembered going to Texas in 1857 and seeing the Native Americans there there were some weird things that happened as well I mean weirder than her recognizing stuff and people she didn't eat for the first month after being Mary Roth they would try to get her to a whole month she reportedly did not eat at all for a whole month and when asked about it she would say that she was being sustained by the angels that she didn't need to eat that her nourishment was coming from heaven and that she wouldn't need anything on the physical plane okay I don't want to say that's weird or anything because that is weird and I'm not going to say that but it is but scientifically [ __ ] you can't go there long without food you'll die you'll die I don't know I haven't been one of those like I can't go 10 minutes without food you know we were talking about the pizza I've already transitioned to M&M's that's right that's my snacking gal she had like Heavenly nourishment apparently for 30 days and then gradually started eating with the family almost as if like that energy whatever energy had sent her into leny's body yeah but then it faded and she slowly started eating with us common folk exactly exactly so there are letters and things that were written at this time from Dr Stevens and from ASA Roth and from other people corroborating what had happened and talking about that some people in the town were concerned that she was the devil or that some type of demon was there but Mary quote unquote laurency as Mary seemed perfectly happy and healthy was a very calm and and polite young woman and she recognized seemingly everything including a box of letters and notes and trinkets that Mary rth had put together when she was alive did she ever use a Ouija board I'm just wondering because they were kind of popular back then the spirit boards not that I'm aware of no spirit board was ever done here but she did still during this time as Mary rth occasionally go into a mild trance and say that she was speaking to Spirits one time during one of these transes she started speaking in a very deep male voice and said that she was a man who had lived in Tennessee and had died died there years before he said that Mary was going to stay in control of Loren's body until loreny was healthy again oh like the spirit was going to heal her himself or itself that maybe Mary was kind of taking control of Loren's mind and body while Lauren's Spirit was somewhere else healing itself maybe of the the psychological problems that she had been having I'm not sure H but she didn't have any further epilep fits just occasional transes and at one time as it got closer to may I believe it was the end of March uh there was a time when she was being extremely affectionate to her mother and father like overly affectionate hugging them and kissing them wanting to sit on their laps to the point where their parents were like this is enough you know we we've had enough affection today what's going on they said she looked very very sad and she looked at them with tears in her eyes and she's like I want to hug you and kiss you while I have physical lips to do so because pretty soon I'm going to go to heaven and then I won't be here to hug you like I can now and so I want to do it as much as I can because soon when I come visit you you won't be able to see me anymore that's so weird yeah so she kept trying to tell them all how much she loved them then on May 7th Anne rth went to laurency Venom's mother and said that laurency was coming back and that the personality had started to change in the child and and that Lauren was coming back later that day on May 7th Anne Roth went to Lauren's mother with loreny and said that loreny was coming back and in that moment a change came over the child and she started crying and she asked where she was and said that she wanted to go home and she recognized Mrs Venom and knew her as her mother she didn't recognize Ann rth and she said she she said she wanted to go home so for about five minutes she was saying she wanted to go home with Mrs Venom and then a change came over her again and she was back to being Mary rth she stayed that way for another couple weeks until May 21st 1878 now there's a letter from ASA rth that he sent to Dr Stevens and it says quote Mary is to leave the body of rancy which is what they called loreny of loreny today at about 11:00 so she says she is bidding neighbors and Friends goodbye and she tells me to write you as follows tell him I am going to heaven and rany is coming home well she says she will see your dear children in spirit life and she talked most lovingly about the separation about to take place and most beautiful was her talk about heaven and her home and so on May 21st at 11:00 in the morning loreny came back too came back into her body looked at ASA and didn't recognize him and asked to be taken back home and just switched like that just like that and she lived a normal life from that point on she went home and they said she was completely well now how old was she how old at that point 13 13 or 14 and she never transed back or well that's not exactly true she never had any epileptic fits she never had any more cataleptic fits she never had any anger outbursts or any of that that she had been having quite a bit before she was a perfectly quote unquote normal person a few years after she reach returned home she married a gentleman named George binning in 1882 and a couple years later the family moved to Kansas her husband says that she would occasionally slip into being Mary rth Mary Roth's Spirit would come into loreny and he didn't like it when that would happen and he asked so she kind of want SM like fa in and out like like almost like she had like split personality right but not often just occasionally most notably it happened when she had her first baby when loreny had and uh George Benning had their first baby Mary Roth came as soon as the labor pain started and Mary rth was the one that was there when she had the baby and as soon as the baby was born loreny came back was that more of a disassociation of pain it very well could have been uh loreny liked to say that Mary would come and help her when she needed it Mary would occasionally like with the child birth take over Loren's body but didn't like it and asked her to stop and so she did eventually it stopped and loreny lived a perfectly normal life and had 11 children with George binning holy [ __ ] 11 kids 11 kid stop yourself stop yourself so all these details including the letters and reports from the Venom family and from friends and neighbors who had seen Lauren cmary Roth recognized people and objects uh all of this was documented in a book called The Watsa wonder and uh there were quite a few reports I guess there was a well-known um psychic researcher that looked into it a couple of them have looked into it and reported that it was um credible so that is the first known Spirit possession in the United States wow creepy right that definitely predates The Exorcist So the houses do still stand the Venom house and the rth house and there's a a gentleman I don't know if he still owns it but a gentleman named John Whitman did own the rough house and he fixed it all up and you can go stay there and they do ghost hunting tours and things like that in the rth house so just to kind of clarify there was never any sort of like exorcism or anything that happened it just faded away and stopped and it just faded away and sto yeah like that one one Spirit came she announced in the beginning the Spirit came and announced that Mary would only be there for a short period of time and then that other spirit that man the Tennessee man came and said that loreny was just being taken care of and and being made healthy and Mary was only going to take the body until loreny was healthy and and then she just she just faded away yeah but are you really gonna like really sit there and go okay so I just was told that the ghost is only going to haunt you for like three and a half weeks and then you'll be fine so we're just going to sit here and deal with it for three and a half weeks and it'll be good like that was okay I guess so I guess so so some people have done ghost hunting tours and things in the house including you mentioned a Ouija board earlier yes according to the owner of the home some people did rent it and took a Ouija board down in the basement complete with they made a protective Circle downstairs put candles in each of the quarters and the Ouija board in the center and I guess they still ended up leaving in the middle of the night and one of them had a pretty bad scratch straight down his back oh [ __ ] so I'm not exactly sure who they popped into because all these Spirits didn't really seem to be in the house itself they seem to be with Mary and with loreny themselves like they seemed to be mediums I don't necessarily know if it was the house but apparently there's still some ghostly activity there wow I kind of have like a a burning question here oh do ask do ask how come no one has gone there and tried to summon these spirits and ask why ask what's up I can't say that they haven't I just you know I'm sure somebody has it looks like haven't found documentation of it right if they've done it they haven't talked about it on YouTube yet because this sounds like totally a [ __ ] around a find out moment right I mean thankfully for these people at least it it sounds like ASA you know after after Mary died it sounds like he really felt bad dad for what he had put her through you know he felt terrible for the you know the putting her in the water treatment and the Asylum and he should have felt bad you know and it seems like lorency was kind of just allowed to to just you know just be just kind of get her freak on I guess I mean how often would you she just like oh yeah I'm Mary rth and they're like okay come home with us and then she went and lived with them for months as their daughter and nobody seemed to think it was weird at all but that gave loreny time to heal which their daughter didn't get but you hear especially during the spiritual movement scams true do you think at any point this was a scam well in a scam you have to have some type of payoff right a home in a family to take you in and take care of you but she already had a home in family a very loving home and family I mean they were going to put her in an asylum only because that's what doctors said was best for her know they wanted to help her but still they're still ready to sign her ass over and maybe maybe I'm just wondering well there's also if it was a scam to avoid institutionalization maybe but it sounds like with Asa and uh Dr Steven's intervention even if she hadn't become Mary rth it sounds like they had already convinced the Venoms not to institutionalize her and instead let Dr Stevens talk to her and use hypnosis and try to treat her well as someone who has studied and been certified in hypnotherapy I was a little skeptical once I heard that Dr Stevens had hypnotized loreny Venom at one point prior to her thinking that she was Mary rth under a hypnotic State people can be very very suggestible but where did she get all this information how did she know the nicknames that she had no way of knowing she was predicting a lot of stuff that you wouldn't have known and you she could have been fed all that no way right yeah unless like every single person that she met up with also lied to keep this story going it it's just she knew that's not even possible I mean it's possible obviously but it's not possible right yeah so kind of interesting inging yeah there's my spooky story out of Illinois of all places Watsa interesting I uh I'm gonna take us up to the Green Mountain Inn in Stow Vermont which I would imagine Stow Vermont's probably [ __ ] and cold right now oh my gosh yeah hopefully they at least have snow don't they ski a lot or snowboard and Ski and Stow they do they do that uh too cold for me same there's this cute little quain in the Green Mountain in now I kind of find it funny because this is supposed to be the most haunted in in Vermont oh the most haunted really the most haunted you don't say I'm saying so the Green Mountain Inn is um roughly about 170 187 year old Inn um it has been visited by US presidents they traded it for a farm it was home to a railroad company's offices it was the site of of a grand dance hall it's had a a lot of lives apparently it did it was also the regular um home for the LOL thas broadcasts um so it's been a lot of things the main in and the old Depot buildings are really kind of the main original buildings because as you can imagine since the original property was built in like 1833 there's been additions um but the the main part of the Inn in the Old Depot building are part of the original 1833 structures so this this property talk about giving away stuff so this guy Peter Lovejoy originally is the guy who built this property he traded it to another guy for like a 350 Acre Farm he's like hey I like your farm do you want my house and he's like hey I like your house do you want my farm pretty much but it had I want to say when I was looking I believe it had 100 20 rooms in the end probably its hey day would have been right around the turn of the century and it had right around that time about a 120 folks could stay there but it is what you would think of as like this old Northern New England snowy wooded Inn type of thing okay that sounds like it would probably be very pretty actually I've seen pictures of it like in the winter and this with snow all around it and it actually is pretty really really really pretty but so in the early 1800s you know as you can imagine that time of that location it's very snowy and stuff so at the in they had a chambermaid and a Horseman who in around 1840 were doing some stuff it sounds like the plotline to some sort of really sexy historical romance novel they were doing some stuff and a boy named boots Berry was born out of that stuff boots Berry that sounds like a Stover Vermont kind of name were they even hippies back then in Stover Vermont I don't know if they were hippies in 1840 they're pretty crunchy with the name like boots but you never know back then like was that the name on his birth certificate or is that just what people called him who knows I don't know so he's the son of like I said the son of the in chambermaid and a Horseman now boots was born in room 302 which was on the third floor in the servants quarters okay so that was the servants quarters at that time right so he actually grew up in the Green Mountain Inn with his mother okay basically was born and raised in the Inn he became a Horseman himself just like his father so he was kind of a a story character a couple of times he rose to fame locally as famous as you can be in the mid late 1800s he saved Stage Coach passengers um when the horses bolted down the street and were kind of out of control he was even awarded a medal over it he was um lauded through the county and basically he never had to buy drinks again right he's a local hero everyone's like hey boots I'll buy you a drink good job yeah and that's basically what it was you know he gets a metal well he didn't give a [ __ ] about the metal but what came with that was like unlimited free drinks for Life yeah FK hero status at the local bar drinks of course proved to be his downfall oh no damn it boots he was fired from the Inn for neglecting his duties well you get drunk every day all you got to do is take care of the horses man and drink that's it that's all you had to do wanders across the country ends up in a New Orleans jail oh [ __ ] how the hell did he end up in a new New Orleans jail I don't know but it couldn't have been a fun place no won too many visits to the House of the Rising Sun I guess it was a fun time because while he was in that New Orleans jail another prisoner taught him how to tap dance wait what did you just say he was taught how to tap dance while in a New Orleans prison by a fellow prisoner okay all right that sounds very New Orleans to me that that that tracks okay okay so he eventually gets out of jail and decides to go back to Stover Vermont quite the change from New Orleans I know let me go back but now he knows how to tap dance so there's that there is that that proves to be important here in a minute with a name like boots you'd think you would have been born knowing how I know so now fast forward it's 1902 so he's back in Stow and of course it's snowing CU what the [ __ ] else happens in Stover Vermont pretty sure it snows year round in Stover Vermont and there's this little girl stranded on the in's roof how the [ __ ] did she get on the in's roof hold on I have questions where are her parents that's the thing what do you just like send the girl up there that and and the thing is is I didn't find the answers so that but I guess because okay so boots lived there so he remember remembered that there was a secret childhood route to the rooftop okay well if anyone would know it would be boots she was probably just [ __ ] around I hope probably looking for a place to go sledding yeah right so he takes this secret route gets up to the roof reaches the girl and lo and behold lower a shirt of safety yay boots hero yet again hero yet again but slips and falls to his death no oh boots boots damn when he slips and falls to his death he falls right above room 302 the room where he was born the room where he was born oh tragic end for Boots the tap dancing guess who tap dances across the roof every night really that's kind of rude especially during snowstorms okay well you know wow wow so he saved the little girl and fell to his death right and now he entertains guests by tap dancing across the roof during snowstorms so there's this paranormal investigating group that goes there because again let's go back to most famous haunted in in Vermont the most famous in Vermont you know those um oh [ __ ] now I can't think of what they're called the heat sensing cameras yeah heat sensing cameras Oh I thought they had a name I don't know I don't think they do thermal imaging thermal imaging cameras they're there with their thermal imaging cameras and they have um their EVP stuff and all their Jazz for ghost hunting and they start hearing the tap dancing on the roof I guess it's pretty distinctive there isn't a soul that's been there that hasn't heard it can't be disputed it's there get over it they take their thermal camera and point it up and you can almost see almost what looks like the outline of freaking Footprints no you're [ __ ] me like you can see the warmth from his feet as he dances across the roof in the thermal imaging camera they also had a guy outside they also had a guy outside out out like facing where you could see the roof of the m at the same time they're doing the camera you can see the people in the window doing it and you can see that there's nothing on the roof above them no [ __ ] way that's awes when you look at the but when you look at the footage it's almost like you can see these little outlines that look like feet no [ __ ] so it's like you can see his freaking feet glowing up on there wow damn so it could be the most haunted in INF Vermont potentially maybe basically the most you hear him is in that room sometimes you can hear him like screaming as he falls past the window oh I'd rather hear the tap dancing thank you and other times they just see him wandering the grounds because remember he was born and raised there wow so of course he'd stay there even after death not only does it have the land imprint but he died there spent his whole life there all he ever knew was that that's where his mother was that's where his mother was buried like if he isn't imprinted in there nothing else would be you know he was probably up there saving this girl being like all right I'm back in the town's good graces I'm going to get all these drinks again I'm going to be living the high life and then he saves the girl and slips and falls his Doom that sucks yep he did save the girl though right found tap dancing he's decided he did save the girl but after his new found learning of tap dancing in his New Orleans prison he is now going to spend eternity tap dancing his way across the roof hey you know when you can do something well you might as well damn that sucks for him though but I think the I think the killer to the story is the thermal imaging of the footprints that's wild I can't believe that they could see him tap dancing across Ross the roof how fun I want to see that like I want to see that [ __ ] I want to do a Ouija board in that room well isn't it just weird that he was born in that room and plunged to his death right outside of it it is it's almost like you know it's a very full circle kind of thing it's interesting he Wasau yeah he was conceived born now he's dead there so he that poor guy had no chance he was gonna be stuck there right right so This Guy's in it for the long haul he is there until the end of time and all of eternity so I think we should go up there sometime I want a therm camera I want to see his Footprints I do too that would be wow so that's my story from chilly snowy stove Vermont yeah Green in I guess they have a uh pretty pretty loud ghost there huh well if they're gon to call it the most haunted inn in Vermont at least I got the thermal imaging to back it up you know there's at least that it doesn't have a very high bar for the most haunt I guess not but you know state to state what can you say right well remember Vermont is where I did that story I don't remember what episode it was but I did that story on Emily's Bridge the haunted Bridges um that was also in Vermont true there are some Spooktacular places in Vermont but like I said I was kind of captivated by the thermal imaging I think that's pretty fascinating you know I really love all these different tools that Ghost Hunters use I know we've talked about it in a couple different episodes and I'm trying to gather together some tools of my own so that when we go do ghost hunting we for sure need to have a thermal imaging camera of some sort because you know I'm actually wondering if there's an app you can download I feel like there's an app for everything I wonder if there's a thermal imaging app I'll have well I know that they have some Spirit Box apps and things like that but right I just don't know if it feels authentic to me it just feels those feel gimmicky to me so if anyone out there has used an app for ghost hunting and had success with it please let me know because a lot of this stuff is a little expensive but I really want to try a few I'd like to have at least a few things if you know when we get to do our little hippie van ghosty tour of the United States shall we need to have a few of these tools in our tool belt so let us know about your tools listeners email us the stone witches gmail.com now I know shell you have had a spooky experience that you've talked about on this podcast before with a thermal imaging camera that caught a ghost have there been any other tools that you have used in the past that have really freaked you out um I actually borrowed one time um one of those EVP things you don't realize that this this electromagnetic energy is there until you got this thing screaming in your hand it kind of put a little bit of the reality into it yeah two of the ones that I really like myself is I love dows in rods both for I have used dowsing rods in the past to find buried electrical lines buried sewer lines and also water but they're also really good to use to find spirit energy in different places and so walking around with different types of dowsing rods it's one of the freakiest feelings when those dowsing rods move and they just move on their own it's very very strange feeling and the other one I like is super simple and I think I've mentioned it before is the flashlights like you take those shitty flashlights that you put the two big D batteries in and you and you unscrew it till it's just barely on and then you just set it on something and walk away and then you ask your questions in yes and no format you know like if anyone is here turn off the light or you know if you have something to say yeah and then they turn off and on I love those those like I can't wait to try that myself you know I've also done silly things like you know I've taped a pencil taped it to a table stuck the point in like a piece of paper that was round and would see if I could get like a quote unquote ghost to spin my paper yes little things to try to gain contact um I've just had something as simple as a what do you call those things wind chime make the wind chime chime you know if you're inside there isn't any wind so if it's chiming something's making it chime things like that but that little EVP box that was probably the most eye open because I was like holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] it's picking up something I think those are fun but I would love a thermal camera I would love a thermal camera I would walk around the streets to Salem with that damn thermal camera now that would be a place to go walking around with some ghost hunting equipment right I think every single Street Corner in that area you're just surrounded by ghost everywhere out there we will definitely have to look into finding a Ghost Hunter and see if we can get someone on air so that we can interview them for the podcast but uh for any of you Ghost Hunters out there we want to talk to you so drop us a line email
