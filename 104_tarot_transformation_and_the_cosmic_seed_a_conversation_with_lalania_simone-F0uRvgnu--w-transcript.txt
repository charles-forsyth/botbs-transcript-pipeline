glittery blue and okay I admit it even the blue edges I was hooked you know to be honest with you the first card that pulled out to me you know I have this this thing for dragonflies the lovers card and the minute I saw that lovers card I was like oh my God I need that to be a tattoo you stole that dragonfly thing from me I like Dr I probably did but that's okay that's okay everything but for me it's the Knight of Wands but she calls it something different it's the um the action of Wands that card with the motorcycle I just freaking love that card these car okay so these cards are gorgeous it's a collage type Deck with photos with traditional artwork uh it's put together edgo Edge the colors are Jewel toned saturated gorgeous and I love cards that are edgo Edge I love that whole picture

depth and meaning we both are using these cards on the regular because they're so powerful they're so gorgeous and they're so chalk full of meaning I can't put them down I feel like the minute I put

growing on me and I I'll explain why in a minute but these are gilded in blue and it's stunning I just love them so to join us in our wonderful discussion tonight about Tarra of the cosmic seed we just happen to have the author we would like to welcome lania Simone the creator of the tarot of the cosmic seed here with us today well welcome lania thank you excited to be here now I understand that the tarot of the cosmic seed was originally a Kickstarter deck is that true yes it was about five I want to say almost it might be getting on towards five years or so four or five years from what inspired you to start that um I had been reading the tar I had um actually have a a metaphysical shop and I had started reading the tarot learning the tarot and as I was doing that um I couldn't find find myself in any of the tarot Decks that that I was working with at the time and so that inspired me to the idea of creating a deck which um felt very daunting the idea of creating 78 78 separate pieces of artwork so it was something I kind of put on the back burner I didn't have though I've been an artist my whole life I didn't have the skill set in the digital world yet to to do it that way and I knew that was going to have to be the way I did it and um and then I discovered procreate a friend of mine showed me procreate and and then it was the beginning of that path and I literally did a few um tutorials and then I kind of really learned how to do um that type of artwork as I was working on this deck now my question is when you do that and you go through that process do you start at the beginning and work your way card through card through the progression or are you kind of all over the place the person that I am has to start at the beginning and so I started with zero and then I went through the majors and then I I can decide which minor um suit to start it can be any of them but in that one I started with the cups and so yeah then it would be the beginning to King and and so on okay interesting sometimes I'd be working on a card and I couldn't figure it out and so I would skip it and do the next one and then come back okay okay happen every once in a while but generally I went straight through because I'm just thinking you know if you're working on the strength card you know what if the world is coming through to you yeah I think there was probably a few exceptions but but all in all yeah it was a straight there in this deck there actually are 79 cards yes you have a 23rd card in the major Arcana called The Cosmic seed right yes did you go straight through to that as well or or did you do that so um the first edition did not have the 79th card when I did a second edition I wanted to make it different so that it had something to add um so I made some small adjustments to the artwork and I changed the box and the card backs and I added the the final card now what was the inspiration behind the cosmic seed card because folks are used to that regimented 78 you know that 78 card deck um you know I wanted to kind of open it up into the more infinite aspects that we all hold that really none of the cards actually speak to um you know there's a there's magic in the in the Priestess and you know there's some more expansive energies in some of the other cards but I feel like this kind of opens us up to our Pure potential and not everything can be contained in these cards and so this kind of gives you an opportunity to you know create your own way I love that oh that's funny I just opened up to it by the way oh that's awesome I love a deck with an extra card one of my favorite decks to read with back when I read professionally is uh the L tarot and that also is a 79 card deck the who are you really card and I found that having a an extra card like that added so much more depth to readings when it would come up than I expected it to but I'm looking forward to it because I do find that it's surprising how much one card just adding one card can really change everything and just give it so much more I have a couple of decks um one of the Decks that I love is one of the no the Noel decks oh my gosh my cat and um she had like three cards in her Moon child deck I believe and I actually had to take them out oh and generally I think you know when I do find Decks that have the extra cards I'll take them out because my brain you know it just throws me off and so I I don't I didn't know if people were going to keep it in or take it out and you can't that's the thing you know you don't have to keep those in if you don't want to you know there's the freedom to do that now you had mentioned a little bit ago you said the Kings but in your deck one of the things that I I love and that makes this so much more inclusive and accessible is you don't have kings and queens you don't have pages and knights one of my favorite cards in the whole deck is the action of Wands because you have renamed the knights to action and the energy coming off that particular card gets me every single time I just I love it what process did you go through to kind of decide to to rename say the the pages are The Messengers The Knights are the actions the Queens are now nurturers which I love because not all the cards are feminine but they're still the nurturer and the same thing with the Kings they're called Mastery and same thing those are not all masculine cards to kind of represent that we can be all of these things tell me a little bit about the process the thought process that went into that absolutely um well I took out all of the hierarchical um more Colonial cards across the deck including the emperor and the empress because I wanted it to be accessible to the modern person who's reading it and has no connection to Kings and Queens I also always had a hard time reading the courts you know people say that they they can or should be read as people in your life or people in your world and I had a hard time with that so I decided that I was going to present them as more of an energy signature and so I had to sit sit with that for a while and I knew that the queen was going to be the nurturer and the King was going to be the Mastery and it was really kind of trying to sort out what was I going to call the pages and the and the nights and then you know after I sat with it for a while it came through as this is the energy that we're we're working with here and I like that because the one thing I think that sets this deck apart from the vast majority of decks it is very inclusive and it doesn't necessarily give the stereotypical gender assignments so I like that inclusiveness where this deck is for all people of all flavors and I love that awesome thank you I did kind of still give the you know the nurturers and the Mastery they all have crowns you know they still have their like their their Regal energy to them so that's kind of still a nod to that traditional style it's very traditional this deck is very traditional it follows the Smith weight symbology in imagery reimagined so as much as it is new and fresh and wonderful it's very easy to read as a reader whether you know the cards or not if you know the traditional symbology of the writer weight Smith Decks that you're used to this will obviously come very easy to you but there's so much more to it there's meat to it but if you don't know that you can still pick up these cards and look at the richness of the color and the layering of the imagery that you've got in each card and come up with a story and let your subconscious and your intuition just flow with it in such a beautiful way you know it really was that artwork and imagery that kind of sucked me in immediately to this deck you know I I I have a good share of my my own decks I am a collector addict whatever you want to call it I call it a a lover of tarot the first thing I usually do is I go through and I pull out the cards that immediately that first look first glance pull me in and resonate with me and you know Leila and I look at a lot of decks and there'll be times where I'll have five or 10 or so and I'll be like you know that's a good five or 10 great I if I was going to create a MAG Magpie deck these five or 10 would be in it I couldn't stop with your deck in the end I ended up counting them because I was so like I was like what the hell this is almost like a dam equal pile I had 30 cards that immediately just first just open the deck first glance 30 cards I put in my resonate pile and it's not that the others did not resonate with me it was just at a first glance I always base it on a first glance yeah and there were 30 cards in that first awesome I was like I'm like this deck is definitely got something to it and the more I touched it and carried it around and shuffled pulled it up and did one card pulls with it the more I kind of literally got tied to this deck I love these pictures they're very all-encompassing I was telling Ila before you came on one of the first cards I saw was the lovers card and I my first thought was I want a tattoo of this you have such an array of artwork and first of all Leila and I were talking you do have some I don't want to call them like portrait cards necessarily but there's card that have people on them in a in a fashion that they almost look like they could be real people in your life are some of these cards based on real people in your life the one card that is a real person is the messenger of Swords who is my daughter and the rest of them are cards that I pulled from stock imagery and open source and public domain imagery I hope your daughter appreciates that more than anything in the world she does that's pretty amazing because the people in these cards are part of what draws me to it they seem very alive and very vibrant and so when you look at these cards their expressions add so much you know everything about them gives more meaning and depth to the cards so I'm a little surprised there's just one person that's somebody that you know because they just they're so expressive the thing about some creating something like this is the process of finding the imagery probably took longer than anything else because to find that perfect frequency to represent that card and to have them really embody that is really not an easy thing to to do no and I didn't realize it was going to be so complicated when I started and so sometimes I would um just really create a library of images that I loved that I hoped maybe one of at some point when I get to the card I'll be able to go through these images and I'll be able to say oh that's the one it was the most complicated part of it because also I want them to have their their arms in the in the right place are if you're going to hold a cup or you going to hold a sword or you know there's all these different aspects of it that were just kind of complex yes complex that's part of the magic like we've talked about spellwork before and part of the magic of that is going to look for the ingredients you know if you don't have say a particular thing and you need substitute it with something else part of the magic is going to find that putting your energy towards that so just you spending all that energy looking for just the right thing added to the energy of these cards now this one the eight of coins this is just a gorgeous card and shell and I both read charms we do a little bit of charm casting and that's exactly what this card reminds me of it's like my grandmother's table with I was GNA say reminded me of my grandma it's so bright and it's buttons and coins and it looks like peonies and scissors and there's just so much to each of these cards from what I understand your mom gave you your first Tarot deck yeah she did I was um I want to say I was somewhere between 18 and 20 and I believe the first deck she gave me was the daughters of the Moon do you know this deck oh I know that it's a circular deck they went out of print quite a long time ago they end up making a second deck which I can't remember the name of now um which is still in print through Us games but that one was very impactful for me it was um each one each card is a goddess I believe and I really loved that grab onto your broomstick witches back after these messages this is Isaac and this is Mike and we are Duality unplugged oh I was going to say Isaac and Mike we we're both of those things we talk about everything on this podcast we will talk about some things you might become a better person or a worse person but you might like that that might be what you're looking for Duality unplugged because our bias has been disconnected [Music] right I like when cards kind of Veer away from the traditional stereotypes that the wrer weight decks kind of stuck with I always looked at myself as a magician but according to writer way the magician is always a man so I I really like Decks that kind of Veer away from that that Norm yeah I appreciate that too one thing about this deck and listeners of our podcast will know that I'm not a huge fan of gilding however it's growing on me and your deck kind of really was the one to change my mind I don't like gilding because it it tends to flake and peel and Dent very quick if you use a yeah yeah if you do use it a lot that gilding stops looking pretty very quickly and so it was kind of a a complaint of mine but the blue on this first of all is gorgeous and secondly mine's Rock Solid still oh mine is not I realized that that's part of growth right we're not always going to be bright and shiny and beautiful as you as you have Adventures as you as you go through your life you're going to start to pick up some Nicks and some chips and you're not going to be quite as sparkly as you were before right actually that's awesome but you're going to be unique and you're going to you're going to show some of these things that you have done in your life and I I think that's okay with next come wisdom and you also have the memory too like you can remember the shine and you know that kind of will give you a little warm feeling in your heart and you know honestly I think they're kind of more beautiful now that they're not quote unquote perfect they're much richer and have more stories to tell I guess I love that I don't even mind the the gilding do you use tarot regularly do you do tarot poles for yourself um so I find that it comes in and out of my life um in my shop for about a year and a half I read for the public and um I realized that that was hard for me to give myself in that way yeah and so I often will pull oracle cards for myself and I also have an oracle deck out it's called The Oracle of Awakening beautiful which I really actually love pulling those cards because I feel like that was very channeled and so I'm always like when I read the book I'm like wow that's awesome but um I'm like thank you spirit for that message but no not not as often as you would think I really feel like my my connection to it is through the artwork and I'm constantly working on on a deck like there's you know one coming through red whe wiser I'm actually in the midst of another one that I'm going to Kickstart here in a few oh you are peing my interests that part of me is like always like I'm knitting or I'm making jeel a maker yeah that's what really struck me is that you do all these different things and you create art you're a metalsmith you just said you're a Knitter you know you always have these projects going uh is that how you kind of Express that Mystic energy in your life is that how you kind of get that out there I feel like it is the it is what makes my life worth living and breathing outside of my child who's now 20 so she's grown up and moved away wild it really is like I I you know if I'm sitting in front of in front of the TV I have a a project in my lap it's it's just it's like what makes life happy for me everybody has different ways of contributing to the World on all different kind of levels and I feel like this is your great spiritual contribution to the world and I thank you for it because I am so in love with this you know my my intention really was to touch people so that they could see themselves from wherever they were in the world I should accomplished I love that thank you so much that means a lot you have other projects that you have created before and your Oracle deck is a similar type of collage art it looks like it could be a companion to this like I want to get both of them and use them together I want to use the Oracle deck on top of the Tarot deck and really see how the the energies there kind of go because that's another thing about this deck now I'm going to get a little Mystic for people I'm going to get a little witchy here but shell and I both when we pulled this deck out of the box could feel the joy and the happiness and the energy and the light it it literally came out of the box feeling like love Yeah and just good strong energy I I just love what you put in here but I think your Kickstarter came with like a journal is there ever any thought that you might put out like that journal type book with the artwork in it because that was gorgeous um so the first Kickstarter did have a journal with all the majors full color and I may have one or two of those left somewhere around here what I'd love to do if the if the tarot does well for red will and you know they're able to keep keep it around and keep publishing it I would love to do an expanded accompanying book because that was my first of course my first deck and I really put so much into the artwork and I had worked on it for so long when I got to the book I was like okay let's you know let's get some important pieces of information but keep short and sweet and I've had a lot of requests for some um expanded information that kind of touches on the symbolism and the choices and the colors and all of that and I would like to be able to offer that at some point so I hope that maybe we could do a deluxe set you know a few years in or something this would definitely be the perfect deck to have a color book companion with absolutely and I see something like that being a standalone an excellent standalone book too awesome now talking about that with with all of that being said was there anything in particular in this deck that you loved working on like was there a suit or a particular card that that really made you happy or that you you more enjoyed than any other what's that there's several cards that I really love I love the the seven and the Eight of Cups I enjoyed those so much because those came from really just the feeling of what those cups could mean I mean what those cards could mean the seven is um hands kind of in the ocean and there's these little bubbles with the different options um all the different possibilities in front of you and the eight is um it's like a very old ruin that is set in the sky with eight bowls of Water full of roses and you can walk through the portal kind of and and so for me that's a very meaningful card the the rer weight kind of has that as like a going away or leaving or kind of endings or you know there's a few ways to read that but I've always loved reading that card as like leaving the material behind and and going deeper into the spiritual and so that's what that that's what that feels like for me and then one of the cards I really loved was the T of Wands and because to balance the energy that has um a woman who is has baskets over her shoulders and one of them has her child in it child in it yes and I wanted to really portray that you know sometimes we have to carry a heavy load it's not forever and sometimes you know it's a load that we gladly carry and it doesn't mean that it's not hard right so I kind of feel like that really kind of captured that what a beautiful way to Envision that I I love how you put that and all of these cards are envisioned that way now the colors on them are very Jewel toned you know they're all very rich deep colors and was there a reason why you kind of strayed away from the the more I guess they're not really pastels but brighter colors of say like the traditional Smith weight decks I am definitely a jewel tone girl like if you were to look at my clothing when I go out into the world I'm in magentas and turquoise and teal and that's how I roll and also as I started this whole digital art I just went with the colors that I loved and I didn't really have color theory I don't have any like I don't have any training so that's why also there's like every card is like its own piece of art and it doesn't necessarily mean the first card is going to go with the fourth card right visually because they're each just their own they're almost Standalone art they really are it's really a trip like now going forward the works that I'm doing they all have a different level of coherence so I love this deck because it's just so free like I didn't have any of those constrictions or expectations I was just trying to to get each car done in the way that felt right and now I'm like okay well can we have a color theme for each of these suits like you know everything has changed but yeah the whole the whole color scheme of these just it's a part of the Ambiance that makes this deck so wonderful that the purples the blues the turquoise like it just all works it all everything came together so perfectly with this deck sometimes when I look at that deck and I see like you pull out the the sacred masculine card and it's just like here is yellow and everything else is so purple and so it's kind of funny to me when I see it laid out sometimes I'm like oh that was an interesting choice the bright ones yeah well because as you're working through it you're you don't necessarily know what combination is going to come up and how that's going to present itself to other people now in the booklet there was a a little tarot spread that you put in there and is that something that you created yes that's my my goto spread that's how I read when I read for anyone or myself the only addition is that I now have two cards um below that card so it looks like a tree there's the trunk I pulled the first card which is the center card that represents the person that's the first card and then I pull two cards under it that's the root oh okay and then I continue with pulling the cards I like the root because that kind of gives you some um some place to kind of understand why we're here in the present so it doesn't necessarily mean the past it could be it could be current events that are impacting why this present card is here kind of like the bass exactly could be what's holding you down or holding you steady awesome I really liked that spread actually I am I a spread fanatic shelle and I create them collect them all that stuff so when I used it I was like oo this is good and so I was very happy with it when I first tried it out I'm gonna if you wouldn't mind would it be okay if I put up a graphic with the extra two cards at the bottom perfect I'll definitely credit it to you but I I want to show our listeners with the extra two cards I'm going to try that right after we're done recording I'm going to pull those cards and see how it goes yeah throw those throw that route in there it just kind of gives you a little more context for everything and and I like that I do too so so this is the the spread that you tend to go to yeah this is kind of my go-to sometimes still like I'll get hired to do like an event and I'll just do something I was gonna ask you if you still read publicly yeah every once in a while like something will come up and you know like I said I have a little U metaphysical shop here in Denver and we get calls sometimes and they'll be like I'm having this event and we're looking for a reader for like 3 hours and if um it feels like a good match then I'll go out and do it and I'll just do five part spreads yeah it's it's hard to give yourself like that though it's hard to put yourself in front of people like that and and and read for them to be open like that for a couple hours so it's a big energy exchange yeah yeah I always feel like um for me tarot reading was an opportunity to give spiritual counsel and I'm I'm sure all tarot readers feel like that to some degree that someone is coming to you with whatever is going on in their life and they are looking for some guidance and so my connection with spirit is such that I would use the cards as a framework to bring through the energies and the and the messages for this person so that kind we had a visual representation of what was happening and so that's that's what felt like was happening for me and it was powerful to be able to do that but also I realized I was drained every time and even though I would put protection and I would do all these things I was like you know I just don't know that that's for me and I so love and respect the people who do it we have some incredible readers at our shop and I'm always just amazed at that but you can get gassed out very easily you really can yeah now you said that you are in the middle of uh working on a new deck is that a Tarot or an oracle so I right now I'm working on a deck that is called The Myth Weaver tarot and it is um every card I'm doing kind of a Lino cut style digital technique so every um figure on the card is black and then all of the details have been carved out oh and so really you can see it's just like the black and then we have you know I'm all about the backgrounds and I use vintage flowers everywhere in this deck and so every single card represents either a god um a deity of some sort or a mythological figure or a mythological creature from World mythologies to from like the very common ones to the more obscure ones I really want to represent you know like sunia and um the Aztec and the Maui and all types of different mythologies that people aren't really familiar with yes you hear the Greek and the Celtic mythologies all the time it's nice to get more exactly so there's a little greek there's a little Kel Celtic and then there's the Mayan and we have Japanese and so I'm deep in it now I'm probably just over halfway done and so that's really really exciting oh congratulations that's a good marker that sounds like something I need on my wish list yes I the um so I do have the kickstarter launch page up oh okay I'll put links to it okay awesome just for me personally how what is the transition from Kickstarter to to like cuz this deck um we got through red wheel wiser what's the transition from like Kickstarter to Red wheel how is that difficult so I had I had started working on so my third Deck with is called um the wise Earth medicine tarot and that is an um a Tarot deck that is all nature so it's plant animal and insect and each card has a traditional meaning but it also has the medicine that is being offered from that particular animal or plant and so it kind of doubles as a tarotoracle and the cards are Oracle sized and so I presented that to um red whe wiser and I introduced myself in a in a proposal and said this is what I who I am this is what I've done this is um how I can show you that I am established and that I have a platform and this is what I'm working on and they were super excited and I was hoping that they would take my wise Earth and they said we want all they we want it all we want all three yeah I don't blame them yeah that was a it was a big surprise I actually had originally also received an offer for the wise Earth from a different tarot company that we all know but they weren't as kind and and so it was very easy to make a um a really lovely decision to an offer that I couldn't refuse we love red wheel yeah they're great there they're so kind they're so loving they w around me in this beautiful way and they've they've just been incredible every set and between yall you brought us a freaking fabulous Tarot deck that I just I can't get over and I I'm just shocked that I have found a deck that has taken me a back like this because it is a rare instance it really really is she collects them she does not use them all she there's like two or three she'll use on the regular so me falling in love with a deck and using it that happens once in a while but her it's like super rare rare and I love this so much so so so much I love it because that means you feel the spirit of it that means you f my spirit thank you that means a lot to me than yes and it's beautiful thank you it comes through on your Instagram too I do I do follow you on Instagram I'll put links to your Instagram in the show description but it comes through there too just your loving spirit and you cribe a little bit on your Kickstarter page about growing up in Denver and you were a little bit of a wild child and then you said in your early 20s you kind of felt that magic you felt that call and Colorado to me the whole place is magic so I'm I'm not surprised that you felt that there but would you mind telling us a little bit about that that moment in your life I grew up in 80s I am generation what generation we X they called us so I grew up in the in Denver when crack and gangs was running the streets was running my neighborhood it's it's really my experience was a lot of danger violence there was death there was it was crazy I went to Catholic School in the middle of the hood and it was the nuns that really held us and kind of kept us um grounded in all of that Madness and so we were very Catholic and my mom actually even worked for the church at the time when I became when I turned 19 I moved to San Diego with a girlfriend of mine and I was I was I've always been an artist and I was looking for I went to the library to look for goddesses I had heard of Greek goddesses and I wanted to draw them and I accidentally found the goddess religion and I had a spiritual awakening because I had no idea there was anything else this is the 80s there's no internet rights and um and I hadn't explored anything outside of my religion and so it was a spiritual awakening and I came to understand that becoming awake Consciousness was really an unfolding that happened throughout your life and it wasn't just there's no end to it it's just going to continue and and I had I decided to devote myself to that and so at a very young age I was 19 maybe 20 that's when I started meditating and and really um devoting myself to a spiritual path and whatever that looked like MH and so that's just been unfolding around me since and then your mom who worked at the church gave you your first deck and the rest is history isn't that awesome well she said that she had you know she had grown up Catholic and she wanted to give us a spiritual foundation and so that was kind of the what she knew as well and so actually she's also during that time after I left um expanded into her own spiritual path and even for a while had joined a coven she she's a very wife wom I love that I love that you guys kind of went through that it sounds like almost at the same time same time yeah yeah that's so cool yeah my mom did something similar she now describes herself as a heathen but she you know it took her a little while to kind of come to that but she's this cute she's awesome she's like 72 73 and and she just runs around and she won't say she's a witch but she'll say she's a heathen so I think it's adorable knowing your mother I think she just likes calling herself even yeah it's true it's the shock fa you really is it really is yep
