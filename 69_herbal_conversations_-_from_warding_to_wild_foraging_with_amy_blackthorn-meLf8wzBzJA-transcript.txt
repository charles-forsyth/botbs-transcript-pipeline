join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and today we have the greatest Amy Blackthorn woohoo right Amy is the author of blackthorn's Botanical magic sacred smoke and blackthorn's Botanical bruise and she has been described as an Arcane horticulturist for her green witchcraft now she also owns Blackthorn hoodoo Blends she creates tea based on Old hoodoo herbal formulas oo that's my jam Amy has been a pagan for 28 years in various magical traditions and she started her formal schooling in horiculture herbalism and agriculture more than 20 years ago this girl is like totally like my BFF and I haven't even chatted with her yet so we are GNA talk to Amy about all things herbs welcome to the show Amy Blackthorne we are very excited to have you here thank you so much for having me before before we get into all the wonderful things we want to talk to you about sh and I were story we got a story so I'm gonna let shell tell her story because this is fun you're a part of the story and you don't even know it yet fantastic you know a month and a half or two months ago we were we were all at Sacred Space which by the way folks uh they've put out the dates for next year everybody should get a ticket and go because it's freaking fabulous and the last what was it Lea day and a half or so you know everybody's mingling throughout throughout the hotel and the conference you know do are you enjoying it are you having a good time and I just kept saying to people and I never once said this to you which is the irony at the end I kept saying my cup is full my cup is full you know so many great workshops so many great presenters my only complaint about Sacred Space is having to choose where to go in the time frames yes yes that is everyone's complaint it's like it's so face Choice what are we doing now shell was flush I I was I was a little bit of a broke witch so I didn't have much but shell now bought tarot decks and books and jewelry she had goodie bags like you would not believe she was walking around with one of your books waiting to run into you yes I I I did I had a couple there were a couple of authors that I had to hunt down and you were one of them because I as I am also a a herb witch and a tea witch and I I love what you have to say about all those things so we actually get stuff sent to us and we did a review on our most recent Solarium episode of blackthorn's Botanical magic so on an episode that you can catch our our Solarium you can hear all about that book but I knew that was coming so when we were there I was like I have to buy this book because I know I'm not going to get it and this is blackthorn's Botanical bruise herbal potions magical teas and spirited Libations and I was like damn it I'm going to hunt this girl down and get this signed okay so I happen to find you towards the end and I I very fan girl like asked you and you were so sweet by the way so sweet you didn't know me from anybody and you were like oh absolutely what you wrote like I almost puked on the floor and like I almost had to have Lea hold me up like I said for the last day and a half I had told people my cup is full my cup is full this was so great you know this is what you write not knowing about what I said sh may your cup never empty what the hell so now we see that you do intuitive Services were you using your intuitive on me that day because how did you know that that's what i' had been saying for the last two and a half days I definitely didn't look what she wrote look what she wrote the whole of the conference your brain is just wide open all this beautiful new stuff and yep that was just what came out you heard it in my brain you know and I think when you said like you're you're wide open that's really true like these workshops I have never taken more notes in workshops I think in all my years of going to festivals and conferences and I was happy to do it we would we would go back to our hotel room and we'd be flipping through notes be like let's talk about this and let's talk about that and let's do this spread we just talked about and and and really digging into it you know there was a lot of magic and work there so I'm not surprised that your intuitive self was like wide open and just receiving just picked that right out of my brain and I was like how did she know I'm like Leila you will not believe what she just wrote like you won't and it was just the synchronicity was crazy blew my mind Perfect Since we're on the topic of your intuitive Services I was reading a little bit about you and you know you normally expect to see people say oh I read tarot cards or I read runes or oracle cards and I loved that you put that you were a professional intuitive because while I also love Tarot cards and osteomancy and all the different manes you creepy bone people I also like intuitive readings I like when people can really just get in touch with that energy can you talk to us a little bit about that like what you do and and how you get into into that space absolutely um I've been a professional intuitive since 1999 and I've gotten to read all over the place I I've been able to travel extensively for work and you know I'll go to England or I'll go to Canada or I'll go you know just anywhere that that bbops around and my my brain says oh Sparkle Sparkle let's go there so it's really wonderful to see how my style has changed over the years goodness it's been six or seven years ago now uh friend of mine messaged me on Facebook saying oh my god did you how are you on TV and I'm going what are you talking about my love like what what are you on I'm I I haven't done any TV in years she says no no it's absolutely you and I'm thinking that's it's probably a a twin or a lookalike Apple ganger for sure for sure until she sends me a photo and it's me on Netflix it's that was super duper for real me I had forgot how' you get on Netflix and not know it how the spell exactly that you did this was a u a reading I was doing for a reporter the um Associated Press did the video of it to promote some work that we were doing for the news and so they sold that footage to uh secrets and nickis is top 10 secrets and Mysteries it was an episode on supernatural abilities and they called me a truly gifted medium and I'm like that's great but I just I'm just a lady who listens to the air that's a good good way to put it you know I worked at a shop in Baltimore called mystical Voyage at the time that it was open it was the largest metaphysical shop in this in the United States o giant giant giant but I would read for people all day every day for days at a time we'd have big events we C had one called spiritfest and you'd have five minute reading slots for hours just so that people could get in and it was speed dating for psychics you could get everybody's feel see who you liked who you didn't vibe like get a little bit had to be draining though that's all I could think of like how did you feel after that how did you recover I at the end of the evening a bunch of the readers would go out to dinner and just chat because we're my third eye felt like a sock full of hot nickels right yeah it's like there's just nothing left except weird uncomfortable things and so it was it was grounding it was eating it was conversing it was definitely hydrating because you not dehydrating for this this time you're not appropriately and so it's wonderful to get to be able to recognize and listen to those intuitive voices that come in my opinion um in my experience over my right shoulder someone saying oh hey think about this um I had a reading with a client two weeks ago and I she didn't ask for a mediumship reading she didn't she just wanted some some check-ins with her her guides and her spirits we were doing this when the gates open though the gates open you are not wrong so I get a lot of pictures of I'm a very visual oriented person I am um dyslexic so I could 3D model anything and so visually things come in all the time and so I'm getting this picture from my Guides of Steve Urkel coming into the door over and over again on Family Matters over and over and over again I'm like what in the hell is going on here we have to go on this journey with our clients all day every day this is our job and so she's starting to ask me do I have any anyone that's coming forward and I laughed I didn't want her to think I was laughing at her but I said who is Steve like what is what is happening who is Steve and she goes oh my God that's my dad no Preamble no anything we've just got Steve Urkel banging on the door to come in that's her dad I love that you know it it's funny that you said that and I liked how you said listening to air because when I read professionally for me it felt like the back of my head like that's where just almost like I know the popular word now is download but it literally felt like I was connected to something and it was coming in the back of my head like pictures in the air and yeah things like Steve Urkel pop up and you're like I don't know what the hell that means Steve Urkel really but you have to say that you have to say that to the person that's sitting in front of you and try to describe that as best you can because most of the time like you found out it means something to them you know to you Steve URL means nothing but as soon as you say who's Steve and why are they coming in the door to the client in front of you it clicks they know and then you start getting more information coming in from your left side from the back of your head wherever wherever in the air you get that information once like shell said you open that door everything starts coming in yeah it's our job to go on that Journey with the client yeah I had um I had someone ask me about travel they're like okay am I am I going anywhere in the next six months and I said oh my God yeah you're going right here and I pointed to the tip of my index finger and both of us sat there for a second like that's weird what does this mean what the heck does that mean and then I get a picture of my friend Lacy uh and I realized that she's going to Michigan my friend Lacy lives in Michigan they use your hand as a map of the state and so I said I've got I've got I've got a tape of my index finger and a brown and white sign with a Jeep on it uh she's like okay let's let's work this out and so the tip of my finger there's a state park right there that hence the brown white Jeep yeah so I was like oh you're you're absolutely going here in Michigan um and there was there was a name associated with it she's like oh my God my dad has a cabin there she had no plans to go there but she had a great time but that's part of the journey is figuring that out and going where it leads you and I that's really cool you have to trust there's a lot of trust involved in that yes the the listening isn't just to your client that's a very big portion of it but you also have to remember to listen to yourself um people get this oh my God I can't do this and it's a it's so complicate no it's not these messages are meant for you personally your guides could not give them to you if you did not speak this language like there's no point in them wasting their energy to to talk to you at UE if you don't speak Urdu right so you have to recognize that this message was meant specifically for you so either she knew who somebody named Steve or I had to figure out why Steve urle was showing up in this reading because he's not on the cards like we've got to figure out where that door comes together symbology is unique to each person yeah we've got to figure out what that has to do with where we're going um I was driving down the highway oh probably last year and I'm driving so there's there's messages and there's things that happen and I see a tire Spin and rocks like gravel shoot out from under the tire and so I turn to my traveling companion and I say hey I still have a bottle jack under the back we didn't pull it out when we went to uh Pig and pride did we no no no it's still there it's still there and we're fine I'm like okay they're like uh why like are do are we going to need that I'm like I I think we might need that I'm worried that we might um bust a tire and and need to change the tire on the side of the highway and just got like big big flashing lights and they're like okay that's that's fine we'll look out for that and probably 500 feet later the car in front of me skids a little bit on the gravel gravel goes flying and it slams into my windshield and cracks the windshield oh so it wasn't that I interpreted it wrong it was that I didn't let the video play long enough so you got to really figure out like what does this specifically have to do with you can't assume because we know what happens when you make assumptions now let me ask you this and you know we we do have some listeners that that feel they have the same ability in one form or another yeah how do you turn it off is is there a turnoff switch what if you're just you got going on today and you just you can't listen and you need to turn it off do you have way to do that absolutely a th% boundaries boundaries this is the song of the of our people boundaries we have those can be hard in the mundane World let alone in the magical world yeah yeah a friend of mine when um she starts talk when she started talking to ghosts she's like look um dead people got a lot of time on their hands and I don't how can we figure this out I'm only available for conversation from 5: to 8: pm on Monday through Thursday yes boundaries th% um so we got her to the point where she dedicated a special hat that she would put on so she had the sensory input that said okay I'm open for business we can talk because you're driving your car and your brain starts to wander you're you're looking around but you know your brain turns off you've been down I 95 a thousand times before so your brain sort of checks out and that's when people are like oh hey hey can we can we chat no I am busy I know it doesn't look busy oh I see you're not busy right now yeah yeah so we dedicated a special hat so if she put the Hat on she had the physical sensation to remind her like it's okay we're open for business now but really giving yourself permission to have those boundaries is the hardest part right because they think oh well if I'm getting this message I must need someone must need me no you need to take care of yourself right they can talk to each other until you're ready not to mention it can be mentally and emotionally overwhelming especially if you're new to it and it just feel feels like it's coming at you from all angles and you don't know how to decipher the messages you don't know who they're for and that can be a lot in the beginning until you kind of get to that point where you have your your set ways and your boundaries set and and things of that nature so I I I just thought it might be a good question for the listeners on how do you turn it off if needed the first thing that I teach them is an egg shell like how do I put myself in a little magical bubble and I can make it soundproof this tiny little egg I love the egg as a as a as a first step for beginners because you can paint on the walls you can color it you can add layers you can add bricks you can add bar wire but everybody knows what an egg looks like right even if you've never eaten an egg you're allergic to eggs that's fine the outside is personalizable that's we're gonna go with that it's okay shell can't pronounce anything either it's okay when you're ready to break out of it you have that ability I like that analogy yep I use a soap bubble but I really like the egg because you can paint on it and build into it I like that I like the soap bubble it gives people so when they have the egg down we we have them I have them practicing you know you stop at a stop light here's your egg you stop you walk into work here's your egg because there's no holes in it it gives you a nice firm base to start with people say oh I'll leave a hole for my no no we don't if you leave a hole in it your egg your yolk falls out we don't do that we don't do holes but we can modify what you're working with if you'd like to talk to spirits uh I have a leather jacket my my motorcycle jacket I've worn for 20 years when I go out on my motorcycle so I know that I know the sensation of the leather I know what it smells like I know what it feels like I know the weight of it so I have a magical version of my motorcycle jacket that I put on when I'm going into situations might be scary um I have a cloak that I wear when I talk to dead people like this is a visual reminder for my my etheric self you know I'm not wearing it like I'm wearing my t-shirt my spirit is wearing that cloak saying okay we're we're open for business we've got time but kind of like in you you translate that that to the mundane world because when you put on your motorcycle jacket you kind of get that sense of I need to be aware I need to pay attention I need to kind of be focused on this bike because you don't have that steel around you exactly it kind of even in the mundane World things can kind of put you either in or out of that sense yes I'm a huge fan of using things in the mundane world to trigger magical world reactions absolutely and having an item like the hat for your friend that it's on your head it touches your crown it touches your third eye possibly it is literally something right there where your psychic ability possibly is and so that connects you in a way plus like you said it's a smell it's a weight it's a ritual you do this enough times with that hat and just the act of putting it on put you into that space to speak to spirits or with your your motorcycle jacket it is literally an item to protect you it is literally there to keep the skin on your body when you fall off your motorcycle and so the whole point of it right and so magically the whole point of it is to protect you it matches and so it's very easy for your brain to latch on to those things and when you involve all the senses like that what does it smell like what does it feel like what does it what does it look like when you do all of that it really helps to activate your magical brain so using those as triggers is I I think that is so smart I love that idea if you want detail there um the whole process is outlined in Black th's protection magic awesome perfect in the in the psychic protection section um because we're talking about how to obviously keep ourselves safe so if you're walking at night and it's foggy and it's dark and and you're not sure where people are like how can I put put on a psychic armor to protect myself well you can wrap yourself in your motorcycle jacket you put it put on your your protection items Matt Ain talks about it in psychic witch love that book we we chatted about this in January of 2019 we were met at pantheacon and so we're it's it's two in the morning and we're talking about protection magic and he's talking about actively projecting the psychic sound of a dog burking like a big Angry Dog Barking just projecting it out from your person into The Ether and even if people don't think that they're intuitive even if people aren't necessarily paying attention the hairs on your arms will stand up and they will cross the street to the other side of the street and it works so offensive and defensive psychic protection are valid and real processes yes but they're outlined in protection magic I actually find them just as useful in crowds of people yes yes honestly you're going to a concert and it's loud and people can't hear you they can feel you yeah yeah I like your eggshell analogy um as the barrier as a shield you can use the because the inside of it is so perfect for writing on you can make a Sigil have a magical sigil that you use for protection and you can write that on the inside of your eggshell and slightly different bubble but you know I sometimes will put my bubble up like shell says in a crowd and I'm a very short person I don't take up a lot of space it's very difficult for me in crowds okay both of you tall I don't want to hear you're both Amazon I will plow through a crowd for you but but I don't need that because I have found very easy for me to put up that shield and I can walk through a crowd very easily and people tend to part ways just because that energy is there and people tend to sense it you know when you stare at someone across the room and have them look at you it's kind of an aspect of that same magic you can feel someone's energy you know what that's called what is it called it's called Pro preception when you feel someone looking at you and you turn around they're actually looking at that's a real thing that we've discovered in in our as part of our senses you know you're in kindergarten we talk about our five senses it's a lie we have many many more senses and pro preception is my favorite I have a real quick question for both of you how come all this stuff in the Pagan and witchy world has these freaking names that I can't pronounce blame the the Romans I guess Latin and Greek I don't know blame them it sounds like a great concept I'll never be able to say that word ever and plus everything sounds cooler if you say it in like ancient Greek or know in Latin or Greek it just sounds I pronounce it proception sounds much more interesting than I stared at you so how did you feel me staring at you right that's the type of magic we all accept like everybody accepts the fact that you can stare at someone to get them to look at you that's magic I do that my to my boyfriend to make them wake up and it works every time and I giggle right and if you know that that is true you can then create dogs barking to protect prot you you know summon up pate's hounds and have them with you while you're on your walk put that eggshell put it around you people can feel that energy one of my favorite things about that is having hecas hounds with you you you'll you'll walk differently you'll you'll appear differently you're walking like you're like they sent you to kill Captain America like your spine is tall and your arm your shoulders are down and the slow motion uh theme music walk yes yes stuff's exploding behind me and we're just walking away you can and people can see that they can't see the the fiery ball but they can see that your head's up your shoulders back your your head is on a swivel and I'm going you are protected I also think that part of however you want a phrase that summoning these things or or what have you and you know like with the hkat hounds you know if if I'm if I'm picturing myself walking down the street because I'm picturing myself with hiat's hounds I myself am going to present differently so it's almost like it tricks your psyche into being that protection almost within yourself you know what I mean like Lea said you know you got your shoulders back you know your heckles like that is more than kind of that cowering you know you you you psych yourself into protecting yourself almost as well and bad guys can see this yeah you you go from looking like a victim to no to looking like you can mess somebody up I literally just read an article about that the other day that is so true yeah and when you when you bring in these magical protections it also changes how you present yourself and and more of because you feel that that confidence for lack of a better word yeah yeah mundane suggestion here Gavin Deb backer's book The Gift of fear highly recommend it similar to what we're talking about here it's on the suggested reading list for protection magic yeah awesome see more synchron ities I love that yeah great book now I want to kind of I want to kind of take it in a little bit of a different direction talk about books I know you you own a business called blackthorns hoodoo Blends now blackthorns Botanicals oh blackthorns Botanicals black Thorns Botanicals yes can you talk to me a real bit what what's hudo talk to me what is this American folk magic oh okay I think people in the greater World maybe sometimes confuse hudo with Voodoo ah yes it's a very common problem Voodoo is a beautiful religion that if I would if I wasn't a witch I would get I would be I would get initiated into Voodoo it's such a beautiful beautiful religion it makes me feel so seen and heard so is it is it is it literally American folk magic whoo is American folk magic yes like I'm thinking you know Byron Ballard you know Appalachian folk magic kind of thing am I on the right track say Appalachian or Byron Ballard's going to throw an Appalachia appalachin they're part of they're from the same tree they're just different branches on that same tree okay okay um so appalachin folk magic is here um hudo is here everybody's got their own Traditions so a lot of this came out of um the Congo and the African-Americans being forced to come to the US the camans the Caribbean islands Hai and West Africa yes and there's there's so much really inredible magic that has come from that but the important part is that as a a palm colored person when we talk about American folk magic not everything is for us right right right and and some things are closed right yes closed practices are super important when we're talking about respecting the trials and tribulations of individual cultures because if we take from that we take it out of its context we I have my mugart balm that I've created and I send it to some across the planet without any attachments it loses that culture the culture is part of what we're bringing to um individual practitioners when they talk about their their own practices their their thoughts their feelings their experiences I came to appreciate African traditional religions and and the African diaspora through my father who um was a blues musician oh so we'd go um Baltimore has a a great Blues culture starting from the 1890s when there's a big influx of people coming into the Baltimore Harbor Port uh and bringing their culture with them so there's actually a couple really amazing not just Museum exhibits but really in-depth discussions about what African traditional religions have brought to Baltimore specifically through the those ports there's a museum that I absolutely is amazing if you ever are in Baltimore please go and see it maybe next year at Sacred Space you could take a day but it's called the American Visionary Arts Museum and it's a museum that is not funded for traditional artists who went to art school and and learned how to sculpt and and here you go here's here's a here's a sculpture that's not it they want to um support indigenous artists uh people of color people who couldn't afford to go to art school but still have the creative urge to make art that's great I love that I love that I'm getting Goosebumps um but they had a really immersive an amazing exhibit God maybe 10 years ago maybe longer um and it was all of different traditional religions deities and Spirits embodied in their art so there was a king-sized bed that had been hand Beed with these little tiny tiny seed beads to be an altar for is fra and there was a life-sized blue mermaid that was um the embodiment of Mami the the the embodied Spirit of the people who threw themselves over a ship rather than be transported to a new place her job is to collect those souls and love them the Sal of her tears is is yeah that's it's a lot it's heavy you know and and that's all wrapped up in it oh my God yeah um but you can't take green tea out of this context and and have the weight of that not come with it right you you have to honor those spirits and say this is part of what what is happening yes it's there's no removing little pieces you can't remove a little piece and still retain the essence of the whole thing you it has to be all of it and some of that some of that has doors that we can't go through and that's all right that's okay and it's not for us and that's okay I was it's more than 10 years it's probably closer to 15 years now um I was taking a class on uh it was a Mystic Saints and sages class of judica illis and I had been raised in the United States as as an American child so I had been given this oh America's a Melting Pot and everyone's great and it's amazing and idea and we were talking about that and jica said that is the most racist thing on the history of this of this country and I'm like oh my God who could say such a thing what are you talking about and she said to be a part of this Melting Pot you have to give up your own culture you have to give up your language you have to give up your spirit you have to give up your holidays you have to give up everything to be to fit into this little bubble that says this is what Americans are and up until that point I had never gotten that it's it's not something that had my brain just didn't grock like it just didn't right right right it wasn't until that moment that I felt like I understood the amount of stuff that people have to give up to say that they're American other countries understand this because they're like okay you're American you're this you're not like on Tenth Scottish and one tenth Welsh you're you're American you have your own culture but that culture is so for lack of a better term actually I think this is a really appropriate term whitewashed it is and that's part of the problem and I when you talked about Melting Pot that was something I loved as a kid I never saw it necessarily as like a like a cheese fondue Melting Pot I always saw it more as like a a stew or a really great soup or a gumbo where everything all comes together with its own flavors and makes something better than it was and that's what I wanted it to be you know that's what I in my you know my corner of the world hoped it was I guess thought it was but it isn't it's it's more like the cheese fondue where it all kind of melts into this homogenized pasteurized cheese product that is American and and I think I I thought the same thing growing up and it wasn't until I ventured out of my hometown and kind of you know saw different cities different states and different perspectives when I realized that I I might have been misled as a as a younger person yes you you grow you know we we are older we know more we learn more and and that happened in our religion too because Amy you were back there in the 90s you know back in the day of this and it was beautiful it was wonderful but it was also very exclusive and it and it it had own issues we didn't know more gatekeeping back then yeah and yeah and it was more heteronormative and it was more very much from a white perspective and and it had a lot of amazing things I'm not taking anything away from that time period but you know now the whole religion has grown exactly we know better we do better and and that's what we're trying to I hope that's where pagans as a whole are kind of going towards so now that we've got some serious stuff out of the way let's go back a little bit to some more of your your books and I need to say a quote because this this quote shook my world okay damn first first page of this book Liquors are horiculture distilled down to its finest form I never in all of my days until I read this book 30 years never until now did I ever think of alcohol as a damn magical through other than obviously you know the cakes and Ale piece of of that I was like this chick's a freaking genius I love this like I obviously I've been you know I've been into the tea thing forever in a day but I didn't realize that that translated to alcohol go you oh thank you so much thank you tell me about that let's talk about some some lior spells what do we got here oh my God it's so great because um I don't know if any of you are Amar with Amy Stewart's work she's amazing and we love her um she has a book called the drunken botanist and so I already love it it's amazing please go buy seven copies um she is really really fantastic she has a traveling Museum exhibit that goes around at this point it it visited the Delaware Museum of Natural History and it was not only was it a fantastic Adventure walking through the these diaramas of botan structures and things they had a they had a model of a dynamite tree the fruit explodes like a hand grenade oh yeah it's it's dangerous dangerous portic culture but she went into the it was actually a the exhibit is for Wicked plants the weed that killed Lincoln's mother and other Botanical atrocities o yeah such that sounds like it was a good presentation yes it is it's an amazing book it's a little hard cover green book and so the exhibit built out of that b book and so we were talking about the drunken botanist we had um my brain's trying to say vever vermouth we had vermouth tasting from a local distillery in in Philadelphia and they actually had all of the different Botanicals that they put into it so you could sniff a little a little bit of myrrh that had been submerged in alcohol and you could smell cardamom and you could smell um alligator pepper what is it called uh it's a alligator pepper is my is my favorite common name for it you smell each of the pieces of this puzzle this Botanical puzzle that they're creating vermouth out of and it's like most people think of that that green bottle in the back of the bar cabinet it's a it's a fortified wine it's distilled wine that's sort of flavored with these beautiful beautiful which means that it's meant to be used the whole bottle is meant to be used you know within a week or so of opening it it's should it's not meant to live in a bar cabinet for 20 years at the back getting Dusty so giving people per mission to make it themselves really allows people to embrace the magic of each of these individual spices flavors Aromas into the REM that you're making and it opens up these doors because so many people especially when I was talking uh on tour for the Botanical magic release so many people came up to me and said I can't be a green witch I kill all my plants shell and it's like my love you don't need you don't need to Garden you don't need a no one's checking you don't there's no Licensing Bureau you're okay let's do this I'm the herb witch that kills things yes yes and plants can come to you for end of Life Services that's fine they do they do she's the death duela for plants there we go but it gives us permission to really dive in and expand experience and relate to the plants that we're working with by taking them into the kitchen by taking them into the bar giving us permission to really experiment with those things it was really important for me to both my parents are alcoholics every mention of an alcohol whether it be absence there's 5,000 words on Magic with absence in that book um or something else I wanted to make sure that everyone felt comfortable with what we're talking about so if there's a magical use of absence for for example there's also a sober substitution for those who are in recovery who still want to be able to work with the energy of these plants but are don't want the alcohol piece yes for whatever reason because it's no one's business but yours right but it was really incredible to give people the permission that they were looking for to work with these Botanicals so we'll have something like absence and there's like I said 5,000 words on it so you can look at what each plant offers to each Brew so there's absence isn't just one thing there's a whole list of herbs that are in it and there's there's protection and there's pounding enemy attack and there's the peaceful dreamy side that people associate with absence a attracting tuary Spirits we're looking at all of the individual ingredients that go into these pieces and what does this magical math problem look like when we're done so if you can take cardamom and Infuse it into lilet Blanc which is a really lovely uh French wine what's going to happen to it what magic does it give that new brew that you've just created and it's absolutely what people were looking for in the in the permission department they want the book to hey you can actually do this so I wanted to make it as approachable as possible first of all so making your own sodas gives people permission to play in the kitchen if there's strawberries that are going to go bad before you get a chance to use them chop them up and throw them in and make a shrub out of them now my my big question for you is did you create a tea that is a hangover medicine for any of your liquor potions in Bru yes no not only did I do that but um I actually had uh my New Year's Eve party that year was based on tea cocktails because people get excited and they they're excited they're having a party they're doing all their things and they forget to hydrate by making tea cocktails hydration is in the drink yes right there where he started so everybody gets to feel fancy you can put herbs in it since it's tea you could put herbs in it to help with headaches or to you know all sorts of good stuff there like or to have a good time time at the party you know you can kind of mix those teas up to be little spells I love exactly my biggest problem with tea is it makes me pee all the time there I said it well good you need to it's good for you hydration is important my first spot was um the very last day before Del went into lockdown for 2020 I'm picking up groceries I'm making my last trips and my you know I'm a little nervous a little anxious nobody knows what's going to happen and so my brain says hey uh I want watermelon and I look and there's the little $5 bowls of cut fruit that's that's ready to go and I say okay I'm going to grab some watermelon I'm going to take it home if they're five bucks I need to move to Delaware you do it's the bowl is this big and it's $5 so I get it home and I'm super excited I I I told my brain I wanted a thing my body said I needed a thing let's go do it and I got it home and I cram it in my face hole and it tastes like TV static because I forgot that it's March and watermelon does not grow in March right and so my body said I wanted this thing for the flavor and now I got nothing so I said okay well I'll make a shrub out of it I'll make it for practice we'll see what happens there's no flavor that I'm tasting as I'm as I'm eating it so there's no harm in it I I will waste a little bit of sugar to see what happens scientists and witches right here same place so I get my one cup of watermelon my one cup of I used a prco vinegar really lovely and then one cup of white sugar and I put it in a bowl and I let it sit on the counter for two days what happens is the vinegar breaks the cell wall of the of the watermelon and it releases all the sweetness and water and sugar and all of that into this syrup that we're now making I'm gonna make I'm gonna make sodas with it nice Italian watermelon soda let's do it so I I strain all the watermelon out I put that in the refrigerator I'll put that on over ice cream later because it's already tastes like sweet syrupy watermelon don't throw that away the best was the strawberries in bomic vinegar oo ice cream and guess what happened all of that flavor that was was not present on my tongue when I went to eat it had been released into that into that syrup that we were making so I had watermelon sodas for the next three months I had you know just a sip there it's amazing it really is but it lets all of that the sugar and the sweetness and the water and all the things that are missing in out of seasoned fruit it's hiding inside that fruit it's there we just don't know it so it let all of that out and I was able to make really gorgeous watermelon sodas and in the evening if I happen to put a a Tipple of some Uncle Val's Botanical gin in there okay it's a cucumber forward gin with sage lemon and lavender in it o so I had a little watermelon cucumber cocktail happening this sounds like summer in a glass it is and the fact that I needed that because it was March and I was stuck inside and there's a pandemic happening and we don't know if the world's ending I wanted some summer in my life yeah now you're talking about recipes so this is a Hot Topic online and I actually bookmarked a recipe from your book and I I want to hear what you have to say about this so the tiktock I call it the tiktock it's it's my it's my thing The Tick Tock in the Facebook I feel like everybody on the planet is getting hexed and the ones who aren't want to do hexes like I don't know what's going on here now you have it's an epidemic of cursing and hexing just flying willy-nilly all over the place so you have this hex breaking mint and grapefruit tonic with rosemary syrup I I want a hex so I can drink this because that just sounds delightful so I want to just quick talk about what are your thoughts on everybody on the internet being hexed and your bruise to break said hexes if you feel that that has been put upon you the great thing about the recipes from the book is that you don't have to have an excuse protection magic is a cyclical responsibility yes so God I love that I love that a cular cular responsibility so when we talk about our protection magic we should not only be responsible for our rewarding or our protections when you think something's going to happen every day even if every day is part of your responsibility as a as a yeah magical practitioner to maintain regular magical hygiene yes proper magical hygiene is important if we're doing that that means we're switching it up so some people will say oh well I I burn lavender every full moon I'm fine are you though because one if you do it every full moon and and your best friend since the sixth grade knows that you do this every full moon if you are no longer friends they know how to get around your your experience it's almost like you know the loophole exactly yes so you the other problem with that is if you have a purple spotted monster that lives in your attic and he's not allergic to Lavender he's going to stay there forever if you get that that's the only thing you're doing by rotating through the things that you know and understand about your magical practice you you wind up avoiding the magically resistant staff infection hiding in your attic right good analogy thank you analogy like I I Adore the way you think see and this is why she's such a good writer this is why I love reading your books because you have all I do think that that is an important thing though and I think people learn one method of say protection for example and they're just going to keep doing that that's their go-to over and over part of the fun is it fun of it is learning different ways and I kind of want to segue back to to your for of of herbs and Botanicals what is your favorite herb or herbs to kind of throw in to various things whether it be protection or happiness or money because we all know that there's herbs that have multiple uses talk to me about your favorites because with all these books I know you have a couple that's evil though I do have a couple but Haven to Pi one it's like oh my God what do I call one if you had to go on this this crazy magical spiritual adventure and you could only take one or two or okay three we'll go let's give three you can only take three herbs with you for any use you might need go mugart dragon's blood and cloves oh nice interesting Trio I like that okay yes that's very py Trio you have the dreamy responsibility covering your your etheric psychic intuitive bits in the mugart dragon's blood has that Fierce protection magic and it smells amazing and clove brings luck to you it can um it works really well for protection magic the thing about protection is not it's not one thing you know if you learn one method of protection and you rely on that then you know if if all you have is Hammer everything starts to look like a nail right so if you are looking at you have I can bring clove with me to this magical desert island I can set it up as a protection Ally I can work with it as um to bring luck into my home whatever that's going to look like on a deserted island everybody's got their own jobs so protection magic could be I could look at citruses they've got a solar Association and that solar light brings light to anything that's been dark and muddy and sort of neglected I could bring clove and have the fire to burn away anything that's negative before it even gets into my into my airspace so to speak so nobody is just one thing so yeah those three those three plants are definitely at the top of the list and that that was one thing when we uh did our Solarium episode and we we did four books and one of them was uh your I want to make sure I get this title correct the blackthorn's Botanical magic book I like that you have a little section where you talk about the different correspond not correspondences but like if I have bay leaves I can use it for this this this this and this if I have mint I can use it for this this this none of this stuff has one use and that's why I wanted to know what your three favorites were yeah because when we look at it we're taught this list of correspondences that no one no one is going to remember that's please don't feel like you're supposed to memorize all of this stuff there's so much to learn that's what a book of shadows is for folks that's right we have the opportunity to work with and learn from these individual allies that's great but if we take it that extra step further and say hey if we rather than buying one oil for each material I've got a hex shattering oil recipe and I need to make a bunch of different stuff I got to buy Six oils rather than expecting anyone to be able to afford to go and do all this we can provide them with one oil that'll do a million things rather than six things to make one oil right right I I grew up in there is there's homelessness there food insecurity like it's really important to make sure that everyone who approaches witchcraft doesn't feel like they have to spend a million dollars on all the fun at ceron it's fun go do that if you can but please don't feel like you have to do that to be a witch right not a thing and that goes along with in this book there's a lot of kitchen herbs things that you would just normally find in your kitchen and I I love those like coriander since shell brought it up blackthorn's Botanical magic you talk about Cor Ander and you list all these different uses and the listeners of this show know if you want to get rid of unwanted guests in your home turn your broom upside down and it's that's a good simple folk spell some Appalachian folk magic to get people out of your house what can I use Italian seasoning for but if you want to make it a little it's a protection it's a protection malange yeah exctly everything in there could be used in protection magic yeah you take coriander you put it on on your broom you put it on your your window sill whatever you that helps you know and and you take a little something from just your kitchen you don't have to have anything dragon's blood is awesome I love it but you don't have to have it you can use something else absolutely there's always another thing if you does one of you have Botanical magic in your hand yes open it up to the back okay what do we need I'm in the back in the indexes you'll see an index of all the recipes in there and they're grouped by subject grouped by subject yes they are air scrying okay yeah I see that if you look at that I wrote that index myself um we didn't it wasn't like somebody who came in and just wrote down an index nice so what we have is not page numbers to find hex chattering oil we have the plant in which that section is found so if you're looking at the hex shattering oil I think that's in Clove yeah I'm actually looking at hex breing spray because it has my favorite Rosemary in it which I love that's another one that you can use for a Prett much everything so I love that it's in the hex breaking spray but yeah right in the back you have different uh recipes centering oil Clarity incense under mental Powers it's all broken out very nicely I love that but what you're looking at is not really an index what you're looking at is a readymade substitution list Perfect Look at that sneaky yes very sneaky very sneaky that's why you're kick ass thank you so much yeah you really do these books are so much fun they read like a conversation not like a lecture yes and interesting an interesting conversation it's not just boring lists it's they're interesting books to read through it's not just recipes and boring so thank you for that because those are very cool I have one more question slash topic I wanted to ask you about now you mentioned you don't have to be a rich witch to do this and it's not about money spent and it's not about you know how pretty your stuff is can you talk to us for a minute about um foraging the dos the don'ts the etiquette you know what what is the the benefits or the negatives to foraging your own as opposed to maybe going to Home Depot and spending money you don't have they sell herbs at Home Depot they do yeah they they have they have a whole landscaping Garden section that's right usually potted usually potted like you're not getting it ready to you know that's true yeah but talk to talk to us about foraging for a minute like I said the kind of the dos the don'ts the etiquette don't kill yourself that kind of stuff so the first thing is um good sharp scissors and a pair of gloves I know it sounds obvious to to know that these parts are really important but they are important for Magical reasons as well as mundane reasons so the next book that comes out is sacred plant magic it's the sequel to Botanical magic o I'm excited about this when that coming out real quick uh September 2nd the idea is that with the scissors and the gloves you are providing the healthiest option for the plant from whom you are deciding to take material if your scissors are dull if you just try and rip it off you're doing a lot more damage to the plant then you are the plant that would benefit from some sh sharp scissors okay not to mention I try to be thankful and kind of thank it before I kill it yes we not killing anybody um that's that's the second rule of foraging you take no more than onethird of that plant material okay we're not ripping anything out of the ground we're not taking anything that we can't have one we're respecting the plant and saying hey do you mind if I take this piece I I need it for X reason and the plan can say yes or no and that looks different for every practitioner you might feel a lightness or a Lifting for a yes and a and a Sulken downward muddy feeling for no but you've got to figure out what that looks like for you as a practitioner I start with the lightness and the heaviness for new students just looking for that so we're only going to take a third of the plant material that's available two you're going to look for some of the out of the way places because one people's yards don't get shot over some plant material that you could find another way to get private property is private property folks yes two if you go to a nice well-maintained park they may spray a lot of chemicals around to make sure that that Park is maintained right um so you have no idea of what's been sprayed how recently what could be an issue so if you go to a field and you meet a sunflower that just happens to be there and that sunflower is either non-communicative or gives you a no and you move to the next Plant and that one says no and that one says no and that one says no there's probably a reason there could be pollution in the in the water table there could they could have been sprayed with something recently they're dying and you don't know it because you weren't there the whole time right so please don't feel don't take it personally if a plant was like sorry dude we're not doing that today because there's there's going to be a reason whether you know it or not it's a good way to put it so you have your your sharp scissors your gloves because there are plants that whose poison is transdermally absorbed or there's Thorns or there's Thorns there's all sort of you're looking for a nettle obviously you're gonna want gloves there is a trick to it by the way those Nettles um erating hairs are all pointing upwards because they're trying to protect from stuff coming from above so if you come from below those nuttles don't sting you can just pick them with your bare hands good tip but we're not we're not killing plants so we have our materials obviously a basket or something to hold whatever you're you're cutting a good field guide Peterson's is the one I usually recommend especially if you're in North America Peterson's has a lot of individual pieces but it's broken up by the shape of the leaves so if you have no idea what you're looking at you can look it up by oh there's there's a pmate leaf and opposite branching you can actually look it up based on the characteristics if you know nothing else about the plant I do know enough to know to be careful of the app like if you're using a plant identifier app I know that you should be very cautious even if using something like that yes the same with books because anybody can publish anything at this point you know self-publishing is a is a is a thriving industry which means that people are publishing AI content as a book like they know what they're talking about AI does not know what it's talking about it's a BL large language model it knows what people put into it so there was a a joke this morning um someone had used a plant identification app and they were looking at at a mushroom to try and figure out what mushroom it was and the because it was AI generated it came back with that's a button mushroom so go ahead and eat that actually I saw your post on that and laughed my ass off because since we're in radio land and cannot see a face that I'm making this mushroom was not a button mushroom it was a destroying angel that will liquefy your intestines that will liquefy your liver they'll be able to pour it out of your body during your a tosy and it takes Days to Die by the time you feel sick it's already too late you are dead I have a mushroom rule if I didn't buy it at the grocery store I ain't going near it that is the next rule of foraging if you're not a th% sure of what it is that you're talking to do not put it in your body right don't do it there's look Alik plants that are poisonous we talk about um The Lost Colony of Rowan Oak who who remembers this from history class colony of Virginia just dis appeared off the face of the Earth and they don't know what happened to it one of my first Mysteries I learned of one they immigrated to a different Island uh because everyone died they ate something they shouldn't have yes do you know what they ate what how many people are familiar with um Queen an's lace oh me like a wild carrot right or something yes there are three plants that have the same exact look the only difference is the little blood drop in the middle of the queen ANS lace so wild carrot looks exactly like our friend the queen we the wild car queen and the third is a Hemlock oh yeah so they dug up they thought they were looking at wild carrots and they dug up batches and batches of Hemlock roasted it and then the whole town ate it oh and they all died there are lookalikes when you're looking at foraging if you don't know how to tell the difference that's why I specifically mentioned Peterson's field guides because again we're not we're not looking at AI generated content but you're making sure that each of the pieces that you're that go across are all falling in line one book I got about 30 years ago is actually it was put out by the military and is a military Field Guide to North American plants and you wouldn't think that a military guide would be good for pagans but so is it really is it really is because it's written for the lowest common denominator somebody who knows nothing right right can pick up this book and say what is this thing that I'm looking at it was kind of built more for if you were forgotten in a forest how are you going to make it until they come get to you and if you have to eat what is around you what was safe and what was not safe you're right it was kind of dumbed down to the average person and not very scientific e you know what I mean yeah because you have to hand it to somebody who's grown up in Manhattan and never seen Angelica plant before and 18 years old and just enlisted in the military yeah yeah AB absolutely so my mil Field Guide has always been kind of a good backbone for me absolutely th% there are a couple simple things that people can get as long as you're careful like you said to make sure that no pesticides you ask permission and you leave them but a couple things that I like to Wild forage are Mullen oh yes I love me some Mullen but you have to be very careful because that grows a lot on the side of the road you can find that on the sides of the roads and those get sprayed a lot with pesticides MH to mention all the emissions from Vehicles all day yeah you can do the Mullen torches yeah I was just gonna say did you make hag tapers out of them yes yep yep yep shell and I are gonna try that we just learned about that last year I think so we're gonna make those and that'll be a lot of fun so I love to forge Mullen that's pretty easy there are lookalike so again you still have to be careful dandelions I love dandelions for all sorts of different edible and magical purposes and little violets you can find little violets in the grass and those are pretty easy Yep they're all in the in the family of pansies violas they're all in the same family so you can eat them you can roll around at them it's great so those are ones that I really like for summertime spring and summertime I feel very I don't know very Cottage core very you know witchy Forest goddess core going out with my basket and my gloves and my little sharp knife and cutting Mullen and dandelion so your next job your next homework that I'm going to give you is in the next couple weeks in your area those Mullins are going to start flowering they're going to shoot up their little hag taper and they're going to start flowering this beautiful brilliant yellow blooms are going to start appearing and so what I want you to do is go and grab some fractionated coconut oil okay in a 10mil bottle okay that's the one that stays liquid at room temperature right yes okay grab your grab your little tweezers if you use them and those individual Mullen flowers put them in your 10 Mill bottle you're going to infuse the Mullen flowers and to make iric oil oo okay MH this is a great way to get rid of those ear infections where the hell were you when my 30-year-old kid was like four right here apparently damn yeah actually she was at Blessed Be and meet me with us right kid was that age I just I just didn't get the earache oil from her that's right so Mullen flowers the little yellow Mullen flowers that come out it's a big tall stock and and it's got these little teeny tiny flowers all up it so I'm going to grab those my little tweezers and I'm going to put them in my fractionated coconut oil now how long do I let them Infuse for leave it forever leave it forever just leave them right in there okay leave them right in there a lot of people they're they're very strict with their I'm gonna make a tincture and I'm gonna let it sit for eight weeks in a cabinet I'm G shake it every day and I'm G strain out the material you don't have to strain out the material you really don't okay if you want to bottle it down that's fine that's that's where we're going you sound like me making my fires cider in the fall yes exactly 1 th% yes make your fires cider do the things but you don't have to strain it you don't have to strain it but if that's your thing that's your thing absolutely you're fine you're not hurting anything I love making and you'll find this in Botanical bruise I love making my own vanilla extract yes oh my gosh yes on Tik Tok they've got a couple companies that sell splits so you can make it super cheap what happens is if the Pod is left on the vine a day too long and isn't harvested right away they can split open and when they split open they can get dried out and people say okay well they're not as glossy and shiny and pretty so we're not going to sell those as the first tier of vanilla beans but being a little bit dried out means that there you get more bang for your buck so people say oh I just put it in vodka that's no no no you're you're not making yourself available to the materials that you have brown Liquors have been aged in barrels so they already have vanillin the the chemical component that gives vanilla its fragrance in the material so a nice whiskey that's been aged in a barrel is going to have those caramel notes already you're already ahead of the curve if you use whiskey instead of vodka to make your your vanilla now you're talking my language I'm there I wonder I wonder if my shitty whiskey will work with that Lea yes yes yes yes find that's what don't waste the good stuff use the shitty Whiskey on your tinctures if you've ever heard of Black Velvet I apologize now but I I just can't help myself um a friend went to a really beautiful um bourbon tour of Kentucky and they they get driven around in a bus and they go to all the different distilleries and places and they brought me back this really super expensive bourbon in a little like one oz bottle super pretty and I'm like oh this is really gorgeous I'm not I I don't drink a lot of whiskey what you make into it what could I do I just put I just crammed a vanilla bean right into that bottle and made it into extract oh yeah that was probably fantastic vanilla yeah now I I am the PSA Queen here it seems like so I do want to just put out there like Leo and I always say we're not doctors we're not MediCal people check with whoever you need to check with before you ingest or whatever any of this stuff and if you up don't blame us exactly so now that we've talked about alcohol and we're wrapping up here a little bit I do have to say I see you have your sacred smoke book and all that and you have alcohol blends for spells when are you going to have a book about my favorite smokable spells I like to mix cannabis and herbs to do spell work and I would love to see what you have to say about that that it comes out on September 2nd yes sacred plants correct sacred plant magic plant mag the the idea of sacred plant magic as the sequel to panical Magic was here's a way to work with plants as embodied Spirits with a yes yes oh my gosh yes one of the one of the friends that we get to meet in the book is cannabis which is very alive the Green Goddess speaks so clearly especially as a growing plant there are there's a whole section on the individual tpin that pop up what they do makinga fan girl right now by the way I knew I couldn't wait for this book now I really can't wait for this book and it's great so people think oh you know the tpin are just something that gets added and it's and it sounds I'm like no no no if it has a smell there's a Benzene ring attached to that chemical component there's going to be scented components in it so I actually link it back to the essential oils and the plants that carry those Tarpin so people understand this is naturally occurring and we're not we're not nobody's messing with your materials no one's messing with your plant allies woman I love you yes out of her skin right now jumping out of her skin the tpes are so important so the beta mercine that you look two to relieve pain is also found in Clove but oil this is how we link all of that stuff back together we want everybody on the same page there's a gummy recipe in there that will knock your socks off okay okay I like that are you gonna be doing are you gonna be doing a workshop on this that's what I need to know always there's always another Workshop yes yes now because this is very this is the workshop that I did at Sacred Space was very much the same thing we talked about the tpin and and different types of cannabis and and how that can you can use that in your spell workor combining it with different herbs to create a literal smokable spell and so I cannot wait for this book this is I love this so bumped that I missed that at Sacred Space so this is fantastic make that whole day well right back to too much good stuff in too little of time frames that's right I don't like having to pick
