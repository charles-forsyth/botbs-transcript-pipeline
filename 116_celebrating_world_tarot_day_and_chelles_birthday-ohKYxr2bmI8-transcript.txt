actually not surprised at all that is coming up the same week as your birthday this episode not only  is it right before World tarot day which is every year on May 25th it is also right before World shell day which is on May 31st world is a huge thing and this year it is the biggest most amazing most wonderful thing my besties birthday comes up the end of this month I'm going to be only numerically so the 31st is Michelle's birthday and the 25th is World tarot day so just kind of be celebrating neither here nor there and we've been celebrating I think the biggest thing that I wanted to point out the folks  people surprised I'm surprised maybe I shouldn't be but I'm surprised a lot of people as I didn't realize that was founded by a person named Den Helder in 2003 and she is a Tarot reader from way back and apparently she got tired about hearing all these negative things about tarot back in the early 2000s episode I saw several people invites and demons and is evil and and is just a path to hell so yeah those ideas are still out there on the highway to hell in a handbasket tarot cards shaking all my decks with me right so then she did an interview for the Americans are Association about this day and she said that she really wanted to celebrate sterile and wanted a whole day tours  and to celebrate quote love for this tool and get over our differences you know seriously if they to get over it really I think I really need to meet an elder because we're on the same wavelength there should be more days in the year so we're with your dad at least there's this one I'm happy to celebrate it you know what the heck made up holidays I'm down so what are some of the things that you can do to celebrate World tarot day then herself has a couple of ideas that were published in an interview that she did with the American terrorists sociation I'll post a link to the article but I give a friend or a complete stranger a tarot reading I don't necessarily know if I recommend weed strain on your mileage may vary but if you do email us let us know how you could also use the tarot as a meditation to lure contemplates your life's purpose but if your regular listeners of the show you should be doing that already anyway you could also write a short story by  find one or more of the tarot cards which is one of the ways that I was taught to learn the meanings of the cards you could also wear something special symbolic jewelry a design drawing on your skin excetra to pay homage to a court car or one of the suits you could research and learn at least one new facts about the history of the tarot go back and listen to you are episode about Pixie Pamela Colman Smith if you haven't already filled out for you and of course shells favorite suggestion buy a new Tarot deck or trade one with the best see oh my God I have a great idea and a celebration of world tarot de I should get a new deck yes yes you should I think I should do actually I'm going to be on the hunt for a new deck there's been a couple of been looking at on Kickstarter so maybe I'll grab those as a special treat I have gone Against the Grain I don't know who I am anymore you and I personally have talked about this for years here with our folks in the eye  switch talked about it pretty much from the start I am a creature of habit and then I had some strange Epiphany and fell back into the rider Waite Smith deck which I vowed never to do and somehow and I have now ventured out into a couple other Ducks I think I have actively used more decks in the last year or two then I have been 30 years I'm almost surprised myself with the amount of amazing artists and Decks that are coming out I'm not surprised because one of your big drawers you've always said has been the artwork I admit if I see a gorgeous deck I can't resist I like the symbology more so even a pretty deck sometimes if the symbology is just not hitting for me then it's just not a deck for me  but there's so many out there to choose from it it makes it kind of difficult and kind of fun and also I think I have found if I'm in one load I want to play with one deck and if I'm in a different mode I want to play with a different deck and that was never the case before so I feel like almost like the tarot decks and actually using is expanding not what I own but when I'm physically using I found that to be the case as well when I first started reading it was a deck that my grandmother had given to me I think she got it at a thrift store it was tarot the ancient prophecy which is basically a rider Waite clone and it was by Dynamic design back in the 70s and is very pretty it's a very pretty rider-waite-smith clone B Pixies are through the whole thing and I love that sack then I started using one that was a little more stylized call The Lawn to Tara when I started reading water remember that  they look like elves like tall skinny elves kind of that was my reading for other people that I do own it but I can never connect with it but every time I looked at it and it works wonderfully for me to read for other people but when I read for myself or if I read for you or other people that were close to me I would go back to my original rider-waite-smith clone Old Faithful yeah and I still have the original back I love that back like you I go through moods depending on my mood or why I'm reading or who I'm reading for there's Decks that I'll use and I I keep finding that I'm returning time and time again to the witches wisdom tarot by Phyllis Quran with the artwork by Danielle Barlow so much to it and I I love that it's a little different I also love an independent deck this is one bite Aerotek estudios called The Dark Mansion tarot and it's just it's just  beautiful the artwork on it is just very different it's really it's kind of dark but it's got a lot of symbology in it and I like cars that have a lot of images that have a lot of colors that have all those symbols in it you know but I've always felt like you have kind of and correct me if I'm wrong I feel like you've kind of always been more attracted to like I want to say the darker. Like the law and yeah I know it's true it's true but with me really is kind of mood dependent but I always kind of settled back to that Celtic luck and I think that's what drew me to the Allen Cannon Reed witches tarot very Celtic but right now I cannot get enough of la la nina Simone's doc like I just can't or you know if you if you came to me and was like you know how shallow can you post some cards  totally 110% but I don't think this is a deck I would want to use for public readings if I'm reading for people professionally. There's not going to be the deck eyeball right you know that's a really really good point when I'm calling cards for my nightly tarot polite end of all the witches wisdom and I've used it for that purpose so much that the SEC has become very personal to me and I only rarely use it to read for someone else and usually for another person I'll grab a Smith weight back or the lawn Doterra because those are Decks that I associate with reading for other people but using cards and different decks for different purposes is really really smart because it can really help you get in touch with different parts of your brain and different parts of your magical self funny story that we didn't talk about prior that that you just sparked in my brain I have over the years done a couple reading  in relation to each of my children and as you are well aware when they were significantly younger I had bought them each a deck and I have the same decks my collection so if I were to do something for my son if I was trying to either do a reading for him or about him my go-to would be the gummy bear tarot by the way if you have not seen the gummy bear tarot you as hell but that was my son was deck so if I was going to do a reading relating to my son that almost kind of mentally makes that connection because I know that that was his deck where is my daughter had a Alice in Wonderland tarot so if I was doing something relating to her I would be more apt to use my Alice in Wonderland tarot is almost like a connection to her you know what I'm saying with you I have a line to Terrell if you were like a shell could you play me some card so I can get that sticker  because when I see that Londa Tarot deck I think of you so it would almost be like Layla energy because it's the lawn to deck you know but I mean for all three of you obviously I would still use the same deck I use for myself but I do feel like almost like there's a small deck in the public deck you get different connections with them and whether that connection is energetic or interpretive because easier to interpret for other people and some decks the imagery is easier to speak to yourself better you know you might get more understanding internally than you'd really be able to explain to another person I guess I'm a little more weird about it and you know how I am with analogies and I guess that's the best analogy I can think of is I will share my food with you but I don't necessarily want you eating off my plate sure exactly summer super personal feel like like especially you know there's tarot of the cosmic seed  I feel like the connection I have built with that deck is between me and that deck that isn't what other people's energy to be penetrating Smith back I feel like that is more you know how valid Terry and it's for it's not as private and personal in is a different relationship if you know what I mean absolutely and you can build that with your text by using them exclusively for a certain purpose so maybe you have a deck that you only use when you're doing your tarot card pulse or you're doing it for daily journaling or for meditation purposes and you can really build a relationship with that deck where it feels weird to use it for something else or like you do it's so personal to you that it would almost feel like showing a stranger your underwear and also subliminal  trying to get you to buy multiple decks I mean really this is how I ended up with over 200 Ducks what suits me fancy right now what would I like to go read in the public what deck will speak to me privately like I just can't get enough I want more whether you're someone who uses them for divination or not you can use tarot cards for all sorts of different reasons I think they're an excellent way to get in touch with your subconscious they can really help you move past problems you can use them for self-reflection you can work with them if you're magically stuck you can cast spells with tarot cards there an excellent companion for shadow work using tarot cards in your magical practice can take so many different shapes and forms and sometimes using different sex for those purposes can be the news tarot is a component of a ritual absolutely you know the Fool's Journey though the meditation that we just recently put out that type of work you can do by Paul Anka  journaling with that you don't have to use the cards just to Divine the future or to answer questions I you can use them for all sorts of different magical purposes meditation ritual spell work especially but you know that kind of circles back to what I what I was saying about I have a medic and then I have a like a quote on quote public deck because if I'm doing spells and rituals in in meditative work with that dock I don't want other people's energy a part of that you know what I mean and I think any professional tarot reader would say they were private. Going to public dock quickest I'd kind of reminded me of a couple different things if you do use tarot cards to read for other people not only sometimes is it is it good to have a personal back and a public Zack it's also a good idea to protect your deck from outside energies when you don't want it to be picking up energy because of your using exact that's attuned to pick up someone's energy  when you do readings for them it's a good idea to keep that deck covered when you don't want it to be picking up someone else's energy when I was first given my back I was told that I was supposed to keep it in probably soaked but some type of natural fabric I'm not quite so strict about it now but I still like to keep them in a bag or a box or something like that to protect them from the outside energy that was something that you kind of put off on me about 30 years ago that stuck with me a if I'm using a deck regularly I do not keep it in the Box I actually have shout out plug to Laura Tempest eckroth I use the you know the silk bags or you would taught me back in the day before there were bags that fit tarot decks my grandmother gave me a bunch of her old 1970s era silk scarves and wrap them up if you're not  play some rap them up if they're in a box I'm not regularly using them if they are in a bag or silk they are in the in use pile and I do feel that that helps to keep them separate to keep them special it helps to keep their energy protected I also like to shuffle the deck and cleanse it clear it clear the energy before I headed to a client or before I do a reading for someone else you know I'll clear that through and do the energy put them all in one direction maybe one thing I've always done when I've read publicly in between clients I reorder the cards I know you said that you know your right side of up and do your thing I literally reorder them but I also do it like I almost like I don't want to say it like a cleansing ritual but after publicly reading as I kind of do a cleansing ritual and cleanse my back absolute lie and you know you kind of get into a rhythm of it where you do a reading for someone you shuffle through and you just know your  can can clear clear clear but you should do that order them go through a order put them all straight up sometimes in my tarot bags I keep a a little a clear quartz crystal as well that's a great idea I need to ground them a little a little bit of hematite something like that you could you're good so using Terrell in your practice for divination for spell work for meditation fabulous we also really like to do three card poles or one card polls FPL online people tend to do three card polls well I'm here to tell you tarot spreads are where is that three cars is going to give you a surface answer you've got past present future. That's about it I feel like I feel like a three-card spread and you know circling back to  stay awake I'm aging myself here but I feel like a three-card spread is like back in in the 80s when you would be wherever it is school function your friend's house and you can call your mom collect and I'd like to state your name and you be like  you know the collect all things feel like the 3 card spread is like a collect call yeah you're trying to fit a lot of information into a very short space right right right and if you want an in-depth answer you need to spread 3 Cars is great for journaling it's great for kind of giving you a general idea is great for like yes no type questions and things like that but if you're looking for answers you're only getting a part of the story with three cards and so we really like friends or more is better yours last year I had 49 cards in it for your birthday spread while I was 49 I needed a 49 spread that's right I was not doing a 50 spread this year by the way but we do want to talk about a little bit about how to create a terrorist Brad why in the tarot spread good and in my opinion and a present really great to get clarity to go  a lot of information because each of the positions in that spread is like a it's like a part of the story if you have a story like you to read a book the positions of the cards mean something and that helps you to tell the story and so that's how you can create spreads if you can't find one that fits what you need if you know the symbology of the positions not only will that help you read spreads better but it will help you to create spreads if you need to make one for your specific situation actually been creating spreads for a very long time and how it really started was I don't know who created it no disrespect intended but I am so over that Celtic cross spread and I was over at 20 years ago you know every deck you bought every book you read kind of focused on that Celtic cross you know and I felt like it wasn't  really soothing how I wanted to read you know what I mean I was just like well I can just say if I put a card here it symbolizes supposed to put a card here and then Shuffle It Up and lay him down and see what cards ended up in the spots I said that has each position mean something symbology it makes a lot of sense so cards to the left typically are things in the past cards in the center tend to be present for the right time to be the Future car is on the bottom is very often things that are foundational it can be earthy it can be physical Hearts above you are usually dreams and goals they can be ideas and thoughts again it kind of makes sense you know Autumn is your feet and the Earth dreams where you're at where you been where you're going cards that cross you or cards that are in the way again like for like their obstacles  things that are literally Crossing you or crossing your path or blocking your goal so these positions tell a generic story these positions give you more information when you put Cards into them my very first spread that I created was also because I was working with the Celtic cross all the time and I was finding that it just wasn't giving me everything that I needed it has its uses yeah it's in every single book because it has everything it set up with a framework to be able to answer any question that you have the positions in the Celtic cross give you the outline of your answer and the cards that you pull basically fill in the details as good as the Celtic cross is though there's no such thing as one generic outline that will work the answer every question it doesn't always suit the need of why you write the very first spread of it I created was an add-on to the Celtic cross because as I was doing  readings are people I found very often I needed to draw more cards to get the rest of the information and so I created a half moon spread that I did in addition to the Celtic cross with every single reading that I did and basically that was six cards in a an upside-down Crescent to Rising one of the top two falling and then one at the bottom underneath the Crescent know I found especially doing public readings that the Celtic cross didn't fit the message if that makes sense you know when you're when you're reading professionally and you start laying down cards I do for you and I there is also kind of that that little voice that you're talking to you know that psychic thing that Medium thing you know you're hearing part of the message as I'm seeing it in the cards for me it's channeling straight into the back of my head and sometimes that message doesn't fit the cat  Motocross and I found myself back in the day I died on me back the cards after shuffling and right when I would start that spread I'm like no no no no no and I would just start laying them down maybe not knowing us I don't want to send making a spread upon the fly but kind of almost like Spirit saying no I want these cards to be like this and I want the story to be told in this manner and that was really kind of what started me with creating my own spreads the message and that's exactly how it started for me was I needed a little extra out of that Celtic cross and the other thing I wanted to add is sometimes I use the significator sometimes I don't it's almost like the cards will tell me if I need to put a significator card down whether it be for me or someone else I'm reading for and sometimes it just doesn't  when I first learn tarot I was told you had to you had to pick a significator and it had to be one of the Court cards and it didn't always fit it didn't always fit so I stopped using it and it just didn't really work the only time I use significant others is if I want to see if I have a certain intent there are times when I'm like allright I have this specific intent for this reading so I want to put this card down as a significant her to make sure that this reading starts where I wanted to but other than that I almost never use a significator not anymore I used to all the time I do randomly here and there I feel like the decal tell me if I need to you read very psychically there's a lot of different ways to read tarot you can read tarot straight from the book or from memorization absolutely fine by the way yes and use that as a way to get in touch with  subconscious as a way to work with yourself as a way to Grass ideas and thoughts that you might not have otherwise come in contact with it's also just an excellent way to do Journal work you and your journaling good for you you can also read Terrell very psychically very organically you don't even need to memorize the cars you can just pull the cards out and whatever psychic impression comes to you with every feeling say that write it down work with that are you going to get it wrong sometimes yes are you going to get it right sometimes yes but the idea is to work with that thought slow to work with those ideas to work with that magic that energy as it's coming and you'll get better and better at it so you can go from Strictly rules and strictly what the cards mean all the way to using your own psychic ability to go wherever it wants to go and everything in between and you know that kind of  circles back to my my love of different decks because I mean in and I know you know this sometimes it's almost like with with certain decks the images like jump off the card and start talking to you and Mike meaning a side you know like I know these meetings like the back of my hand but sometimes the cards tell me what they mean not what tradition tells me they mean and I think that's perfectly valid I think that's fabulous and that's really hard to do well to be honest like everything in my opinion is practice makes perfect. Yeah and and doing your tarot Paul's daily and working with Taro and working with your own intuition is really going to help you to do that I didn't want to get too far away from tarot spread so because you have come up with a Tarot spread in honor of world tarot day so before we get too far away from talking about tarot spreads why don't you tell us a little bit about this  spread that you created World Tarot deck I feel like last year I kind of made it all about me and did my birthday age spread and suggested the folks that on their birthday do a spread that was in relation to their age I guess that they were turning to kind of give you a a look at the year ahead and if you go back on our Instagram and Facebook you can see a picture and kind of some details on that spread from last year but this year I wanted to do something a little different that wasn't focused on a birthdays another year and this year I went a little different and I don't know if it was the warm streak we had in here in the Northeast for a few weeks which by the way is gone or if it was a Dandy lions are everywhere but I was sitting outside one day and all the sudden I got an idea for a spread and the name of the spread came before the actual  body of it and in such and its flowers of May where will I Bloom and me personally I am trying to make some changes in my life and in trying to kind of switch gears and going a different direction and that was kind of my thought you know all these flowers are blooming where am I blue making you know being a May baby you know Maggie is kind of like my I feel like everybody has their own like reset month of the year and in a lot of people try to do January oh it's a new year reset for me my reset has always been like my birthday and so I wanted to kind of do a reading that is like okay so I know change is coming I want change to come where do I buy blue Michel the beautiful shell flower that I am where it where is shell blooming and that was kind of the idea of the spread came when you are looking  either validate choices or validate directions at your look at at you need to maybe have some insight on where will you bloom and now you've shown me the outline and I admit that when the first picture you showed me I thought was entirely a different thing but only because I outlined it with a marker  yeah and I am a 12 year old boy at heart but I love this friend and it and all the positions follow exactly what we were just talking about with you no positions have meaning I really love this Fred for that so let's go over your spread a little bit and if you're listening don't worry we will definitely put this up on our social media if you'll be able to follow along there obviously play flowers of May where do I Bloom I wanted the spread to kind of look like a flower and you know my artistic ability is lacking best so my sweet darling love and I always got to bring in some big guns for help with design I asked him how can I lay out time cards I don't know what my thing is I like anywhere between 8 and 10 cards Ecards just isn't enough I like 5 to 10 really  404 Calle 18 cards in it spreads is a lot of cards so I was like you know hey I'm trying to come up with this spread and I wanted to kind of look like a flower and actually in the end it actually came out looking like a dandelion even though you and your 12 year old boys self thought it was something different when it was outlined oh yeah show people the picture you first sent me and see what they say will put it up on the Facebook I will twist her arm and make her get her opinion first so I started off with the stem if you are a flower and you are going to bloom you have to start out with that bass that stem that foundation and so I made a little stem and then a little flower of cards above it I like to start this particular spread at the bottom at your foundation so the very bottom card which would be card  one is the route the foundation followed by the next card which would be what holds us up what motivates us followed by what sustains you and those are kind of the roots of of you and what you embody in your change in your growth and how you're going to move forward it all comes down to the stem in The Roots what told me together and in this picture those three cards go straight up just like the stem of a flower and the stem of a flower has the roots on one end it sustains the plant it holds it up and it provides nourishment so all of those things shall captured in those three positions and that's exactly what the stem of a flower does the top portion so I basically have three cards is my stem the top portion the flower part I have 7 cards and I kind of did this part like and  in a traditional left to right manner so starting on the far on the far left I have my first card what's holding me back because you know I'm a traditionalist even though I don't like rules and don't like to admit it but I do kind of get that what is on the left is where you've been and what got you there and what is on the right is kind of where you're headed so I'm on the left I have started with what is holding you back you know what is what is your obstacles and then that is followed by what steps do you need to take to take action sometimes you need a card to kick in the ass you know and that is followed by your truth sometimes that's a difficult pill to swallow and sometimes it's hard for you to come to grips with your own truth and you need the cards to tell you and be like you know what it is admitted and again those three cards like you said are on the left side so what's holding you back  very often things from your past things that you think about things that have held you back before so that's the very first card in the kind of left past type of position and then what steps do you need to take planning sometimes it in your Society of what to do next holds people back tonight that's why I felt that that was a good card to have in that left position because you know what steps do you need to take you need to get over the hump and do it man right and planning has to happen first planning is one of the first things that you need to do so perfect and then the next card is your truth and your truth again to something also that you have carried with you for a while this is not something that you're just thinking of now your truth is something that has been part of you for a bit from your past so having that in that position also makes sense and it having the is the 3rd card over made sense to me because you know what your truth is not only  yeah your your foundation was built on your truth but your truth is all of it also what carries you forward and kind of yes I love that I love that exactly symbology of position so that fourth card you know where do you where do you dry your energy from that is getting you to the the next phase that's almost like that bridge between where you were and where you going oh I like that I like that you know what I mean what are you feeding yourself that is getting you from point A to point B and not only is that card directly in the middle of the three past and the future cards it's also directly on top of the stem so that fits it almost looks like the top of the stuff the plant so that the energy so we can symbology of position it perfectly fits no starting to continue over to the right my next card what are you drawing into your life  sometimes you want all these wonderful things but you keep consuming your life with bullshit you know what I mean I mean bulshit and I'm bitching about it you know what I mean we do tend to create a lot of our reality not all of it but a lot of it is created by our own desires and certainly our own actions and thoughts so what are you drawing into your life what are you bringing in and what's going to happen in the future for you what are you creating for the future now my next card what to nurture and I think this is important because especially with people like you and I were the last people that are going to nurture ourselves you know where everybody else our kids are our partners our family are friends and we we we don't think of us and sometimes you need to take a step back what do I need to do to get myself from point A to point  what do I need to nurture what do I need to cultivate you know what I mean and I think you start you know you get over to that right side what do you drive again and what are you nurturing are you drawing and bullshittin then nurturing bulshit are you drawing in positivity and in motivation and all those good things so that you are nurturing all those good things energy flows were our direction or attention goes exactly positive positive understand that you don't have control over everything but what are you giving your energy to what are you nurturing when you talk about energy I think that sometimes you can control more than you think by the energy you put into it and then the last card also fits with that thing's coming to you for in the future is also kind of circles back to to what I made  spread what is about to Blossom for you what is your flower that's getting ready to blow all of those are future positions and they fit perfectly but now I'm going to modify it a little cuz you do this to me all the time and I told you what are the things that I saw when you first showed this to me and we talked about it being a dandelion was I also see it that art of the flower can be the dandelion head either in full yellow blue or it also looks to me like the dandelion puff balls so I added one last card to this spread above the whole thing on the right hand side just off-center to be that one dandelion seed puff that's blowing in the wind and that's your wish what is your wish for the future what wish is about to come true for you or what is your deepest wish that you hope to come true and that's what that card symbolizes so that's the  7th optional position  I love this Fred and I love the each position has such beautiful symbology that works together to tell the whole story your idea was where will I Bloom you needed to know you know where am I going to grow shifts Rocky here and I need to be the fucking gorgeous flower that I am where am I going to be home so you created a spread that looks like a flower to match that symbology to match that energy doesn't need to look like a flower yes absolutely fucking time because that's part of the story that's part of the energy when you look at the spread and you see the flower you think blooming you think growing and that's what this is about and so again not just the symbology of each position but the whole or arching spread has meaning and lens that meaning to the reading and that's why it's very important to have the first card you lay down be the bottom of that stuff because  you're starting with your foundation what what is and why is your foundation that is getting you to the point that you are to get you to the point where you want to be and you have to grow from that base so this is perfect and this is a beautiful example of why tarot spreads are kind of important and why the positions have meaning and this is also an example of why the Celtic cross spread wouldn't work for me for this particular thing being able to create something and know why you're putting things in each position makes sense yes you could just lay cards out yes you can just do three cars or you can just start pulling cars and telling a story with them absolutely works perfectly valid but having this Foundation the spaces can make it a little easier for some people and can really give you such Rich Nuance to your readings know I really think it would be funny and I think I'm actually going to do this  first of all I'm just going to interject make a left turn here we all know I love left turns and I have been remiss on social media we understand life has been life and we're getting there but I I really want to post this picture that Layla can see it right now but it's like I'm a piece of paper I had Andrew Little Boxes each random drawing out the meanings but I do actually want to post this because I want to give people an idea of you can just come up with a spread on a napkin paper and if it works for you rock it and that's really the important thing is you have to try these and okay I'm going to take a slight left turn as well do you remember when I made you watch Agatha all along I do and I wish that I watched the whole thing but I was having issues with Disney plus different Missouri  find each position and what they said each position meant and tried it and it didn't work that's why I wasn't your spread it's not that it wasn't my spread I think it was more that whoever put the spread together didn't exactly follow position symbology so it it just didn't work like there was a card Crossing you but that was supposed to be the outcome and it felt off yeah that the last card was crossing the main card and that was supposed to be the outcome but why would your outcome be Crossing you or against you you're already in Gloom direction right from the get-go with just the spread outline exactly so when I tried the spread it just felt off so I worked with it believe he'll and JoJo actually work with it as well love how and by the way how am I worked with it a little bit I showed a version she showed up version and we kind of made it work but if those symbols if those positions don't  please fetch Yer symbology or symbolism doesn't make sense to you than the spread won't work so you have to try them after you create this you have to kind of try it and see if it flows make it a try it I got a little project for y'all I would be so thrilled if some of you all took a little bit of time in your tear ducts and just organic create a spread but what would thrill me more than anything in life is if you share that with Leila and I because you got it in you folks you just you just need to realize that you two can create your own tarot spread that suit your need my wonderful amazing besties
