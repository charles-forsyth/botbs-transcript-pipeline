welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and on this episode we'll be talking about a witch's tools what are they where did they come from and how do you use them I'm shell and tonight we're going to talk about something like the coolest things to have that you don't necessarily need is that a good way to put it oh I guess so but I do think that there are times when you might definitely need them yeah but there are times where it's not necessarily necessary and we'll get into that that's right we're going to cover all of the bases what are witch's tools where do they come from and why or why not would you use them before we go too far the first thing I want to say is that we're mostly going to be covering Western European pretty much Wiccan based I was going to say probably this is going to be more relevant to a Wiccan listener well that's where the use of them in modern witchcraft became popular but they're not just for wiccans tools tools are definitely Universal through through a lot of different paths don't get us wrong that's right but we're going to come at it from the angle where we learned it how we came up with buckland's big book with our very heavily Wick and influenced background in rituals and and magical spaces so that's what we're going to come at this particular episode but we will have episodes in the future where we go over lots of different tools from different places but you'll be very familiar with these because they're they're in the magical lexicon this is what you see you go on Tik Tok or when you go on YouTube or even when you walk into a occult metaphysical or magical orientated shop um these are going to be the things that are going to be front and center exactly so what we're talking about are things like a wand or an aame or an athame depending on how you want to pronounce that you know I was actually thinking that we should discuss this for a minute what is with the different ways to say that I always called it an athame but now I'm hearing a lot more people calling it a aame and I'm like why are we changing the pronunciation or have I been wrong for 30 years you know that's a darn good question and I think it comes down to a lot of like sin or Sam Hayne and I try not to shame anybody that says Sam Hayne because odds are they've never heard it pronounced and they've just read it right and I think that that's the same thing with an athame I mean ultimately however you say it that's nothing is wrong so we were taught aame from what I understand from my Garian connections is that supposedly Gardener invented it I don't know if that's true or not the word itself and he said aa aa so all of us are wrong is what we're all wrong doesn't really matter how you say it not really it's a ritual blade it's a double bladed I was going to say if you're not familiar it is a double A double-sided blade definitely not necessarily the sharpest out there but a double-sided blade that's right so we talked about Garder and Garian wiah creating a lot of these tools or really creating the need for a lot of these tools and where a lot of them come from is older magical Traditions Gerald Gardner Alistar Crowley Dorian Valiente all of those guys they Incorporated the use of magical tools from these other systems like the Golden Dawn they got them from the manuscript of the key of Solomon from the Jewish Mystic tradition of the cabala from Muslim Mystics ceremonial magic and from so many different places I mean these guys were all spiritualists they were searching for magic and magicians and witches everywhere so they Incorporated these tools into the witchy belief system that they were creating and they took their traditional meanings and uses and kept what worked and they also added their own associations to make everything work in the system that they're creating that's kind of how I think of it is they're kind of assigned like a a quarter an element however you want to Define that so I look at is I look at an a as like a fire South kind of tool so if I have it placed on my altar that's something I'm going to have kind of in the southern portion of my altar to represent South these tools come from these different magical traditions and Gardner put them onto his earth-based religion his witch his form of Witchcraft and then that kind of got minated throughout the United States mixed with a lot of folk magic mixed with West African traditions where we get the JBE the drum and and lots of different other cultures to form these tools so let's give a quick little list let's list off a couple of the main tools that in our experience are in regular use by a lot of witches and magical practitioners today okay so we got an aame which we can briefly touch on that whole thing that we we talked about with the tarot cards with with swords and Wands chalice cauldron a staff or a Stang yeah a bowline although I almost never see that a bowline is a sickle-shaped knife it looks like a moon a crescent moon with a white handle and it's traditionally used for work basically harvesting herbs and things like that and I've heard of one never seen one I mean I have seen them before they're beautiful uh usually kind of expensive but I've almost never seen one in actual use I think they're hard to come by yeah they're pretty and they're cool they're not a very practical knife but they're kind of cool looking candles obviously yes definitely candles are a very common item that witches used in spellwork they're not technically one of the traditional tools of Witchcraft but they're used for pretty much everything in spellcraft and ritual for which is today yeah I have drums herbs crystals jars candles things like that a broom and an alter cloth incense seashells okay now we're kind of repeating things basically what a tool does is it helps you to direct your energy it helps you to have a physical representation of different types of energy on your altar in order to help you in your spellwork or your ritual they're kind of you know I kind of look at it as each quarter Pentacle that's what I was forgetting because each quarter and and then deity kind of has its its quote unquote tool so you know we talked about aame in the South for fire The Cauldron would be West for water the wand or the staff would be East for air um I personally generally use like a stone or something of that nature is my my North tool and the traditional tool for North would be the pentacle right or I was going to say or the pentacle and then for deity honestly I that's where I kind of use a candle as a tool I also like to have representations of deity on my altar as well and you could have a representation like a a statue for deity true true but shell likes to use a candle for deity you can use traditional god and goddess colors if you want to or colors associated with that particular deity let me tell you why because not at every point in my life have I been able to afford a beautiful gorgeous fancy statue and I know that those aren't always easily obtainable for people so back in the day I just it was a candle that's what I had that's what I had to use you know what I'm saying I mean obviously now I have some statue and it's gorgeous but that's not always something that people have on the ready whereas a candle is something you have on the ready generally and and that gets into a topic I I definitely wanted to touch on with tools is that they are a physical representation of an idea and that's a big part of magic is you really want to get your subconscious your magical brain you know that part of your brain when you're when you're in a magical state or when you're meditating when you can really affect change having a physical representation can help that energy get more easily into your subconscious any representation that you can associate Works therefore a gold candle will represent the God and a silver candle will represent the goddess very easily so it's like cooking there's substitutions yes oh I love that I love that yeah like for me my my the things I like to use to represent the god are usually uh antlers I love to use antlers because I I do love to work with konos and on the flip side of that I have used a butter knife as an athe before just saying exactly exactly yeah do so things for a God would be anything that you would associate with the god any phallic symbols you could use a wand or an aame to represent the God and in some traditions they do there are specific rituals where that's done for the goddess you would do things that would represent the womb or the vulva chalice shells uh the triple Moon that's because wiah and a lot of earth-based practices really have a lot of themes revolving around procreation the act of creating life and that more often than not requires male and female forces and energies to create and to reproduce life but that's just one perspective there are a multitude of ways to view deity that don't involve genders or reproduction at all like everything your mileage may vary and you need to do what works for you there has been times where um I have actually printed out pictures of deity and used that on my altar to represent deity kind of have that that visual picture of whoever say it was Kali you know take a picture of Kali and have that on the altar to to represent deity so there's a lot of different things you can do with that the idea is to to have these items to honor the elements to honor what they're representing and also to assist you in your spellwork they again are a tangible real world World representation of that energy that you're trying to call up so that makes it a lot easier for you to do it like if you're trying to call up fire to call up that energy you can think about it you can hold an AEM you can think about it being forged and fire and that's a great way to call that energy but how much easier is it if you're looking at the flame of a candle or at a bonfire while you're trying to do that right and you know and I think kind of of a chalice is like you know when you are when you are drinking from The Chalice you're kind of taking things in you know you're you're you're being receptive I guess is probably a good word I guess the best way I look at it is it represents you you not necessarily consuming things literally but kind of more figuratively consuming yeah exactly by doing the literal act you can also use the the figurative energy the the magical energy also comes with it so say you're doing a spell where you want to fill yourself with more confidence you could whip up some tea you know a tea spell and put it in your chalice and then literally fill yourself with confidence exactly you are performing an act in the physical world with the physical representations of energy to affect that same type of change in the magical realm it's like a Mind Body magical connection it's a loop and and that's what you're trying to trigger with using these tools and there's also the honoring of the element part that comes into it too and you know I've also been in situations where the wand has been used to represent deity and therefore um incense and an incense burner was used on the altar as a tool to represent air um so if you do you know if you are using something uh like the wand for deity you can kind of interchange different things to represent the element that it's that is also associated with so back when we were involved in the large Pagan community and with our own coven whenever we would set up a ritual most of the time I mean we did stray from this formula but there was kind of a formula that we followed yeah yeah alter setup so to say yeah exactly in the East we would have objects that represented air incense feathers flowers wands anything that represented air yellow things and if we did uh if we did quarter candles we'd have a yellow candle there you know in the South it would be Aames it would be fire it would be candles burning red candles burning yep and in the west we would have your cauldrons chales any type of liquid we would have blue things seashells representations of water and then in the north um we've we've had everything from rocks to dirt to pine cones kind of those earthy things the first fruits from people's Gardens um baked goods like breads um things of that nature earthy things earthy things and then in the center we would have a small bonfire but we would also have a deity altar where we would have representations of the God and the goddess the Lord and Lady for us those represent ideas there's a full spectrum between all of that and they represent the whole thing you might say the goddess but she's represents the inner energy taking things in she's receptive she's Hearth and Home she's creation she's destruction so doesn't necessarily have to be a goddess and the same thing with the god it could just be deity that's right could just be deity but then you you put your representations there whatever deity means to you whatever spirit means to you and again we've done you know candles purple candles we've done statuary we've done lots of things we all sorts of stuff yeah and then there's always we've talked about this in a previous episode but with the whole Wick and Roots there have been times particularly for belane when the Great wri which is a a Wiccan tradition it's basically the coming together of the God and the goddess that's right and it's uh you take your aame and chalice and your high priest and high priestess would be hold one would hold the aame one would hold the chalice and there would be a whole back and forth that they would say um let it be known that no man is greater than a woman for what one lacks the other shall provide yeah something like that there's a few things in between that whole thing but then you put the the AEM into The Chalice to represent both sex and like you said the union of male and female so there's all sorts of stuff that you can do with those we've even had a vase of flowers represent deity it's it's whatever it means to you and you know we're kind of talking about traditional tools here but you know whatever those those elements mean to you and what you're going to associate them with can be what your tool is for that yeah it really comes down to a mindset and for me having magical tools especially ones that have been used repeatedly in ceremony and ritual a lot like the the traditional tools that we used all the time in the Pagan community that we came up in using them repeatedly helps to create an atmosphere of vibe and really helps to get me into the flow state of magic there is a time and place for everything if you are doing you know ceremonial High magic absolutely all the bells and whistles everything in its exact proper location but on the flip side if you need to just throw something together that's good enough too oh absolutely I mean I have several altars throughout my house and they're I mean some are more formal than others with where things are placed sometimes things are just kind of placed in an Elven chest sort of fashion I I I kind of have an interesting altar set up it's like any surface that's available pretty much yeah becomes an altar either that or I pile books on it it's one of the two yeah yeah you know we that's the thing is like Alters almost turn into a collection of things you know I've got I've got Stones I've got pine cones I've got wheat I've I've got candles like I've got lots of things and the cool thing about that is those are all things that are important to you they have meaning they have magic they have weight to them so when you grab that pine cone you remember where you got it that says Forest to you that says Earth that you know that says God and so that makes it's so easy for you to call that kind of energy and honestly having kind of like a quote unquote tool collection different things you know I might pull if I'm looking for for assistance with say love and happiness I might pull a rose quartz whereas if I'm looking for something a little more finan eventually based I might pull a green adventuring you know so I it gives me the opportunity to pick and choose what I need for what purpose and intention yes you pick a rose quartz because we know what the qualities of rose quartz are we've been told right people have been using it for this for a very long time that kind of gets into the idea that it has these qualities because people have been saying it has them and working with it in that way for a very long time but even though history can kind of give a certain confidence you don't have to take their word for it you can spend your own time with tools and use that time and then find out for yourself how they work best for you what categories they belong in for you I remember with a witch from Connecticut that I had the great luck to train with and she did this thing where she called it a stoning and it wasn't the weed kind which I was kind of expecting but she handed me different crystals that I wasn't I was I was just a little witchling at the time I didn't know all these crystals she had this huge collection so she had me sit down get into an alpha State no weed involved sadly and she would hand me different Stones different crystals and ask me how I felt about it and she kind of write them down each one and then afterwards we went over what like the actual meaning of the stone was compared how right were you they were all pretty close some of them were you know kind of tangental connections there some of them had different meanings for me but and that's because we have these ideas of what colors mean you know you gr up with the idea that green means money and pink means love yeah right right so we have these ideas these archetypes in our head that's part of what can make some of these tools so powerful the weight we give it okay I got one more story this one is to show you how easily we can fool our brains into giving something importance and energy okay when I was training to be a hypnotherapist one of the things that you learn as a hypnotist is presentation is everything right you got to right brain hacking is a big part of what we do we were taught whenever you go to give a presentation or if you're giving some type of Workshop always have someone else introduce you before you go on to speak why because that automatically makes you an expert in the minds of the audience only important people get introduced introduced exactly nice before you even walk out on stage you have gained Authority and presence without even trying and that's because our brains are trained to think in certain ways right and you can hack into that by using greenstones for money you know and that's why we like tools because tools can help us get there that's kind of actually the point of tools is is that physical and visual representation you know if you are if you are looking to project something out you know you're going to want to use your wand or your aeme you know just like Harry Potter and kind of project that out in a way you know even the shape of a wand looks like it should be projecting energy out right right but then again you know if you're if you're using a candle that might be kind of more of of a burning Spirit you know a representation of passion a representation of action of things being handled and taken care of so you know that's why I also think that sometimes especially when we get into the you know we talked with a with the tarot about the swords and the wands debate you could say the same thing with with the alter tools some people think that the aim is air and that the wand is fire if that's what it means to you then great that's just as great as it meaning the opposite to me personally I very much feel that objects have their own power I think that herbs crystals Earth everything I think everything that's the whole animism thing yeah exactly everything has its own energy and power and when I ask them to assist me they lend their power to that and so I do very strongly believe believe that that can help for that to happen I do feel that you need to create a bond with your tools you need you need to spend time um exchanging energy with your tools and working with your tools you don't just buy it from the store and then just have this bond with it to do your bidding so to say so there is an element of connecting with your tools whether it's the herbs or the Aames or the wands or the chales like you have to create that bond to be able to work together yes and that's why personal items that mean something to you are so cool because you already have that Bond you don't have to do any work it's it's already there or something that you have created that Bond's already there sometimes you can see that really gorgeous piece of Steel in the magic shop and feel a connection but other times you have to create it right right and you know like going back to this Rose quarts I bought this particular one that I'm showing you because it was flat and I thought it was pretty interesting that it was flat so I have it here kind of next to my my working space and there's been times where I just sit here and rub it I don't know why I rub it because it's flat and it's cool to do that with that's kind of now I can call on the stone and ask it For assistance with things because we've exchanged energy we've spent time together you know what I'm saying I do and honestly okay this is going to sound a little weird but rubbing things is a good way to put your energy on it but let me throw a little science at you that helps me to kind of feel that way and feel that that's not entirely weird have you ever taken a needle and rubbed it with cloth to give it like a static electric charge and make it a mild magnet oh okay how about rubbing a balloon on your head to stick it on the wall yeah when you rub a balloon on your hair or you rub silk along a needle what's happening is electrons move from the more negatively charged item to the more positively charged one and that gives it a temporary static electric charge and that's why you can stick the balloon on the wall now you can also take a magnet and rub it along a piece of metal in the same direction repeatedly and that will turn that piece of metal into a magnet and it does that because running the magnet along it makes the atoms all line up kind of and go in the same direction and it turns that metal into a magnet and that process is called magnetization by stroking you can do that right because that changes the alignment of the atoms and it makes them it turns the magnetic I'm gonna try that you know because I've never heard of that before you're actually physically affecting something when you do that so in my mind when I am holding something in my hands or if I am you know petting it or or rubbing it rubbing it maybe rubbing it down with nice oils or some herbs or something throw on some cool music get some incense going candle lights little different podcast hey you know if you want to romance your tools go for it there's nothing wrong with that but yeah create a connection with them that way you know talk to them I'd like to talk to my herbs before I work with them in a spell or put them in a joint it's be honest you talk to your weed before you smoke it I do oh my gosh I used to talk to my plants so I remember and I used to call you crazy well you still do that's not nothing's changed no no so those are really good ways and you might want to cleanse them first if they were someone else's tools or if you got it at a at a yard s yeah maybe you want to cleanse any energy there from manufacturing or from other people who've handled it and after that then put your energy onto it but you know and and this used to drive my kids crazy absolutely Bonkers I am like a rock collector okay like I will just see something I'm one of those people that like I'll just be walking down the street and like some shiny Rock On The Ground attracts my eye and I pick it up and they're like well that just looks like a brown Pebble why is it special I don't know it is don't question me you know maybe you have a little Pebble that is a a gray Pebble that you found on the sidewalk that can be just as good and have just as much a connection as the rose quartz that you buy at the store yes oh yeah I'm actually a big fan of using things that you just kind of find on your own like like rocks on the sidewalk or pine cones or you know make your wand out of a sck that you found in the yard you know what I mean I am forever doing this I have snake skins on my altar I have the last dandelion puff from my yard in a jar on my altar I have called nature packrats is that what we are nature packrats Sylvio the beautiful human that gave us those two broom paintings called me out on it at the central New York Pagan Pride this summer because we were all talking after our work shops and I had been picking up you'd been doing it too I've been acns acorns and Oak and those little Oak Leaf branches that had fallen off the tree and I was likeing a little squirrel and Sylvio called me out on it it was very cute hi Sylvia we love you we love you but it was adorable they were like are you taking all those home I'm like yes yes I am okay right here a baby pine a baby Little Acorn that we got from uh CNY Pagan Pride day I have a bunch of them on my altar as well now oh speaking of in the same place where I have I'm gonna have to put up a picture because it's super cute I have this cute little shelf that I have a whole bunch of my nature hoarding stuff on but on it I have another tool that you and I created together our Ouija boards oh yes awesome we created OU Boards out of cardboard and a Sharpie marker and a Sharpie marker we even made planett we each have one they work great by the way if you want to see a picture we did post it back when we talked about it so scroll back on the old Instagram and you will find the pictures so making your own making a connection with it is a really really good idea that will also help you kind of tap into it maybe maybe you have an athem but it doesn't feel like fire to you maybe it feels more like something you use to carve runes or sigils into your candles right maybe it feels differently and so you kind of have to pay attention to that a lot like with our charm casting you have to spend a little time with each of your tools and decide how it feels for you and that's why you know going back to creating that Bond you you have to spend the time with it as you would spend time with a friend or with a loved one you know you got to put in that energy and work to create that relationship because there will be a point where you're going to ask it to assist you in some sort of magical working and you need to have that Bond created to kind of ask that favor you know what I'm saying exactly and and that makes it so much easier especially if you have any type of difficulty visualizing having these tools in front of you can really help you focus your magical energy to affect the change that you're looking for so maybe you want to know how do I cleanse my tools what do I do to cleanse these tools that I just bought from some fabulous shop online or local bil local by local so I know that you have probably used a few different ways as have I smoke cleansing um I've done water cleansing I've done air cleansing plunged it into the Earth uh that's what I do with my aame actually because I did get a new one not too terribly long ago and kind of plunged it into the Earth to to create that Bond so there's going to be a lot of ways that may work for you cleansing wise but I've used all of those ways smoke earth water fire the type of tool might dictate how you cleanse it exactly you're not going to always want to put crystals in water depending on the kind of Crystal you might not also want to leave them out overnight to bathe in the Moonlight having that a good idea to cleanse your wand with fire either that's right your wouldn't launch should not be Clos of fire the only other thing I would add is sometimes people want to do like a blessing on it too so maybe you know if you're doing a smoke cleanse on it then you can do some sort of verbal blessing along with that but again that's really just personal preference yeah you can go as simple or as elaborate with this as you want to you can just take this tool and be like mine and then you're good but then there's also full Ceremonies for it right you can create a cleansing cleansing smoke and then a blessing oil you can create ritual herbs you could name it you could inscribe literally carve or etch or do it in oil or chalk a name onto the tool you can consecrate it to a deity or to yourself or to a specific purpose you could speak words over it you can get as elaborate as you like or as simple you did name your broom I did ha I love her my lovely base home I did have the pleasure of talking to the wonderful hags over at three Moon brooms while they were being created we were lucky enough to be able to get custom matching brooms from them when she first started creating our brooms I got pictures and I immediately knew hagatha and just like I said sometimes you walk into a store and something will call to you and you immediately know yeah you know that's right a long time ago I got a whole bunch of Green Egg magazines which then sadly I lost entirely in a flood but before I had met pagans that was a big connection for me of learning about paganism and about other people who practiced but I had gotten them at a secondhand shop and from one of the people that I had met at some point who knew about witchcraft I had gotten the idea that you weren't ever supposed to haggle for a magical tool so when I saw these magazines they were priced at like two bucks each and there was a good 20 or so of them and I didn't have the money so I'm like hold on to these I'll come back with the money I came back and someone else was on shift and I said hey that's my pile of magazines I'm here to pay they bring them over start flipping through and they're like oh $2 each that's too much I'll give you the whole stack for $2 I said sold patience is a virtue that's right put the money down and got the out but in that is where I found the poem never again the burning I I learned so much from these magazines but the point here is that sometimes a magical tool that is meant to find you will just call to you and find you and you might not necessarily need to clean it and at that point in your life Green Egg was your magical tool oh my gosh yes I love those magazines so I scour eBay for them when they come up and I can afford them I snatch them up but yeah so it could be anything and do you have a favorite tool I guess is my next question you know oddly enough I actually thought about this because I figured that we would probably somehow Circle back to do I have a favorite tool I do and it's it's actually going to have to be my Pentacle necklace and that is because you know you might be in a situation where I don't have my athe with me I don't take that to work you know but no matter where I go and what I do I've got that Pentacle with me it can be an is is a tool to project to manifest to to protect just as I would use it on an altar sometimes I use it wrapped around my neck because I do think that sigils and such are also tools as well so honestly it's probably the my Pentacle necklace I I had to think about it I I'm I'm a magpie I guess I I like pretty things I I like to have things on my altar I like earthy things and I do like to have representations of the elements and deity on my altar or when I'm doing a spell but when I thought about it the biggest thing I want to have when I'm doing a spell is smoke I like incense or I like a smokable spell if I have incense it feels like a spell to me I guess so maybe it's because I'm an air sign I don't know but incense of some type which I guess isn't really a traditional tool you know funny cuz my backup would have been an atheme which doesn't seem like something would pick but for some reason it was what I kept going back to that's another that was the other thing I thought of I went back and forth because I do also like atham but I like wands and I could just keep going down the list you know I have a cauldron collection I don't know right I have chalises and cauldrons and I have Pentacle stuff I like representations of the elements but I would have to say when I really really think about it if I have incense it feels like a spell to me and then also for ritual if I'm doing a big ritual but it doesn't really feel like a ritual to me unless there's druming see now funny because if for ritual wise I'm gonna have to go with my cord it feels like a ritual if I have my cord yeah you know honestly that is a tool we did not list when we listed our list so we talked about the AEM traditionally it's double bladed because uh was it words and actions can both cut or something like that correct and it has a black handle symbol of masculine energy traditionally Bells we didn't talk about Bells but those can be traditional uh to ward off negativity let's see cauldron and chalice feminine Pentacle symbol bowling but we did not talk about the cord that is also traditional from Garian magic and we also had chords in our coven now it can be a lot of different things um you know some traditions some coven kind of use chords kind of like a name badge of of your status it's a long rope that's usually multiple long ropes braided together that you wear around your waist like a belt that indicates status or rank yes but you know it also can kind of be the the ties that bind us too correct yes you know we've used cords and hand fastings um to to bond people together I've cut cords to cut cords yeah that's right that's right so whatever it it's again another tool that can be multi-purpose but in a ritual setting you know once I tie my cord around my waist it's almost like all right game on we're ready for me cords I only associate with covin I never use a cord if I'm just doing a ritual like say at a festival or at a workshop or something like that I associate cord strictly with coven I guess I never thought of it that way you might not be terribly wrong but it's not necessary it's just how you look no you could if you wanted to create a cord for yourself again it's just a braided traditionally 99 ft long once it's all braided three braids so nine cords total nine ropes three braids usually the colors mean something when you're initiated you get a white cord and then you get added different colors as you go through the different levels to to indicate your training but you could use chords for different things if you wanted to do cord for yourself you could do it for your own level of training chords are big use in hand fastings as well hand fast I do have a hand fasting cord on a shelf right above one of my my hand fasting CT on a shelf but I don't really use it for anything but other people do you know shell wears one all the time when she goes out with her C well you know it's and robes uh tradition sometimes different groups will have traditional dress but the ones that you mostly see are going to be Earth representations like a pentacle The Chalice the the blade the candle the incense and and these are really Elemental aspects typically and they mostly come from Wiccan history yeah but you know I'm I'm a fan of my tools I am a fan of my tools and even though I've kind of you know spent some time pulling away from wikin specific I you know I'm Centric I take my tools with me take my tools with me and I like the representations I I like representing the natural world around me I like representing the energies that I hoping to work with that feels good and right to me when I'm when I'm doing a spell or a ritual well and you know the only example that keeps popping into my head is remember that time we did that dream walk and what we did was we tied our cords around our waist on one end tied the other end of our cord around our aame and plunged our aame into the ground to kind of tie us to the to the real world so to say we were going to into the Fay realm we were traveling to Avalon for that one we were we were and we kind of used that almost like leaving a trail of breadcrumb making sure we had a way back there is another example of a chord it was within a coven setting but that was a magical use of a chord exactly exactly the ties that and like I said the ties that bind us but that is that is an example I keep thinking of with the cord in the a you know kind of grounding you into the real world or grounding you into a specific point that's really the the point of all these is we use that as a physical representation of what we magically wanted to do right and that's really what all of these are these are objects for you to work with their natural energy to direct your will and that's what magic is really so there are lots of other tools that we didn't cover again we just kind of went with our personal Roots which is very Western European Wiccan based with a little bit of animism and folk magic thrown in because we like the natural things we like them to represent the natural world and you know if if you have tools that are different or used differently that is absolutely fantastic this is just kind of what we have kind of been trained and know and have practiced throughout the years I know we're going to get people that are going to yell at us and Jonathan our beloved Jonathan also gave us a little bit of crap not really love you Jonathan but in ceremonial magic if you do go back into the Golden Dawn and into High magic of the cabala and things like that blades are air so they always use swords and athem for air uh and that's again something very different than what we do we're more Elemental earthy you know down in the earth refer back to our swords versus wands tarot episode previously because that's my thoughts on it here too but my point with this is just that your associations may vary and that is perfectly valid and okay it really is very important that your tools reflect your feelings and your beliefs because it's not going to work for you if you try to go counter yeah to your own personal beliefs if you're holding a chalice and you're trying to force yourself to say this chalice filled with water represents Earth and it just doesn't feel right to you it's it's your Spell's not gonna work sound right right it has to work for you or the magic will not flow so the more comfortable you with with your associations the better you feel about your associations the better those tools will work magically for you I just think that you know tools it's just another collection Obsession we like shiny things I like shiny things and Tarot decks yeah yeah I mean you can never have enough in my opinion I agree I agree all right well I am going to go dust off one of my altars because every time we talked about a tool I was looking at it I'm like you know I've been neglecting that one it needs to be cleaned up and I'm actually going to take some photos and post some pictures because I just I know people are going to ask they're going to say I want to see your altars I want to see your tools so yeah I'm G to get going on some of that so if you want to check out
