welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and today we're going to be talking about all things summer summer magic litha summer solstice long long days I want to start out with why is litha like the Forgotten holiday people skip over it our old Community like I feel like one of the least attended rituals what's up with litha being the back burner holiday I got two reasons for you oh boy the first one is super easy it's the first summer month of the year everybody's out and about schools out people have plans everyone's going to festivals music festivals Pagan festivals all of the above and so they're busy people are busy in June well I hear you a little bit but okay what's your bet what's your better reason my better reason well I don't know if it's better but the second reason I think is because litha is like we have the whole wheel of the year and you have your high holidays you've got belan and sa imul and llamas and you know your big holidays the solstices aren't really historically even weren't even that big of a deal they were celebrated and they were noticed but litha itself didn't really become a holiday until you know you've got um oh shoot Murray Margaret Murray writing you know the witch Cult of Western Europe know that's the first time it was seen it all of the times they were looking into the hereditary witches of England that's when it kind of started becoming a thing I believe litha itself is just the old name for June I was actually thinking more of the movie A Midnight uh A Midsummer Night Dream and like that's my vision of litha is that that I don't know I just feel like it's like the Forgotten one you're not wrong maybe it's because the opposite is the winter solstice which is so heavily tied with you know the Ule Christmas season and so it seems like a bigger deal and litha is just like I had plans that weekend it might be and I know for our old community and our old Coven in particular this was the time of year when a lot of pagan festivals really got underway there's fairy festivals and Pagan festivals from June till August and so people were gone and I I can remember many many a festival getting out to the land where we would all meet to camp and there's just a handful of people there the grass is long the Crickets are chirping the fireflies are all around and there's maybe a dozen people that's the thing you know you could have 200 people at belan and then litha you're you're lucky if you got 30 people oh gosh that would be a big one if there were 30 people there and most of the time the person who had called that ritual who had called that holiday to run it half the time didn't show up and so it would be left to the people who did show up to create that ritual on the Fly and honestly I loved some of those I loved that summer laidback feeling those first Warm nights of camping and we're all kind of sitting in that overgrown field with the Lush grass trying to come up with a last minute celebration for this season of laziness of fullness of waiting well and as a summer lover because you know I love I I love being warm way more than love being cold um it's the longest day the winter solstice okay it's the longest night you expect that in December but this is the longest day like it is light here in the northeast of the United States until like gez what almost nine o'clock at night like I love that I love that and you know litha is supposed to Mark like the Epic peak of the sun's power that sun energy for the growing season yeah it's when the God is at his height you know there's so much daylight and so much sun like you said the growing season it's all about giving that strength to the growing things now I see all this stuff on tiktock you know I always like to go back to tiktock I I see all this stuff where where some of these newer Pagan folk new witches think that like if I don't do this on June 21st strike me down well the thing is about the solstices is it's not always on on the 21st and that's you know same thing with the winter solist it can be like what the 21st to the 23rd is that right like the 20th to the 22nd roughly astrologically that effect yeah astrologically it can occur on any of those days depending on if there was a leap year you know depending on where we're at in the cycle litha can occur 20th 21st and 22nd and historically again because this was one of the Lesser celebrated sabbaths they didn't have a set date for it in different countries and different cultures the summer solstice could be celebrated all throughout that week or or throughout this time period so litha itself is one of the ones where you really don't have to worry about celebrating it exactly astrological Solstice you can celebrate it pretty much any time in June yeah and also you got to factor in the fact that our society follows the Gregorian calendar and there is like a little slight difference between that and the actual rate of the Earth's rotation of the Sun so you know there's that little detail but yeah within those couple of days and nothing like a leap year to throw off your Solstice days right you know how many times have we celebrated the solstice on like June 24th like it happens it happens it's okay Gods understand no one's striking you down right and and like on this year I think the solstice is on a Tuesday or something who has time to go out like I work that day exactly and so celebrating it the weekend before the weekend after very common certainly okay if you're doing High magic or something that requires specific timing that's entirely different but most witches and Pagan practices it's more the feeling summer has started and for us the summer solstice is the official start but honestly it's it's been going on for a minute and from the beginning of June we've all kind of felt that summery feel feeling so we can really celebrate at any time but you know as far as different magical things you can do around this time most people even here in the Northeast actually um we could actually start kind of planting little things not big things but like herbs and stuff early to miday so at this point you can start harvesting some of those herbs like I've actually got some white sage growing outside and then you know I got kitty cats so I got the catnip growing too but you know I'll go out and start plucking those um jarring them up drying them out and using them for other things so it's also kind of a I don't want to say a good time to start toying with harvesting but at least herbs yeah this is literally and figuratively a time of abundance a time to enjoy the work that you have done you're just starting to glean those very first beginnings of harvest from the plants that you've sewn whether it's magical seeds that you've sewn in the spring or whether it's literal seeds that you've sewn the energy of the sun of the oak King growing it's that strength it's that life and now is the time to Revel in it to roll around in the grass to pick the flowers to to grab those first tomatoes that are just starting to ripen candelion crowns candelion crowns there's less work to do right now now is the time to kind of look at where you've come from the spring see if things are growing the way that you want them to and continue on that path and to feel that energy of the god to feel that life coursing through you I mean who doesn't love to go outside and to feel those first rays of sunshine especially on a festival like coming out of a tent after being freezing all night long and then feeling that sunlight on your body wonderful but there's I mean this is also as far as like kind of some a little mythology when the Battle of the Holly king and the oak King which we actually did a Passion Play ritual super fun I was thinking about the same exact thing we had two of our coven mates One play the oak King who rules the land from Ule as he grows stronger into litha when he is at the height of his power and he battles the Holly King who rules the dark half of the Year from litha Summer Solstice summer solstice to Winter Solstice so you know that that's also definitely something that if you're kind of interested in in especially Celtic mythology check out the legend of the oak king and the Holly King in in the uh seasonal battle between them fun story I think anyway that was an epic ritual we had our coven mate uh Play The Goddess the pregnant goddess and the oak king and the Holly King battled because she was transitioning from that young Carefree woman who wanted the younger God now she needs that stronger steadier energy the that energy where she can have a child with him and feel safe and secure and and in a partnership and go forward so he needed to change and grow up and it was that it's that kind of energy that we're that we're dealing with right now it's the fullness and ripeness of that God energy also another thing I've noticed about Li over the years it is damn hand fasting season oh yeah pretty much belain and litha are like hand fasting Central so that's kind of a biggie this time of year as well with with a lot of folks in their litha celebrations everybody likes to get married in the spring you know life is abundant and and all of those signs of growth and prosperity and love and abundance are all around in the spring and especially and now in litha the beginning of Summer it it's a perfect time to get married the weather's beautiful the flowers are gorgeous and it just represents that strength of a relationship and that strength of life and of growing now what celebration is complete without mass quantities of food lith is a good time I think to barbecue because you want to honor that fire and the energy of the sun crank out the grill man food is a big part of any Pagan f go to any Festival you will always find cakes and Ale it's you know you'll see it listed as cakes and Ale for after the ritual or you know the the bread feast or the or you know some type of feast is always includ all I can think of is the Run Fair where you eat the big turkey legs by hand the big drumstick turkey legs you know this is this is also one of those um those fire celebrating holidays as well in Old England what would they do they would light the wagon wheels on fire and roll them down the mountain side to the water yes yep I've heard that litha is a time to celebrate the Fay folk the fairies the shei and we have had several rituals where we worked with the Fay with Queen ma but be careful working with the Fay folks because that's some tricky territory you are better off around and finding out with a Ouija board than you are with the F okay just saying that is Elemental energy at its final the Fay energy fairy energy this time of year is abundant abundant it's capricious it's alive it's that feeling you get when you're walking along a path on a full moon night in the middle of summer with fireflies everywhere maybe some of those gorgeous candles hanging in the trees and you know there's romance and love and the air is just sultry with flowers you know it just feels like life and happiness and love and the Fay are all about at that time and they that energy is very very strong but they can be kind of tricksters they absolutely can this is a great time of year to leave offerings out to them to the to the energies of your land maybe the Elementals that reside where you do to the Fay that you might work with another fun thing is to actually do a fairy alar um have a cute little fairy alar somewhere outside we've done it at the base of a tree before kind of on a heap of rocks before um but a cute little fairy altar always a good time and you always want to leave them offerings that lessens the whole trickster thing yeah and there's different types of Fay if you if you ever are interested in looking into the Fay maybe we should do an episode on the shei because there's a lot there leaving an offering is usually a good idea a little bit of milk maybe a little bit of food maybe some flowers maybe something one of the first fruits from your Harvest maybe something from your garden itself is always an excellent offering to any energies of the land around you or any deities that you work with especially this time of year you know I just wanted to add in here I cracked open the old Book of Shadows the OG book and I just wanted to share a chant that we used to use I'm not singing it people so don't get worked up I'm just gonna say it but this is a good one and I know you may have this may have kind of slipped the Forefront of your mind but when I say it you're going to be like oh my God I remember that a good litha chant that we used to use is we are the old people we are the new people we are the same people stronger than before and I don't know I feel like this is a good time of year for that to be relevant because the sun I don't know for me personally the sun makes me feel stronger and and when you're out in the sun you kind of it's almost like you're recharging your batteries and you're trying to recharge as much as you can before that literal dark period you know end of October November December through February and stuff I kind of get that you know we are the old people but we are the new people we're still the same people and that that energy is making us stronger than before we are the old people we are the new people we are the same people stronger than before I forgot the clap and then you start it over I love that chant those are great and you know generally um that is a good chant and if you if if you are so inclined we generally did it in what either three six or nine verses oh yes man the three six and nine those magical numbers another thing we should do an episode about because that has come up for me a lot today the world will implode if you do that chant four times no I'm just kidding I'm just kid got do it three six or nine get into magical geometry and trus scallion and the the rule of three and the the triple goddess and all sorts of things come back to 3 six and N magical numbers but anyway yeah there there's definitely something to be said for you know when you when you say things in in that it's not just the numbers being significant but you know saying something once you're just kind of putting it out there when you've said something three times or more you're kind of cementing that out to the universe and also within yourself your subconscious really likes repetition and like you said if you say it once you're just kind of saying it at a second time your brain pays attention that third time it remembers it sticks yeah but the same with the universe you know the first time yeah you said it the second time I hear you the third time they're listening exactly as within so without I love that that's that's absolutely that's awesome and some of my favorite litha rituals and spells to do have to do with honoring that fullness have that Bounty that's all around us right now you're all alter should have flowers on it it should have fruit on it honey abundant things pin Wheels things do smell pretty circles things that are a circle like you said they would light The Wheels On Fire and roll them down the hill it's the cyclical nature of things that we're celebrating right now you know it's also a fun time to do Beach magic if you are into sea witchery or Ocean Magic this is a fun time to do that because well you know it's June don't you want to go to the beach any any way you're there you know also while you're there don't forget to do things like grab your bottle of sea water for later you know grab a bottle of sand to use for for Magical workings later look for seal glass the shells or the Driftwood you know you're there having a good time do a little magical stuff while you're there so Beach work is a good is ocean work um sea wiery this is a good time for that now I know you and I are both Big Time Beach witches we love to go to the beach we love the ocean we love the lake we love the beach I wouldn't go so far as to say we're sea witches but close we're working on it we're working on it but one of the things about litha is it is a celebration of fire and water and what better way to celebrate that than on the beach on a hot day there is no more perfect representation of fire and water than that hot sand and the ocean right there actually I was thinking of it more because we you know we were upstate New York more landlocked out at the lake all day and then by the campfire all night exactly exactly and that's yet another way to honor that fire element while still honoring the water it's that balance the yin-yang that's so prevalent this time of year and you know while you're sitting on the beach getting your tan you can be doing a meditation you know you can be doing some sort of ritual work while you're just chilling getting the tan it's definitely a fun a fun time this year this time of year I think but again I'm a summer lover oh I am too we do not do well with the cold I love the sun I love the longer days I Loved These summer rituals people's creativity came out when it was last minute and it was smaller groups we had a lot of fun with it I feel like there's more magic in the air this time of year it was it it just feels like it's floating around you I mean look at the Cottonwood the dandelion seeds floating in the air there's butterflies and birds it just feels like the very air itself is filled makes me sneeze but while while you're walking around not having an allergic reaction you can kind of feel that energy in the air it just it feels very abundant that God energy you know it's after the sun goes down you can still feel the warmth radiating up out of the pavement you know that energy is potent it's very strong it likes to stick around and so this is an excellent time to charge things you know how we charge things on the full moon you can also charge things this time of year with the sun energy put it out before the 21st as the sun grows stronger up to that culmination of his strongest Point any tools that you have crystals any herbs that you want to charge dry them under that sun let it absorb that energy while it's growing and you know again you can collect your your sand and your Beach water on your Beach trips and then you can take those back and uh utilize those things to cleanse your crystals and such because you know there are crystals that you don't want to be laying in salt again there are crystals you don't want to be getting all watery either and there's crystals you don't want direct sunlight on either right sand is a good cleansing alternative to salt and I don't think a lot of people realize that you don't see that advertised much out there but sand is a perfect alternative to salt and it's less erosive and corrosive to things oh yeah I love sand especially we've talked before about how we use to do um salt circles in particular I used to do one on my roof when I was a kid but salt is not something that you want to put on the ground it will kill the plants you know a little bit of salt that you're sprinkling is probably not going to hurt anything but why take the chance doing a sand Circle if you actually want to physically draw a circle with something sand is an excellent substitution for that because then you know you're not going to be killing your grass or your garden and just a little PSA please be reminded that ocean water has salt in it good point very good point oh I heard a cool thing about fairies actually oh D tell I remember one Legend from when I was a kid is I heard that if you look between the ears of a cat you could see fairies old wives tales said that if you see like a cat staring at something that's invisible look between their ears at what they're looking at and you'll be able to see the fairy oh wow I've never heard that the other one I heard is if you take fern seeds and rub them on your eyelids that will give you the sight to be able to see fairies on litha I don't know about rubbing seeds on your eyeballs I do not recommend this but but supposedly an old witchy thing is if you rub fern seeds on your eyelids you can see the Fay I'm not gonna try it but even Shakespeare thought could feel the magic of Midsummer A Midsummer Night's Dream and Puck and all the sex and love shenanigans that they get up to and that because it just it's a potent time of year you can feel it in the air as you're walking around why not harness some of that and do your workings for abundance and for joy and that kind of like I don't know I always think of it is like the Easy Living time of year you know there's food right there you don't have to work for it really everything's just here it's easy to Camp because it's warm and comfortable it just feels like a time of year you want to bottle up and keep why not literally put put it in a spell jar or put it on your tools and you know use that energy in your crafting and in your magical workings right now to kind of bring that abundance into your life you know what's interesting about the cat thing with the fairies because I had never heard that before totally makes sense though but the tie-in is did you know that one of the litha goddesses we'll call it in air quotes um is Bast I did not know that Bast that kind of makes sense because no offense Bast but cats like the sun light and summertime so I guess that kind of makes sense from that point of view I mean maybe it's just a me thing but I always think of the green man um I I understand the oak King the Holly King but this is also kind of a green man time of year in my opinion when we were talking about Patron gods and goddesses we talked a lot about goddesses because that seems to be a lot of where you're and my focus is konos is a patron deity of mine and he's just always kind of there he's like the Green Man the the forest God the the representative of all things masculine and divine and Godlike to me he just kind of represents that that earthy Green Forest Lord with the antlers and sunlight and you know and so that Forest God energy like you said it doesn't have to be the oak king and the Holly King it can just be the personification of the Green Man or konos or the god of the wood that also sticks out very much to me this time of year as well but lots of different like I said lots of different things you can do like with it being an herb a good herb growing time that turns into a good herb drying time nothing cooler than taking like I can't remember how many you need I'd have to lay it out in my head to know but kind of making like a little Pentacle out of sticks and tying some of your bundles of of fresh herbs to it hanging it and letting those herbs dry super cute nice activity for this this time of year my youngest daughter is an herb witch and she loves to plant and to dry her herbs and I'm going to tell her about that because making a little Pentacle and then hanging your herbs from that how cute is that well you got to hang it from something right and this is the perfect time of year to put them out there I mean not that you couldn't dry your herbs in July and August you absolutely can but just the the potency of the sun energy right now is so strong you know this makes it a good magical time to do that another fun thing to do this this time of year for litha I used to actually do this my kids we'd call it magic potion we'd make magic potion you know how you can get those big containers that you can make like lemonade or or what have you in yeah um slicing up the lemons slicing up oranges and just throwing a ton of whatever fruit you know whatever we had at the moment who knows what we were going to hodge podge at the time putting that out in the sun kind of like how you do the sun tea but this was all with fruit it wasn't a tea really and you know hey hit with the kids throw some sugar in when when you're done boom Another really good craft if you're into being crafty is flower crowns flowers and everything are so abundant this time of year you were always a flower crown Master yeah I do love the flower crowns and uh being able to weave those together with flowers that you have grown or that you've picked up at your farmers market or at your corner Farmer Store if you're lucky enough to have a Farm Stand and and weaving those together it's not that hard to do and you can make beautiful crowns to wear for your LIF celebration and then to let dry and have be a beautiful decoration or a crown that you can wear at a future ritual especially if you use those flowers in your ritual as you're celebrating and then weave that into a crown with intention weaving things is a form of binding spell take your flowers that have already been part of your working and have gathered that energy and then weave them as you're chanting a spell or as you're thinking of your intention whatever you happen to want it to to be and weave that Crown together now every time you wear it every time you look at it it will reenact and renew that energy and hopefully help to move your spell forward um actually what I've done is I've made them at litha and then burned them in the llamas fire yes that is another fabulous way to release that energy you can also uh keep it from litha Ule if you want to or litha till sin I love what you just said there shell because charging these crowns with this energy and then seeing it every day until the next ritual and then intentionally burning it and offering that Crown releases that energy in yet another way and if you want to go even further you can take the ashes from that crown and add it to your salt and make black salt and now you've got black salt that's protective and charged with whatever you charge that crown with as well so there's lots of different ways to complete that ritual to offer that energy back to the universe and then to continue using it in a very magical way I think uh one thing I I also want to point out about this particular Sabbath is it's kind of the take it easy one um because we are gearing up for the the next Sabbath is harvest season and it's celebrating the beginning of work are we really or are we celebrating the end of school and the beginning of Easy Street summer and pretending that we don't see we're the grasshopper in this situation we're pretending that the cold season is not coming right but this is our last chance to kind of enjoy with nothing behind us and nothing ahead of us because once we hit llamas we're celebrating getting back to work at that point that's right then the Harvest festivals begin and yeah back to work we go and you know on a on a kind of a spiritual angle you know the summer is more carefree and jolly and chipper whereas those dark winter months are more introspective and Shadow work and draining and taxing on your soul so this is the time to just let your soul be carefree and they really are like how many times how many ritual shell can you remember sitting on that land around a fire in the camping field and just the laughter ringing out across that field at night either before or after ritual absolutely but you don't get those same Giggles in the data winner no no you don't everyone's bundled up in their cloaks and their boots and huddling really close to the fire yeah like all right I'm cold but it's lazy and it's warm and it's comfortable and everyone's happy and passing around food and me and yeah me and maybe a little cannabis and we're having a good time and and everyone's comfortable enjoying that abundance and enjoying that growing energy that like you said it's a time to relax to chill to be with friends to have a barbecue to weave a flower crown to leave an offering out for the Fay and just to enjoy the freaking stars at night you know it's it's just a beautiful time of year to celebrate being alive and and being in the middle of all this abundance that sometimes we take advantage of or we don't pay attention yeah we just don't pay enough attention to it you know you know sometimes life passes You by but it's the little things like I said if nothing else if you're going to the beach in the next couple of weeks take a minute that's all right take a minute count your blessings count your blessings and gratitude have grat this is an excellent time of year to have gratitude it's easy they've shown scientific Studies have shown that people who Express their gratitude are happier and have less stress and so take a second if you can and count your blessings and say something that you're grateful for even if it's just standing outside in the Sun and like I am grateful it's not winter yeah just just be kind be kind to yourself be kind to other people yeah be kind feel that warmth in your soul and just let it light somebody else up you know be kind to you and be kind to everyone around you right now because we all need it and you know just as much as the moon can energize you and recharge you and do all those feels type things the sun does too and I think the sun gets a bad WP you know the sun is just as magical as the Moon is magical they're the ying and the Yang you can't have one without the other at least in this world so celebrate the sun because we put a lot of focus on celebrating the moon and this is a good time to just sit back and celebrate the sun I love that real quick before we get into a whole another topic we do tend to neglect the sun and the god a lot I think in this religion maybe it's a backlash because a lot of people come to this religion from god- centered you know from very patriarchal religions and so we do have a tendency maybe to overcompensate by paying attention to the goddess but we all have Duality within us you know we need both of those you need the sun you need the moon you know we need men we need women you know everyone in between we need all of it the takeaway I think the biggest takeaway is go out and celebrate the sun go out and celebrate the fun and celebrate the longest day and the shortest night be care free because in the next notch on the wheel we're celebrating going back to work folks it is true that inner work and that outer work so celebrate the the Sun at its Zenith that extra strength that abundance that warmth in your life the easy times right now because like shelle said work is right around the corner and you can't have one without the other so if we're going to go to work you might as well play just as hard happy ltha everyone happy litha and we hope that you have a wonderful longest day of
