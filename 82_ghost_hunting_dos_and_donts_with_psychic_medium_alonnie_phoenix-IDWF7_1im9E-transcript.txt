with this lovely person yes we do shell and I are very excited to welcome Alani to the show hello Alani hi everyone how are you happy boo season my magical name name is Alani Phoenix and I am a psychic medium that's been since I'm going to be 66 the end of the month I've been doing it since I was age five so I've done it for a good minute um I am from upstate New York I like to go chase Things That Go Bump in the night I love being a pagan and I I love being an out ofthe closet witch you were one of the very first witches that I met when I first came to the Pagan community that I kind of came up where I met shell it was always wonderful to see you there because it was like just the energy around you was always so bright and so wonderful it's been very interesting to see you on Facebook with your business your psychic mediumship growing and I'm very intrigued about the ghost hunting because you've been to some pretty you've been to some pretty big places I've seen we've been to some places yeah don't believe all the hype don't believe all the hype but some and others are fabulous what is prob the most haunted place you've gone and investigated the Hinsdale house Hinsdale New York it's also called The Dandy house so it's outside of Buffalo and you can book a tour you can go and investigate there Daniel has it as a a place for people to go and learn and practice the art of paranormal exploration and paranormal research oh nice and it does not disappoint so it's good enough that you can go there as like your first investigation and learn learn how to do it that's how active you know how it is with any place that's active one night it might be quiet as a church mouse right and then you get home and you listen to everything and you got you know something and other times you're like holy crap so on our specters page you'll see uh some of our our evidence and there's a couple of pictures from the Hinsdale house with a critter that I encountered that was you know a lot of things don't bother me too much I've been scratched and yelled at and you know the whole thing this thing holy cow scared me and other people have taken pictures of it and had seen it and so when you look up the Hinsdale house and go to the hins house restoration project on YouTube and look at all the videos yay yay team 18 wow so we like to not only do we support the Hinsdale house we we are loyal fans and if I can say anything about New York State they've got some great places and this is one of them New York is definitely really big on that we um shell and I our old podcast the stoned Witches Hour focused on paranormal events and a lot of it Crypton everything there was a lot in New York state and I know that the like spiritualism really took off out of Rochester New York yes about that way yeah Fox sisters and everything there oh what's the name of the the house the our Main Street all I can think of is Roberson Roberson the Roberson house oh they don't let you play well there but the the Bundy Museum the Bundy Museum on Main Street I'll tell you a real quick story when I was a snos teenager hitchhiking along Main Street and hanging out with people on Main Street the Bundy house I would look up and I would see this little girl and she would be screaming oh wow right and so I'm going to be 66 this was age 15 16 right and so we went and did a couple recordings there a couple investigations there and on one of them I caught her screaming oh wow and we got a lot of EVPs from that place and and things that aren't just one word you know and so there's other groups that do a lot of Investigations there and I would encourage people if you want to look for something in the area check out the Bundy and we like to support local I have a question is there a difference in going into this as a I don't know how else to say a mundane person versus going into this as a witch and is a pagan is a psychic medium is the experience different and if so how well I'm a huge skeptic I half the time I don't believe what I'm saying until someone says holy crap that's true right yeah and and so my husband's a skeptic right and going in with that little bit of a scientific background or thought process and and not believing anything until you till you experience it right so as a as a pagan and as a medium it felt normal for me my entire life so to me it's like walking into a theme park woohoo we're going to have fun right right we've had other people we've worked with they've gone in go I get nothing I feel nothing I know nothing I feel nothing okay are you enjoying the experience of looking yeah okay then then it's a win-win because being skeptical is a healthy thing being open is a a positive thing and allows you from my experience if you're more open you're going to experience more things just like with anything in life yeah there has to be that balance right more you're going to willing to be say okay I'm going to experience this and see what's open to me and you never no we we did a one at the bundai and we had a friend that was one of our former teammates big skeptic huge skeptic they kept saying I feel nothing and and we got back and we tore through the evidence and the footprints footsteps are walking right up to them we're like do you hear that he goes well yeah but you don't always hear it at the time no so going into something with your eyes open is up to you whether you're going to experience it or not does that answer your question some would you still would you still call yourself a skeptic I'm a huge skeptic I am am after everything you've seen and heard yes because I I don't know if I need to say I need to experience it myself but sometimes you can look at somebody and just go well you're so full of kaka right right and and you're going that does not ring true that's not R ringing true to me so being a skeptic is an important piece of it but I a firm believer as well because I talk to dead people I've been doing it for decades so going into something like this going into a place that is reportedly haunted or could possibly be haunted or might not but there's the the lore around it you know you never know till you get in there and you experience it just get in there and get your feet wet you know going in as a skeptic does not mean that you don't believe it means that you're going in making sure to well was that the wind was that the reflection of headlights going by is there a window open is the floor uneven you know it's making sure that you go through all that mundane checklist first for sure because I think that's so important when you're doing you know especially when you're doing any type of psychic investigation like this you really have to go through that and then you have the stone cold Skeptics that say you can't prove it's true and I said then you can't prove it isn't you know so you've mentioned that you've been doing this since you were very young and that's something that that we know about you that you've had these experiences since you were a very small child who was your first ghost and and how did you know that that was a ghost another story so I'll give you this one so when I was five I was in morning kindergarten back then it was morning or afternoon kindergarden and you got gram crackers and milk and you played with crayons and you took a nap that was Kindergarten now it's what trigonometry in kindergarten something like that and so our babysitter was across the street and because I would see dead people kids and all these things she kind of got a clue that I was doing this and so every once in a while she would take me and my brother to a seance run by Reverend May York who was big in the spiritualist community in broom county oh wow so they would trap me over there and I'd be over in another room with all the other little kids that were there visiting with their parents that are in the Sands and they'd have us someone watching me and when I would start talking to the dead kids they'd say it's time and they would trap me over into the the room with the Sands and the big round table and the people all there and on more than one occasion there was a lady who was about she she it was the weirdest thing she had like a white pants suit on but behind her would be this little boy in a white they had like the Sailor pants little short pants and a little and he was always folding a rose and that was what he was buried in and so I would say well he's behind you and he's got his Rose and Mama and the whole thing and you know the whole thing and so I don't know how many times I did this with her with other people I don't remember how many times and she always would say don't now don't tell your mother secret and one of those days I said and I saw the Dead kid and I lost oh no spilled the beans spilled the beans and she couldn't be my babysitter anymore which was which was very sad so I would say that was probably he probably wasn't the first ghost I seen but it's the most it's the the memory that I hold more to Dear as far as my adventures in this started the ghost child brings up a question a story of fine and then a question so the story is there was a time when I read tarot professionally and I was asked to go to an event it turned out to be a memorial for a young girl who had passed away and her family was putting on this big event with different vendors and and they were raising money so I was doing readings and things were going well and towards the end of the day a woman came in and asked for a reading but her cards were very jumbled I I wasn't getting anything good and I told her so um was like I have nothing I'm sorry and I tried to give her money back and rather than do that she gave me more money and said do it again so I did and same thing even more jumbled than before she kept doing this she did this four times until I was finally like no stop I am not taking your money you need to stop I'm very sorry but I've got nothing and that's when she said she was the mother of the young child who had passed okay and she was trying to contact her child now this is not something I normally do but it has happened in the past where Spirits or Souls have come to me during readings I tried and got nothing she was not there and I tried as gently as I could to tell the woman this what could I have done in that situation other than I I felt horrible I still feel horrible to this day and what you did was right was the correct course of action so there's a couple things that could be going on depending on how old this child was when they left eight or nine I think okay their energy may not be Coes yet they may not be ready to come back and talk anybody yet you know and I and I always tell people keep praying for your dead they need that that prayer to heal them so that they can heal you when the cycle continues right and I also tell people you know depending on the age of the child if if the baby doesn't come to fruition if it leaves for a number of reasons whether you helped it to leave or it needed to leave on its own their thing is that karmically they have to go in and out real quick because they're usually a guide or Guardian for the mom and always for the siblings right and so now you have someone that's had a little life behind them and they may not have been ready to come back they could have incarnated again already doubtful but probably wasn't ready to do that and ethics is a big piece and so we don't try to blow smoke up people's butt and say oh well I see and he's doing this and he says he loves you because that is so there's too many people out there that are that unable I wanted to I really wanted to your heart is like heart's breaking I want to do something lady yeah I was heartbroken that I could not I got nothing there was nothing but you were honest and that to me that's the bigger piece of it you did the the right course of action by saying I'm not getting anything and it's got nothing to do I've talked to people standing beside the casket and I get people from centuries back but it's not up to us for when they're going to come and talk to us they're not trained ponies right you know and just because you talked to Grandpa two weeks ago with me doesn't mean he's going to come again in three months it might be someone else who got the message there's a lot of expect that people in our profession that deal with this all the time will help people to understand a little more logistically how things are going to work now on the flip side of that do you ever find ghost hunting that Spirits like reach out to you like you're a telephone operator desperately trying to make a connection all the time that opposite scenario all the time I was doing a reading for a client last night and I got to her house and I said Jesus you got this guy out in the yard and you got this guy out in the yard and you tell him I said look think of yourself as a dimmer switch and we've turned our dimmer switch on you know our Grail sign is on and they're just going to come oh your lights on I'm coming right I got to talk I want someone to hear me here's what's going on and then you know as I tell people part of my brain is talking to you and part of my brain is working with them and so while I was talking to this lady last night saying okay there's this man as soon as I my butt hit the chair I looked up and she was wandering around her yard and I I said well what's going on he goes my chest is crushed I said ah heart attack okay you you died from a heart attack yes why you sticking around I don't know where I am I'm lost okay so part of my brain so I'm calling in your ancestors your loved ones to come and collect you go with them when you hear them and the other part is talking to her and telling her what I'm doing and so when we have those experiences I could be in CVS and something comes up and I might go up to somebody and say hey by the way here's my card here's what I'm hearing here's what I'm seeing people today are a little funny about people walking up to them so you gotta yeah you got to be careful with that now you got to be really careful really careful but you no more Teresa capuno moments I don't you know you know I get people and I tell them you know I don't want you to become addicted to a reader it's not fair to you you got free will you can't do this see twice a year is a big it's a lot for reading but if you have a particular issue you want to focus on we'll talk but I'm not gonna see you every week don't ask me that not gonna happen you know it's funny I used to have the same Spiel twice a year is more than plenty it's more than plenty you got a life to live that's right now if someone wants to connect to a spirit what would you suggest that they do and conversely if someone wants to you know to hang up the telephone what would you tell them to do I would talk to them about what they mean by Spirit right because people confuse a ghost with a spirit right they're two different things oh explain that a little bit in my opinion something that's Earth stuck here or is not choosing to leave they become attached to something they might be haunting the place they might be stuck there and and choose to haunt him right other things they like this gentleman he didn't know he was dead he didn't know where to go right so he's not necessarily haunting but he's Earthbound then we have people who have passed and they become our their Spirits our our ancestors our loved ones our animals they could be guides Guardians Watchers are just like hanging out right and so we can talk to them you don't need a medium to talk to your loved ones just talk to them they're going to hear you and maybe they'll come and talk to you and that time period right before we fall asleep and right before we wake up up our conscious our subconscious plays well enough together that they can communicate with you it's a natural Alpha state it allows you to connect to those different planes a lot easier much easier and they don't always remember their name right because it's not I don't know my name but I'll tell you that I used to make the best parois and so and that's how I filter it dead people tell me a lot about food they like and that helps me with them and he's asking for this this is what they did and to me talking to the different things I will talk to an energy that stuck is the same way I would talk to to an energy that's in spirit I think as a novice going in what you don't want to say is okay everybody come and talk to me right no let's yeah you don't want to open that wide right right you know we don't want to let the whole clan in because you know you don't know what's coming so being a little careful being being mindful about that talk to your loved ones talk to your animal friends that have passed and and they're going to be there cats like to screw with the living and an and dogss are the way dogs are you know they're just like in death what they were in life right cats like to screw with the living you'll see half a tail to see half a cat running around you know that kind of thing and so if someone wants to say to me how do I how do I connect with them well you can go to a medium you can invite them to come and talk to you when you say your prayers at night or what you're grateful for you know come and give me a message and it might be it might be more symbols I mean dead people talk in symbols a lot you know I always say men have this many symbols and women have this many symbols right and they might give you some messages you know in that way but I don't hear them all the time well maybe you don't hear them but maybe you smell them maybe maybe you smell them maybe you get in the car and their song comes on or maybe you feel them right right you know there's there's so many ways to experience this that there's no there's no rule book on this right the one thing that does bother me about this community or this thing people are more um have a disposition to go to it's demons right I don't believe in demons myself I don't believe that's a Tik Tock problem and I don't believe in hell but it's good television that's true now it's not to say that there are things that are Earthbound that are really really negative because there are right and I know I have some friends that are exorcists and they do things and I'm like I want to come and watch I want to do because I need to you know am I seeing the same thing but we're calling it by different okay I can do that I can I can appreciate that but you know the paranomal community has a lot of gates to hell and they're everywhere they're everywhere every old hotel has one you know and and it's not always that way but that's the first place people jump to and so that's what their expectations are going to be so the first thing they're going to hear they're going to experience oh it's a demon no it's Grandpa and he's just you know gassy cranky gassy if you want to hang up on Grandpa you know what do you what do you do so um usually when they're done with me they'll say goodbye or they'll say sleep sleep or they'll just fade away and if they're talking to you talking to you talking to you and you're done with them because sometimes they'll just jabber I love you I will see you again and then you just don't pay then you just hang up the phone I'm not I'm done talking to because I'll get people coming through and they're just like and I said there's other people in line we got to talk to someone else now there's another relative here so can you hang out over here and then I just kind of not talk to them surprising how much saying goodbye in any particular way is potent that's a good word shell any way you choose to say goodbye as long as you say it that can sever that connection it's just like a phone byebye we're gonna see you later you know the the big piece of our kind of work is not only are we kind of acting as a counselor sometimes so we need to be very well of someone who may have a truly diagnosed mental health issue yeah absolutely and hearing voices or or experiencing things that um are are part of the mind as opposed to something different now sometimes I see things visually sometimes they're in my mind's eye sometimes they're yelling in my ear I like to scratch in my ear say there's a lot of weights I can communicate with them but I also ask questions and if and if you get that answer that it leads you to think I think you might should be talking to a therapist or a professional to be honest about that because those are the folks that are going to be that psychic vampire because they want answers and they don't understand what they're hearing I've heard that mental health counseling is actually a very good defense not just if you have mental health issues but also if you are having problems with negative energies getting your brain getting your mental health in order can be a very healthy way and good way to deal with negative energy or mental health issues both of them and there's a lot of you know professional practitioners out there that are very esoterically inclined yeah which is helpful you know getting your brain house in order can be very helpful right right now for those new witches out there that are kind of solitary out in the middle of nowhere have no Community how can you tell if it is you are going crazy or you are actually hearing Spirit or hearing ghosts or whatever you want to say as opposed to I need to go see a mental health counselor like if you don't have anybody to bounce that off how do you know if you're going nuts or if you're actually having conversation with Spirit you know what I'm saying one of the things you could do is um put on a tape recorder and then tear it apart and see if you hear voices see if you hear other thing that's go things that are going on and it really does help to have someone that you could Bounce It Off Of You know because there are times I'm going did I hear that was that real right and I got people around me you know that can help tear apart the information and stuff if you got someone that's out there so far that they're that isolated that's a scary thing cuz your brain's going to do the I need people and it might inent people and you might be out somewhere in the middle of nothing in a house that's very active and so getting someone in there as a third party or as another Observer to come in and talk to you and listen to you is important so what you're really looking for is outside confirmation yes and with the rise and popularity of paranormal investigation I mean there's paranormal groups everywhere if you look in your local Reddit or Facebook you're going to find a paranormal group that you can ask to come kind of double check your work just be sure to and investigative group that has a lot of references and really good credentials yes credentials and references you know that that kind of things you know absolutely and and for all the little young witchlet and stuff that that are looking into this stuff and doing things you remember Miss Gil you remember Miss Gale yeah so she and I worked at a bookstore together and the little witch LS would come in right and and they automatically right to the Spells and I want to do this and this and I'm like honey yeah you're running before you can walk you know and and it's the same with the Paranormal world let's not jump into something that is way beyond your capability before you even start to understand what you're doing if you can't put it away don't bring it out oh I like that and so having that conversation is good because we there's there's a lot of especially the young oh my God I did the same thing in high school we all played with the Ouija board when we shouldn't have I still play with the Ouija board look at my name behind my thing it's the Ouija board right we made our own to use in Salem that's fabulous you know I tell people I'm a human Ouija board they're like oh my God I said honey it's just words on a board right you're the conduit yes right but let's teach you how to be a good conduit before you can start pulling stuff out of your hat oh know speaking of Technology the technology aspect of this do you really have to have the equipment to GH time like is that necessary you see these what are they EVP recorders and things there's two there's two schools of thought with that like I don't need them but I'll carry around the tape recorder because then it'll pick up the things that they're they're talking about right some of the things are very helpful to have and some things are just props kind of thing that one time the apps you could get on your phone were crap crappy Oli and they refined some of them so some of them are better so if we're doing a session EVP session and let's say during the course of four or five hours we get 5050 things right 50 words that are said maybe 10% of that is appropriate and will make sense so do you have to have that stuff no if you want to prove something to somebody yes because yes you know because you could say I see this and they're gonna say okay but I didn't see it so what can you back it up with like that time sh you saw the heat figure yeah you saw that figure and then they caught it on the heat camera see that now that that double thing there where where you're getting verification is in this day and age is very helpful so it verified me to other people but it also verified me to myself yes that's where you get the I am not that [ __ ] crazy it's an important piece because I'm very skeptical of myself to say did I just say that or did I see that you know and we have a friend that's an intuitive artist and so she's gone on some some things with us and not only has she drawn what I've described she's been in a room and Drew something that I didn't tell her and that was accurate you know so so there's a lot of ways that this can be done and I think that that science and skepticism and uh mediumship kind of thing can marry well if you have people that are going to marry it well right you have some people saying well mediums and psychic are just fakes and we don't need one of those because we have our toys okay fine but can I tell you what's behind you you so it's not a bad it's a good it's just the way the nature of the things and today with the television you can't you know you can't shake a dead cat to hit a psychic medium in a paranormal shop right that's true that's true and so you know I have a a thing where say I'm throwing a cat at the television because I'm like this is making me so angry this is crazy this is crap I'm throwing the cat at the television that's it I'm done you know what are you doing but there are other places and places I've been that have a little more hype than they necessarily need or have earned kind of touristy places maybe some of the touristy places some that have had movies made after them oh are you got to name some that have earned their stripes and some that have earned some of their stripes and others are manufactured Stripes is there any place that's quote unquote too much that you just wouldn't go to I don't know oversaturated with activity so to say or a place that has scared you well um well I have some stories on so the the elemental at the Hinsdale house that scared me right good thing the Anvil was sitting in front of me because I was like leaning behind thing is looking at me and it's got these Claws and it's going with wow oh wow it's fabulous but I'll go back there in a heartbeat you know scared me but I'd go back you want another story a scary story yeah okay so we're talking 1981 into 1982 and the husband at the time I was married 14 years before I even told him I was a witch he knew I was you know she has ESP okay so we went to this I'm not going to say where it is to to look at to rent and it was out in the middle of God's green acre and we walk up on the porch and there's like you know like the doors have the little glass next to the doors yeah I look in the glass and I see a lady in a black Civil War era dress she got a shotgun in her hand on on the stairs at the bottom is the husband in seconds she told me uh she was crazy she he was was part of the Civil War she thought he was cheating on her she shot him took him out and hung him in the apple tree that was and she's looking at me she's goes don't come in here I don't like you don't come in here so of course we rented the place and she terrified me the bathroom was downstairs our bedroom was upstairs right and it had the cluster flies in one of the rooms and and my husband saying we're going to make that the nursery Over My Dead Body we're making that the nursery right and so she would stand at the end of the bed just ohz just scare the B Jesus out of me and when I would try and go down to the bathroom she would follow me and scare me so that I put a bucket in the bed in the bedroom I was like I'm not I'm not going down there anymore So eventually in in July of that July January of that year my first son was born and he was maybe just a few months old and and there there was like a kind of a kitchen place and the dining room and I could see him from the kitchen into the dining room and I was you know first time Mom what did you do you boiled everything oh no everything is getting boiled everything's getting boiled third kid here just take this okay pick it up off the floor I I hear him squeal I look out and she's pinching him and she's looking at me and she's pinching him and pinching him and I oh my God I got Goose pimples right now I ran out and pulled him out of the little rocky thing that he was in and he had all these little red wels all over him oh no I gotta leave you we got to leave him because he didn't believe me when I would tell him these things but the neighbor who lived next door had us go over one time and she says do you know about the history of that house and I said I'll tell you the history of that house the neighbors always know the dirt man she did and I said uh the man and she she hung him out in the in the apple tree she goes yeah that's true how did you know and I swear to you on all my kids lives we're talking about that and lightning hits that that apple tree oh my God oh my God so that house it's on the historical preservation kind of thing because you know back in the days they would use newspaper to use his insulation mhm there was the Gettysburg dress and all those things that were there and so the walls were covered with you know new walls and stuff but all that was still there oh wow it was a way station that was used by the Civil War wow so much history and so much haunting so much haunting she she scared me she because she I I did everything I knew in my toolbox you got to go let's help you go with the whole thing nope this is my house that was her house you were the one who had to go I had to go and I had no problem with going she's probably still there she is probably still there now when you go into do an investigation I know from TV and from stuff like that that there's different tests that people will do there's different things that you might set up yeah what is your favorite thing to do to check for a ghost or a haunting or Spirit we learned this the hard way so we were going up to a lady's house and she had told me no it's my grandmother's going to be there my grandmother mother's going to be there so she didn't say the grandmother was dead we thought the grandmother was alive we go in the front door and to the to the left of us we hear Hello and Anville and I are looking around for the lady and the owner of the house comes over and I said where' your where's Grandma she just said hello to us oh she's dead oh so we learned right away before we even get out of the car and and this has happened at a few houses soon as we open the door of the car we get stuff right away so tests there's all kinds of funny little tests get your recorder going I mean we've done the baby powder test we've done we've done that we've done the baby powder test well you know people say well there's always somebody walking through the hallway okay we'll put some baby powder down we've done the you know put a ball down draw circles around it see if it moves we've done that we've done the flashlight thing I don't think we've ever had much success with the flashlight thing so much now the flashlight thing is that where you like lightly unscrew the the light so it's just barely on and then as it you know you ask yes or no questions and have the light go on and off yeah and I'm there's a part of me that's going maybe maybe not maybe they're maybe manipulating it somehow you know that kind of thing there are a lot of things that people do and I guess it's really personal preference on what kind of a a test you want to do because if it doesn't nothing happens are you g to as some of the shows do they fix it in post and then something happens I've heard that and otherwise you say we didn't get it yeah but like you said maybe some like today could be an inactive day but tomorrow could be active like a dinner party absolutely absolutely you would say clear audience is more one of your big things is listening for them I think that's it's going to help the scientific part because you're going to get something on there right and the psychic part is going to help because then you can direct traffic oh we here if you go to our YouTube page there's a family we I used to go to with a team we had several years we would go every year and I and I still read for her now and her son had passed from an illness and we were talking to him and he he saids some words to us and I'm not going to tell you what they are I'm going to let you go and find out and her confirmation was that was the only thing he could eat oh so when you get that that to me that verification is better than a test because that's that's honest verification right there right right and it allows the family to go we've connected that's what they said and that you know sounded like him and etc etc and doing a test that maybe you'll get things but do you have a favorite test that you like to do no but uh you kind of intrigued me with the EVP thing because I had an interesting EVP my first ever I think um when I went to the wh house in San Francisco I'd like to go there oh it was wonderful I loved it shell and I were going to be talk well I was going to be talking about it on our podcast and since it was just an hour or so away from where I lived at the time I figured I would go check it out and oh it was wonderful I had such a great time and I walked around and took lots of pictures and I saw Zero ghosts I may have been tapped on the shoulder by a ghost possibly but I was a little disappointed there weren't really too many Vibes couple little things maybe but shell and I were talking we were doing the episode and I was telling the story about how the wh House was built on the hanging grounds where they used to yes the judge a whole bit yeah yes and so Yankee Jim I think his name was very tall gentleman was hung there and because he was much taller than the average man his toes touch the ground the ground and it took a very long time and it's his ghost that a lot of people see so I'm telling this story to Shell and I said they the historians don't know for sure if it was a tree that they used for the hang or if they built a scaffolding to do it and so we we talk about this and we finish the story and so later I'm editing the episode and when I get to that spot after I say you know and they're not sure which one they used and so there's just speculation at this point there's a little dead air before shell starts talking and there's a little tiny squiggle of sound I'm like well that's weird so I blow it up and it's a man's voice and he says scaffolding scaffolding that's fabulous I love that I have it I will send it to you oh that's so fabulous that's the only time I've ever caught an EVP or anything like that and it's very clearly someone saying scaffolding and I just thought that was the coolest thing see now I see them I actually see things more so than here and you know when I was younger you know 18 or so 19 20 my grandfather used to always come but he'd stand in my doorway you know we were all just getting into the the witch thing and the Pagan community and I was like you know this is kind of interesting but people are going to think I'm just saying this Lea comes over one day to my apartment and she's like there is a man standing in your doorway and he is tall and he looks like this and he's dressed like that I pull out a picture and I'm like is this the man you see and she's like yeah that's him I'm like oh my God that's my grandfather but what he would do is I would go to bed at night and like you know how sometimes you like kind of fluff the covers over you and let them kind of like settle down on you yeah it would be like he would lay on top of me and my blankets would like almost like suction to my skin okay and I would feel a weight on me and then it'd get to a point where I knew it was him and I knew that it was and I would just be like look you need to get off me because I need to go to bed and it was like theight the weight lifted and he'd stand in the doorway but Lea has seen him my ex-husband has seen him like several people had seen him but in the beginning I thought that it was just almost me desperate to see my grandpa yeah until other people acknowledged it and I'd show them a picture and they'd be like that's exactly who I say that I love that a lot the interesting thing about EVPs there's a couple things of that one is you you know you're going to have so many hours that you're going to go do an investigation whether it's an hour or 10 hours MH it could take you two to three hours to go through an hour it's very tedious it's very time consuming and you want to have someone else listen to it too because our brain does chuds trying to make sense of all this stuff you know I think he's saying he wants a tuna sandwich I think he says he wants to go to the tuna you know I want to go and play golf you know so so you know you want to do that kind of stuff the other thing with me a friend of mine that we've done investigations together and whenever he's going through this stuff he says I always have a a bunch of dead people with me the time I have my own little bunch of people that all time so we never know what they're saying talking to me all the time and what you're get and so I've done other podcast and had people contact me and say we're hearing voices so you might hear something in this you might I wouldn't be surprised my God it's wonderful and the nice thing about seeing something like what you did sh is it gives you some some relief ah right and valid we need to have boundaries like MH my bedroom's off limits a lot of times they come and talk to me in the bathroom in my car and so my bedroom's my bedroom it's off limits so if something does come in my bedroom I know it's serious enough that I need to know I'm going to see a client in the next few days that it's going to be something serious because they don't cross that boundary and so I tell everybody you got to have boundaries you don't want to be a big old sponge and you're the living they're not you got to say Here's My Line in the Sand and at the time you know to be kind of honest with it kind of creeped me out that my grandpa was in my bedroom while I was like changing my clothes and you know and I was just like you know there's a threshold and we need to you need to stay there and and this is but you know there's also like you said that quote unquote emergency situation where that Spirit has to go through that threshold to be like hey yes this is urgent yes yes it's true and for for ESS of living you know one of the things I tell anybody investigators or clients that I see the biggest thing with all this because you're using energy and there's their energy and your energy and the whole thing that you got to ground this stuff out and if you don't you don't want a psychic hangover it's like the flu and a hangover on steroids right what's your advice on that everybody I say when we done you're going to hydrate the crap out of yourself not with alcohol you're going to hydrate the crap out of yourself with some kind of liquid and you're going to eat something that's going to put you on your butt I want you drooling in the corner because you want to get rid of this stuff and I tell clients all the time when I'm doing readings I'm not going to remember you the propensity for me to remember what I said to you it's not my message I'm not going to remember it for you and so I've got clients that I've had for decades and some I look at and go oh it's our first time no you've been seeing me for years oh okay and sometimes someone they'll come in sit down and everything will come right back oh okay BL BL blah I say that's how I protect myself and I think as people like ourselves that are magically inclined we need to have that that boundary barrier set up so that we can take care of ourselves so that we can help others I'm so glad that you mentioned grounding grounding at the end of any kind of working whether it's spellwork or ritual or working with Spirits or ghost hunting doing some type of cleansing and grounding can be so important and sometimes it's as easy as having something to eat hydrating we talked about that before as cakes and Ale at the end of doing spell work or rituals um is there anything else that you would recommend to help people some people like stones you know and look I am old school any stone can be programmed to do anything you want it to do you know right because it's not oh you know well you got to have it in a silk scarf and it can only be stop okay take your cards play with them let other people play with them those those are your Stones you can do whatever you want and if this helps you to feel like you're grounded stick it in your pocket put it under your pillow you know it it's a psychological thing as well as a magical thing right and so some prayer work is helpful one thing I do when I do a house party or I'm doing a fair or I go to a haunted house when I get ready to leave I on on the rug I my feet you stay here you don't come with me nice make a little static charge almost I love that yeah because you want to you want to establish a you know yeah suffer that tie absolutely and when I get in the car we do Another Blessing okay you can't come in the car with me you know because they like to come in the car with you dead folks like to travel in the cars with me some people like to have their loved ones in their car with them fine let them in your heart you know but I'm I'm at a location I don't want that coming home with me right boundaries boundaries are important in real world and magical world I've actually pretended like I'm using scissors cutting a cord and kind of severed that like like visually severed that tie like I was cutting with scissors um because that's important to kind of you stay here I'm leaving now that Mind Body Connection is so important so that that symbology of the scissors is fabulous you can use I mean I know some people like to use smoke or incense to separate you can use black salt salt music I love music there's nothing like playing a song you love really high and singing movement movement and and dancing is always good laughing is a very good way to move the energy around let's not forget what you said and one of Shell's favorite ways to get rid of spirits is just to tell them to get the [ __ ] out here's the boundary I'm saying get out we're done there's that's very powerful you put meaning behind that that can be extremely powerful one thing that I've dealt with on a few occasions when someone is being affected that almost acts like a drug and they're like I want this gone but I want to I want to do it I want to do it I want to experience it and I'm like but we've chased them away if you start calling them back that's on you right right you you you can't be on one page saying this is scaring the hell out of my family but I like the high it gives me right and because then okay then what do you want have a cake and eat it too exactly that you're you're you're doing your own your own self-fulfilling prophecy right there yeah you're saying go away go away go away come here come here come here yeah it's not fair and little people are so open until they get deprogrammed you know so I I what I tell parents all the time is if you say the kid is saying to you I see this over here in the corner and you say to that little person well can you put a clown's nose on them can you put a wig on there can you change their clothes oh yeah it's imaginary if they're going she's always in the closet this is what she's wearing this is always what she's saying this right then we've got some validation we can start to address it and look at those things even though paranormal is a lot more mainstream than it has been kids suck and they're mean right yeah that's true and so I got grounded a lot as a kid because I thought all kids talk to dead people and you're not supposed to tell people that they grandparents are standing B right so you know in in this day and age the wanting to join the hand wagon is Big so I say to people you know when I say I think he's a grandparent that's come back or he's he's someone else that's been reincarnated that's what they're telling me right well you don't want to say hey you're your grandfather you're going to want to you're going to want to watch and see if he does anything that is indicative of what that person did or if they say to you I have memories of this this and this you don't want to feed anybody anything it's like when you're doing an investigation you try not to to feed oh I heard a noise so that's what it is or right Bob is that Bob it's Bob right well we don't know if it's Bob we don't know if there is a bob right so so part of it is television and part of it psychologically trying to hook you in right so you want to be careful you want to be careful when you're doing this stuff that you try not to feed more than it is I like that yeah I like that a lot because you don't want to feed into an imagination right you're looking to see what's true like with shell she didn't show me a picture she asked me what I saw what this person looked like and so I gave her that information and then she's like okay and then whipped out the picture and showed me you know not the other way around when you know somebody that there's verify that either they died you you have a body right right you know that's dead there if they give you some kind of acknowledgement you know that's that's good and that's wonderful right but you don't want to go right out of the gate and go okay so that's Bob and Bob was Bob what are you trying to tell us are you trying to tell us you're demon what's going don't be presumptive oh good way to say it don't presume that that it's going to be what you think or expect it to be yeah guess that goes back to being a skeptic like we were talking about at the beginning you have to have a hefty a healthy skepticism and a healthy mindset I think going into this because if you get OV excited about hey I'm doing investigation I'm seeing ghosts you know you can taint what you're looking for you know and get results that aren't going to be as satisfying I think one of the things that makes me a little crazy we're going to do an investigation we're going to go there and we hear a noise then we run wait you asked him to make a noise they made a noise why are you running away H that's making no sense to me wait you're here to do a job and you're trying to figure this out and oh my goodness they made a noise and we got it's all fun games until you [ __ ] around and find out well that's it you're right and people by Nature we like to be scared we like to have that Adrenaline Rush more than anything else there's a thrill to it there's a huge thrill to it until it really happens right right and then there's a time and a place when you're going to want to run right but get to that place you know get there and enjoy the experience yes you're G you can get scared by some of these things I don't like to work in the dark couple reasons one I see things during the day I don't need to have it dark two I'm clumsy and I fall down I don't want to be running around in the dark looking for something that's darker than dark that always makes me crazy have you ever been scared enough that you wanted to run from an investigation I don't I don't think so the thing at the Hinsdale house unnerved me and he says you want to stay tonight I said no I'm good I had he because you can stay overnight and I said I'm good right it didn't scare me off it just okay but I don't think I've had anything that I've run from where I said the the one place I was talking about with the child that died something started growling at one of my co- teen people there and I charged after that thing you ain't going to be doing that in this house oh no you're not you don't know I think on one of your bios it says you're like the mama of the group it sounds like you're the mama bear oh man well you know pterodactyl is my power animal for a reason oh I love that they don't call me Medusa for nothing so nothing yet I would like to get to that place I would really like to get to that place where I've experienced something that is so outrageous that it scares the hell out of me I I want that because I want that validation and I want to be able to see what that is so I can pick it apart to see okay how do I do it that's why I want to go with you know some of these going on exorcism or go on participate in exorcism ISM I get a little crazy when people in the Paranormal Community say there's only one way no no no no no no no no I can make holy water just like you can right and and this faith has a way of dealing with negative things just like you do so no you don't have the all encompassing only way to me that's elitist and power over and we know yeah we know where that all comes from power over and we know what happen with that I'm looking at my husband going is there place I run out I don't there something at the Park View nothing that scared you to run away from it but had pre riled up oh sure I remember what that was you guys were chasing it all the way out at the park the Park View which is down in oigo before they redid it and made the rooms hotel rooms we you could investigate there and we got some wild stuff there and I seen things there that would you know W makes me want to stay there oh my God I just want to stay there now because I because it's not like they're going anywhere right there used to be a bathroom upstairs and I went in I saw the woman giving herself an abortion That's Heavy That's Heavy and then the owner came up and said and up here in this bathroom there were women would do self- abortions I said yeah I know I can see it you know so I don't need the dark don't and I don't want to play around in the dark because I'm clumsy and I fall down and I know it makes great television and I know people say well Spirits are more active when it's dark they don't [ __ ] care and they don't know if it's light or dark it's time is different for them than us so you know oh see I get on my high horse now do you have any places upcoming that you're going to be investigating we've got some private homes that we're going to be doing I can't really tell you much about them but we've got three homes that we're supposed to be going to and one place I'm trying to get back into that we've already discussed in this program wi wi I'm G to approach them it's been 42 years since I've been to that location so oh wow let's see what they'll do they'll let me no people can hire you to come investigate their private home I don't charge for that now there are some people out there that do charge for those things we don't charge for that if they want to give us a donation for gas money give me 10 bucks for gas fine you know when I when I go out to cleanse a house or if I go out to do a blessing or if I just come out to say take a look C to see if we want to do a fill bone investigation I can't ethically charge for that I don't feel that that's right that's part of my clergy Services how I look at it nice one last question as a psychic medium what are your favorite or what are your most used divination tools like do you do tarot or what's what's your what's your favorite way to do divination so sometimes when you're getting ready to do a reading with somebody and you're looking at them right and you know you're looking through them and you're getting all this stuff and people get a little nervous the hell right so I'll throw some cards down some tarot cards down because that'll keep them occupied right occupied and might look at some past present future stuff in the cards because then it's a conversation and the door just opens and there people come in and by then like they're comfortable and I can bring their people in so that's fine for my own divination I use runes and I use animal cards I like to use dowsing rods I like a pendulum you know those are those are nice ways to communicate with things and they're good yes and no answers you know especially dowsing rods are people and they don't even have to tell me the question they just have to tell me when they're done you know I don't have to know the thing I don't particularly want to know somebody's last name I don't want them to say well you Googled me no I I don't want to know your last name the last information upfront the better the better the better you know we're not 100% And I could tell you something and it's going to happen five years from now and I get people all the time call me said oh you told me this I didn't believe him and oh my God and then it happened right and so everybody's got their own little particular bent some people might want to do some Sage first or some P Santo they might want to do some prayer have ADD it whatever works for you works for you who cares how you get to the source as long as you get to the source noonnie I haven't been able to catch up with you in a little bit and I have to make a confession I just got my I think 293rd Tarot deck you sound like my husband I have I have addiction issues serious addiction issues he also has addiction issues yeah it is it is funny we're we're doing an event at the sci-fi horror Fest up at the um what's the name of that casino bur down burning downs and we love it we love going there right and so this year he's selling a lot of tarot decks he's been bringing them in by the Dozen we and I've got a lot of them too but here's the interesting thing some decks talk more than others we all know that right absolutely so I was using one deck for decades right and I have other decks but it was predominantly and then my husband pulled out a deck and I went oh my God that's talking to me give it to me and it was the first deck he ever used well almost 30 years ago oh wow and so I'm using that to this day what sharing what deck it is know it's the sacred Rose deck okay and some decks are more chatty than others and some have beautiful artwork and so 93 decks I can appreciate that no 293 that's fabulous no I no I really I have an issue Alani
