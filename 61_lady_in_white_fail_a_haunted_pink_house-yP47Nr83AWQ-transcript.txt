getting higher than a proverbial kite I'm Leila and I'm over here getting we had a listener that that what do he call us getting higher than a rhino oh yeah he smoked enough to kill a rhino I'm over here smoking enough to kill a rhino tonight like rhinos are dying from trying to keep up with smoking what I'm smoking tonight well I can barely contain myself sh because I want to show you something so before we get into mine what the [ __ ] are you smoking okay this I first of all this is almost half a story in and of itself so you have something to show me too I have I have a I have a couple things and one of them is what I'm smoking and half of it just the name so remember remember last week when I told you I veered off course and of and kind of stumbled upon a new store yes and they were very very cheap and you were loving it we all know you have known me for so many decades you know that sometimes I have gone quantity over quality oh oh absolutely you are a size queen it's but this it was high quality High quantity low low prices those are all my favorite things shell what have you got who smoked enough to come up with this name okay well you and I have gotten pretty high and come up with some pretty wild names so hopefully it's as good as something we come up with you know this is this is actually not something you and I would have come up with this is something that probably the men in our lives would have come up with uh oh good thing we have a not safe for work rating this is this is called banana pudding Tang oh okay no no I must note that I am saying this properly it's not banana pudding Tang it's pudding Tang ends with an n p u d d i n t a i n PUD puding Tain qu now you know I'm here I'm here at the store looking through the menu and we all know it's shell come on folks I'm looking at THC numbers but you're also like a good name you do like a good name there is the occasion where I see a name and the number don't matter but listen up friends not only did I get an ounce of the banana pudding tan for the low low price of2 15 which in Massachusetts nice because remember remember I was doing the eight for 288 so 2115 come on now that is cheap so my my my banana pudding Tain my ounce was 215 and this [ __ ] has so remember I told you about the labels last week total cannaboids 31.25 so we got thca 30.10 THC 9.44 now you know because I have chronic back issues which BL it actually has a cbda of 0.10 so I'm getting high my back's feeling good and it tastes good it doesn't taste like banana godamn it that makes me sad why would you call it banana and not make it taste like banana you hate that when something has a fruit name and it doesn't taste like that fruit anything called grapes you make me angry yeah that's one of Shell's big no no don't name it after a food unless it's going to taste like that food that's why I like the lemon stuff because I actually taste citrusy but hi THC Rock and name low low price and I got a 10% off coupon for my next purchase sweet [ __ ] sweet even better a deal who doesn't love that okay it doesn't taste like bananas does it taste like pudding Tain yeah I'd say it tastes like some pudding Tain sure very nice you're getting pretty high I see you got some glassy squinty there very high and one thing I've started to notice store-bought weed has to be ground you can't stuff and pack with these like me in my old days this can't be stuffed and packed you have to grind it bottom much denser much much denser nugs that is the popular way to go so that's what they're going to sell plus I really think a lot of East Coast weed is kind of stale West Coast weed and so it's kind of condensed down it's drier listen to your Elite self oh your East Coast weed is just our leftovers from like like no hey if the old weed fits but not all of it I know not all of it is especially in Massachusetts you guys are fabulous for people growing seed to sale you know same place grows it and sells it so I I know I'm talking a little bit out my ass there I'll be honest with I'll be honest with you I don't know if this store makes the swed um I I have no idea the popular one now whether it's dry or not I'm just kind of being an [ __ ] but the popular way to do it now is to grow it's the denser stickier harder nugs that's what people expect to see like we've talked about in previous episodes people are looking for pretty I just want to get high I don't give a [ __ ] if I'm getting popcorn nugs or an eighth in one big nug it's like the visual is what's important to them 100% [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] you and I have found some damn good deals on Smalls because people want the big pretty bud in the little tiny glass jar and so I'll buy pre-ground I'll buy Smalls all day long if it's got the taste and the THC I am so there don't care what it looks like you know how I look at pre-round hey you saved me a step you saved me a step thank you exactly I used to be a snob and I would not touch pre-round I was sure that it was just their leftover leafy shake that was going to be [ __ ] and I have been disappointed yet yeah no I think they just got they're just paying someone to sit in the back of that warehouse with a big old grinder and just po butt and like grinding that [ __ ] all day long I think you're absolutely right and I'm sure it's going to depend on where you go make sure you go to someplace reputable right but the the places that I've gone to and gotten pre-round have been fantastic so I have to I have to just quick I have to mention this I I don't want to go into too much detail because it's absolutely a visual and that's not fair to our listeners but you know I've gone on and on and on almost since day one about this silicone pipe that I just I can't I can't get my hands off it you know I was such a glass person I was such a glass snob but you give me an unbreakable pipe with a cap on it that's like gold man that's gold so you know I I've given this thing the good life that it deserved so I went to the store this weekend no you retired just that you've had that silicone pipe that's practically an extension of your hand I know right right I got a new one no way oh I got to see this is it is it cute is it bigger is it different see you know my favorite color is green absolutely always has been always has been so I have to go with it so you know my my traditional I had the original green and black which you can see I have a little resin stain on the top of on the top and you know these silicone pipes they're pretty much the size and shape are the same um you're not really veering far from that but this is like a lavender and neon green look how pretty that looks like a pretty spring crocus flower right there look at you with your new spring pipe that's beautiful that's exactly what I was thinking I'm like that looks like one of those snow crocuses I actually haven't smoked it yet and was going to it is pristine clean beautiful I just purchased this like 24 hours ago and I have not packed it yet and was actually going to pack it while we chat tonight with my with my banana poang I [ __ ] love that that's awesome you're gonna christen your pipe on air [ __ ] yes bring it you know for for all of our listeners out there lavender and neon green pipes they actually work it actually works together soy and like I've said a thousand times before you can't go wrong with a a pipe that has a cap so you can cap it put it in your pocket for on the-go life so nice so now you said that you had some surprises do tell do tell well I've mentioned before a delivery service that I've started using while I'm here called Hot Box you've mentioned it a few times love their stuff great customer service I just love their name if you're gonna call yourself hot box I'm buying friends they've already started their 420 Specials and they actually have a box like what do you mean a box like a box oh my God that's like a shoe box of weed it's gorgeous it flips open F I gotta say folks I know you can't see this but I like the sexy devil girl on the on the box she's hot we should put some pictures up on our Instagram inside this beautiful box are nine jars what of different kinds of topshelf weed no wait wait wait wait did you get to pick or was it random there were they have two different boxes one is their upper mids and one is their top shelf and the upper mids wait you got nine8 yes do you know here in Massachusetts you can't get more than a than than than an ounce in Okay so have two different ones they have um they had the top shelf and then they had the upper mids and I I did end up going with the upper mids and the reason was because the top shelf was $420 for just over an ounce 420 for like an ounce and a quarter is is what it came out to the weights it's about an ounce and a quarter so not too bad actually pretty damn good price the uh upper mids that I got again an ounce and a fat quarter on sale paid $130 for this are you I can't I can't speak what I know you paid 130 bucks I was going I was just going there to buy an ounce and I was going to spend about 120 bucks on a a mid upper mid ounce wait did they also deliver this to you they did right to the door where I'm staying and you got you got 98 for 130 bucks delivered to your door they're fatter than e they're bigger than eigh so it comes out to be like an ounce and a quarter I don't have words yeah and I got it to lard I don't have words on sale for $130 I could not pass that up now talk to me about how it smokes is it worth like I have no words like what is like is it good like like what it has been an absolute dream I started in the top left corner with train wreck and then I move on to my next one which is London pound cake and gelonade 2 which you know I love me some gelato the next row we've got some jack hair another favorite of mine ruthless Gary Payton outdoor I have no idea who Gary Payton is never had that before or why he's Outdoors or why he's Outdoors Cherry Bomb one of my current favorites gushers and then last but not least octane so I have been having an absolute freaking blast trying each and every one of these different cultivars and I love the box I love the box I love the jars I'm going to reuse it and I'm getting [ __ ] high because this is fabulous it's like a Sherie Board of weed and I wish you were here to share it with me I'm so sad you're not here I I I wish our listeners could see my face right now because I just had to pick my jaw up off the floor Upstate New York represent thank you so much HotBox this is an amazing amazing deal and I cannot believe the prices it's blowing my mind right now I I I have no words who knew that New York state would come through like this I mean I fully expected that they would go the other way I thought that being this new in their whole recreational stage that they'd be at the $300 midrange you know the $200 $250 mid-range ounces oh no there okay in true New York Fashion and I can say this is a is a four decade New Yorker they're just trying to suck you in so that once they got you sucked in they're going to go up to $500 an out that's the New York way it's quite possible thankfully most regions don't go that way most of them don't hopefully here in New York state it won't I do believe they're going to start having um consumption lounges in the local area uh they've been approved to consumption lounges where you can bring your own and just kind of hang out and smoke there I'm really loving the culture I also hope I'm here long enough there's something called the Lilac craft fair here in Rochester which is a cannabis Farmers Market are you [ __ ] me I am not [ __ ] you shell they have Farmers from all over Upstate come to this craft fair they have local dispensaries come it's just an amazing amazing time they even have a quiet hour shopping before it gets super busy and they have the bands and everybody comes so if you're you know if you want to just go get your you're like me you're a little introverted you just want to go get your good [ __ ] weed maybe talk to a farmer or two and get the [ __ ] out before there's too many people you could do that I I can't hear this anymore because we left New York shell and it got really great as far as cannabis goes I am super impressed I mean I've never in my life really had a whole heck of a lot of wonderful things to say about the great state right but anyway I'm going to start with some gelonade too and my stories today are actually starting in New York and um one of them turned out to be a real bummer so I'm packing some amazing weed well I guess I'll just stick with my banana pudding Tain darn I want a hot box hot boox come to Massachusetts I'm begging you so I will have to bring I'll have to get another one hot box I'll be calling you up for the the beautiful 420 version and we'll bring that over and share a shuer board of highend weed with shell ah oh my God we should totally do that actually we should get together again and I'll grab a hot box and you grab some weed from one of your favorite places and we'll just sit there and we'll just like the whole episode we'll just like giggle we'll talk about some of our own ghost stories we'll try like a we'll try like a an EMP session or an EMF session what is that where you try to EMF session session like word thing we'll do some EMF ghost hunting try to find some ghosts while we smoke a [ __ ] ton of weed from hot box and from your new favorite place I just I just have a sneaking suspicion that this is going to be like our Ouija board episode of [ __ ] around and find out I have a feeling we would probably get a lot more I have a good feeling about it so I'm smoking the gelonade 2 right now and this is really I thought it was the octane at first because it has that you know when you like smell gasoline you know it has that it has that taste you know that really high octane kind of taste but delicious very very good oh and I would like to point out to everybody you know we we we've said this before generally uh due to my location I do the majority of my smoking prior and and and after and don't always have the chance to smoke during recording whereas Lea puffing on that bong like it's her job um but tonight I am actually I I am I am recording in a location where I can smoke while we're recording so that's contributing to the highness but yeah I I I'm just happy that I'm actually able to smoke with you tonight me too yay love it so so my story this evening is another lady in white story you and your damn lady in whites like I think it's an obsession it is at this point it absolutely is an obsession and someone should probably suggest something different because I have like three more lady in white Legends lined up please people give her other ideas give me a different suggestion if she if she tells one more Lady in White story she's going to be the next lady in white oh that's creepy oh that's dark shell that's so dark so this is in Rochester New York which is Upstate New York on the shores of Lake Ontario and this also happens to be the home of the fox sisters if you are into any type of spiritualism the three Fox sisters practically invented yeah spiritualism in the United States they like helped spread it across the whole the whole us but it also is a home of a local Legend called the lady in white of Durand Eastman Castle o is it a real castle you know I love castles well we'll get there we'll get there so this kind of goes along it with one of these stories as a bummer and that's why I got a second one but anyway Rochester New York is very very old like many parts of New York and Durand Eastman Park um was purchased in the early 1900s by Dr Henry S Durand and his friend George Eastman and so they bought up a whole bunch of farms in the area and some swamp land that was on the edges of Lake Ontario and turned it into a park for the neighborhoods Legend has it that there was originally a castle a very large grand house in that area and a woman named Alysa lived there with her husband and their daughter rumor has it that the husband either cheated on the wife and took off or just abandoned his wife and family and left the mother Alyssa became very very bitter well of course because he was a dick right so this extended to her daughter she was desperately afraid that her daughter would leave her and so she was very very overprotective particularly about men she told her daughter repeatedly men are going to leave you they're going to break your heart they just want to use you don't trust men now of course the daughter being young and beautiful had to go out was constantly out had a lot of suitors and didn't really want to listen to her mother she became a little too interested in a local boy and her mother locked her in a room in the castle and forbid her from seeing this boy and to make sure SS very sounds very like like Rapunzel to me very much so to make sure that her daughter didn't escape and that no boys came on the castle grounds she got two large dogs and would often Patrol outside the castle castle and along the lake shore now of course the young daughter being very resourceful be threaten the dogs and get out that's right get the [ __ ] out not keeping us there and no one was keeping our Rochester Rapunzel in the castle she decided she's getting the [ __ ] out the mother discovers she's gone and tears the castle apart looking for her and then starts looking for her on the grounds of the castle and all along the lake she's distraught she's upset she is livid with rage cannot find her daughter anywhere now the legend differs here some say that the mother did find the daughter and her lover and the dogs tore the boy apart and she locked the girl in the tower until she died that's freaking vicious Jesus some say she never found either of them ever again some say that she found them and the boy was raping the girl so there's a lot of different things here but most of them say that the girl either died or was never seen again and the mother in her sorrow and in her grief continued to walk up and down the shores of the lake and around the grounds of the castle relentlessly all day and all night with her dogs until she passed away of grief then after her death people would continue to see her all in white with her two white German shepherds or two white Doberman coming from the lake or walking up the beach and walking around the legend goes was even further to say that if she sees young couples come to this park you know after the the houses were torn down and it was turned into this park by Dr Durand and Eastman people would continue to see her ghost and young couples would go there in the 20s and 30s to make out and this ghost If It Came Upon a young man and a young woman would uh attack the man and so there's several stories of her attacking young men in the woods that have gone there with their girlfriends the continues to this day people continue to say that they see the lady in white coming from the lake so this is a pretty popular Park and you can see the walls these are the ruins of the castle ooh that's pretty looks like a foundation like the first floor all Stone of a castle and there's even like a round tower part of this wall probably the base of it maybe probably like the the quote unquote Sellar area there are some rumors I I did ask quite a few local people about this Legend and if they'd ever seen the ghost and a lot of people have heard of it including from the aronda historical society and there's also ghost hunting tours that go on in the area and they have also spoken about the lady in white here so a lot of people talk about this Lady of the Lake or lady in white by the lake there's only one problem but as you know shell almost all of these lady in white stories follow a similar path path and this story follows the path a relationship problem then she lost a child both of those are lady and white tropes these are lady and white Traditions right however they all usually have a kernel of Truth they all like the devil's elbow one you found a woman had been murdered and her husband had been murdered there the Texas lake a woman had drowned you know they have a story where it began you know maybe the sightings are or aren't true but there's always an actual event that precipitated The Legend This one doesn't have one no one can find any evidence that anyone died there that anyone's daughter disappeared from there and the castle it was built in the 1930s what to be part of a concession stand the popular style at the time was to build some of these Park features in like a Spanish style and so they built it to to look very imposing and in stone but on top of it was just built a little wooden concession stand and it was a picnic area for people to come on the park to hang out by the lake it was never a castle not even a grand house it's just a picnic area and when the concession stand burned down they just never replaced it no one died there there is no lady there was no great lady I'm pretty sure from all the res Arch I could do and and I corroborated this again with the Historical Society in Arondo which is right next to Rochester and while I could find a lot of people that were told the story most people were told the story either by a parent to get them to stay inside their tent when they went camping or to not go there with their boyfriend or they were told by a um a brother or a sister to scare the pants off them right right but I could not find any firsthand account of anyone seeing a ghost there just slightly different versions of the same kind of story that's always been told so I'm pretty darn sure that this is a dud it's just an urban legend that grew up around possibly the castle and possibly because it was a makeout spot in the 60s and 70s every everything goes back to a make out spot a dating spot let's go park right exactly so was kind of disappointed that my lady in white story here was just a big flop right and and then I remembered that not too far from here is a cemetery where I actually had a paranormal experience well someone I was with had a paranormal experience oh so when I was in I think it was in Middle School not even a teenager probably maybe a tween I was at a sleepover at a friend's house and a bunch of us were together and she had an older sister who decided to take us all out to a cemetery in penan New York this Cemetery was home to a very mysterious headstone of a woman named Matilda Gillette Matilda or Tilly as she was called lived between 1859 and 1936 as it says very clearly on her headstone but shortly after she was buried there in the granite of The Headstone a woman's head appeared a face appeared on the granite that's weird right so the family tried to buff it out and it came back Oh weird and then weird things started happening there like a boy spit on it and then he tripped shortly after that and broke his arm another boy kicked it and then later that same day broke his leg oh I know some people would talk about having parties there and I know some people would like pour alcohol on the stone kind of laughing one guy in particular who said he did that the very next day he caught like the worst case of the flu ever he was like puking he could not keep food down for like a whole week ah so the theory is I guess Tilly had a bad relationship with her husband and he had died before she did but she still never forgave him and she vowed to like haunt him forever I guess which doesn't really make sense since he died first but that's how the story goes shortly after she died that face appeared I'm going to share my screen with you again so you can see this because it's really freaky and of course of course my friend's sister is regaling us all with all the times that she or her friends have been to this Stone and something weird has happened we don't all entirely believe it so we get to this cemetery and we we're walking around and here's here's the Gillette Stone and can you see this here shelle yeah what is I'm gonna like this is her hair this is her neck she's looking up I see it yeah oh that's weird right so you can clearly see her face so when we went there we all kept daring each other to touch the stone or to go up to it and I wouldn't I could feel a Vibe right right it it was different now at this time I had started being a you know I was a wannabe photographer and I was big into taking black and white photographs and and doing all sorts of you know pictures like that in graveyards most of the time I wasn't scared I liked graveyards they didn't creep me out or anything you know it was just a a quiet nice place to be for me so it wasn't that I was in a a graveyard and I was spooked this grave and gravestone definitely had an aura about it I wouldn't say evil or bad it was just really really creepy and felt like something was there so I wasn't going near it and you have kind of disappeared that was weird what happened I don't know you were talking and all of a sudden it shut off and just said connecting that's so weird so I showed you the face you showed me the face and then you said that you didn't like the vibe so you wouldn't touch it you were getting kind of sketched out yeah so I totally sketched out not going to touch anything I'm not going there so my friend whose sister had brought us there she was kind of a badass reminds me a little bit of you and so she went except I don't think you would have been this dumb even at like 12 or 13 years old she went up to this Tombstone and said something basically to the effect of I don't [ __ ] believe in ghosts and slapped the face oh [ __ ] yeah no no no I could feel it it's like a bell rang in the cemetery and I could feel the reverberation go through my body I can almost feel it now just talking about it I hope you ran it's strange because one of the kids with us did and it literally was not physically that loud when she slapped the stone it was just like a slap sound against the stone but it was almost like the hair rang like a bell it was very very strange and one of my friends kind of fell backwards and took off he was that scared anyway so nothing else seemed to happen and we kind of continued to tease each other as we're leaving the cemetery just before we get to the car my friend screamed and put her hand up to her face I look at her as she's screaming and her whole side of her face flushed bright red just one side and it was the weirdest thing we're all like what happened what happened back I thought maybe she'd gotten stung by a bee or something no [ __ ] joke when that redness went down she literally had a welt handprint on her face like someone had slapped her back across the face now if that's not a [ __ ] around and find out moment nothing is I have never seen a ghostly repercussion that fast probably before or it still to this day blows my mind when the wel came the wel came and it looked just like a handprint oh [ __ ] five fingers in all oh [ __ ] yeah so we never went back she kind of cursed herself on that one she really did so the white lady was kind of a flop but it's not too far from the penan cemetery where you can go see the face in the grave on Matilda gillette's grave and I'm not exactly sure what the curse is but the face is definitely there and it seems to keep coming back despite the fact that they have changed the stone more than once and they keep trying to buff it out but I would not [ __ ] around and find out with it because that one's pretty potent yeah right jeez wow so there's my stories for Upstate New York and I I swear please someone send me a direction to go in so I can spare shell the like 50 million lady in white ghost stories I have lined up Lord or or she's going to just start talking about orbs again I think right I'm so disappointed in this lady in white story I'm ready to go in a different direction I think you know I came across this place called The Old Pink House this is down in Savannah Georgia I'm sensing a theme here we've got the banana PUD andain and a pink house and a pink house or am I reaching you're you're spring I'm Twitter ped what are you gonna do this house actually predates America folks what a Pink House That predates America this house was built in 1771 and and they painted it pink well actually no and there's a story that's part of it I'm getting there okay it is pink but they didn't paint it pink but it is pink it was actually a Gregorian style Mansion like I said 1771 okay and I can't remember the year but there was have you heard of the big Savannah fire were like pretty much all of Savannah Georgia Burnt to the ground oh yeah yeah I have heard of that this was one of the only buildings in the whole city to survive oh wow okay so very old house and it survived the Savannah fire it did but that kind of plays into some of the hauntings it was the originally the home of joose Joseph Habersham how do I get the bad names that I can't pronounce Joseph Habersham he built this house originally like I said 1771 and he lived there until he died in 1802 first of all one of the stories goes that he hanged himself in the basement oh that's gruesome so there's that and and you know people who go in tragic ways tend to leave a residue right right he kind of had a weird story that is sad this guy was like a big huge monarchist came over from England you know he came to America he supposedly sent the first bales of cotton back to England very loyal to the crown very very loyal um and was very proud of it okay so he had two sons and his fate would have it his sons uh were a part part of the opposite side of the Revolutionary War it kind of came down to fathers against you know father against sons and sons against father yeah so it is one of the the themes goes because you know how some of these stories are you get different views on it but one of one of the stories was he was so distraught by the sons which back then that was kind of life-changing that he just you know got a rope and that was that so the the theory is that he was so upset that his sons were on opposite political sides that he offed himself in the basement well and it probably didn't help that his sons ended up on The Winning Side oh gotcha gotcha gotcha okay you know that that's kind of a a buzz kill you know when you're when you're trying to sway your children and make them do what you want to do and then in the end your children are right you know that's a tough pill to swallow that's true and you know this guy had a hard time so you know he hangs himself in the basement and then his other one of his sons takes over the house then there's the fire the great Savannah fire currently there's a Tavern in the basement so picture this basement made out of stone huge enough to present day have a have a bar there basically Okay so they kind of used that because it was one of the only buildings left standing they kind of used it as like a triage Center like a like a makeshift hospital and a lot of kids that were brought there from one of the orphanages that burned um the children died there oh oh damn I can't even imagine like during this whole like the whole city is [ __ ] burning how terrified everyone must have been and then to bring the wounded to this place it sounded like a lot of patients whatever you want to call them that were brought there were kind of mainly children and unfortunately makes it even sadder that they were from a nearby orphanage and so you know these kids kind of didn't have a chance because you know orphanages back then they there was no you know fire escapes and there was probably one entrance several floors lots of stairs and honestly the kids at that time were not the priority of the people that were there so they probably weren't even trying you know and also some of the folks that were trying to fight the fires that had succumbed to whether it be the smoke you got the guy that hangs himself you got a bunch of kids that died there because of the fire you got some firemen um that that died there so as you can imagine kind of unpleasant happening is going on here yeah it had then been converted Ed over the years um into a Tavern in the basement that is actually still the case today there is a restaurant/bar in the basement and kind of a B&B on the top but what happened with the color thing um you would asked if it was painted pink yeah how did it get to be pink they buil this house and back you know when they were doing these Gregorian Mansions they were built out of bricks and where this was located and where they har harvested the material for the bricks was a very rich rich red color they build it decide that you know they don't want it you know the brick color so they paint it white a lot of those Gregorian Mansions were white back then well you know in places like like where I'm located in the Northeast bricks are bricks you paint it white it's white well because of the richness of the red no matter how much white paint enough of the red bled through to make it look pink okay that's pretty interesting yeah and even to this day it is still a pink house but in the 1930s they decided to just start painting at pink now it is actually painted pink but the reason it was originally called The Pink House was because from the time it was built in 1771 up until the 1930s it was literally just because the brick would bleed through the white oh that's kind of interesting I mean a little creepy given the fact of how many people you know died there during the fire but interesting you know on a on a science level makes total sense yeah preservation efforts and you know how the historical societies take over places once they they got their hands on it it it became painted pink from there on but when you look at pictures of it it's just got this air of sadness about it it kind of reminds you of we did our Marty gr New Orleans uh episode it looks like a building you'd see in New Orleans it's kind of like very Square rectangular shaped you know nothing nothing too fancy Southern kind of Gothic style yeah yeah um but the funny thing is is because the original owner Mr Habersham um was such a loyalist they have always since his sons died uh and it was taken over always have flown the British flag out front your kind of house well that's that's nice to do that as a tribute to him I suppose here's where the hauntings um occur and get a little creepy like I said after the 1930s they made a Tavern in the basement kind of a you know they didn't call them airbnbs back then more of a like a hotel type thing upstairs you know obviously as we would expect there's going be children voices apparitions um that s sort of thing yeah for that many young people to die so traumatically there I I imagine there's a lot of that energy there the most common though is actually Mr Habersham himself really now this is this is my kind of Haunting okay even right up to present day his apparitions are to the point where folks that go into the the bar restaurant even currently will actually think that they're sitting at the bar next to someone who you know how you get those like reenactors yes people think they're talking to reenactors they just like turn away quick and turn back and he's gone so you know in that whole Colonial period you know dress to the point like I said where people think that it's it's it's actually a reenactor but he's a very interactive ghost He is described as kind of a think of it as like a barfly he just wants to sit down have a drink and be kind of who's here who's hanging out what's going on you want to chat interesting you know I'm surprised considering the legend has it that he took his own life in the basement which is where the bar is right it it is but maybe it's him not being able to let go but coming to peace with the whole my kid pick the wrong side kind of thing yeah maybe he was momentarily distraught and you know and now he's happier I guess I don't know interesting but here's where the kids make it creepy there's like a bathroom in the tavern like you know restrooms in the tavern part in the basement and then there's there's restrooms upstairs they do not allow patrons to use the ladies room in the basement why not because as kids would they like to play pranks and and things of that nature they lock women in the Stalls and actually lock the whole bathroom to the point where they've actually dismantled the locks from the doors and somehow people still get stuck in the Stalls or stuck in the actual bathroom itself um to the point where they don't allow patrons um to use the ladies room in the basement no that's wild yeah yeah yeah isn't that funny that's fantastic they have also spotted a female ghost on the second floor kind of sobbing and and and very upset like you're like a lady in white right to the point where they will actually if if patrons say that they've heard things or whatever once they say you know you know I think there was someone trying to get in my room or you know I heard someone you know trying to open my door handle while I was sleeping there is a code they actually use that's you know the upstairs is all clear kind of the it's not a real it's just the ghost playing pranks really so they have a code to let the the staff actually have a code because like this is apparently a Super Active place but like I said visually it is the guy that people see the most but as far as as sounds and creepy weird things it's more like a lady and a kid and I never really kind of got the story of the lady but as you can imagine being in in that part of the country um from the late 1700s on there were also rumors that there were slave children um in in slave adults uh at that location so maybe that's what the crying woman is um but I never really kind of got the story on her wow but imagine just being like Oh I'm gonna go out to dinner oh hey can I use the restroom wait I can't get out wait I can't get out I can't even that's wild and it's it's mischievous children ghost that do that right to the point where and it happens so much that they can't even allow people to use that bathroom anymore that's amazing we need to go there and I guess sometimes depending on what's going on or what time of year the main entrance the doorway can actually be slanted you know like a doorway is kind of square in your door certain times of year this is another thing I I didn't really find more information on but most of the sightings um of the man are from October to March and between October and March is when the door is like SL like the doorway itself is slanted but then from March to October the doorway is a perfect 90 degre Square interesting well that's weird I wonder if that it has anything to do with it that you know doorways between here and there maybe I wonder if that has anything to do with it there are theories that about you know the wood expanding and and shrinking back in because you know it's like hot is all get out in Savannah Georgia in the summertime and then let's face it this was built in 1771 what the hell do you expect right good gracious so we're creating a bucket list here I want I want to check out this pink house because unlike your story I totally want to [ __ ] around and find out and use the downstairs bathroom I absolutely do I mean that sounds like fun that sounds pretty interesting not only does the guy that sounds fun just say it it okay it sounds fun because mostly because it sounds like the children ghosts are just mischievous you know it's not like some horrific terrible thing you know they're kind of playing pranks yeah that sounds fun I can handle that I mean you do have the sobbing lady but then you got the guy who just wants to drink and chat yeah I mean who wouldn't want to have a nice chat with the original owner you know dressed in his looking like reenactment Garb you know that would be freaking cool I would do that I'd sit there and have some whiskey sour and you know chat it up with what's his name Habersham Habersham until you have one too many whiskey sours and you blink in the [ __ ] gone that would be so epic I would love that I would love i' be like wait a minute was I just talking to a ghost or did they get way too much Jack Daniels in this I can't deter did this at the moment I'm not sure that would be pretty amazing I would AB absolutely love to [ __ ] around and find out on that one what this story actually did is it it it sparked me to find that I didn't realize how haunted Savannah Georgia is as a whole oh I imagine I'm actually gonna check out some some locations for future episodes but like holy mackerel it's pretty haunted down there yeah the whole South I I is just crawling with ghosts and a lot of these old you know Anabell and town cities and towns are just there's so much history there really bad history and a lot of a lot of stuff happen and as we know you know places that are sites of extreme events and yeah trauma tend to hold on to pretty wild energy so I would not be surprised and a lot of these a lot of these locations especially on the East Coast were tied into the Revolutionary War the Civil War just kind of yeah the history it I mean even now these places are NEX maybe where people can feel energy and and a lot of them tend to be sites where a lot of hauntings happen or a lot of unusual Paranormal Activity if we have any listeners from Georgia I want to hear some some stories because like I said I just I just feel like I just came on a treasure Trove of ghostin down there like I said I guess I just didn't realize how haunted Savannah as a whole is and this was just kind of tip of the iceberg it kind of ghost wise haunted wise paranormal wise kind of had a very New Orleans feel oo I love that I love Georgia i' I've Loved going through Georgia anytime I've been down there it is a beautiful place and it is one of those places where you kind of feel a Vibe you know you go into Savannah and you feel that Vibe it's it's like the history the past different it's different yeah it's almost like the past is right there for you to reach out and touch that it's so much closer there the past feels closer there than it other places well at the old pink house it might just reach out in touch or lock you in the bathroom or lock you in the bathroom well on that note thank you so much for joining us for episode 61 of the stoned Witches Hour I hope you have
