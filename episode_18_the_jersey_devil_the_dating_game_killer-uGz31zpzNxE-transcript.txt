it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 18 of the stoned Witches Hour we're Lila and shell two best friends on opposite coast of the USA and each week we get together to smoke weed and scare each other's silly with stories of Haunted Happenings ghoulish events and terrifying True Crime I'm Lea representing the West Coast I'm high as usual and shell and from the East Coast hi my high friend how are you today today I am back to I got a new batch of Jasmine silver haze how is that smoking how does that Jasmine silver haze taste delicious delicious now you told me once that it was harder to grow is that correct sativas yes are typically harder to grow yes on the whole but this very tasty not flowy but not fruity but not citrusy kind of like everything good all wrapped up into one damn why can't you mail me some of that I love a good tasting weed I don't even care what the THC percentage is if it's got a nice taste to it I love that and it's it's a very smooth smoke too which you know sometimes there's like that cough to get off kind of smoke this is more like that smooth silky yeah goes s real nice oh I love those I love those I do tend to prefer generally hybrids but sativas are so good so good usually and and the silver hazes I really like personally this Jasmine silver haze topnotch good stuff nice good stuff I wonder if the Jasmine is what gives it that like allaround Flavor possibly I'm not familiar with that particular cultivar but I am familiar with the the hazes and the silver hazes and they do tend to have a nice flavor um but Jasmine sounds like it should taste good oh it does it does you'll you'll you'll have to come visit and have some because it's good stuff oh my gosh yes for sure when you come out here I'm going to have a Sherie Board of Bud for you to try and I fully expect the same when I come visit you in Salem we're going to just have a sampler platter of a little bit of everything and try it all exactly exactly but yeah no very it's it's very good and and I'm actually still working off my 88 for 288 deal like that was such the greatest deal ever on the planet that is a nice deal that is a nice deal quality stuff and that's the best part it's not just like junk weed on sale quality stuff yeah I just got um I did get a batch from the gas station my favorite delivery guys I did get a batch of super cheap um midi it was just a whole bunch of mixed mids they called it so it's just a bunch mixed uh mid-range mid-quality cannabis midies the last time we said midies right well now everything has a name so we don't have to like we don't have to call it dirt weed or you know midies or Hydro or Hydro or dank you know we we don't have to call it dirt midies or dank anymore everything has a name we can call it what its actual name is so you don't hear that so much but I guess they just had a bunch of uh buds left over that they just kind of dumped in one big pot and so they were selling it very cheap so it was uh midi for 50 for a half so we got some of that yeah nice it's a really nice deal and it's a it's a good quality smoke so you know a nice daytime just want to get through the work day kind of smoke good Sal pie didn't we used to call that a salad yes yes we did we would kind of dump what was left of all our little bags in a jar and then when you were out the go-to jar yeah that was the mixed salad that always got me high as [ __ ] higher than anything else and I'm smoking in that I'm also smoking on a freshly cured batch of homegrown my gorilla cookies my Autoflower gorilla cookies and those are fabulous so so good now it says that they have 27% THC in the description and I have not gotten mine tested I would honestly say it's probably higher I can't smoke these I'm going to smoke a little bit while we're recording but then the rest is going to go back to my mixed midi how you test it how can you you as Leila growing at your house homeg grower sitting in your in your living room how do you test the percentage I know that there are places that you can send your weed to it does cost um it's usually not something that I'm going to want I don't know what the cost is to be honest I'd have to look it up but I know you can send it to different places here um and I do think that there are some some kits that you can get to to test it at home they're around 100 bucks 50 to 100 bucks each I don't know how accurate they are it's actually that might be something that I would be interested in trying I might grab a couple different kits and maybe check into a dispensary and see if I could have it uh tested but just from my experience I would say that it feels like it's a higher it it kicks me right between the eyes kind of like a 34% 32 34% THC you know that I get from a dispensary would so the description says it's about 27% THC and I would have to say it's probably it feels like it's higher so that's more of my nighttime really want to relax chill out kind of weed melt into your bed melt into the bed and it tastes so good though it's hard hard not to reach for it in the middle of the day cuz you know my mixed midies are nice they taste great it's fine but it's no nothing to write home about but you know these gorilla cookies so delicious me personally my head is racing my mind goes a million miles a minute and my body is just kind of more like normal to lazy so so when I look for a weed I kind of want to balance that out particularly during the daytime I want something that's going to slow my brain down so that I can focus and get work done and not be constantly thinking about 10 bajillion oh squirrel kind of thing right and I want something to keep my body energized but not too Buzzy and not too relaxed you know so I want something to kind of balance me out and this this is one of those weeds that does a great job of that nice so yeah who wouldn't want that for a daytime smoke you know just kind of focus feel good feel happy and not be pinging for from thing to thing yeah yeah so hi I'm good I'm I'm smoking the good stuff today you know as usual just just living the dream here um waiting for for a little bit warmer weather but you know you take what you can get at this time of year it is beginning of May in the Northeast and you know how the beginning of May can be it can be like 41 day and 75 the next day and my allergies are exploding folks it's kind kind of like that over here it's 73 one day and 86 the next it's just oh poor you yourself blue skies all the time I love it okay there was one or two clouds in the sky yesterday so I can definitely tell spring is here it's so great you know I'm laughing because you know you you you're from the Northeast you know what I'm dealing with weatherwise here in the beginning of may like it's treacherous so I'm at the store and and I do this to my boyfriend all the time do you know that all winter long they've had a big display of bathing suits and I walk into this particular store and I'm like hey need a bathing suit why why it is cold I have a car heart sweatshirt on I have socks in a in a foot heater on and you've got a bathing suit display in the Northeast in the beginning of May sense to me evil evil I say they're taunting me that didn't make sense until I moved here because I do want a bathing suit right now I everything kind of well come here because there's a store that has like a whole freaking display yeah that in the Northeast that never made sense especially because in the first week of May you could have your heater running in the morning and then need to open your windows and possibly turn on your air conditioner in the afternoon you're GNA get it all yeah and that you know and and unfortunately as fun as that can be it creates an allergy explosion so if I'm sounding stuffy and Allergy ridden it it I am I am like we have a white car and it's turning yellow as we speak is the season everybody talks about this dry heat where is it because it is sure as hell is not in Massachusetts no it's out here in the desert right here I love it no so it is gorgeous here and I am loving it so first week of May gotta love it we just had belain this is a fabulous time of year for pretty much all of the United States I think for the most part we're all happy to get out of the dark and and start enjoying the outdoors and enjoying nature a little more you know this is the time of year where you know we we just did our belain episode belaine just passed and you know we always we talked about how we always camped for belain this is one of those years where I would have been one of those camping for belain absolutely first week and I I'm like all right guys um how about we wait another like couple weeks let's wait let's wait another couple weeks before we go camping again this has also been a pretty historic week just just not too long ago for another reason another state has started legal marijuana sales New Jersey on the 21st which is so dumb why didn't they do it on 420 but the day after 420 New Jersey rolled out legal marijuana and uh had booming sales from what I heard you know they probably just didn't want some like like I could see the government's mind working here they're like oh my God if we do this on 420 there's going to be like some like Mass explosion of people they were like probably thinking riots and stuff when all these Stoners are just like dude why couldn't have done this yesterday I don't think they were prepared for how calm and orderly a stoner line could be I don't think they I don't think they get the fact that there wasn't like what did they think I95 is just going to be shut down due to traffic what's happening Maybe thought if they did it on 420 the universe would just implode and probably yeah they did it on 421 so good for them for for actually starting the legal sales so they do not have home grows available in New Jersey which is a big thumbs down boo New Jersey hom Growers should be part of any legalization uh package and I I frown frown upon them I think I know why they don't have hom grows in in New Jersey and that kind of is going to lead me into what my story for today is oh I'm pretty sure that the reason that they don't allow homeg grones in New Jersey is because of the Jersey Devil wait what is the Jersey Devil like a cop or something like what's the Jersey Devil the Jersey Devil like this is like you mentioned the Jersey Devil before how does I have and I can't for the life of me believe that you don't even know what the Jersey Devil is like that baffles my mind okay I do remember now that you you have mentioned the Jersey Devil to me and promis to tell me what it is so and how does it how do they prevent people from growing weed because you don't want to be outside and come across this mofo like okay bad news like this is where you don't want to be out tending to your plants after dark and run into the sky is this another one of those lantern fish we put the orbs out so we can steal your soul like in our last episode this is a crypted absolutely oh another evil crypted Y in in episode 17 we talked about the puck wedgies of Massachusetts they corrupted my beloved orbs and use them to lure people to their death yeah well the Jersey Devil ain't much better oh no oh figures it it really isn't and we're not talking about the hockey team here folks the Jersey Devils bad just as bad as the Jersey Devil itself no I'm just kidding love hockey not so much Jersey Devils go rangers um so anyhow the Jersey Devil okay again just to be clear for my stoned brain the Jersey Devil the crypted not the Jersey Devil the hockey team correct crypted we're going down the crypted route crypted okay there is a a forest in South Jersey called Pine Barons and this is kind of where this this jersey devil has originated from the origin of the legend is that there was a resident named named Jane Leeds known as mother leads we're talking a couple hundred years ago this was obviously not something recent you know she was you know we we talked about belaine talk about someone in the belain spirit so she had 12 kids oh nice so she kept the belain spirit in her heart constantly right right she kept it in her heart constantly that's what they call it now I'm sure that's not everywhere she kept it imagine having 12 kids like I only got two eyes and two hands man I would not like to imagine that thank you mother leads and finding out she's pregnant for the 13th time oh the 13th child oh always a good well I guess that wasn't always a good omen not in this story not in this story so she's pissed because she's pregnant again so she cursed the child in a fit of rage and frustration oh yeah because it's the kids fault and not the dude who didn't rap it right you know you you you're still getting booty on the regular but you're pissed at the kid and go curse it but she did and her curse in frustration was her crying that the child would be the devil ridiculous she should have gone to see the local witch and been like hey you know but you know they had probably burned the local witch at the stake the summer before so you know poor mother Leeds was [ __ ] out of luck anyway pretty much so you know of of course I you know I wasn't there I wasn't around in 1735 but the story goes that you know on a dark and stormy night um she goes into labor back then you know a lot of the town's women or your your your your closest female relatives or what have you are there they're helping they gather around so this 13 child is born and the minute it comes out it's normal but then it starts changing and its feet turn into Hooves it has like what they they can't tell if it's a goat head or a horse head it begins Get Growing bat WIS and ends up growing a forked tail the child starts growling and screaming that sounds awful it flew up the chimney and headed into the Pines so the poor baby was born normal but because of the curse it like transformed into like this horrible disfigured thing and flew out the chimney now some people say that Mother Leeds was supposedly a witch that the child's father was actually the Devil Himself as one does and some say that there was a clergyman that tried to exercise the creature from Pines Baron but basically this 13th child turned into like what they considered like this devil creature wow so it flew out the chimney and went to the woods in the pine Barons went into the pine baronss and it's just kind of been there again 173 35 so you know years go by people seem to see this thing encounter this thing it supposedly will kill you again like the Pu wedgie take your soul eat your soul that whole bit no [ __ ] so like if you see it in the pine Barons it's going to like kill you and eat your soul it's not a good thing to see the Jersey Devil no it doesn't sound like it a lot of people in in in the Legends and the stories on the ghost stories and such actually describe it as a monster horse head bat wings goat Hooves well it sounds like it's a Monster yeah now you can actually find it listed not just the Jersey Devil but you can find it listed as the leads devil or the devil of leads named after the family ultimately his family name how cute he kept the family name okay so have people had encounters with this thing yeah there there was encounters all through the late 1700s um all through the 1800s and actually they they you know early 1900s but there has been a group recently um as recently as 2013 that had gone down there again kind of like a local paranormal crypted searchy group and you know you you you hear of these these people that have these encounters and you know I I watch some of these like quote unquote interview videos and I believe these people that they saw it that just look looking at them talk and listening to them describe what they saw like you believe them so they're very convincing they they definit you can tell that they they're relaying something they actually saw yeah so so this group goes down 2013 and we've experienced this before we've talked talked about this in other episodes going into the woods and even though you know where you are and you you aren't far away uh from a road or path you just instantly get lost and they walking in circles yeah like that that Blair Witch in the woods a Blair Witch phenomena in the woods absolutely yeah um so the these folks went in there and and very quickly lost their sense of direction uh couldn't find the right way felt like they were being circled from above almost like by a bird oh like something was like trailing them from the sky creepy but then but then like it came down and then was buff him in the branch and then came down to like ground level and was like following them on ground um oh wow they were hearing growling noises um they were they were feeling almost euphoric like they felt the only way they were able to describe it was they felt like there was something in the air that was almost making them feel kind of trippy like someone was smoking out the woods and they were getting high like a contact high yeah like if you were getting hot boxed in a car something but in the woods wow pheromone or something that this creature is supposed to secrete or something I don't know I don't know but they they the group of people that went out felt like they were under some sort of euphoric spell interesting and kind of like how some snakes Mesmerize their prey yeah yeah and I guess how they kind of broke free of this trapment it was kind of near they were kind of near a military base and there were helicopters flying low a couple helicopters had gone by um at a low altitude and all of a sudden no growling no noise nothing tracing them so it was almost like the helicopters in the area kind of released the trans of the Jersey Devil so to say um but again you know these these creatures aren't out out looking to be like friendly oh so once they started flying helicopters around the area no one saw it anymore right it went away it went away wow kind of like it got scared away maybe might be a good way to describe it and it's because of this legend that they named the hockey team they named the hockey team after this Legend yeah actually yeah actually so the 13th bastard child of the devil yeah that sounds like a hockey team yeah but you know they that 13th child back in 1735 mother leads his baby um never found any bones never found a corpse it was like that baby just vanished you know it's not like these women were in hysteria or or or whatever and are are misunderstanding of situation I mean the woman was pregnant she gave birth and there's no trace of the baby you figure it out wild it's definitely it's definitely something that that kind of Sparks your mind because it's not that just one person one person experienced this you know this was a group of women that all had the same exact story right when they saw it born they all saw the same thing and saw it leave and there's no evidence of a body and then people having these experiences in the woods even decades later that there has been sightings as far away as Delaware in Western Maryland so you know it's not necessarily just in South Jersey but there's been times where they thought that actually attacked a trolley car wow yeah what did they how how did it attack a trolley car isn't it like a train car or something I think a like a trolley I guess like a trolley you know a trolley thought like a trolley was like a something that ran on Rails I don't know like trolley car runs on Rails is that like the San Francisco trolley yeah yeah I think something like that yeah yeah I think something like one of those yeah and the police actually shot at the creature to no effect so the police have actually seen this they have found um hoofprints uh in the snow after there's been a sighting and they're not dog prints they're not like whatever they were actual hoof prints you know some some some crazy [ __ ] you know there's people there's always people who are like oh you know we're going to be Vigilantes and we're g to go find it and hunt it down ah sure the Philadelphia Zoo at one point posted a $10,000 reward for the creature wow wow Pennsylvania throwing some uh reward money over for a New Jersey creature yeah that was like in like I don't know like the 60s like 1960 you know obviously to no avail you know you're not going to go CCH catch the the devil creature with the red eyes and it's been invading people for this long why did they think someone would catch it now you might as well go pick up big Bigfoot on your way and put him in the same cage you know right just put them next to each other but yeah so in 1960 this Zoo they they were going to do whatever it took to try to capture the Jersey Devil and bring it to them you know it it's kind of like one of those places animals don't like to go into into that particular Forest people try to go in there um and do like day hiking say with their dog or something the dogs just don't want to enter if that doesn't tell you something right there I don't know what does yeah as soon as animals are are freaking out that makes me feel all weird I don't like it when animals start getting like tweaked out nothing or seemingly nothing people have even described that there's no Bird activity in that Forest as well if there are no birds in the dogs don't want to go in there turn around my friends definitely Eerie is not a good place not a good place to go I just I I don't understand why people would be like hey let's go check this out hey they wanted the reward you know you offer people enough money they'll go hunting for anything yeah but the thing is is that like it wants to kill you yeah it wants to kill you why would you even go I wouldn't go that $10,000 is not enough of a reward for something that wants to eat you and and then take your soul now there was a guy maybe 20,000 this guy in in in 2015 um David black a local resident he's claiming that he has a photograph of the Jersey Devil I've seen the photograph what do you think could it be it could be it's it's kind of flying in the air and it does kind of have that ho feet goat Facey short wings look to it but I also feel like I am not the I don't know if I am technologically savvy enough to say it is not a doctored picture Okay so there is some possible photographic evidence though POS and you know when when I was doing some of this research where I found this not that that it necessarily matters but it was um a story on ABC News so this is actually you know a mainstream news uh that did a story on this and and again you know this guy claims I I don't know you can't tell like I said you can't tell it could be fake it could be real I don't know but it it it's freaky nonetheless because I believe the story I believe in the cryp did itself I'm just not sure I believe this particular guy okay it's enough to make you go what the hell is out in those woods and I don't want to be out there alone but thanks are there any other photographs or any other types of evidence that it it exists um there are people throughout time like I said this has been kind of a 300y old story there are people that that claim to have had pictures of them they a lot of them were debunked you know you got to figure at the beginning of this story uh photographs weren't even invented yet but there's some from like the early to mid 1900s but they they were easily debunked by local authorities I think a lot of people want to get a picture of It kind of like Bigfoot yeah it's like I'm not saying you didn't see it but your picture is a bunch of [ __ ] kind of thing right you know I I kind of like the alien thing I believe I saw an alien ship when I was in ninth grade just like half my town but I also am not claiming to have a picture of it either you know what I mean right yeah exactly so I'm not negating that these people might have seen something I'm just not their pictures aren't necessarily 100% convincing um but but this guy in 2015 it's it's a pretty darn good picture but I just I'm not 100% sure because I just don't have that technological background yeah okay well fair enough fair enough creepy story nonetheless even if there isn't any pictures that type of legend that local Legend is always fascinating you know I like Bigfoot better because Bigfoot just wants to be left alone these last couple Cryptids I've talked about like they just want to like take your soul and kill you and like what the hell yeah these guys are mean they're just really mean that's not cool these sasquatches are friendly somewhat as long as you don't [ __ ] around with them they just want to be left alone but I guess when you call something a devil you get what you expect you're going to get Yeah that poor baby was cursed by its mother and then the pounds people kind of cursed it and thinking that it was the child of the devil or whatever it didn't ever have a chance more than likely it was just some poor deformed baby and and they were just when you think about that time period back in the 1700s that's exactly what it probably was unfortunately it was probably a baby with some deformity you know what I'm saying and family didn't want to begin with and right right and it turned into a big story you know it it sounds good and it sounds interesting but is this really just a child with a deformity that got twisted and turned into something more than likely or is it really the child of Satan who was born in freaking ryal New Jersey yeah very interesting local legend for sure and probably never know what started it but you're I think your assessment is probably spot on I definitely think that at some point we really need to go and check out for ourselves to see if we find the Jersey Devil oh shell you and your dangerous trips I don't know this that was how bad could it be uh well getting murdered and your soul eaten bad that's how bad yeah but that's what you're there for you always make that stuff work out somehow in the end I come out with a great idea and you somehow save us in the end how is it that you always come up with these crazy ideas and and I somehow end up and saving my ass I don't know you're good at it we're a good team you you get us into trouble I help get us out of trouble and it makes for fun stuff it does make for fun stuff so yeah um definitely the Jersey Devil check it out Pine Barons South New Jersey I'm down I'm down if anybody out there um has any stories or experiences with the Jersey Devil definitely share because I'm very intrigued by this even though Lea's never heard about it and I have heard of it before I didn't I still don't think I know the whole grasp of the Jersey Devil story so if anybody out there has any additional info shoot us an email I'd love to hear it I'd love to hear variations on that Legend that'd be very cool and we could definitely go check it out as long as we then go see a Jersey Devil's hockey game afterwards right y love hockey that' be so fun and that would be scary enough I think the hockey game the hockey game yeah do you remember was a few episodes ago you talked about the wedding where the they had dosed a couple layers of the wedding cake with cannabis and I was all concerned about whether the guests knew or not and thankfully in that case everyone was aware that Grandma was going to get high if she ate the the wedding cake there was a recent news story yes there was you did hear there was a recent news story where some aspiring Chef bride I guess and her cook cohort caterer cohort dosed all of the food without telling anyone people got so high off of these Edibles she didn't even like lightly dose them she like Mega dosed everything people were throwing up the bride and the caterer actually got arrested they asked the groom if he knew anything about it and he apparently was completely clueless totally stoned out of his mind and just kind of blankly stared at them before he remembered the word no and got that out granted they were all going to be fine but that's still not something anyone should ever do I you don't you don't you don't do anything of any nature no matter what it is you don't do anything of any nature like that against someone's personal choice person what was she thinking why would she think that was a good idea I don't get it you don't do that to people you that's right like talk about pissing Grandma off you don't do that to your friends and family like that's that's low blow stuff and first of all you don't dose people without their knowledge you just don't do it and second of all it sounds like the levels that she dosed these people was insane if you're going to if you're going to put cannabis in a whole meal you have to do it knowing that people are going to eat everything and so you have to dose it accordingly and make sure you keep those levels very very low and it doesn't sound like they did that I think these people got a very high dose of of edible cannabis and that's not something anyone should do and definitely not unsuspecting just because it's weed doesn't make it right Y and and I think that's the biggest thing that that might teach them is that just because it's weed doesn't make it right you know because I read one article where the caterer was quoted as saying something like oh it's not like it was crack well okay you're right it wasn't doesn't make it right exactly you're right they're fine they're all going to be fine chances are extremely high that every every single one of those people will recover in a few hours and have zero effects doesn't make it right does not make it right it still is subjecting people to something against their will and it's it's not cool not good no no and that's that's that takes the fun level out of it and it takes the legality out of it and it takes the the whole Spirit of getting high and being high out of it absolutely and okay so Grandma's glaucoma was probably better I no I'm not even going to joke about it I'm not going to go there kind of like Mike Tyson here's another person that we were just recently talking about in the news [ __ ] is with him I'm so conflicted over how I feel about this Mike Tyson was recently in the news we just talked about how he's very much on a journey to find Zen and peace in his life obiously not obviously not here he is on a plane and you've got the troll of all trolls sitting behind him that Tyson is trying to be nice to and this guy's being a complete and total airplane dick you know the type the one we all want to turn around and punch in the [ __ ] head and unfortunately Tyson gave in that impulse I'm not going to say that guy deserved it because nobody deserves to get hit but oh my God I'm going to watch that video again probably he took throat punch to a different level yeah you don't hit people come on but come on the the levels that this guy was going to antagonize Tyson was terrible that is why you should be able to buy a little baggie of Edibles from the stewardess on the airplane just can't smoke and you can't even Vape on a plane give me the gummies one of the offerings on the plane should be Edibles if you can buy a mixed drink you should also be able to buy THC chips THC water THC gummies so that you don't punch the guy in the seat in front of you that just leaned his chair all the way back to your face yeah yeah yeah yeah American Airlines if you're out there weed gummies weed gummies the stoned witches approve we we highly approve offer weed weed lace things on your flights we'd fly more so there's there's that I don't know how to segue into my story what you talking about today what are you talking about is it is it better than the Jersey Devil what you got what you got I that's a really good local Legend but I'm I'm going the the True Crime route today so we're going to talk about Rodney alala sometimes known as The Dating Game Killer uh oh does this have to do with the actual dating game show because I loved that show it does this guy actually appeared on The Dating Game in the midst of his Killing Spree oh my God looking for dates imagine being on that show and then finding out after and being like Oh my God I would have picked him glad I didn't do you want to know if he won or not are you gonna tell me he won I'm not telling you you have to wait and see I'll tell you in a minute when I get there such a tease right I try I try all right so we're going to start our story in 1968 and at this time Rodney Alcala was living in uh the Hollywood area he was a young 20-some guy long curly hair described as very handsome and he was a photographer La so we're going to talk about a young woman Morgan Rowan 16 just a girl she was living in Hollywood in 1968 like many teenagers of that time she spent a lot of her nights on the Sunset Strip partying at the dance clubs that were for teenagers at that time and in that crowd was Rodney alala and he was known as very handsome but everybody knew he was way older ah kind of like kind of like the creepy old guy that's hot but still old and creepy right right not like super old but old enough that you know he shouldn't be there he should be in a different type of Club despite that U Morgan and her friends all kind of had a crush on this older photographer guy that was there love that name Morgan by the way right beautiful name Morgan Rowan so Morgan and her friends are dancing one night at these clubs and this photographer Rod as he called himself at that time offered them a ride to a local IHOP they were going to go have some pancakes in the morning as one does after hanging out all night instead of taking them to the IHOP though he took them to his apartment which was a few blocks away on Delong pre Avenue and he told them that he was he was having a party come on up so they did and there were other people at the house and the music was super loud they were having a good time her friends got distracted and were kind of separated from her probably on purpose and Rodney alala grabbed this little 16-year-old girl dragged her into his bedroom and barred the door he then proceeded to attack her oh jeez he hit her quite a bit he bit her uh he strangled her and he raped her and he strangled her to the point where she was blacking out and thought she was dying thankfully her friends had noticed that she was missing and were frantically trying to find her and when they found the locked door they broke it down only to see Rodney covered in blood standing over their friend who was unconscious on the floor and he was just like just take her she says she remembers him saying just take her like she was nothing like she was an object and her friends grabbed her and took her out of the house and she says they actually had to kind of hide from Rodney cuz he started looking for them and she's throwing up blood in an Alleyway as they're trying to hide her it was horrific but that was a time when if you told anyone that you were raped a lot of times it was your fault and she did try to tell a police officer what had happened she didn't even mention Rodney alcala's name and he said well in your short skirt and go go boots what did you expect you know and that that was kind of a shitty thing that was very common in in that era very much so and so she decided not to press charges and even went so far as to hide most of her wounds and told people she'd been in a car accident to explain the ones she couldn't hide so he didn't he didn't kill her September of that year he tried again when the same girl no oh I don't know if that's better or worse right so he W Rodney alala was seen luring an eight-year-old girl tally Shapiro into his car as she was going to school so this [ __ ] not even not the adult women make it okay but even when after kids he did he did his victims his victims ranged in age from like 18 to 35 I known victims this witness who saw him lure this little 8-year-old girl into his car followed them back to alcala's apartment on Delong pre Avenue and then called the police because it just seemed suspicious to him by the time police arrived Alcala wouldn't answer the door said he was getting out of the shower and the police actually broke down the door and went in and saw him again covered in blood with a little girl laying on the kitchen floor with blood all around her and an iron bar the same iron bar he had locked his door with he had used that to try and strangle this little girl and he had raped her and bitten her same as he had done with Morgan Rowan holy [ __ ] despite the severity of the attack tal Shapiro did survive but alala escaped out of back door and took off he so he evaded arrest and they had a warrant out for him he fled to New York City and changed his name to John Berger b r g r and he enrolled in NYU oh my God he actually took photography l from Roman palansky oddly enough shocker toad right didn't his wife or daughter wasn't she later killed by the Manson family um yeah but then at one point he was actually he I I think he's in jail right now currently present day as well right right so yeah good company yeah yeah he's changed his name he's in New York City and while he's there in June of 1971 he raped and strangled Cornelia krly uh with her own stocking she was a trans World Airlines flight attendant and he killed her in her own apartment later that summer he became a camp counselor in New Hampshire and he used the slightly different spelling of buur John Berger buur g r as an alias a couple of campers noticed his poster up at a local um post office at a local post office showing that he was on the FBI's most wanted list and they turned him into authorities and he was arrested and he was extradited back back to California to face charges on attacking and molesting tally Shapiro and this is all before the dating game this is all before the dating game wow they do they didn't do the background checks on on contestants like they do nowadays they absolutely did not so he gets extradited back to California and he goes on trial but tally Shapiro's parents didn't want her to testify they had actually taken her out of the country to Mexico and it might have been the thing for her because she does seem to be very well adjusted and collected and does not see herself as a victim she's handling the situation very very well however because she didn't testify they couldn't get him on the abduction or the mo um or the rape charges or attempted murder charges they he was only convicted of molestation and he served 34 months are you are 34 months that's it that's it he was released on parole and given permission to travel New York where he again assumed the John Burger identity and a New York woman Ellen hover 23 disappeared July 15th 1977 and on her calendar she said she was meeting with John burger and so Rodney alala was questioned in her death and was released because there was no evidence he pled guilty to that murder in 2012 oh wow Ellen Hover was killed in 1977 and her remains were found in 1978 and that's when he was questioned by the FBI and released due to lack of evidence then later that year 1978 he appeared as Bachelor number one on the TV game show the dating game now what year was what what year was that again 1978 why don't you describe would you describe uh what the dating game is for our listeners shell who might not be old enough to remember it now from all you kiddos out there the dating game was like you know at the time it seemed like a fun game I watched it as a kid it was it was very 70s themed and there'd be either a bachelor or a bachelorette on one panel with like the host guy and then on the other side of the wall were three prospective daters so if it was like one girl with the host it'd be like three guys if it was like a guy with a host then it'd be like three girls you get the idea yeah and the ones behind the screen were always called like Bachelor number one Bachelor number Bor number two and Bachelor number three so this guy was Bachelor number one you said this guy was Bachelor number one for for any of you guys that that have watched old game shows that are kind of like Lea and I's age Chuck Baris was like the host which at the time was like a very good-looking TV guy but so you would be on this show and Chuck Baris would would be with with the single person the contestant and they would have these questions and they would read these questions to the three people behind the wall you know like what is your idea of a great date night silly questions like that even better they were questions that were designed full of sexual innuendo right right to watch it now in the year 2022 to go back and watch old episodes of the data game you'd laugh your ass off the idea was is that they'd ask these questions and kind of eliminate down to the person picking Bachelor 1 Bachelor 2 or Bachelor 3 and then the TV show kind of sent you on like a all all paid expense date basically so yeah this guy was Bachelor number one so he was Bachelor number one behind the screen and the host described him as a successful photographer between takes you might find him skydiving or motorcycling so they gave him like this really Wild guy right and of course his answers to things were super racy I believe one of the questions was if you were a food what would you be and he's like well everyone calls me the banana why don't you peel me or something like that are you does that work for guys actually work for guys this is 1978 it's a TV game show designed to be corny and sexual I mean come peel me if that ain't the pickup line of the century apparently his banana won him the date with the girl so our killer was already please tell me she's she he didn't kill her did he he didn't killed our contestant did he well no he did not they didn't even go on the date they met backstage and she decided he was too creepy to go on a date with and she refused to go on the date with him wait I saw him on a wanted poster I ain't going on a date with him I wish by one account he was seen on that show by um Orange County police officers and that's one of the things that helped them find him but they didn't catch him yet because in June of 1979 he's still in California wow only now he goes to Huntington Beach pier up here in California and he sees two young girls two 12-year-old girls playing doing cartwheels in the sand and he goes up to them and offers to take their photographs as that he's taking photographs for portfolio which is something he did quite a bit with people and a lot of his victims those were his Trophies the pictures were his trophies is that basically what it was you are not far off shell my little investigator he's taking pictures of these girls and tries to get them to go away with him when thankfully a Good Samaritan sees what's going on and comes over even though she didn't know the girls she wanted to make sure everything was okay and she kind of was like putting herself between the girls and this man and he took off and the girls were kind of spooked and decided to leave and one of the girls Robin samso a 12-year-old Robin samso had to get to ballet class so her best friend offered to allow her to ride her bike and said go straight there and don't stop for anyone because they were spooked about this encounter robin samso never made it to ballet class didn't listen to her friends did she nobody knows exactly how he got to her but 12 Days Later her body was found in a remote Ravine the ballet they know it was him yes I mean I'm not trying to give the guy all benefit of the doubt and stuff but you know unfortunately there's sick people out there do they know it was him he was seen leading her up the Ravine and there is other evidence as well that uh DNA evidence as well that ties him to her as well as um one of the things he took as trophies were earrings and he had her earrings oh so she didn't make it to the ballet lesson the teacher called the parents and said she'd never gotten there and the parents were already worried because she hadn't come home and it was late and they looked and looked and looked for her her brother describes just searching for her for hours and unceasingly um she was found by a forest service worker in a remote Ravine 12 Days Later quite a bit of ways um I believe it was over 10 miles or more from where she had last been seen and a kitchen knife was found nearby so he basically like younger girls Preen teenage girls early 20s so like pre-teen to 20s yeah in early 20s mid to late 20s as well he had a wide range so after her body was found and her friend described the meeting with alala uh they put out a search for him and he was brought in and arrested July in 1979 for the abduction and murder of poor little 12-year-old Robin samso and he was convicted on those charges in 1980 interestingly during this trial came out that he had a storage locker in Seattle and when they searched that storage locker they found a trove of over a thousand photographs of young women and men some of them in very sexually explicit positions and some of them were his victims known victims they also found a silk bag full of earrings including the earrings that had been on Robin samso when she went missing wow many of photographs have been connected to his victims um we'll talk more about those photographs a little bit later but four years after his conviction in 1980 it was overturned because supposedly the jury had been tainted by being improperly told about his prior record oh my God then they tried him again and got in 1986 and got a second guilty verdict but this was again overturned each time he's been sentenced to death for this and this 1986 guilty verdict was over returned again in 2001 this time they said that the prosecutors had hypnotized the forest service worker that had found Sam so's body what hypnotized him yeah first of all have you met someone who's worked for the forest service because they're not the type that are susceptible to being hypnotized right at the time unrelated but a woman's body was discovered in 1982 by a rancher in a big open Field in Wyoming and she had been murdered I don't mean to I don't mean to interrupt you but how did they avoid the whole Double Jeopardy thing as well I I'm not exactly sure but it depending on how the case is like tried how it's dismissed I guess will depend on whether you can retry them or not um I know there are some cases where you can I'm not a lawyer so I'm I'm not entirely sure but we could probably look that up or have a lawyer contact us and let us know but the last overturning when it that charge was overturned in 1986 actually worked against Rodney Alcala in the end how because by that time DNA technology and other forensics had caught up and they were able to they had taken a sample of his DNA during his prior convictions and they used that DNA and ran it through a database and found four victims that he had killed that he had left semen or saliva on L and learned is nowadays only date somebody who has submitted their information to ancestry DNA right so those four victims right that's I laugh but that's a good idea right the four victims that they used his DNA to match were Jill barhom 18 who was a runaway that had been found like rolled up into a ball and shoved into a Los Angeles Ravine in 1977 Georgia Wicked who was 27 who' been beaten to death in her apartment in 1977 Charlotte lamb was 31 who'd been raped strangled and left in laundry room of her apartment complex in El Segundo in 1978 and Jill parento 21 who was killed in her apartment he's strangled raped bit and what was the motive what was the motive do do does anybody know why was he doing this nobody knows he liked the control he he had a similar um he had a similar manner of killing them he would offer to take their photographs he would take them to a secluded place and take their photographs and then he would beat them he would bite them and he would strangle them some of his survivors said that he liked to strangle them to the point where they would almost die and rape them and then when they came back too then he would strangle them and kill them again so he liked to torture them was this like like a like a a sex game very much so very much so it would definitely involved sex and power for him he would then take their earrings and pose them in usually in carefully chosen positions and take their pictures so some of the earrings they also tested the earrings that they had found in that Seattle Locker during one of his prior trials and they found DNA that matched um Charlotte lamb so now they're being able to use better technology to tie him to many many more crimes in 2003 they redid the trial again again I'm not sure how but they redid the trial again for killing and abducting Robin samso they had these four new victims that they had DNA evidence that they could tie him to during this 2003 trial Alcala decided to act as his own attorney that always works out well for people exactly and by act I kind of mean that literally because he adopted a deeper voice when he would be his attorney and ask himself questions and then he would an did he think he was on like Law and Order maybe I don't know and then he would answer himself in his normal voice and a lot of these questions apparently involved his long flowing hair hair I don't know but what did he ask himself like what kind of conditioner he used I'm not sure but some talked about the extensive questions that he asked himself about his hair but he had observed basically he said he didn't remember doing it and he couldn't have done it because he wasn't there wasn't me was his defense and for his closing statement you remember that song that Arlo Guthrie song Alice's Restaurant that really long rambling song Story I do I do there's a part in the story where the narrator is trying to get out of the draft and so they try to pretend to be crazy right and they go on about kill kill kill and eating bodies and I'm going to kill all these people y he played that part in court as part of his closing statement what was he smoking our weed I wish because I don't know I'm not going to say that wouldn't have made him a crazy murderous [ __ ] but maybe it wouldn't have made him a murderous [ __ ] yeah he played that part of the song and I hope he was convicted absolutely all five counts of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to death again and this time it's stuck did they they had the death penalty there yes it later was um uh the governor eradicated it or whatever yeah the governor turned uh stopped the de death penalty here in California but he remained in prison the [ __ ] died last year July I was I was just gonna ask you I was just gonna ask you if he was still alive or not so he's dead now he's dead thankfully good rot in hell so back to the pictures that they found in that Locker uhhuh over 900 of them were too explicit to release but they've used the pictures to identify several more victims and they've released 120 of his photographs March 2010 the Huntington californ Huntington Beach California department and the New York City police departments released 120 of his photos online to try and get the Public's help in identifying these potential other victims because they've they know of a bunch of of victims and they're pretty sure there's more um after they released the ones that they could 21 people came forward and said hey I'm in those pictures and I'm okay and some of them had creepy stories to recount some of them didn't that's crazy six families came forward and said one of those people is someone I loved that disappeared and I don't know what happened wow and so those are more than likely six people that he had murdered that they just haven't found yet wow and he never alluded to one other remember the body that I mentioned that had been found in uh 1982 yes that was determined when those pictures were released a woman Cathy Thornton who had been looking for her sister Christine for 40 years saw those pictures and said that's my sister and they were able to use her DNA to match it to the body that they had found in in Wyoming it was the body of Christine thoron who in 1977 had run away with her boyfriend but they had gotten in a fight and she met up with alala who said he was going to take her picture and he took her out to this remote Field in Wyoming and raped and murdered and left her there her body wasn't found until like 1982 um but it was determined because of those pictures that he was the one that had killed her oh wow yeah oh wow so they still have these pictures online there are still quite a few pictures that they're trying to find some estimates say that he's killed 50 to 15 people and they just found them all I'll post a link to the pictures they're haunting but you can see the pictures that he took hopefully most of them are people that just went about their lives and you know are fine but more than likely some of them that that definitely calls for one of those stupid Facebook marked safe from type posts like from The Dating Game Killer 2022 seriously seriously because if there's that many pictures there could be that many families who don't know what ever happened to their loved one yeah and how many people died without ever seeing these pictures you know and so there's no one to speak for them any you know there's their loved ones died before they could ever know right so there's no no immediate family to quote unquote claim that picture you know what I'm saying right someone some of those people may not have any living relatives to to claim them to recognize them that's sad that's sad but I will put the pictures links to the pictures up so that you can scroll through them maybe you'll recognize a long lost relative but that's my that's my sad story for today that's my True Crime that's sad that's actually sad and I'm glad he roted in jail finally well deserved may he be removed from the wheel of reincarnation may he come back as a bug and be squished multiple times may his soul be
