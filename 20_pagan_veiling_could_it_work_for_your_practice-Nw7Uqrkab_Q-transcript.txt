welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I'm sh and today we're going to be tackling a topic that neither one of us is very familiar with but we decided to try for the sake of magic and for the sake of trying it veiling the idea of veiling your head veiling in paganism it seems like it's becoming a little more popular again I've been seeing variations of veiling and I think that maybe what people think veiling is and what people are doing might not be the same so good topic to delve into today I think so too and I was kind of interested when I tried it because to be honest I approached this topic with a lot of prejudice I did too I'm not gonna lie like you I've seen this pop up on Tik Tok on Reddit on all the different socials on especially on YouTube pagans veiling and I was quite shocked when I first saw because I associate veiling with oppression exactly with misogyny with religion trying to force women to cover themselves to hide yeah to hide to cover their sexuality to keep their worth quote unquote to signify their status and so I saw it in a very negative way and I was surprised when people were kind of claiming this practice but you know how how it first came across me recently was not the veiling that you're thinking you know back in the day I say back in the day we're talking like 20 30 years ago when we used to to wear the bandanas on her head yes veiling who knew absolutely who knew so then I was kind of like okay maybe this isn't as misogynistic as I thought it was you know is a is a kid growing up in the 70s and 80s my mother always had a bandana on her head that's just what moms did back then right and I think that is rooted in some of the history of veiling so before we get too far let's just explain what is a veil basically a veil in this context is any type of fabric particularly of natural fibers that you would put on your head to cover your head cover all of your hair cover most of your hair cover your face but any type of head covering is what we consider a veil some pagans will consider a baseball cap a veil and some will not some will consider a headband or barrettes as a type of veil and some will not but that's that's basically we're talking about something that you put upon your head to cover it for various reasons and you know I think that the key here is if you're into veiling whatever material works for you and whatever you do or don't want to cover works for you agreed and historically even as I started looking into this practice the historical practices all seem to me to come from abrahamic religions where Christians and Muslims uh would have their women it was a requirement that women would Veil either because they were married they would Veil to show that they were a married woman or because to show status that they were a free woman or a lot of times to be modest it was most of the times to maintain their modesty but if it's used as a tool to kind of enforce modesty that is kind of the opposite of what pagans are kind of you know we're not we're not into like suppressing your modesty exactly one of the few texts that we have that seems to be somewhat Universal you know most pagans are at least passingly familiar with the charge of the goddess and in the charge of the Goddess one of the lines is as a sign of your trust you shall be naked in your rights and going skyclad or being clad only in the sky is seen by a lot of pagans as a way to have no barriers between you and deity to have nothing to hide which is kind of the opposite of modesty exactly and the opposite of veiling in my research I only found one culture one in historical times where veiling was not a means of Oppression or control and that was in rastafar raris the rastafarianism rosarin will lock their hair they do dreadlocks as a sign of Devotion to deity and to protect their energy it's part of protecting you know we have the crown chakra and the head chakra and the throat chakra and some people feel that covering these either through dreadlocks or in other cultures through cloth is seen as protecting and covering those energy sources but the only one that I saw that did it out of choice seemed to be the r ofar until now like I'm I'm just talking historically in modern times there are still people fighting there are women right now fighting to not have to wear a veil correct but there are um you know in in more modern times we have found other benefits of veiling and again you know I I kind of I tried to go into this with eyes wide open and shielding and grounding you know like you said you got all your your energy your aura your chakras are open you got like all this this crazy energy in the world going pew pew pew pew you know coming at you like a Star Wars Trooper here and you kind of can use that Veil kind of Shield that energy from you I think so too you know where my attitude started to change is when I was reading some of this and talking to my husband hband about it and he said oh that's why people wear hoodies and a light bul it clicked it suddenly clicked in my head I was like oh that's why I wear headphones to the store that's why I still like to wear a mask even after the pandemic is over it's a shield it's a form of shielding my energy I feel safe when I wear headphones to the grocery store I'm in a nice protective bubble and it's perfect makes me want to put my hoodie on right now exactly and so that's when I my attitude started to shift is when he said that that's when I I realized that I do this all the time and I didn't realize it because we were taught you cleanse and circle your space right and you do that to yourself too you put up Wards we do all of this energetically we make these barriers of magic around us to move safely to not have all that pew pew pew of other people's toxic forgot about the forgot about the physical Shield we forgot about the fact that having a physical representation of a magical thing makes it so much easier so much easier well and what you can do um with your your cloth whatever that may be is you can actually kind of charge your cloth kind of bless your cloth give your cloth the intention to bounce all that right back off you before you use it to Veil yourself so you're almost creating a magical shield with your tangible item hi thought of you when I tried this I I I admit I was not very comfortable with some of the more traditional veiling Styles such as like the Jewish um titel like the regular head scarf that some Jewish married women will wear that felt too too big to me too ostentatious I was more comfortable with the hippie head scarf or the big hippie headband I could wear that comfortably and not feel strange which would take me out of that magical space and I thought of you shell when I was getting them ready because you're a Talisman person you like to charge your jewelry and the things that you wear as magical a WS and talismans and so I thought why not do that with my head scarf why not so yeah so I wrote inside little sigils or I would sometimes put runes I'd wear different colors depending on what energy I needed that day as I was trying this and I I found it helped I liked it now I actually did two different things I tried I have um from back in my dancing days I have a lot of black sheer material and I tried to do the stereotypical what you think of when you're thinking of veiling sheer black I felt like I was oppressing myself yes and the hippie head scarf kind of did make me feel like my mom I'm not gonna lie but definitely more in line with with maybe something I could potentially do failing didn't work for me it didn't I I I have no words for it it just it just it's not my thing and that's the beauty of this it doesn't have to be your thing and where you found great value in it I kind of just I didn't and I think that comes down to a couple different things you are a very um you're much more extroverted than I am you are much more out there in your face kind of pagan than I but I love you my hermit friend I exactly we love each other for for these different in our energy and whereas I am not going to Veil on a regular basis I do like the idea of wearing as I go to especially these Pagan festivals I will be bringing veils with me in that type of situation because there are times when I'm going to feel more comfortable having a head covering and I won't want to wear headphones right um being in a crowd but I'm very much an introvert and I I don't like crowds whereas I'm just kind of like here I am folks am in all my wonderful glor ious Pagan Beauty yes I I still am not fully sold on wearing a veil all the time as a pagan I still don't feel like this is a typical traditional Pagan practice but I do see it's becoming a very popular subset but I will say the funny opposite thing of this is you would think some people say well you know where you're located could could affect whether or not you're in Dev veiling because maybe you want to hide that from the greater world you would think where I'm located in the great state of Massachusetts it would just be like free and clear and wonderful but let me tell you the energy that bounces around in this city is like craziness and for someone who's into veiling you want to wrap yourself up in like bubble wrap to to kind of Stave off some of the energy that floats around in Salem but like you said you know I kind of I do more of the Talisman thing and and charge the jewelry thing and you know the scents and I I just I just have a different method and I just feel that veiling did it for me you've hit it exactly veiling is just one different way to physically manifest a protection a personal protective space and before I lose the thought I want to ask you as a person who lives and breathes you walk to work in the witch City this practice I I I would say it's probably less than 5% of people I would say maybe 1% you and I have been witches I've been practicing since the late 80s I think you've been roughly around the same time I have almost never seen anyone Veil except online recently yeah I know where you're going with this and the answer is not a lot there is not a lot of people in in Salem that I okay there is not a lot of townies in Salem that I see veiling are there any witches in general in the crowds that come do you do you see veiling occasionally I have started to occasionally um you can tell it's more with the tourist population yes not so much with the folks that live here the folks that live here here they're they're loud and proud and out and about but you're starting to see it a little bit with with some of the tourist population I think the biggest thing that I see honestly is the hippie bandanas yeah and and and those are so versatile and they're so nice and they're much more acceptable plus if you are veiling you don't want to adopt someone else's culture right you don't want to be wearing a hij jaab or you know a burka if that is not your culture or your religion you do not want to be disrespectful exactly same thing with dreadlocks if that is not your religion or your culture you should not be doing that but in other types of veiling that is much more accessible and I think you hit on something a little bit ago that I hear a lot from people who choose to Veil is it makes them feel like their mother it makes them feel grown up and and in a lot of cultures that was a sign of being grown up is a married woman would cover her hair and again I kind of feel that that's a little oppressive but if it's something that you choose if you're like hey this is a mark of my Womanhood this is a mark of my change in status as a choice I think that's kind of cool you know but see in the household I grew up in when my mother put on her bandana that meant it was time to clean and you know that's also funny because I do see some people who say they are called by deity I almost always see Hestia if someone says they have felt they were called by deity to Veil it's 90% of the time it's Hestia and that makes sense right Hearth and Home and some of them will even just wear the veil to clean as a sign of Honor for Hestia but that is one of the places in history where veiling was very common you know in ancient Greeks and Romans would wear the um was a Pala and the pallum the women would wear the Pala to cover their head men would also wear a cloth covering called the pallum in Greece it was called the himti basically which means like little porch or little roof or or something like that and it was a covering that was meant to symbolize that women belonged in the home but this covering allowed them to bring the home outside with them I Goa like the protection of the home they had the protection of the home outside of the home exactly and if someone makes you do it is very different than if you choose to do it totally different context yeah exactly totally different context so for me I have to get over the idea that someone who is veiling is always told to and and I'm starting to accept now that a lot of people Veil sometimes consciously or subconsciously because they choose to for lots of reasons I I do want to add something to to kind of spin back to your to your question to me one thing I have noticed with with um some of the locals here around town is if they advertise for their services online their online profile they have some sort of covering that makes big sense to me I really get that so when I'm walking the streets when I'm walking to work when I'm going on my lunch break going here and there and shopping and going to the water I'm not seeing it in my everyday walking out and about but if I go to some of these local shops websites or local tarot readers uh Instagrams or or Facebooks their online profile they have you know it might just be like a like a silk scarf that's just covering the top of their head you know it's not necessarily wrapped or anything but their online profile they have some sort of covering oh hell yeah 100% get that you said that makes sense explain okay you've done it you and I have both done it and I I'll explain that in a second am I forgetting something Tiaras you would often wear especially when you're reading tarot cards you would wear something on your head you know the a tiara or some type of jewelry that would cover your third eye and would cover your crown chakra I also very often would wear some type of Scar piece like a headpiece as tarot readers we come into contact with all sorts of people's energies and we basically invite them into ours and grab hold of their energy with both hands we need protection we need a lot of protection from that so even in our advertisements online having a covering over your head helps to protect you from that type of energy and as someone who works with the public in a very intimate energetic way I think we need that more than other types of people I guess I never looked at the headpieces as a quote unquote Veil I guess I just never made that connection it's not only a veil it would help enhance energy a lot of times we would wear in ritual space uh we liked to wear headpieces or crowns not necessarily as a protection but more as an enhancement of the magical and and of the energy that we were using and it works you know you feel that energy as soon as you set that crown on your head and it touches your third eye you can feel that you know and it it makes things better I guess I just never made the correlation between the two learn something new every day yeah it was like that for me with the hoodie and the headphones right it's the same thing or wearing your cloak shell how often have we been on how often if I hid behind the hood of my cloak for pull that hood up up and you're immediately in Sacred Space you immediately in protected space right I guess I just never I guess the word veiling is what threw me off and the word veiling is what kind of made me I was prejudiced yeah and but when you when you equate it to things like our headpieces and and and the Tiaras and the you know all that stuff the crystals the cloak hoodie and all makes sense it was the word veiling that I think I was getting caught up on it's that whole idea of for me too I had a lot of biases against it I had a lot of baggage with it because it is used and still today used as a tool of Oppression and control and and it's difficult for me to separate those two right um my husband opens my eyes on a lot of things he's a very clear seeeing person but you know just knowing that I do that with the hoodie with the headphones it it really opened my eyes to a whole different side of choosing to Veil and choosing to protect your energy in that way which is very different than being told to I think the moral of the story here is is that we've always been veiling and never really knew it the veil was the friends we made along the way right right who knew now that I've kind of put it in the perspective of stuff we've always been doing anyway yeah love veiling yeah it's still not something I'm going to do every day and I I have seen a couple just a few months ago on Reddit there was a high school AED person who was looking for help because they had chosen to Veil as part of their spiritual practice and I understand that a lot of people are choosing that as a daily regular practice for many reasons to show their dedication to their witchcraft again their deity has called and asked them to do it they feel more protected they feel more comfortable so they choose to it's not something that witchcraft tells you to do but this child had chosen to do this and and should be protected you know they chose it as part of their religion and unfortunately they were denied so at this point I think they are still writing letters into the school trying to help this child um and they have given them multiple ways like you and I said you could do barrettes or or some type of small piece of cloth in your hair to not be a hat or head covering but still give you a little bit of that protection particularly like you said if you use oils on it or you know protective incense that you pass it it through write your sigils of protection on it sew sigils I was going to say sew little sew little crystals into it if you can use the thread to make patterns of sigils or runes and to sew crystals into it to sew herbs into it you know so you can do that without having a full head covering but some people have gone this route and won with their school with their work some people commenting in that thread were in the military and had gotten the right to wear a head covering under Witchcraft and and so it for some people it's working for some people it is not as a society I don't think we're quite there yet with open freedoms so as much as the concept of veiling is a great idea there's still resistance and we we are not as a society where we should be on a lot of things and this is one of them you know the ACLU can definitely help with cases like that I believe the Church of Satan is also very good at helping people who are being religiously oppressed can I just give a little PSA since you mentioned that the Church of Satanism they're not what the media makes them out to be look into them before you judge them just saying oh they're pretty damn awesome actually you definitely should look into the Church of Satan because they do a lot of very good things actually they're their national headquarters is here in Salem yeah so an interesting place to go I will definitely say that it's funny because okay tangent I started out thinking I was a Satanist for like six months back when I was in high school because I was trying I couldn't figure out what religion I was I didn't know what I was I was looking and Satanism was like the closest one free will do what you want that kind of thing and then I found Witchcraft and was like oh this is what I am this is way better right but anyway so yeah veiling I think I I I accept our brothers and sisters that are doing veiling right now it's not for me daily I don't think but the head would be something it wouldn't be something I would do every day as as far as ritual veiling but I feel like yeah I probably already do my own version of veiling on the regular anyway just not necessarily the Webster definition of veiling yeah I'm still going to do my headphones and hoodies and hippie scarves and I think you're still going to be pulling your hair back into that ponytail while you wrap it up and say charms against all those evil eye people and don't think and do not think for a hot second that I am getting rid of any of those tias cuz I'm not oh you should not girl I mean those crowns are you they're definitely you for sure but yeah so I think you know veiling is is interesting and I'm curious to see where it's going it is not something you have to do how to decide if you should Veil I have two rules for that if you feel called to or if a deity calls you to or if you want to that's it and if you're comfortable yeah absolutely you know everybody needs to find their own way to protect themselves and their energy on the daily and this just might be the Avenue that works for you may not necessarily be the Avenue that works for me but if if this is one way that you can protect yourself and your energy when you're out and about rock it just rock it because there's some crazy energy out there wow wow yeah and however however we can move through this world right now and feel comfortable and safe in our own skin I say let's do it so yeah if headscarves are for you veiling is for you I'm very interested in this new aspect I I love seeing all these things that are just slightly different aspects of stuff that we kind of grew up learning in the craft and that are now coming out into the mainstream it's kind of it's interesting and are now actually having names put to it I think that was the biggest thing for me that what what we've always done never had a name it was like oh you know their's shell wearing another crowny headpiece and now it's their shell veiling so I just think we didn't necessarily have defined words for what we were doing back then yes yeah I think it's definitely a a a long-standing practice that is now becoming more refined and and like you said now has a word for it well as I'm soaking up this first half of the full moon I think I'm going to go put on a cute little crown and go out in the sunshine and just enjoy and if you other witches out there want to send me your favorite playlist on Spotify for when you are out and about grocery
