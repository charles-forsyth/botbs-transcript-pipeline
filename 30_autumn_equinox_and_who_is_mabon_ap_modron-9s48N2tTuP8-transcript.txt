Happy fall equinox for the Northern Hemisphere and for the southern hemisphere Happy Spring Equinox when the day and night are of equal lengths and the colder season begins welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and practices so grabb your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and Welcome to our mabin episode of back on the broomstick I'm Lea and I'm shell and today we are talking all things mabin and I gotta tell you you know what I got I know I showed you a picture of this I got bright red sunflowers from my love I saw that picture we even put one up on our Facebook and I think you put one up on the Instagram it is gorgeous and sunflowers are one of my favorite things about the Autumn Equinox and that kind of Segways me into what do you like to put on your mavin alar because sunflower a must absolutely I also have an old corn dolly that was given to me a long time ago as a house blessing and I like to keep her on my mabin altar as well to kind of you know remind you of the cutting down of the Corn the letting go of things but also creating something new with that all that dies will be reborn so I got a little funny story for our listeners real quick so I'm trying to make this beautiful Altar and you know since moving to Massachusetts Allergies have gotten the best of my life it's not the witch City it's the allergen City so here I go I'm off trying to get stuff go forage for beautiful alter stuff for this time of year so I didn't know I get this pretty I thought it looked like something grainy cuz you know grainy type things at this time of year on your altar apparently I cut down mug weed oh no so I bring this in my house and you know I make beautiful so my boyfriend says why is that in the house I go because it's pretty and he's like that's why you're sneezing yeah I'm like what do you mean so note to listeners be careful of what you are foraging from the outof doors and bringing in for your pretty little fall altars because it could really spark your allergies to the next level who knew who [Music] knew not a lot of Celtic traditionalists call this holiday Autumn Equinox mabin and the reason is I've just recently been hearing this and I was like what and I was actually told that it's called that be calling it mabin is a Wiccan a quote unquote Wiccan term so proceed yes mabin is a relatively new term mabin is actually the name of the god and it's not technically the name of the holiday it kind of was given that name back in around 1970 to 1975 by a man named Aiden Kelly he literally made up or guessed the names for litha ostara and mabin litha and ostara have a little bit of historical context for those names but mabin he pretty much made up completely a lot of people still call it mabin today and I think most people don't mind whether you call it mabin because it's been known that way for decades or if you call it the Autumn Equinox as long as you know where it came from it definitely is not a name that's been around for hundreds or thousands of years it was completely made up by Mr Kelly in about 1974 correct it's most commonly known particularly by Celtic reconstructionists as the Autumn Equinox correct um and I I I actually was just I had a deep discussion about that recently and I was like huh I guess you're right and then I've kind of felt guilty almost calling it mbin ever since honestly go ahead and call it mabin I mean if you're in a coven or a circle where it's a no no please don't but for the most part it is accepted as mabin or Autumn Equinox either one is correct just understand where it comes from and that the word mabin is not an ancient title it's actually pretty new when all else fails call it the Equinox there you go go perfect another notch in the wheel of the Year why do I always say that why do I call it a notch I don't know I think of a wheel notching remember our our very first wheel of the year was imul I feel like it was a hundred years ago but I also feel like where did this year go where did this year go we are almost to the witches New Year sin is right around the corner this is the Second Harvest and leaves are changing it's cold do you do leaves change in California or no sort of not really the grass not at all like here things will go yellow or brown and some leaves will turn a little bit but you don't get that red and orange and you don't that don't happen out there no in in the mountains it will if I go up to Big Bear or something like that I'll see it a little bit but even up there the trees are different so it's still a lot more yellows yellows and Browns do palm trees change no nope okay they stay green and they still look gorgeous as you can tell I am total East Coast here New England I know nothing we'll get you out there we will about pal trees hey when we're doing our Countrywide road trip I'll get you there I'll show you palm trees we'll be cruising around in our little witchy auntie schoolie and we'll go to all these great places so back to the fall equinox it has always been one of my favorite holidays particularly on the East Coast just because this is a great time of year here I've said already I'm a basic I love me some fall I like the fuzzy boots I like the fuzzy jackets I like to wear a hat give me a flannel any day little fire in the evening colored leaves I'm so there I have a confession what's up I hate pumpkin spice oh yeah there I said it people I said it I'm with you I like it in pumpkin pie and I like it a little bit in things but man they've got everything everything yeah it's in everything I think we even mentioned they have pumpkin spice and bued clothing I can't get behind that that's just wrong I I've never really liked pumpkin spicing coffee or any of that so I guess I'm not that basic I'm I'm not your Starbucks basic I'm just your fall leaves and UGGs and flannel shirts basic so my sweet boyfriend today he was off today and and in my day job my real job my my paying job this is your real job show that one just brings in the money but I I was I was work at home today and he was home he's like you want me make you some cinnamon buns I'm like yeah does like like a freaking cinnamon bun du the answer to that is always yes it was a  pumpkin spice cinnamon bun can I just say that and it wasn't even like you know the white icing that oh the white icing it was pumpkin spice icing no see that's too much leave my cream cheese frosting alone thank you right so I don't know I just I love so did you kick him out are you guys still together I ate it I was hungry yeah it is sugar yeah and you know and I I I had a work meeting and I just needed to like shove some sweet cinnamon yumminess in my mouth whether it tasted like pumpkin or not it happens it happens but aside from pumpkin spice I love All Things Fall you don't get this in California you only get this on the east coast in the Northeast the smell of the leaves change like when all those leaves are red and orange and yellow like the smell of that there's something about it I agree it's definitely it's definitely nice you can tell tell that the seasons are changing in the beginning of September you could tell that the season was changing it's something something small something infimal changed in the air and it just switched now just just to give folks an idea of kind of the premise of mabin what we celebrate for abin it is the fall equinox day and night are equal length 12 and 12 man it's kind of sad for me because of course like any other person on the planet I love those long days I love them and once we once we get to mbin that's when it kind of smacks you in the head that like it's dark at 7 o'clock now I like when it gets dark at like 8:45 9 o'clock yes yeah the shorter days are hard people have trouble this time of year I mean there there's that whole Seasonal effective disorder or sad right really does cause problems for people this time of year because there isn't so much sunlight we're we're kind of mourning the the sun going down a little bit but aside aside from the Equinox part that the equal day Day and Night Part this is also the Second Harvest if you recall back to our llamas episode um back in August we talked about how that was the first of three harvests mabin is the second of three harvests so you got that equal day and night thing going on aside from that second harvest lots of good eats coming out right now by the way another thing I love about this time of year corn is out gourds you know pumpkin squash all of that is out apples are out I love being on the East Coast for apples there's nothing like a honey crisp apple from New York you have not lived until you've gone apple picking every I think everybody on the East Coast has gone apple picking once in their life oh gosh you have to it's it's a joy to do this time of year get outside wherever you are go to a farmers market go to an apple picking place a pumpkin picking place if you can and another thing you can do something I was shown a long time ago for abin that has always struck me with a little bit of Wonder it's a lot of fun to do with kids or even grown-ups but is to take one of those apples that you have picked out of the tree now normally when you cut an apple in half you go straight down the the stem right go from the stem down and you cut it in half instead of that turn it on its side and cut it in half that way like through the meat of the Apple so that you have the stem on one side and like the butt on the other and then look in the center of that Apple where the seeds are and you'll see a five-pointed star and I love that symbolism for this time of year cut your apples in half that way and you can lay that as as an offering on your alter but it's kind of beautiful to see the pentacle hidden inside the Apple absolutely because you know I think I was like 30 something before I realized that that if you C the app sideway I was like no I don't even know who programmed me to cut apples that way also grains I couldn't even think of the word oh yeah making bread I I love that it's anything that you can do with baking the abundance from your garden you probably got too much zucchini from your neighbor or you know you've got your apples you've got fruits and everything is just coming in in abundance this is such a time of year to reflect on that abundance reflect on the work it took to get that type of abundance and prepare it and plan for the winter ahead because the first harvest we may not have thought of winter it's still summer the days are still long we're still enjoying that it's just Bountiful but now it's starting to get a little Frosty it's getting a little colder you might actually have in your mind that you need to prepare for the winter time and for the coming cold and to put some of those things away but yeah take those grains and you know make yourself something delicious you know how I've been into this whole spell jar thing lately oh yeah gorgeous I love seeing your spell jars I was sinking the other night knowing that we were going to do this episode a really good mab and spell jar oh what's your idea here's my idea now you know I like those little mini mason jar things for spell jars good side perfect the mini ones don't be getting no big gallon thing because too much no nobody needs to be filling that up too expensive and a little goes a long way right little bit of dirt in the bottom dig it up from your yard it's plentiful yeah we don't all get to have Salem dirt in our backyard shell I got Salem dirt folks if you need give a shout out to our email I'll mail you some Salem dirt oh the first person to email and ask it's some Salem dirt right I'm gonna email you but you know the first Leaf there's always that first leaf that like I don't know what what do they call it that leaves do color I guess like get all brittle the chlorophyll goes away and that's the word I was looking for lacking chlorophyll I try to find the first Leaf put a nice crispy Leaf in like a Autumn Leaf so you know a first turned Leaf some dirt a piece of Apple but now ah I wonder if I could but too big you can even do a slice that way cut it in the middle and cut the slice or cut the just cut the center out like cut a big slice and then and then cut a circle around the star in the center probably yeah that would actually and to preserve it you could either use some vitamin E oil or better yet just use a little bit of lemon juice and put that on there think of that and then it won't change color on you genius and then a cinnamon stick and this time of year I don't know why but for some reason I love burning orange and red candles wow orange and red in the fall I wonder what that could mean see I'm a person I I I personally yellow is not my favorite we all have a color in our lives that somehow for some reason repulses us for some reason in my life yellow repulses me so I know yellow is a fall color but I just stick with the red and orange I love the red and orange use gold instead of yellow I think that's better this time of year anyways but I've been doing those uh wax seals so what I would do is take this orange or red candle drip the wax over the top of my little spell jar and then use one of my wax seals to kind of seal my little mabin spell jar that's perfect that's absolutely perfect and the colors that you choose can reflect what you see in nature so maybe in California instead of using some of those deep Reds I might use some of that yellow or you know like a brownish orange or something like that just to kind of reflect what I'm seeing outside in nature right right also you could use like a uh they sell these at like local store like Trader Joe's or Wegman's little stock of barley you can get little stocks of um wheat like an actual stock not processed they're kind of pretty to put in spell jars they really are they're beautiful and that grain to represent the god of the Corn the god of the grain the Green Man konos uh who's the who's the dianis the god of the vine the god of wine god of wine it's hard to preserve an apple or a grape or something like that in a spelled jar so I think a sheath of of grain is perfect to put one little head of grain because also you know how I am I with these spell jars yes I'm going for magic yes I'm trying to do a spell but I also want it to be pretty yeah I love things to be pretty I that's why I like the pageantry of spellcraft we talk a lot about being able to do spells just in our head or just by thinking about it or or forming intention sometimes the ceremonial part of it or the ritualistic piece of it I don't want to say need that but sometimes it's not a bad thing it's never a bad thing because being able to see those things in a spell jar or to see each of your quarter altars and your god and goddess altar set up and ready for the season the incense the candles everything puts you into that magical space and get you into into a space where you can do magic where you can affect change and when we talk about intention we're not saying you can just tomorrow go out and be like my intention is to conjure the wind because there's there's more to it than that there's practice and repetition there's there's training your mind through meditation and through to it you're not just poof there goes the wind right right exactly it doesn't happen overnight and even once you have that training it's beautiful to to put a MB and altar together how often did our community everyone bring things from their Garden right things that they had created or were in the process of making and we just all kind of put them together on this altar of bounty which is what this season really represents and and see that's kind of the the idea behind the the mini mason jar mabin spell jar so to say as you know in my current living situation I don't have tons of alter space so my alter isn't something I can switch up a lot or I choose not to switch it up a lot whatever that is I can make this little MB and spell jar and have that be like my ma and alter for the time being and add it to my current alter Al without switching up my current altar get what I'm saying yeah that's exactly a good way to do it and and changing your altar for the seasons is all well and good but maybe we all can't do that right you know do it in a smaller way and I like that well and part of that is you know I like my altar the way I like it like even when I take it apart and clean it and and cleanse all my stuff and you know clean and dust and all I literally put every single thing back exactly where I had it last time way too OCD about my altar but you that's a good point shell is this is an excellent time of year to clean your altar even if you're not going to decorate it for the season I mean we talk a lot about cleansing for the holidays but in the southern hemisphere right now it's oara the Spring Equinox and so so like spring cleaning this is the flip side of that we're going into winter like in spring cleaning you want to cleanse everything and bring in that new air fall cleaning is so underrated but let me tell you you want it you know even if it's not for witchy purposes dude the holidays are coming people are coming to your house it's getting cold your furnace is going to be on blowing you're going to be closing everything in right you know keep clean right close it and clean make sure that things smell the way that you want them to smell burn that incense make sure you're you know you have those fall scents or those wonderful scents oh my God you know what I got at the grocery store the other day what' you get you know how they have those freaking broomsticks that are like the cinnamon brooms you love those the minute I start getting that fall vibe in here in the east Coast it's that fall Vibe is 80 degrees during the day and 45 at night so that's your sign to take yourself to local supermarket to the flower section and every year I get one of those cinnamon brooms and I'm telling you that lasts until well after Christmas almost like it puts my mindset okay I'm smelling cinnamon 247 it must be fall being back on the East Coast one of my favorite things is Wegman's oh my God I love Wegman we I love them so much we actually call it wagies waggies love wagies well I happen to be in Rochester New York oh my God isn't that like the birthplace of Wegman's yes it is stupid that I know this it's stupid that I know this I'm here in the birthplace of Wegman's anyway the point is is I think they have an orange and cinnamon scented wreath I thought of you when I saw it because I know that you really like the cinnamon brooms and so I thought an orange and cinnamon scented that's got to be fantastic you know what is another cool fall thing to do at your house if you like that fall sa take a freaking big pan like a big spaghetti pan I'm sure it has a better name than a spaghetti pan but that's what I call it a big spaghetti pot fill it like 3/4s of the way with water and then fill that pot with cut up apples cut up oranges and cinnamon sticks your house will smell like damn fall in 40 minutes that sounds like it smells fabulous and I'm going to do it yeah the oranges the apples and the cinnamon let me tell you throw in some cranberries you're going to want to lick the air in your house nice yeah that'll get your house all permeated with good feelings and lots of and while you do it think of abundance the apples I mean apples are symbols of longevity immortality Health fertility uh Harvest and oranges are symbols of wealth and cleansing and all these good things and so you put this stuff all together and not only you're getting a wonderful scent in your house but you're also getting all these fabulous Vibes all these auras of goodness going through your house as well now you know I love making incense so I wanted to talk real quick about maybe if you're herbally person like me and you want to come up with some sort of maon type concoction I call them concoctions love it this time of year a lot of the things I like to burn are like bay leaves which normally I think of bay leaves was spaghetti but perfect aren't they really good for banishing spirits too bay leaf so yeah great the veil of it's getting thin yeah the veil between the worlds is getting very very thin it's obviously thinnest on sin but it's thinner now than at most other times of the year so something to protect you from Spirits or or to call them in alternatively if you're looking to reconnect with some loved ones you know bay is excellent to to help protect your home but again you know other things besides that you know Sage Rosemary um eona High soaps but you know sometimes if I'm making some sort of incent sometimes I make the jars of herbs more not to necessarily burn but more like in a spell jar type fashion sure I'll put stones in there this time of the year just like I would pick candles that are like red and orange I will use a yellow stone for this just because yellow stones are different than me hating the color yellow in general I would use Carnelian or citrine and put like a little St Stone like I get sometimes I buy mass quantities of those little chip stones and I'll put a couple of chips based on the color and what I'm using it for I'm big on color correspondences too color correspondences are great because they're an easy way to get you right into the mindset for mabin you can use hematite you can use cat ey Amber citrine you know anything that's kind of that yellowy ready orangey not that hematite is that's obviously not but still good stone for this time of year and then like I said with candles I would use like the Reds the oranges you can use yellow not my personal preference you know what actually is really cool like if you can get your hands on like a burgundy candle this time of year oh I love that color and with Christmas coming all the Christmas  is out so you can get burgundy candles pretty much now burgundy is an excellent color also because you know it looks like wine it's that light dark wine red yeah and this is again the time of year when dianis the god of the vine grapes are sacred this time of year it's also September is the wine Moon another thing this time of year I think about is with mbin and ostara it's kind of you got to kind of also think of it as like a transition time because cold sucks warm is great and fall and spring or the transition between that so it's kind of the transition into the next big season right everything's getting darker it's getting colder it's getting more shut in it's getting more hermy I always feel feel like a hermit this time of year yeah this is definitely a time when people start to go inward we are in the we're getting to the darker half we're we're we're marching down the darker half Trail yeah we are on the we are on the back end of the of the dark half of the year and it's just going to get darker from here you know you have to kind of go inward this is the time to put things away to take stock of where you're at you know this is the second harvest so you know how things are turning out in your garden both literal and figurative and so you know what has worked for you and what hasn't so now is the time to harvest and put away and learn from the things that have worked for you and to cut down the things that didn't and get rid of them you know put them in your compost pile for next year you know grow from those things even if they didn't serve you the way that you wanted them to learn from that type of thing and and take stock of that you know we're we're going to be a lot of us I mean not in California but a lot of the country is going to go inside a lot and kind of be stuck and we're going to end up going inside our own heads a lot so you kind of want to prepare for that and be ready start journaling start taking stock of where you're at in your life right now and and you know do some things to prepare for the next season it's also a good time to start ancestor work um the next like couple of months are a good time for ancestor work is the season for the veil to be thin like you said that's also another another thing that you can kind of work into your mabin slash sa uh rituals and stuff in the moons in between good time to touch basee with the old ancestors very very good point like you said the veil is very thin this time of year and but this is definitely a good time of year to do it but stay grounded you know make sure you have your hematite it's delightfully frightening it is a delightfully frightening time of year no I met ancestor work oh yeah ancestor work is delightfully frightening yes yes it is mbin is also the time when pranie is supposed to return to the underworld back to her husband Hades for that half of the year when she is with him and and that's when her mother demer goes into mourning and that's why the Earth kind of gets cold and has snow oh so according to Circle Of The Sacred Muse the birth of mabin AP modrin which means great son of the great mother is celebrated at the Equinox he is born from his mother modin who is seen as the guardian of the other world the earth and the protector mavin was stolen from his mother when he was three nights old in one version of the myth the eagle the owl the Blackbird the Stag and the salmon rescued him while in another King Arthur was the one who saved him during his captivity mbin dwelled in a magical otherw world in madan's womb madan's womb was a place of Challenge and nurturing and while there mabin grew in strength and wisdom before being reborn as the son of light his mother's Champion so this kind of follows the prapan myth a little bit because he goes back into his mother's womb to be protected and then comes back out as the son of light when pranie she goes into the underworld with Hades she eats some seeds from the pomegranate and so when her mother finally finds her she stays in the Underworld for six months of the year and comes back out for six months it's the kind of same story mavin goes into the womb pranie goes to the underworld and the world gets dark and cold and then when pranie comes up from the underworld and mabin is reborn then the light returns to the Earth and we get warmth in the Sun and growing things again so that's the story of mabin which is again basically that whole theory that Mythos of of going within and kind of gathering your strength and finding finding that within yourself before being reborn into the light and being able to take those things that you have learned internally and bring them out to the world right right so some good ways to do that are journaling meditating doing ritual this is a great time of year to spend some time with yourself do self meditations this is what you should you know a lot of people like to meditate just sitting I'm GNA Sit Close My Eyes meditate you can meditate walking through the woods of fall beautiful leaves and get the same effect as if you sat on your damn bed and closed your eyes you know I also look at this as kind of winding down your outside time take advantage of your outside time take it all in because it's going to be many months before it's back and flush that's right live every day as if it's going to be the last time you get that glorious sunshine and that wonderful warmth do all the outdoors things you can seize this season grab it all store it all in because like you said it's going to be dark soon enough and you're not going to be able to do those things that you love so do it as much as you can none of us are promised tomorrow also I'd really like to thank one of our Instagram users Becca want to give her a shout out shout out to Becca hey Becca I had talked about some ancestors um in our ancestor episode and Becca was such a deer and went out and did some research for me um and
