smoking what I have a review to read for you today shell we got a review yeah we get them all the time review what do you got what do you got what I got for you is probably one of my favorite reviews ever and the reason is because I I love everything that that they say this is exactly what I'm hoping to do when we started this podcast this is from jewels5 on Apple podcast and juw said best pod ever and gave us five stars these ladies are are the best they're so fun to listen to and find the best stories to tell they're such good friends they make you feel like you are part of the podcast they're always getting super high and sharing what they're smoking I love that because it always gives listeners new butt ideas to try I love to turn this podcast on whenever I'm doing chores gardening or smoking a fat bowl they are good company to have in your ear keep up the great work ladies a isn't that nice thanks that's awesome I love that so Jules I am smoking a big fat bowl with you I hope I'm about to spark up some of this fabulous gelato dream that I'm smoking o of course you always got gelato or Jack hair or something like that oh yeah you know gelato are my absolute favorite I have a sweet tooth for the gelato cultivars big time and this one is phenomenal it's one that I grew myself it is got some nice little purple on it and I would have to say this is one of the higher thc's that I've had in a while and so going to go a little bit slower on this today because I have not had a 36% THC in a minute you're the editor extraordinaire you're like the Techno brains of this operation and I just want the listeners to know I don't know how she's gonna edit the intro to how good it makes it sound but Lila is really [ __ ] up today and the in the intro took her a good four minutes it so whatever she's whatever she's spoken she's really struggling to speak today and I love it I'm a little Tongue Tied it's true my thoughts are ping ponging all over the place this is definitely again this is my own so I have this sounds like cleaning we this is what you just this is like what Jules says you get up and you just pack a big fatty and you start cleaning this is something I would use to work in my garden while listening to other people's podcasts and music because I can't keep a straight thought in my head and I definitely want to be up I'm very Smiley I'm very happy want to be moving around so this gelato dream is absolutely fantastic it's sativa dominant and as you know I love my picky [ __ ] but it is very sweet all these gelato have delicious tastes I'm not sure exactly what Tarpin go into a gelato but I know that they give it kind of that almost a dessert like taste combined with the high silly exactly so it's named so well it's perfect so what are you smoking today sh I got the stuff now here's the thing with this this is another one of those like it gets you up and pey and perky but you start getting hangry okay this this stuff makes you hangry you don't have any sparkly peeps this time do you them all oh good but I do have a leftover big huge coconut cream Easter egg because you know I don't eat my Easter candy in a timely fashion so you know we might be munching on some coconut cream Easter eggs today we'll see how that goes we'll call it a Post belane Easter candy treat so this is called Midnight o I like it there is I feel like this is another one of those that I can manipulate either I can be uppity uppity or like relax I wouldn't say melty but relaxed you know okay now this has let me see so this is 27.7 wait no I lie total cannaboids uh 29.5 oh nice the thca is 27.75 the THC 9 is one blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you know I don't really care about all that stuff here's the thing that grinds my gears about this one it tastes like I'm smoking a bundle of sage M like feel like I'm in a damn ritual but instead of smelling the sage I'm smoking the sage like it's very I don't even know if Piney is the word it's very planty this was the weed that they used to call Grass because it tastes like grass like like it's very planty so it's probably pinin pinene kind of has that a little bit piny more of an herbal like green grassy taste yeah yeah yeah that's what this is this is like not that beautiful Citrus flavor lemon flavor no no no no no it's beautiful it's gorgeous it's just very earthy tasting so if I were you I would stay away from cultivars that have pining so if you look on that label does it have percentages I know some of the ones you've had before have actually had tarpine percentages on them this does not Ah that's a bummer you could ask the people like what the dominant tarpine profile is and if it has pining in it I would stay away you've mentioned a couple times that you don't really like that particular taste yeah pinene and terpinolene are the two that are are very piny but terpinolene can be a little sweeter and a little more floral tasting for as much info as they put on these damn labels can't they just say this [ __ ] tastes like grass this [ __ ] tastes like lemon can I have some descriptions like if you are going to print a label with a bunch of crap on it that I don't even give a [ __ ] about could you at least print on there what it tastes like yes I'm with you I've seen on wine and I've seen on cheeses in different stores they'll have what it tastes like right this tastes like a gym sock okay that's I want that's right but you know if it says you know this tastes grapey or this tastes floral or lemony you know maybe the people that work in some of these places could write quick little notes you know a comment about what it tastes like or they're putting on here that it was tested I don't know how they're testing it but in my mind somebody's rolling a big fat joint of this [ __ ] and testing it for for us can you at least write down what it tastes like yes I would like that I I like to know what's in it I like to know the chemical makeup when I'm buying something I like to know what the THC is for sure wouldn't you [ __ ] yourself if you and I got a phone call one day and they were like de shelle and Leila the government would like you to come and help federally regulate this [ __ ] we need your ideas and we would just be like dude okay let's start with the labels and then [ __ ] yes I'm so there call me up I would that job I will be the high Empress of weed for the whole country shell and I we got this I'll just be fine being the the weed princess you can be the Empress of weed and I'm just gonna be the weed princess okay you can be the princess of weed I love that and you'll be the empress we also get to taste test everything and write little cards about what they taste like dear Federal Regulators please send us an email at The ston Witches Hour gmail.com and offer us the weed job of our dreams damn it you don't even have to pay me man just let me it okay I lie you're the federal government give me a little bit of money here right they can spare it yeah you got it give me healthare damn healthare and all the weed I can smoke they don't know what they're getting into that's all I want I'm just a short woman I'm not very big I just want all the weed I can smoke that's all pretty pleased that would be such a costly adventure for them yeah but we would absolutely love to label them all but yeah that would be better I think think if I could find a weed shop that actually let their employees taste test the Cannabis that they got and put little labels on everything about what they thought about it I would love that I mean you go to some of the stores here in Massachusetts and they'll be like staff pick or staff choice of the week so you know these guys are testing it they're not just randomly picking something to say staff choice if you've been into any of these dispensaries these people are smoking their product I promise you if it's a staff pick it's because they got blazed on it and if I go into a place I will ask a bud tender now I've not had as good of luck as you occasionally I'll get a great bud tender when I ask them well what do you like what tastes good what has a good high you know they'll usually have something that they like or they themselves have tried so at least there's that Avenue if they don't necessarily know where it was grown or when it was harvested or what it tests at I do take that Avenue sometimes if I'm looking at something and I'm not sure and I never heard it before I'll just be like hey have you smoked this right just cut to the chase have you smoked this is it good did you get really really high I just ask they tell you they have no shame in their game that's right you know what I've been hearing lately what just real quick before we get into the stories I want you to explain something to me shlain it you need to shlain it Shain it I'll try hit me a lot of people a lot of older people older than us have said so older than dirt is what you're saying correct we'll just call them more of the closer to the boomer generation how about that Elder Gen X Elder Gen X they're saying that um they don't like one person in particular I encountered a week or so ago said they wouldn't even bother smoking weed nowadays because it's nothing like it used to be like I'm talking like back in the 70s and 80s and they're like it's so skunky now am I missing something because I was somewhere the other day and I kind of walked into a room and someone was like why do I smell skunk and I'm like I feel like my [ __ ] don't smell like skunk but yet I'm hearing this all over and I'm hearing that I smell like skunk so does weed really smell like skunk and I'm just immune to it and why does it smell like skunk now and it didn't 40 years ago I think that this deserves like a a multi-art answer the first part is they're full of [ __ ] and the second part is weed is more potent now and we do breed for more of a smell and a taste than people ever used to funny comparison look up cannabis pictures from like uh the centerfold from High Times from like 70s even 80s and then look at weed now vastly different it looks like the worst homeg grown that your buddy's buddy kind of grew in his closet with a light bulb it probably was grown there probably and you remember what that [ __ ] looked like and you remember that it was half stems and seeds every time and sometimes we'd have brick weed we'd have to peel apart and there would be [ __ ] mold in it yeah when I say brick weed children I mean literal weed that was compressed into a brick you had to peel the buds apart they were peeling them I do I do and I remember the little trick with the magazine and a credit card so that I could separate my weed from the seeds easily yeah the people that are saying it's skunky now are a little bit correct it is more potent now I wouldn't say it's necessarily skunk itself more but it is smellier and tastier and stronger okay because I just want to put it out there one of the people who said I smelled like skunk was my dad oh yeah he's a boomer and I'm just like I don't think I smell like a skunk but I guess I do a lot of those people I think never really were smokers or they were really big Stoners back in like the late 60s early 70s and then slowed down and haven't been in the game recently and now think it's different right and it is it is I mean life is different folks life is different that's right things get better so we're here for a reason tonight it's not just to get high well we won't tell them that we are gonna talk about listener stories yes we do have listener stories that's right we're not just hanging out just think they are getting just as high as we are probably I hope so Jules I'm smoking another bowl for you so light up girl and you know what I'm getting I'm getting what what was that phrase had something to do with us getting higher than rhinos High Enough To Kill a rhino that's it we're there we're there I am going to start this out with a little bit of a sad news what um I have had a loss recently we've talked about my hundred-year-old Grandma we did his birthday we celebrated in April she unfortunately passed away this month she did make it to a 100 and that's what she wanted to do and she was surrounded by her very large and loving family so a couple of these stories I know have to Pardon Me do have to do with grandmothers so I picked them specifically because of that to honor my grandmother you know she did love a good story so now was your grandmother into ghosts a little bit yeah she definitely believed in ghosts and she does believe that her husband has come to her and she would see people in dreams she wasn't really necessarily a huge believer okay okay just a little bit is all it takes all it takes and I am hoping grandma if you're listening I would love a sign or a Dream from you so I'm going to dedicate this episode to Jenny May who turned 100 this year and is now Trav traveling in the stars with the loved ones that have gone before so I'll hail the traveler damn it Jenny May will you please come to Lea because she needs a sign she wants to sign so how about I jump in first because I got a really good one give it to me this story was sent from August M love the name by the way August writes to us when I was six years old my family bought our first black lab you can't e black labs right love Labs oh my God they named it magic oh that's a great name August and Magic were inseparable and when August was 18 magic passed away from a heart tumor that's [ __ ] sucks that's [ __ ] shitty I'm very sorry of course August was absolutely devastated obviously and had a really hard time getting to sleep afterwards because she always slept in the bed with a year later they got another black lab and then this weird phenomena started to happen August wants us to note that it should be noted that the lab refused to sleep in the bedroom funny probably knew it was already the other lab's room didn't even really like going into it at all always looked intently at spots and then would quickly leave they would bring him onto the bed and try to get him to sleep in the room and he would jump right off and cry to be let out of the room and August would sleep with the door closed so August knew that the dog wasn't coming in but one night tossing and turning all of the sudden felt as if someone had jumped in the bottom of the bed oh so the new dog is they they shut the new dog out of the room because she wouldn't settle in the bedroom where the other dog had died correct so the door shut correct but August felt the dog jump up into the bed correct oh wow wow and obviously as you can imagine there's no dog in the like like that you can see as you can imagine that would freak me out I'd love it though August's exact exact words were it freaked me the hell out Ah that's funny see I'm with you August right there I'm right there with you then just like she would always do when she was alive it felt like Four Paws were moving in a circle trying to find that quote unquote Sweet Spot before the covers would just gently press down at their feet oh this happened every night for weeks oh their old dog was coming back yeah August kind of felt like you know am I going little cuckoo here but one night it was really annoyed because August woke up and was was kind of getting a little pissed off at the way that this ghostly Spirit was kind of pushing and shoving and making its way and August yells magic go bug mom kind of said it out loud half jokingly but didn't actually fully believe that it was magic and the next morning over breakfast the mother looks at August and says the strangest thing happened to me last night I swear like I felt magic jump onto my bed find the comfy spot and lay down no [ __ ] so basically August told the freaking dog to go to the Mom's room and the dog sure as [ __ ] went to the mom you are kidding I'm not kidding you I don't make this [ __ ] up awesome August that's [ __ ] cool yeah August never told their mother uh that they thought that magic was jumping on the bed every night because shocker didn't want to come off as crazy right right you just sound like sad like you missed your pet obviously as you would after the mom had said this and said that you know obviously August told the mom what was happening and had said that they had sent magic to go bother her that night so August in the mom cried because they you feel bad you know yeah and they kind of felt like they didn't want magic to feel like she's been replaced yeah you know it was kind of a sad thing I'm just imagine the mom was probably like what the [ __ ] so after they cried for a little bit and and you know we're kind of reminiscing about magic later that week it just stopped all of a sudden August told the mom that they hadn't felt magic jump on theed in the last few days and the mom said that when August wasn't home she went up to the bedroom and told magic we love her and we'll never forget her and she could never be replaced and it's okay to rest now oh wow I wonder if they realized they were doing magic when they did check this [ __ ] literal magic not the dog magic check this [ __ ] out ever since then the new lab has slept in the bedroom every night um they think that magic basically gave the new dog permission to be in the room a and the mom and August still tell people the story they have no explanation for it and they believe that she came back to spend a little bit more time and show the new puppy how to be a good boy oh that's so sweet sad but sweet I was gonna say it's like heartbreaking but heartwarming all time if that makes sense because you know here's poor August has this damn dog from the time there's six years old to 18 like that's like getting a limb cut off at that point truly and then to I don't know what's worse to have magic come back or have magic leave for good the second time well as someone who has lost a 15-year-old dog I think coming back would be really nice it would hurt but it would feel really good too you know what I loved about this story well I loved a lot of things about it but that dog was territorial even after do not come in my room was like hey you've got a new puppy this is my person this is my bed right and and the fact that the dog was like okay guess I'm not welcome in this room I'll go sleep out in the hallway thank you that's you know people don't give pets enough credit for having that I don't even know what you call it second site I don't know what you call it we've talked about that on this podcast before animals seem to sense things and that we give we give a lot of weight a lot of credence to incidents where an animal also senses that there's something there and in this case this dog obviously sense that there was a problem or something in that room and it wasn't welcome and then it was comfortable you know after they cried and let go and then the mother went up and did that releasing spell you know maybe they didn't realize that you know it wasn't a bad thing you know the dog the new dog wasn't scared it wasn't like barking like there wasn't an evil entity you know there wasn't a portal to hell in poor August's bedroom surpris they're everywhere else the story comes across like the two dogs had a mutual respect yeah yeah and I love that I love that too that's very sweet so August we appreciate hearing your story about your sweet sweet magic you know as much as I know that magic has crossed over to a different realm I do hope magic comes back and visits again oh that would be so nice let us know if she does all right so my first story does involve a grandmother and it is from someone called wiie Jack so Willie Jack says my wife was given her grandmother's antique clock a cherished heirloom that held a special place in her heart when she moved into her first apartment when she first received it the clock would trime every hour like clockwork isn't that what clocks are supposed to do yep exactly but all that changed after her grandmother passed away the clocks Chimes stopped and would only chime when there was something significant happening in our lives it went off on our wedding day the day our first child was born on birthdays and every first day of school for the last 5 years what the hell happens if it's not a birthday or iversary and it goes off I'd be [ __ ] myself right every time it chimed we knew something important was going to happen one day a few months ago I had to make a quick run to the store for some cigarettes and a soda before work I knew I'd be leaving a bit later than usual because I was picking up a cooworker who was also a good friend to go to a job site so I figured I had some time when I returned at 7:01 my wife told me that I had just missed the clock chiming I wondered if there was anything special happening that day but couldn't think of anything off the top of my head as I stepped out onto the deck to call my coworker I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off I tried calling him twice but there was no answer just as I was about to give up his girlfriend answered the phone this is Becky Gary isn't going to make it to work today I found him dead 10 minutes ago I was speechless my mind was racing trying to process what had just happened right then just as I was about to collect myself the clock chimed again at 7:19 a.m. as if to confirm what had just occurred I was stunned until that moment I had been a skeptic when it came to ghosts and the Paranormal but this experience left no room for doubt it was strange how the clock only chimed when something significant was happening and we never quite understood it but we were grateful for the comfort and reassurance it brought us it was almost as if it was a way for our loved ones to communicate with us from the other side letting us know they were watching over us but scary as [ __ ] like the clock Chimes you're like oh [ __ ] now what right oh my goodness good story I wonder if they still own the clock I'm curious I would like to know and I wonder if the grandmother had any experiences with it you know because she gave it away to this woman and it seemed fine it didn't get weird until after the grandmother passed so I wonder if the grandmother had any kind of experiences at all with it beforehand you know what I noticed about grandmothers what's that weird [ __ ] happens and they don't tell their family and they're like here take this don't ever let it out of the family just keep it forever I Can't Tell You Why and then all this weird [ __ ] happens that's such a freaking Grandma move want to do that I am going to collect weird objects and I'm absolutely going to pass them down if I ever have grandchildren I will pick children I don't care I'll pick some your grandchildren and I'll pass them weird and mysterious objects totally the kind of old lady I want to be I dispense diic boxes and Demon brushes and weird dolls that'll be my old lady gimmick if you have any of those let us know because Lila is going to hand them out as the weird old Auntie that everyone needs a [ __ ] my grandkids are gonna have some crazy [ __ ] because of you damn it right I've already got that book from the wh house that's haunted I need to get to your grandson oo he he he's still a minute away from reading so you got a second got a minute I got a minute so what's your next story so my next story comes from a fine listener KD so KD sent us this great story now KD first of all I want to put out there is one of our peeps a New Yorker shout out to the New Yorker so KD writes years ago I was living outside of Buffalo New York on an old estate on the lake e Reed Shore I rented a Carriage House of an old mansion that a doctor and his wife owned the doctor was a heart surgeon and they were a well-to-do couple with multiple properties there's a lot of those people along the Great Lakes have to say I know right have you seen those houses damn you know it takes a couple pennies to own so the people who owned it weren't a lot weren't around a lot KD liked the Solitude of the place and having just gotten divorced although the carriage house was slightly decrepit KD loved living there the Mansion looked over the lake and her house was closer to the road off a private drive that went from one side of the estate to the other The Carriage House had servants quarters and whoever lived in the Mansion at the turn of the 20th century had servants lucky there was an enclosed Courtyard outside my door that was B was bordered by the back of my house the carriage Barn which had stored carriages in the back like with horses and Buggies this place sounds like a mansion sign me up I would love a carriage house it was a very cool place to live the rent was cheap and there was a private 150 foot Beach what this has to be old because there's no way in this housing climate you could find that it's not possible very isolated as if there was nobody staying in the Mansion there weren't any close neighbors because all the houses along the road were biggest states and a lot of the rich people living in the area weren't full-time residents but KD was young and brave and it was a big estate full of decaying spookiness that sounds fun Katie writes I am a weirdo that likes that kind of stuff so I was overjoyed us too so Katie continues on one night I was coming home late around 1:00 a.m. from a friend's house driving down a street a mile or two from my house I saw a dark figure up ahead standing close to the road I thought that was kind of odd because it was late on a night on a weekday not exactly a party town in the Buffalo South Town right no [ __ ] like in Upstate New York we can only party on Friday and Saturday Thursday if it's a good week Katie started to get a little nervous because the person was standing as if they were waiting for someone to pick them up and as Katie got closer they could see that they were wearing an unusual black shroud like thing H like a cloak or something maybe I guess long and dark and draped with a part of it wrapped over the person's head to look like a hood sounds vaguely cloak like but it just like a bunch of material wrapped around the body and the head and it seemed totally inappropriate for what Katie knew of the people that lived in the area that wasn't common place for like the local yals okay especially not outside at 1:00 in the morning on a weekday and the person was just standing by the side of the road looking stooped over an old KD slowed down to a crawl as they approached in the car worried that the person needed help which you know you'd start to think that at that time of day you know they thought maybe it was an old scile person who was lost maybe confused when they got close enough to see the person she lifted her head and looked towards Katie and saw that it was her ex-mother-in-law what the [ __ ] that would scare the [ __ ] out of me yeah that does sound kind of scary why the [ __ ] her ex-mother-in-law lurking about on the road at 1:00 am. KD was absolutely positively sure it was her the same gray brown hair same eyes same tic smile that had always made her wonder what she was thinking but never saying the woman raised her hand and waved at Katie not a stop and help me but more of a hey it was nice to see you kind of wave that's flipping weird that would freaking weird me out strange clothes 1 am mother-in-law ex-mother-in-law no no that's weird KD had the [ __ ] scared out of her [ __ ] yeah Katie and the reason being is because the Mother-in-law had died three years previously oh [ __ ] you could have led with that shell I mean whoa damn way to bury the lead there mother-in-law wasn't hit shiken mother-in-law was dead it was her ghosty ghosty like first of all KD I'm real sorry because if anybody's gonna haunt my ass if it's my mother-in-law I'm just gonna die yeah that would be kind of like a whole demonic thing that would be terrible like out of all the people I want to ha me seriously so anyway so Katie sped up and kept driving hand shaking on the steering wheel no [ __ ] right but you know after a few deep breaths little composure KD says I should go back and take another look now that's a [ __ ] around and find out moment I love it that's a you thing not a me thing totally a me thing I'm like [ __ ] in Reverse I'd be like I'm going home and I'm warding the [ __ ] out of myself and you want to go back no luckily for Katie she says my mother-in-law loved me I couldn't imagine her ghost would appear seeking her renge on me for divorcing her son who had not treated me well to say the least that would kind of make a slight difference in my decision to go back or not yeah now I'm not sure what what the significance of this is she drove in a square by making left turns that went down the same road again but there was no one there why the square oh I think she was just saying she turned around basically oh okay okay okay all of the sudden she was too freaked out to go back to her spooky Carriage House with the weird sounds in the hundred-year-old history with nobody there but her and the ghosts that she was convinced probably inhabited the place so she drove to the local allight Greek diner and sat there for an hour drinking coffee and calming her nerves that's probably a good idea because if the if the veil is thin enough and shit's going on enough to have your mother-in-law be on the road to your house not even a place that's attached to her it's a place that's attached to you it gets worse oh yeah I'd be scared to go back to my house that could already be haunted for sure that's energy of foot KD continues when I finally drove home and into the courtyard I could see that something was wrong my door was standing open my glass windows broken and the door cracked almost all the way through from one side to the other what the [ __ ] someone had destroyed the door to get into the house the next day they found a crowbar in the courtyard thrown off to the side but the only things that they noticed missing from the house were a few pieces of clothing super creepy and a jar of loose change and a knife from the kitchen did someone [ __ ] break in the house and her mother-in-law saved her ass holy [ __ ] maybe so she was just divorced and not exactly loaded to the gills with cash so she didn't really have much [ __ ] worth stealing why take somebody's clothes what kind of Creeper is that by the way honestly that's the part that disturbs me the most because of the True Crime cases that I've covered a lot lot of them stole People's Clothing a couple of them broke in like the BTK killer broke into a woman's house in order to kill her and when she didn't show up on time he stole some of her clothing and left and mailed it back to her which is how she knew she was there so that's a that's like a serial killer thing several of them have done things like that so that me out as you can imagine um KD was very scared that someone broke into her house that she lives in all by herself in an isolated area hello upstate New York isolation Central but they had to KD thinks they must have driven right into the courtyard and would have been hidden um from view when they broke down the door Katie called the cops no one was ever caught wow I think her mother-in-law was warning her away and that's what she says with with all the upset of the Breakin it wasn't until hours later that she remembered even seeing her dead mother-in-law waving from the side of the road dressed like the Grim Reaper she KD is convinced that somehow she appeared to delay lay her from going home and that if she had driven straight to the Carriage House whoever was breaking into her house probably would have been there waiting for her or whatever it could and you know it could have turned out worse it could have turned out deadly for for Katie yep listen to this [ __ ] I love this so now KD writes fictional horror stories and even wrote a whole gor story novel wow yeah now Katie wants to put out there that story is actually 100% real life true it's not a part of her novels and she knows that that was no matter what her ex mother-in-law that she saw that night that saved her that's amazing I believe that I've had a similar experience that I believe I recounted in I think the one with Tom maybe where a ghost I think saved me from possible Doom can I tell you wild can I just tell you Katie's parting advice sure what' she say Katie if you're listening I am saying this with a chuckle you know she's half right damn it and I don't want to admit it uh oh what' she say it is Katie's recommendation that people should remember to be nice to their mother-in-laws because she might help you out even after she's dead I am so glad my mother-in-law and I get along what oh my God imag like okay I've never had that experience before and I know that you've had something similar happen but I never have like I've never had like a ghosty save me from Peril I mean I've had a ghost you warned me of divorce I guess you could call that Peril but I mean that's like some serious [ __ ] to be like oh my God the ghost literally just saved my life I wonder if there's a classification of hauntings that's like that like you know there's the bansi the Fay folk that announces a death by screaming you know you'll see this so I wonder if there's some type of ghost of shade something that that warns people of danger dead mother-in-law cult yeah sure I don't know but I wonder if there is some type of ghostly Guardians yeah you know there's the the lady in white Trope there's the The Hitchhiker Trope there's the there might be ghostly Guardians yeah yeah I wonder if there are so if you have a ghostly guardian or you have ever been helped out by a ghost email us the stone witch isour gmail.com KD I love your story by the way and I do have one question I want to know if the mother-in-law ever haunts your ex-husband or if she ever showed up again I'm quite curious yeah or you know if you're kind of like witchy inclined have you ever tried to reach out to her if you gotten the old Ouija board out some tarot cards like I need to know why your mother-in-law is so wonderful yeah do a little ritual say thank you burn her a candle I would damn I'd buy the best incense and the most expensive white candle [ __ ] yeah all right what's your next story I love these These are so exciting I love these are so great I do have a quick question though for all you witchy [ __ ] out there who are also Stoners how many of you have ever cleaned a bowl using the end of an incense stick or am I the only one I think the better question is is how many of you have not cleaned the bowl with an incense yay I'm not the only one all right you know gotta use what you got man hey it's a good poker all right so this one is mother son story actually oh I'm a mother I got a son this one was sent to us from cosmic mom 73 and she says she's always had a bit of a six sense when it comes the Paranormal and it runs in her family she says her grandmother has it and her son even had it when he was younger but she says that unlike her and her grandmother her son has since blocked out the experiences but up until he was around 13 or 14 used to sleep in her room just so that he could feel safe in case he saw something oh [ __ ] what's in the poor kid's bedroom she says that for herself she hasn't seen ghost in a little while she says the last time I saw a ghost in my bedroom was a few years back I woke up in the middle of the night and saw a tall woman in an old-fashioned dress from the 1800s standing at the foot of my bed it was unnerving but she didn't seem hostile what's with the end of the bed like that happens a lot right it's because they want to [ __ ] with your feet damn it while oh that's why we keep our feet under the blankets to protect them I get it actually my my real question is is are these apparitions that appear in your bedroom and at the end of your bed whether you are cognizant of it or not or are they some sort of relative I don't think so she does say that she's seen other ghosts she says that she's seen a teenage boy who looked like he was suspended from her ceiling a Native American yeah right a Native American man in street clothes holding a bun of dried flowers at the end of her bed and a young man standing by her dresser with his back turned to her wearing Dockers damn it's like a party in her bedroom right so it seems like they're coming to her it almost seems like these ghosts are for whatever reason maybe they know her family can see them and so they're coming to her rather than being ghosts of that room maybe it's like when you pick up the phone and call somebody you're going to call somebody that you know is going to answer you're not going to call phones that you know nobody's going to pick up so these ghosts could be coming and being like okay we know this one's listening she says the most Vivid sighting I've ever had was in college when I shared a dorm room with a roommate who didn't believe in the Paranormal at all we were talking about her boyfriend who had passed away in a rock climbing accident and suddenly we saw a glob of white Misty smoke hovering above the bookshelf it was shaped like a human figure but it was hard to make out any features the most bizarre part was that it was surrounded by neon green Sparks like zig Zags in the air after that sighting even my skeptical roommate had to admit that there might be more to the Paranormal than she thought that would just be cool to see right so it does seem like they're attracted to her she says her son started having the same types of experiences with seeing ghost it started when he was 8 years old and unfortunately this particular sighting caused him a lot of panic which is I think why he started sleeping in her room oh she says our next door neighbor was battling cancer and he and his wife were very close to my family particularly my son one night my son woke me up in a panic telling me that he saw our neighbor walking through our living room walls across the lawn and then disappear into the neighbor's house he was visibly shaken and I could see the fear in his eyes I tried to calm him down and reassure him that it was just his imagination but deep down I knew it was more than that we found out the next day that our neighbor had passed away in his sleep and she says that for days her son didn't even want to go to the bathroom by himself he was like glued to her side which I don't blame imagine at that age though that poor kid was just freaked the [ __ ] out yeah he was absolutely terrified and she said it took him a long time to recover from it and that they never talked about it that was always my rule back in the day you remember you know how it was and how I Ruled The Roost right if any ghost you want to [ __ ] with me [ __ ] with me all day long but you do not mess with my children right or it is ghosty game on I don't care if you are an apparition a Dusty Cloud a shadow I'm going to take your ass out if you [ __ ] with my kids you [ __ ] with me all day I will have fun with it I am that person don't don't don't bug bug my kids man absolutely you've always been like that very protective mama I don't know if he had any experiences between that or if he blocked it out but she says he might have been so scared to block it out that's the that's the sad part yeah and that can be very powerful particularly when they're that young if you don't know what you're doing you can it turn into trauma yeah and you can set hardcore powerful Wards against things like that without even realizing what you're doing so she says that um about 5 years later I remember hearing him scream in Terror from his room I ran to him and he was shaking uncontrollably he told me that he saw a little girl in a white dress standing at the foot of his bed the girl had long dark hair and was staring right at him after that he would see this ghost daily and it was too much for him to handle he became too scared to even walk down the hallway and one of us always had to go with him the Visions only stopped when a young girl that had been missing a few Towns over was pulled from the lake a mile or so from our house she had long dark hair and was wearing a white dress so the that little girl was probably trying to come to him to be found there are ghosts that seek help and this little girl was probably just looking for help please find me and because it was so close to their house probably even though he had put up those walls it had been 5 years and probably close to the same age and she just went straight for the first person like you said someone who would answer they know who's gonna pick up the phone yeah and she said that she wishes he could open up about it and share his experiences with me but he's become closed off about it and as far as I know has never seen another ghost or is so traumatized even if he did he probably might not talk about it ever again or put you know that trauma caused him to reinforce those WS or you know maybe it was again just the circumstances of her ghost being in such need and so close and maybe those circumstances haven't repeated also maybe when he found out the real story that it was a missing girl that was found dead you know by this point this kid's a teenager I mean that [ __ ] with you yeah that [ __ ] with you yeah it really can for sure well that poor boy a just let him know that it's okay and that he is not a weirdo is not a freak he is a absolutely wonderful kid who just sees things that not everybody else does so I got another one what you got show I love the the way this person signed off their name the apprehensive camper oh I like that okay we are hardcore campers here so we're a little concerned that you're apprehensive but you're still a camper so it's okay I'm just worried about reading this story to see what's making you aprehensive because I'm getting get ready to go camping soon and if you're going to make me scared to sleep in my tent then damn it okay so our apprehensive camper writes last weekend my parents little sister and her kids moved into a big house me my older sister and my older sister's kids helped them move all weekend the first day all of the kids played hide-and seek all afternoon in the mostly empty house as we moved Carlo's in that first day my 5-year-old nephew asked me to help him find a place to hide there is a long hallway off of the living room with a big closet under the stairs a bathroom three bedrooms in a linen closet at the end of that Hall I took him over to the closet under the stairs but when I opened it the light was burnt out so he decided he didn't want to hide in there because he would be scared with no light sense I'm following you so far here camper 3 days later as they were mostly moved in I sat down in the living room to take a bre break the kids were all down in the hall in my nephew's room playing and all of the sudden all of the adults were outside or unpacking things in the garage as soon as I sat down to check my phone I see my 5-year-old nephew come from the hallway open the door to the closet under the stairs and close it behind him well that's weird I know right I am sitting maybe 10 feet from the closet with a direct view of it I stare at the closet for a few seconds waiting for him to come out because I know he's going to get scared in there then I hear what sounds like a single bang on the door okay that's creepy I know right so without taking my eyes off the closet I get up and walk over to open it so I can help him find another place to hide I open the door and no one is in there what the [ __ ] like okay so apprehensive camper has written from the GetGo that she sees the kid go in there and did not take the eyes off the door exactly no one's in there no one's in there and if it's a typical Under the Stairs you like Harry Potter Under the Stairs type closet they're not very big there's really nowhere to hide yeah I mean the closet was deep as it goes under the stairs and and at that point the mom had put in a few boxes in the back that were full of Christmas decorations apprehensive camper rights I call out his name and look over and around the box says nothing then it occurs to me that I can faintly hear him and the other kids down the hall in his room playing oh no [ __ ] way I walk down the hall my nephew his brother sister and cousins are all on the floor playing a game and have been for an hour no one was no one was playing hide and seek so apprehensive starts saking out a little bit get some body chills you know if you get the full body chills that it's something's going on what the hell did they see runs to go tell the sisters the older sister tells her that that night before when she was there helping them move she heard her daughter frantically calling Mom Mom Mom Mom her sister walked down the hall to the room her daughter was in and asked what was wrong what did she need and she goes I didn't call for you no one did what sister swears it was her daughter's voice now okay first of all you got those G you know that there's ghosts that impersonate people's voices and it sounds like this is one of them stories why is it impersonating the kids that's so [ __ ] up so [ __ ] up sh that's [ __ ] up they continue on the house itself has some creepiness the upstairs bedroom yeah no [ __ ] right news flash the kids were the first creepy clue so the upstairs bedroom has a big closet with a tiny door that leads to a tiny room what the hell no you that's a Coraline thing you do not buy houses with tiny doors to Tiny rooms some [ __ ] Spider Woman with buttons for eyes is going to come try and eat your soul you know what the real called it what a prayer room what listeners if you could see Lila's face right now is this a thing a prayer room I don't know I'm not Christian so I don't knows Weir are a Christian or no Christians please let us know if a prayer room with a tiny door is a thing so it's a super creepy little room but extra storage space right well the day they looked at the house to buy it the three-year-old niece kept calling it Annie's house oh [ __ ] they don't know anybody named Annie oh [ __ ] who the [ __ ] is Annie also the three-year-old niece freaked out one night after staying there saying she wanted to go home because there was a monster in the new house the in the ceiling vents basically oh that house is haunted haunted apprehensive camper writes that they have never seen something so clearly that wasn't there um and physically saw the closet door open and shut by what they thought was their nephew and it was not and then like what the hell so they're part like these ghosts are kind of morphan into the kids they're they're like They're copying their voices that's so [ __ ] up there's been instances of that happening that's been documented before where ghostly things ghostly entities take on the shape or sounds of of other entities and can I just say I don't know what religion you are apprehensive camper but call somebody yeah whatever you believe call several of those people and have them come in that house is [ __ ] up you need serious help there not to try and alarm you or anything but get help now this is one of those situations it it sounds like a joke you know a priest a rabbi and a pagan High Priestess you need all of them [ __ ] in the house yeah anytime that a a ghosty ghost is impersonating a a real live human being you got some bad bad [ __ ] going on up in there put it this way the people you need to call aren't in the phone book wait do they still phone books are we us but like you need to call somebody of a spiritual persuasion yes that you preferbly believe in it really honestly doesn't matter what it is as long as you personally believe in it I mean I'm not a doctor I just play one on TV but you need help that's all good luck apprehensive camper we're rooting for you good luck we are sending lots of energy your way because damn it's scary and trust your kids when they say they see stuff there because they they might be seeing [ __ ] that you and your older sister aren't seeing just saying get a couple cats and a dog and if they're barking at nothing get out get out now that's right that's pretty much our only advice get the [ __ ] out now yeah burn the house behind no don't burn the house but burn the house behind you you know when we read these these listener stories I try not to be like oh yeah you should be really afraid but this one I feel you should be really afraid really afraid yeah that one's got me really creeped out you have every reason to be apprehensive yeah go camping you'll be better off in the woods I'd rather face Bears than whatever the [ __ ] entity is in your house sounds like multiple entities that's why I'm saying call your priest call your social worker who do what you got to do yeah we're on this okay get our tarot cards we've done banishing before we need to go that's right we will go email us I don't know if I we'll bring all our [ __ ] well I'm not sleeping there [ __ ] I'll camp in the yard but I don't know if I want to be inside from what I've heard we'll do an investigation then we'll cleanse it from top to bottom and we'll bring back up I would even make another brand new homemade Ouija board for this oh hell yeah we we will make a specific one just for your house because it needs one and we'll bring lots of friends this probably has a portal to hell just saying oh yeah I think there's definitely a portal to hell here you could probably turn it into an haunted Airbnb at this point but make people sign a waiver first and keep get the kids out get a dog seriously all right what's your next story this one is from mcot scoota and they say first the backstory for context at the time of my paranormal experience the neighborhood that our house is in was not the safest it was a very lower income neighborhood in the heart of a large Metropolitan City in the early stages of development and gentrification when we moved in three of the five houses bordering our property were legit drug houses not the good kind of drugs I'm guessing yeah yeah sorry in my neighborhood at that time it was best to keep to yourself mind your own business and not bring any attention to yourself I think I've lived there our immediate Nextdoor neighbors had constant traffic in and out of their house and it was very obvious what was going on drugs we always minded our business but I tried to be cordial and my neighbor was always polite but we had very limited interaction sometimes the neighbor's customers would make me uncomfortable two weeks after the Paranormal experience that I'm about to share we woke up in the middle of the night to a lot of commotion when I looked out our bedroom window I saw the cops raiding our neighbor's house I found out later from news reports that the new owners were charged with Distributing heroin powder cocaine feny and crack cocaine [ __ ] they also had a large stock of illegal Firearms a significant amount of cash and one of the individuals living there was on the Run wanted on murder and robbery charges and he was hiding out in this house during the Paranormal incident that I'm about to describe that's a one [ __ ] of a backstory geez if that's the backstory what the [ __ ] is the the the four story now to the Paranormal part so it was late one night after midnight my husband and dog were asleep in the bedroom I was in the kitchen and bent over the trash can to take the bag out and take it to our recycling bin when I was bent over the trash can I felt what I thought was my husband walking right up behind me and lean over me like he was about to hug me he's 63 and I'm 5'4 so he Towers over me like he was bending her over a trash can yeah like kind of a hug sorry you know so he's just giving her a h being funny right she thinks he's being funny so she giggles and then was going to turn around quickly like to hug him and as she turns around she says she sees a woman standing in the middle of the kitchen and this woman put her hands out towards her with her Palms open like you would when you're telling someone stop and she glided or floated towards me while mouthing the word no and when she got inches from me she vanished Into Thin Air and one instant she was gliding towards me the next she disappeared and and I didn't hear anything but her face had an expression of panic and even though I couldn't hear her yell I could tell her mouth was screaming no and it happened very she said it happened very quickly and all she could recall was that the ghost was completely solid not transparent at all and she was wearing a long black sleeve dress kind of like a Wednesday Adams dress right like black dress with the white collar and buttons up the front uhhuh her eyes were blue and she had thick curly hair so in the span of a few seconds she completely saw looked like a full-on person right there and she says she was in shock and disbelief and just kind of stood there for a couple seconds and then she ran into her bedroom so obviously her husband was not behind her when she felt someone kind of grab her from behind because she ran into her bedroom and was screaming for her husband to wake up so she tells her husband she thinks someone's in the house and he grabs his gun from the nightstand and runs out and shortly after that her dog n a 90b pitbull woke up and started growling and barking at the doorway to the bedroom and he got between her and the doorway and kept barking and growling at nothing in the bedroom door Here's your sign people her husband was calling for the dog to come search the house with him he wouldn't go with him would he he would not go which is she says is very out of character for the dog yeah because he was protecting his owner you just couldn't see from what exactly so her husband checked the entire house and not one of the doors or Windows was open or broken there was no sign of any intruder and she at this point knows it's a spirit and tells her husband that she says her husband's a skeptic and started picking on her because she woke him up for a ghost story he asked her to explain what had happened and she started with she thought she had felt him all the way to seeing this woman and he says she was just over tired and stressed out and to go back to bed so the next time she tells her mother because her mother would understand apparently she grew up in a haunted house and it was pretty common for them to see ghosts in their house so when she got to the park where she described the ghost that she had seen who is it damn it it was her grandmother oh okay when she described the woman her mother was shocked because it was uh moscot's great grandmother Gabriella that she had never met I take because she didn't she had never met nope and her mother had been it was her mother's grandmother so and her mother had been extremely close to her the only photos I guess had been long in the 50s so there weren't even wasn't even any photographs that she could have seen and like forgotten about that was stuck in her memory her mother said that she still had her grandmother's dress and it was a dress that her grandmother had you know this mso's great-grandmother she had made herself and wore it all the time and so mscot took a trip a state away to go see her mother and her grandmother to tell them what had happened and they looked all around in the attic for the dress and they did find it and of course when they pulled it out was the exact dress that she had seen the ghost wearing they believe after talking about it that the ghost was trying to prevent her from taking the garbage out that night and they weren't sure why but she did know that there was a lot of crime happening around her house so she believes that that ghost was trying to prevent her for whatever reason from going out at that moment so it was two weeks later that the cops raided the house but she thinks that maybe something had happened that night that was possibly the reason why they decided to raid the house but for whatever reason she feels that something dangerous was going on outside her door and her great grandmother stopped her from going you know and again that's the second one where the ghosty stops kind of impending danger or impending disaster yep and hoay for great grandmothers they are wonderful here and in the afterlife I am a great as in spectacular grandmother yeah you are so I got one more for you go for this one is a little weird because anytime that someone feels Disturbed it's unsettling um you know we kind of joke and and and we're totally into this but when someone is really Jarred that's definitely not cool my final story tonight is from Sarah K when Sarah was 13 years old her mom bought a large bedroom furniture set from the neighbors down the road the neighbors made it clear that they wanted the set to stay together that's weird yeah that is weird why would they care I know right but it was too big to fit in Sarah's room so they had to split it up at first everything seemed fine that's how it all starts at first everything's fine oh no so strange things start happening one night Sarah heard weird knocks and noises but dismissed them as imagination we've all done that yeah that was until Sarah saw a door move on its own oh [ __ ] searched for her cat thinking it was the cat but the cat was asleep on the Grandma's bed so she could kind of tell it was if something or someone had moved that door yeah what she found a little more disturbing was she was looking for a chines takeout menu on the fridge but instead found something that looked like it had been written in dirt and it was a child's handwriting and the only word that Sarah could make out was mommy what the [ __ ] there were other letters there but Sarah couldn't understand them she was completely freaked out and no matter how much she tried to wash it off it wouldn't come off okay now I know you can't see my eyes right now because I'm so flipp and stoned however do you see my like I don't understand face so I also keep menus on my refrigerator sometimes so I get that part and kids are on the refrigerator I get that but is she saying that there was like a new like kids picture like drawn int [ __ ] a that's [ __ ] creepy and all I said was mommy oh no no no that's bad the worst part is when they try to get it off and it won't come off then you're like oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] yeah no that's bad strange occurrences didn't stop there so oh [ __ ] did they connect it to the furniture yet not yet every now and then Sarah would see shadow people outside of their room or outside of the window oh [ __ ] it never felt NE or mean or bad but Sarah always felt uneasy yeah years went by and Sarah eventually moved out of her childhood home and left the furniture set behind but always had a feeling that it was still with her in some way so one night she had a terrible nightmare she was in her new apartment and the shadow person was there looming over her followed her to the new apartment followed her yeah followed her creepy so she wakes up realizes it was a dream and was okay but then this is where you need to just take a big old hit off that pipe I'm ready so she wakes up she realizes a dream but then saw a faint message written in dirt on her dresser and it just said Mommy oh no no no you did not just say that no Sarah was terrified I'm terrified I'm glad you wrote you were terrified because if this was my story I would have wrote and then I started [ __ ] myself yeah yeah that's that's a polite way to say what I would do holy [ __ ] crap that's creep the furnit the furniture set followed her to her new apartment she couldn't she couldn't shake the feeling that the shadow person was still watching her and kind of a part of that so no I think I think she finally like two and two kind of clicked and she eventually got rid of the furniture set did she tell them to keep together you know she didn't say that but damn it Sarah please tell me however you got rid of that that you told him to keep it together got it but she states that the memories and the fear have stayed with her ever since she got rid of the furniture set she doesn't know what caused the strange happenings but she has no explanation for it and she kind of ended her story there but the way she ended it made me it it kind of alluded to once she got rid of the furniture set it all stopped cuz she said that you know the memories of it and the fear of it stayed with her so it sounds like when she got rid of the furniture set that the [ __ ] stopped happening no [ __ ] so this is another case where sometimes they attach themselves to objects kind of the ghost travels with the object because that's also known to happen now see these people told her to keep it together so they at least gave a little warning I would have gone and been pounding out my neighbor store been like what the [ __ ] did you just sell me I'm going to give a big [ __ ] you to the people that sold her this for not warning her now when I am the weird crazy ant that gives out all the cool haunted objects I will obviously tell people to watch out for them and watch leave a little note in the drawer that's right you give them a [ __ ] heads up at least they can break your rules themselves but you at least got to give them the rules if I'm gonna give you some ghosty paraphernalia I'm gonna at least tell you what you're in for right and I'm a little disappointed that she did not tell the next people at least to keep it together I mean she didn't even give them that little tidbit right I I have to give you a I mean I understand you're under some trauma so I'm not giving you a [ __ ] you but I'm going to wag my finger at you that's irresponsible ghosty you know ownership that was bad bad neighbor that's right Bad Neighbor you could have called our friend Zach Zack beins he's got that whole thing and you could have sent it to his Museum that would be the responsible thing or us you know because I'm going to give it away to my nieces and nephews and various random children Sarah's family should have known when when you sell something to somebody and they say you keep this together you need to start asking questions like why where are these garage sales where people are finding mysterious objects that have strange requirements that go along with them why don't I ever find there need there needs to be a Facebook group for paranormal garage sales if you have ever bought a paranormal item at a garage sale please email us at the stoned witches hour atgmailcom because we love other people's [ __ ] right exactly all right so I have one last story myself and this one is a very short one and it is also a grandma story this one is is uh very sweet and it goes like this this is from Mia and Mia says I'll never forget the strange encounter I had with the Paranormal after my grandmother passed away when I was just 15 years old we were Incredibly Close and her death Hit me hard she had passed away on the toilet and in an effort to make light of the situation I would joke that she had gone out like Elvis that is something you can really roll with I'm not g you know especially if you're used to joking with your grandmother you know she says a few days after her passing I was sitting on the toilet when suddenly the bathroom lights turned off it wasn't a simple burned out bulb as something had physically flipped the switch I was frozen in place trying to make sense of what had just happened when I saw a faint blue light shoot out the window it was such an eerie experience that it left me feeling spooked even though the encounter was unsettling I couldn't help but welcome any sort of paranormal activ I was always curious about the afterlife and what happens to us when we die as I walked out of the bathroom I saw my 5-year-old sister looking at me with a serious expression without prompting she spoke up and said Grandma was just at the end of the bed she told me to tell you she said hi and she is sorry for turning off the lights oh wow that moment will stay with me forever despite the initial shock of the lights turning off and the blue light shooting out the window hearing that message from my grandmother through my little sister was incredibly comforting it made me feel like she was still with us in some way Watching Over Us from the other side I have another ghosty rule aside from the don't [ __ ] with my kids ghosty rule number two do not like the bathroom is a private place and I don't give a [ __ ] what existent plane you live on or what existent realm you are coming to and fro you do not go into the bathroom when someone is in there I don't care what your reasoning is you just don't do it I'm going to give this Grandma a pass because even though Mia doesn't say it they must have had a joking relationship because if you're going to joke that your grandmother had passed like Elvis you had to have been had that kind of jokey relationship in life you should still be able to pee by yourself Lord again what is it with the ghost at the end of the bed how Eerie that her little sister saw Grandma at the end of the bed so wild I loved this one I saw my first ghost at the end of my bed when I was 10 years old we we've talked about that before yeah I also saw a ghost at the end of my bed that turned out to be my great grandmother I still to this day and it was my grandfather and I loved him dearly I can't sleep with my feet uncovered and it's all PTSD from seeing my grandpa when I was 10 at the end of my bed can't if my feet go uncovered I wake right up well I'm going to put it right out there Jenny may I love you I miss you and if you want to come stand at the end of my bed and say hi you are absolutely
