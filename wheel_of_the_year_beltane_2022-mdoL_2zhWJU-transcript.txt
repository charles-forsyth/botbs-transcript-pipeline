oh do you remember um hey hey the 1 of May what is it what is it hooray hooray the 1 of May outdoor begins today or you know the more tame version like hooray hooray the 1 of May outdoor loving begins today do you remember that I do I think I heard the outdoor [ __ ] the explicit version yeah it's witchcraft [Laughter] [Music] hi and welcome to a special wheel of the Year episode of the stoned Witches Hour today is May 1st belan in the northern hemisphere this is the third Spring Festival some people say it is the beginning of Summer I don't know about in New York in Southern California I would definitely say this is the very beginnings of Summer this is the beginning of camping go camping for belain and then it's on for the rest of the summer I'm your co-host Lea I'm shelle she's usually high but I I I am high that's the problem that's why we're that's that's why this is Flowing this way that's why it's flowing so nicely right Downstream yeah so I'm ilila and today we're going to talk about the Pagan Festival of belane May 1st which is traditionally the beginning of Summer it's it's when like shell said camping started and we were ready to get outside and get our groove on most of the time dance around a bonfire do the mapole you know I think the most fun thing as far as like belain weekend activities you know other than the whole going camp and for the weekend and all that doing flower crowns and doing the Maple that that it takes more skill than you think first of all you think that you're all agile and stuff until you like trip over somebody dancing around the mapole and flower crowns that's an art man everybody can't just pick that up but they're so beautiful when they're done and I do remember many a belain celebration after we' done the mapole dance which usually devolved into complete chaos Midway through right but we would always look at the how the ribbons had woven on the mapole and we would kind of see you could see the perfectly beautiful pattern and then you would see where chaos began and everything the pattern devolved into just this bright colorful but then you could see the but then you'd see that pattern come back too you would sometimes it would pick right back up it was kind of beautiful in a very chaos way chaotic way yeah there's there is definitely much more to belain than that you know the camping that the having fun but some of the ritual aspects that's that's where we should kind of hone in a little bit today we always celebrated New Beginnings new starts not just fertility I mean I know this is definitely a big fertility and sex ritual because what's happening in nature is what we kind of reflect in our ritual and animals are out there screwing their brains out animals are out there hooking up they're all getting getting together babies are being born new shoots new flowers new growth and that energy doesn't have to be just sexual and pregnancy it can be new energy and New Growth anywhere in your life and we try to represent that in ritual it could be planting the seed of an idea planting the seed of an action a goal um anything I'm thinking of planting the seed in that whole sexual way I meant planting the seed that way I gocha because this is more like the growth part of it like bursting like all of its I guess that you're right the sex part is kind of the planting the seed there doing that for sure all that sex energy also one of the things I remember from some of our community rituals was a big emphasis on female Divine energy and male Divine energy in more recent years by that I mean like 20 15 years ago they Incorporated a third group actually it was more than 15 years ago I can remember a third group unofficially even back in the 90s so we quite a long time ago we had like the the men's Mysteries the women's Mysteries and then the fools what was called the Fool's Mysteries and and children often joined the Fool's Mysteries but anyone could particularly if you didn't feel called to join the men's or the women's Mysteries and I also remember even from when this particular Community was started back in the 70s they always allowed anyone to go if you felt that you had masculine energy you went to the men's Mysteries it didn't matter what your physical form was if you were masculine and felt called to that you went to the men's Mysteries if you felt feminine and felt you were a woman you went to the women's Mysteries and and they have always been very inclusive with that I do remember there were years even when the May Queen was a man they were definitely ahead of their time in that so we did have men's women's and Fool's Mysteries but they were very inclusive and this time of year that type of energy is very strong in everyone and kind of you know flowing very freely through everything you know hence I guess the the big emphasis on sexuality because of the joining and the blending of those energies but you know this is also a good time to do relationship spells relationship rituals love spells love rituals not personally a big proponent of of love spells but if you are so inclined to do such things this is as good a time as any but you know talking about the Mysteries one thing that I liked at the end in in this kind of Segways into the May king and the May Queen we did our own version of basically like fairy cakes and that was kind of how we would choose the the May king and the May Queen what those cakes looked like varied from year to year depending on who the creator of those cakes were fairy cakes are kind of yummy treats that we kind of use to you can look at it as as a couple different ways honor uh the fairies and the Woodland Spirits we kind of used it as a mechanism to let fate decide let the powers that be decide who was going to be chosen for that may king or may Queen almost like if the god and goddess themselves were using those cakes as a tool to make that selection um was kind of how we used it in the community uh that that we were participating in yeah so so basically every year and it was different like you said it was a different treat every year some days some years it was a Savory cornbread muffin some years it was a brownie some years it was literally a cake or some type of cupcake the treat varied from year to year but they would bake something into it something food safe and everyone knew that there was going to be something small in in these so everyone was always warned that you had to break it open before you ate it but but in the men's Mysteries and women's Myster they would bring these treats and into which something representative a stone or or you know a marked item would be baked in secretly into one of these cakes and then like you said randomly everyone would pick a cake and then at the same time everyone would break it open and the person who had that random item in their cake had the been the one that was chosen by Fate to be the May King the May queen or the fool for the year but in other you know in in in different Traditions those fairy cakes were used to honor the ACT fairies and Woodland Spirits yeah often some um the group that did hand out the cakes would I know we did would leave cakes in the woods for the Fay and for the energies of the land um and I'm pretty sure most of the groups in that in that community did so kind of like leaving out cookies and milk for Santa always a good idea to leave offerings for the the deities for the Fay and for the energies of the land it's always a good idea to say thank you or to to give them a token to acknowledge that shared energy wine was a big thing wine bread and cheese constant it was wine bread and cheese you know some of those spring wines that are coming out dandelion wine I don't know how much dandelion wine we've had at belain over the years it was it was kind of like the season of new Libations just good stuff and and again offering it off to the land as well you know speaking of offering it to the land it's a great time also to do an outdoor altar you know we always had different places outside a stone altar that you can build or a piece of wood or even just a spot in your garden or a little a little patch in the woods that you found and to plant fresh spring flowers that can grow there or to to bring flowers as an offering or to bring different stones or leaves or you know something that reminds you of summer and spring to that place I know you've mentioned before that things don't necessarily have to have the perfect magical meaning to work if your intent is there for me one of my favorite flowers for belan is the Foria it's a beautiful reminder of spring because even before a lot of leaves are out the that bright yellow Foria bush is is blooming with flowers so for me it's an easy way to bring that freshness of Summer of spring because you've got flowers They're bright yellow they remind you of sunshine and I don't care what the actual magical meaning of Foria is my intent is to bring that Sunshine that flower energy to my altar or or to my ritual working and it and it works just like that the other thing that is a a belan tradition this is also the first big outdoor fires of the year that's right traditionally in uh in Ireland they would light the two big fires on the hills of Tara and everyone would drive all their cattle all their sheep you know their livestock between even themselves between these fires for fertility to cleanse them and to bring fertility to them for the year and then everyone would take some of that fire home and relight their Hearth fires with it to to share that energy amongst the community and we would do that in our community a lot of times we would do either between the fires dance between fires some years or some years we would do leaping over the fire which traditionally would do the same thing you know leaping the fire would kind of mean that you would bring that belane fertile sexual energy into your life for the the following year and kind of some of the other early Irish Traditions involve them driving out the cattle into the summer pastures which I guess it's kind of in the theory of like they keep them close to the barn and in that warm kind of confined area during winter and then as soon as Spring Breaks they're kind of free to go off into those far off vast summer pastures yeah so that is that is also marked by the Irish for letting their cattle go out they were doing their rituals to protect their cattle and their crops and like you said they'd have they'd have their stock walk between those bonfires as they were traveling off to their summer pasture it's a great way to if you want to go between two little fires or even between two candles doesn't have to be a full rowing bonfire if you're not lucky enough to live someplace where you can do that or even you know two two lit joints if you if you must walk between two lit joints and and you can get that same kind of if the intent is there that you are cleansing yourself of you know you're you're letting go of all that darkness of winter this is the final Spring Festival this is we're walking into summer and you can shed all of that and walk into your summer sexy body walk into you know your summer self your bright your happy sunshiny self and and whether that sexual Life Energy is to bring you relationships sex babies whatever or if it's to bring you new goals new new hobbies new people new Energy new business new jobs new whatever into your life you can walk between those lit joints and and picture that coming into your life shed the old bring in the new you know some belan practices were actually designed to ward off or appease faires and prevent them from stealing things like dairy products always always a good idea to leave an offering to the Fay energies give them a little bit of wine a little bit of beer they will M do you know leave some flowers outside for them leave a little bit of food acknowledge their presence this time of year it's a fun way to acknowledge you know that kind of fun energy in your life I kind of laugh because people kind of forget that aspect about belain um but there are people that that don't even remember that whole fairy tie in and it it really is it if you kind of look at the roots of of some of the different ritualistic things they were kind of designed to appease the fairies down to the darn fairy cakes they are called fairy cakes and the hills of Tara being possible she Mounds or or fairy Mounds you know that and that's where they put their fires you know it makes a lot of sense never piss off a fairy truly no good idea that's actually good life advice right there you know leave a leave a nice Bud out there leave a a fresh Bud from your Harvest something pretty you know and just leave that for the Fay to bring good energy to your life for the year we've done that as [Laughter] well look around you outside it's all earth related look at look at the green grass look at the bright colors of flowers look at the bright blue skies I hope you have bright Lo blue skies you know I always think of yellow I always think of yellow with belting and you know why because of the the dandelion and the daffodils and the Foria yeah it's that yellow it's almost like the yellow flowers are the first ones to come oh my gosh I forgot how much I love dandelions and how quick they are to pop up I know they're a weed but they're so great you can make dandelion wine you can eat the leaves they there's medicines I think you can make out of dandelions I have to look that up but you know it and they're so bright and happy and cheerful I've always loved dandelions but green as well um you know Green is definitely the grass is starting to grow that the trees are budding and the leaves are popping out so definitely green um is is something that makes me at least think of belane color-wise now that you mention it I always think of yellow as the goddess color the bright sunny goddess and and the green as konos the god of the wood you know the horned God horned horny god of belain the you know that Green Man picture that you see all the time with like the flowers and the leaves yeah exactly so the the Deep green of the Green Man and the bright yellow of the Goddess this time of year and but you know we've used we've used pink candles we've used green candles we've used yellow candles we've used purple candles kind of anything really kind of that springy light bright feeling palette you know you can look in all these books and it'll say you know for belan you have to use this color and you have to use this color you know do whatever rocks your boat man if you want to use a color that is not what the book says use a color that's not what the book says it's your intent exactly if you're a solitary or if you have a small group this is a wonderful time of year to set up an outdoor altar or an indoor altar that honors nature bring the bring nature indoors try to reconnect with that as much as possible set up an altar with as many natural elements as you can find and do whatever reminds you of Summer and growth whatever reminds you of sexuality and new beginnings and and honor that in the way that feels good to you walk between two candles if that's if that's what works for you walk between two candles set some time and set up an altar with an incense that you enjoy a candle that makes you happy maybe a a seashell or a small Chalice of water and and your favorite stone that makes you think of summertime maybe it's a bright citrine or or maybe it's some sort of uh dark red Carnelian that makes you think of you know the hot summer sun whatever it happens to be and then light yourself a joint and walk between two candles while you shed the dark part of the Year finally as you're fully embracing the light half of the year now that we've just had the Equinox of ostara belan is the exact opposite of sin and in sin you know it's the dark half of the year and and we're close to the veil of the the veil between the worlds is thinnest this opposite point of belting the veil between the worlds is thinnest as well and there's a lot of like you were saying Fay activity and you know so walk between those candles shed you know Walk Into Summer and maybe then leave an offering outside of a a little bit of Bud or a little bit of food or a little bit of wine or some type of drink that you enjoy and and give that to the Earth and give that to the fairies you know I I always looked at at sa as kind of the veil is thin in the ancestrial way and belain kind of is the is thin in a spiritual creature way oh I love that I really like that yeah I see that it's almost like two different thinnings with two different it's like going to two different parties with two different groups of friends totally the opposite but still the same type of party but with the opposite type of people so this is more of the sativa half of the Year where you're kind of upbeat and happy and bubbly and sin's more Inda kind of into yourself melting the couch stay as a home body kind of like you know sin is where that that that Veil is thin and you can connect with maybe loved ones or relatives or or friends and family that have passed on whereas at belane it's going to be more like f folk and and things of that nature you know spirit animals um just not necessarily the those familial Spirits so maybe this is a good time of year to do a meditation or an introspection for yourself where instead of trying to connect to ancestors maybe you try to connect to the energies of the land where you live or the energies of the land where you like to do ritual or maybe you try to in look for your spirit animal or try to to look for that younger self or or go have a conver go have a conversation with a stream go yeah I love that go have a conversation with nature itself go look for that um [ __ ] I forgot where I was going with this you know right so instead of trying like you said to instead of trying to connect with your ancestors try and connect with the land try and connect with you know the energies around you a little bit more the and uh yeah that's a great idea I love that sh so magical workings now anything relating to prosperity new beginnings new relationships having a child uh if you want to if you want to start a pot garden you can ask for that energy now you know um it's it's a great time for Magical workings to do with so anything to do with wealth growth Sexual Energy this is a great time to do spell work related to that belaine is very special to me personally because I met my husband on belain and then I married him I remember I you remember cuz you brought him yeah blame me blame me I do we absolutely blame you and your husband there are several people that had their hand in this this is the story that makes me believe in love at first sight and I may or may not put this in but I'm going to tell it anyway so I met my husband one belain and I'm hand fasted with him the very next belain so what happened was this gentleman that worked with very best friend's husband hband at the same company and shell and and her husband at the time were both Pagan and we were both in the same Pagan community and everyone was getting ready to go to the belane weekend camping celebration and my darling husband um I don't know what I'll call him C what do we call him Mr Lea Mr Lila I love that so my darling husband Mr Leila sir Lila sir Lila Lord Leila my he is a Lord he's a Scottish Lord so we'll call him Lord Lea Lord no I like Mr Lila so of Leila like like the handmaid's tale be of Lea I don't know Mr we'll just go with Mr Lila so Mr Lila has heard about this belain Pagan celebration and really would like to come along and he's begging Mr Shell the at at the time Mr Shell if he can go and I didn't want him to go oh can I just put that out there I was so salty about having to bring him I was angry well first of all new people typically were not allowed to come to belain as their first ritual typically they had to come to something different because some people got in their minds that belain was a big sexfest and okay it kind of was but that wasn't their first introduction paganism FOC it was not the focus and it wasn't it was it was also considered a big working and it wasn't something that new people typically were invited to but he was insistent and he eventually got his way and was able to come I was so busy I had I was just like fine you can go you guys were all busy and you didn't make it until later in the day after the May Queen had already been chosen I had been camping there since the night before and had done this thanking ritual because I had released all this baggage back in s and I was thankful now at belaine because I was in a great place so the May Queen had been given the sword representing the land and she brought it to me and asked me if I would be her KN and presented me with the sword and I of course accepted and someone saw this happen and gave me a leather belt so that I could wear this sword around my waist at that same time one of our mutual friends came up to me and said Lea I saw you in a dream last night and in this dream you were wearing a dress and she hands me this gorgeous black velvet dress just very medieval and long and flowing and just simply stunning and she's like I don't know why but you have to wear this dress and I'm like of course so I take the sword the leather belt in this gorgeous velvet dress and I go into a tent I change into it and as I'm belting this sword around my waist I'm like [ __ ] I look fantastic and I I walk out of the tent feeling all badass and cool and here here I come rolling up here you and your husband and my future husband come all rolling up The Path and I bow down in a really deep curtsy my face right to the ground I'm grinning ear to ear and I look right up into the eyes of Mr Lea and I say my Lord and I [ __ ] fell in love right then and there I felt like I had known him forever a shock went through my whole body and I spent the rest of the day trying to get this man to pay attention to me granted it wasn't very difficult he was yeah no it wasn't he was just as smitten as I and later when asked when he fell in love with me he recounted that same story from the opposite side seeing me come out of the tent and curtsy and later that night as we're sitting around the bonfire that we had just jumped over I'm standing there he's sitting leaning up against my legs my hand is in his hair and I knew then that I was going to be with this man forever and it was the weirdest [ __ ] feeling and we've been married for what 22 years now so here we still are here we are and I'm still very blissfully happy and very much in love and that was a belain love story so yeah Remember by the way like was yesterday I remember that like it was yesterday I'm so glad you broke all the rules and disregarded your cranky self and brought him thank you you know part of it was I was trying not to be a rule breaker at that particular point and the other part of it I know right I know right so unlike you and the other part of it was I knew you were there already having fun and we were running late and I just wanted to get there and he was going to make me later and finally I was just like fine and it worked out it was the great it was the greatest weight it was it was worth every second of that weight I really appreciate it so to this day I absolutely love that part about belaine I do remember being the May Queen though and that that was actually a difficult year for me the energy of carrying for for that particular Pagan group the May king and the May Queen had a symbolic duty to represent the community for the entire year and to carry the energy of the community for that year and it was actually somewhat of a a magical burden you could feel that energy it it brought lessons and and I remember that being a very challenging changing good year for me when I was May Queen which was a couple years before I met my husband and I don't think people I don't think people expect that when they're in the party moment you know you're celebrating women we're doing stuff to celebrate that feminine energy in all of us and you know we're dancing you know we're we're connecting we're we're doing some sort of craft or event to kind of bring us all together and to feel that divine feminine and then we pass these cakes around and I don't think people in that moment realize that you really need to be prepared for the changes that are going to happen and I don't think people understand when they happily grab a cake what's going to happen magically to them for that year as they carry this energy of community that really does transform you I myself had never have never been a May Queen so I I kind of have no frame of reference to that you have however in this particular Community held other positions of transformative power such as you have been the staff holder and the Chalice holder multiple times and those were things that were not chosen by chance although sometimes they were um and you have gotten it by chance as well as by intention intentional giving to um honor things that you had done for that Community you had been given the honor of carrying these tools for periods of time until you were ready to pass them on and that itself also has transformative energy and belain was sometimes a time when people chose particularly the feminine chalice to transfer you know I I think the staff was a big thing when we were in community the staff was was considered the community symbol right and and and I actually I actually ended up getting the staff geez either three or four different times like that thing kept coming back to me it was like a bad Penny I know once at least maybe twice it was random it was chance chosen by and there was there was some intentional at least two were intentional and given to you in recognition for work that you had done so I I kind of had that it it circled back to me over and over and and that was a burden as well it was almost like the only way I can equate it is like when the Lady of the Lake is holding the sword temporarily until someone comes back and gets it so it's a a blessing and a burning it is because it's it's this this deep heavy magical item that holds holds a magical purpose for a very large group of people with with a hundred people's energy and intent into it and you're the guy holding it it's definitely I don't want to I never looked at it as a burden um I don't know if that's the right way to describe it it was definitely more of a a deep heavy magical responsibility um but I never looked at it as a burden other than transporting it because let me tell you that staff was a [ __ ] to transport and then to get back to the masculine and feminine of it the staff which can be a very masculine phallic symbol was the symbol of the community for decades until our coven at the time Circle amarat decided to bring in a to balance that with a feminine energy and we had the actual owner The Keeper of the land where we the community typically did ritual was a clay worker and he created this absolutely gorgeous double handled drinking chalice for the community and it was imbued oh I'm getting chills it was imbued with all that intent all that energy and and it was it was energized by the feminine energy in community and presented to community to balance that didn't he use clay from the land as well to make it not entirely because it was a the wrong consistency to entirely do the Chalice but he did do partially it we call it a chalice but it's more of an ancient drinking chalice in that it looks like a very large bowl think of a bowl that's too big for your two hands to cup with a a nice curved handle on either side so a good-sized bowl but it was considered a a communal drinking chalice and and so this community chalice was created partially from clay from the land where the community usually had their their rituals and so now the community was in Balance we had the staff to represent the masculine and the Chalice to represent the feminine and those were often passed from to different people again either by chance such as how we chose the May king and queen or with intent for different reasons uh to people within the community and that felt really good and and I believe we presented that on belain yeah actually belaine 2000 we did belain 2000 wow so happy annivers 22nd anniversary to oh my God believe can you believe that that was almost a quarter century ago same time as my hand fasting so yes yes I can it but wild totally wild right and I remember that that chalice that Community chalice had a bee built into the bottom of it I wasn't going to say that I was going to leave that as like the little secret Community thing but yeah there was a beautiful little bee at the bottom to kind of also no we don't that was just in my own head I don't even know why I thought that you know but yeah I loved that too that there was a little bee at the bottom so you know as you would drink that not that anyone would probably do that now but as you would drink the wine and pass the Chalice around there was that little bee that would peek out to to represent that divine feminine I love that and you know now under certain now because of the way the world has turned everybody has their own drinking [Laughter] apparatus but yeah but symbolically to symbolically even drink from it is beautiful and to have those items that have such history in community is so important I think and to have that balance you know this time of year is all about that it it's just I love it it's a great time not just because of you know the the Divine sexual aspect of it but the the going camping the energy of the earth and getting out there and just being in community again and we would do indoor rituals right after sa this was the first back Outdoors period for us and it always felt so so good so I love that even if we did have a dusting of snow on Bel if we did even no matter what the weather we were all happy to get out and Camp even in new New York Northeast oh yeah so I saw this blog it's called Hearth and hedge on blog spot the author Alex mentioned that um they Associated holidays with the time of day and I kind of really loved this they said for them that ostara is the sunrise and I know we talked about either getting up at sunrise or whenever you get up can be sunrise for that day celebrating the spring and they said that um mabin would be the sunet and so belane is kind of like that mid day and I love that that representation because it it is kind of that feeling that you get it's it's late morning the sun's out and and that energy is all fresh and new and flowing and I I kind of liked how they had mentioned they kind of likened the holidays to different times of day it makes a lot of sense that's cool I like that I like that we definitely are in the light half of the year so that kind of isn't easy representation way to to visualize it so it's easy to remember that because if if we're in midm morning that's during the day so you can remember that we're in the light half of the year right now so I kind of like that it's fun the other thing about belain we are Midway to the summer solstice which you know hurah yeah yay another great way to um one more thing before we go is is food is a great way to celebrate belaine and cooking uh make yourself some fresh bread make yourself some fairy cakes and you can definitely incorporate can of butter into that just a little bit you don't want to get too crazy but incorporating a little bit of can of butter into your cooking and having those fairy cakes is a a nice way to celebrate have some with someone that you love and leave one outside for the Fay and and and edible flowers and we're not talking about weed at this point edible flowers uh dandelion wine that is a a a nice belain tradition uh that I'm used to so get yourself some dandelion wine chug it down and celebrate dandelion wine and any edible flowers including cannabis flowers so drink your dandelion wine and have a little bit of uh fairy cakes made with just a tiny bit of can of butter and enjoy your belain happy belain happy belain bless it be thank you for joining us on this wheel of the Year
