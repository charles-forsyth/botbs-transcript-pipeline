welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy best friends from way back delve into their magical history discuss Pagan Theory and provide magical inspiration for the neoy The High Priestess and everyone in between join us as we explore ritual Craft Spells celebrate the Pagan way of life and get back on the broomstick I'm your co-host Lea and today we'll be talking about elements and Elemental Magic and hey I'm shell and I'm excited because this is a fun thing to talk about for me I think I love all the elements in all of the correspondences that go with each of them and all the different things you can do with them individually and so I'm excited today me too there's so many things to explore here and it's it's one of the segments of Witchcraft and ritual that I get a lot of enjoyment out of as a creative person as a words person calling in the quarters was always one of my favorite parts of a formal ritual and all of the all of the things that kind of go along with each quarter I like the shiny pretty stuff you know me I like my pretty things and I like having pretty representations of each quarter as a part of my rituals and a part of spellwork I mean obviously we could do six episodes on this so this is probably just going to really be a more of a scratch the surface on the elements in the quarters but it's definitely a topic we can revisit and do deeper Dives as we go so what are we talking about we are talking about the traditional mostly from Wiccan sources but we'll get into a little bit of the history of where these correspondences came from but we are talking about the cardinal directions East South West and north and also the elements that people think correspond to those directions air fire water and Earth the four major elements that we work with in most Pagan practices you know it's kind of funny because I've I've seen on a couple of um different sites where they add different things into the elements for example they'll add light and dark earth air fire water light dark or earth air fire water spirit so I think that maybe depending on what angle you're taking it from you may have different interpretations of what the elements are or what the quarters are which is funny because quarter means four and people add to it but you know hey that's just me doing bad math I think we talk about the quarters we get that's a little bit different than elements because I know that you know again we're talking traditional Wiccan structures here we're talking about what came down from the Golden Dawn and the rosar crucians and that type of tradition but but in that tradition though they're very that's an interchangeable term elements mean quarters quarters mean elements and they're kind of very interchangeable in that context correct in that tradition there are only four elements Plus spirit that they switch out for deity and just those four elements and then they corresponded strictly to East is air South is fire West is water and North is Earth that nowadays especially varies quite a bit but like you said there's a lot of different elements people will put light and dark they'll put giving and receiving they'll put masculine and feminine but that's the thing you know no way is wrong you know whatever works for you that's the beauty of witchcraft in this type of spirituality is you can kind of hunt and Peck what works for you particularly nowadays and we're being very sensitive not just to the tradition of something which in this case is East is always air but we're also paying attention to the natural world around us and like you said what works for us on the west coast west being water makes complete and total sense because there's a very large body of water to the West when I'm in New York state and I'm near Lake Ontario North might be water I might feel that pole of water from the north because there's a very large lake right there so it very much might depend on where you are in a place and just like shell said that is perfectly acceptable to do now I get what you're saying about you know in California the waters to the West you feel that pull but I don't know maybe it's just because I'm just too caught up in what I've learned and what I've read over the years and what I've been taught and so I just can't let go of that thought and I think that's what people need to sometimes think about is just because you read it in the in a book or read it online or because it's someone else's tradition you're not locked into that right you're definitely not locked into someone else's tradition and it was traditionally kind of locked in a little bit that way for a lot of people because the books in the beginning that came out all were very heavily influenced by this this Wiccan tradition that came from older Masonic practices and such that that kind of all got incorporated into what they were calling wiah at the time so when I learned from books and even now when you read books most of them will have those gardnerian correspondences of East Air South Fire West Water North Earth but people are breaking away from those very strict traditions and kind of going more towards what your local area is like we are an earth-based religion after all so we want to kind of be as natural and in as in harmony with the Earth around us as we possibly can the four elements originally came from ancient Greece you know that's what they really thought the whole world was made up of was air fire water and Earth they literally thought those were the main four building blocks of everything but the universe was made up of yep yep absolutely and then that extra fifth element that could be divided in multiple Parts being Spirit or that spark of life or the Divine energy that gives life to all those other parts and now we know that the Universe has many many many more different types of elements and it it's not as simple as for simple things but for our primitive brains for our for our childlike brains for our animal brains we like things to be simple and it's much easier to affect your subconscious and to help you get into the frame of mind that will help you to affect change and have spell workor work for you if you can break things down to their simplest components and so keeping those simple elements is important and is a powerful magical tool this is a Elemental call that we used 20 some years ago but I I found this and I thought that this was a really good one so if you are going to call the quarters into your circle into your space this is a good one we came up with to the east the wind positive forces I call you in to the South the fire aids this night in my desire to the West the water I conjure my need into matter to the north The Grove bring your gifts and make it so to the center the force I call you to open the doors nice very freaking cool wow we we were pretty good with words back in the day yeah we came up with some good stuff also one thing to mention is anytime you call in elements not deity we're not talking about deity here here when you call in elements it's always a good idea to be forceful be forceful when you call them in and be forceful when you release them and tell them it's time to go so call them in strongly and at the end of your working release them and say it's time to go just as strongly and the and and just to kind of circle that around because I did you know let our listeners know a call that we called in I'm going to also tell you of a really simple easy let go so to say dismissal of the elements if you will we were pretty wordy with our invocations but we would simply release the elements by chanting the Earth the air the fire the water return return return return the Earth the air the fire the water return return return return and that was good enough and it worked for us and we you know again back with the Simplicity our minds remember simple things and you know 20 25 years on still remember ITA remembers that chant like it's like ingrained in her soul you know oh yeah absolutely so invoke them in a beautiful way just remember you got to let them go too release them you don't want to keep those energies hanging around your house every witch is going to have a story of not releasing the elements and you know her pipes burst or a candle caught the curtain on fire or something like that so just release the elements as well good stuff shell nice call love wanted to add that in I forgot I had that marked in my book Shell's wonderful catalog of our history I'm telling you Treasure Trove who would have thought it when I was writing it down and y'all would laugh at me it's beautiful well here we are it's like the almanac we're all so glad you did speaking of tools there are tools associated with each element like I said I like the sparkly on my altar let's break down each element into into what it means and what tools and stuff we can use for it let's start with Earth because I I don't know I like Earth I think it's because I'm a crystal I'm going to say it I'm a crystal I love crystals I do you have piles and piles of glittery gorgeous crystals that you love to pull out I can't almost every single time I come over you're pulling out a box you're pulling out a c a house out of crystals at this point I think and they're all cataloged and labeled I love it but they're pretty they are pretty so the Earth stone Crystal um Pentacle also represents the earth I have this gorgeous Pentacle my daughter bought me um in Toronto Canada and I keep that on there it's got like little vines that make out the pentacle but that is a symbol of the earth you know I've I've used everything from a little jar of dirt I've used graveyard dirt here in Salem now I'm us I'm a fan of using Salem dirt but stones and rocks and crystals kind of are for me those are that Earth thing and you know like I even you might say oh a rose quartz ball well rose quartz is Earth no but the crystal itself is a crystal representing Earth that's kind of like my favorite representation alar wise would either be Stones crystals or a pentacle itself yeah and Earth itself magically it represents literally a foundation again it's it's that magical like for like correspondence Earth is a foundation it is under your feet it is something that is solid and steady and those are the magical correspondences that it has you build a solid foundation of Earth for your home you build a solid foundation for your hear your fireplace the heart of your home and so Earth it's a like for like representation it is steadfastness it is home it is it's solid it's tangible exactly and so it it represents all of those things magically and so any representation you bring in of that like shell said any Crystal no matter its type is Earth and so it will represent those qualities magically when we've done ritual outside bus place that feeling of your feet in the dirt your bare feet in the dirt you know the trees all around you and the grass and just everything you know that woodsy feeling that's Earth in a nutshell even if you're smelling the smells and and feeling the breeze through the trees you know you're getting that that embodiment of Earth all around you there's nothing like bare feet in the dirt in the spring to just kind of recharge you feel that reconnection and if you can't get outside you can recreate that same kind of Earth Feeling by curling up in your favorite chair in the favorite corner of your home and feeling that coziness that connectedness that grounded centeredness of your life in your favorite spot or with your favorite person because home can mean so many different things it doesn't have to be a physical home four walls right and that's Earth you know so the correspondence come easily brown green you know gray black things that represent Earth and earthiness all our correspondences with air it's funny because I'm an air sign and I have such a hard time with air the breath of life you know the breeze in the trees that Ocean Breeze that I'm finally feeling words songs people don't think necessarily of of words and songs as air but that is that is you using your breath to create a spell every word you say is a spell the songs you sing or the songs that are sung they're just spells yeah and they're all Air correspondences yep all Air yellow not my favorite color but yellow to me is air I know other people sometimes think of different colors associated with with air um in East but yellow is what I think of when I think of air pastels light colors the sky the soft Birds the soft morning Sky Sunrise New Beginnings all of these things are associated they're the magical associations with air it's cleansing it can be inflaming it can be something that pushes things air can be very powerful in the form of tornadoes that might come through it can be destructive it can be also very calming and helpful it can power generators you know air has a lot of qualities to it that you might want to bring into a circle or into your working and it can be just as essential for life as it can be destructive for life and you can really say that about any of the elements absolutely but air can be just as destructive as it can be pleasant and words are a good use of that I love that you mentioned words because they can also be very destructive and they can also be very beneficial depending on how it's used right now I'm going to revive an age-old debate shell uh oh and I know this debate is still raging to this day because I just saw it on Reddit but our wands and staves air or fire and our daggers and apes air or fire what's your opinion there is no gray area here okay with me wands and staffs are air bottom line daggers and athm and swords are fire bottom line my opinion do not email us I'm sure you have I'm sure you have an opinion but that is mine sh and I are on the same page for this and I remember per and I getting into big fights over this with Elders in our group because the traditional way of thinking always in the past was that knives and bladed objects are air and the reasoning behind it was that they cut through the air to carve your circle or to carve or to carve your Pentacle in the air and that wands were fire because they were made of wood and could catch fire and so they were considered to be fire I don't know why I don't agree with that but I don't that never worked or sat well with shell and I and quite a few other people as well for us WS are air wood and trees they breathe just like we do they breathe and sink with us not to men and the way I always kind of thought about it is you know back to my my woodsy earthy thing the trees blow in the breeze the leaves blow in the breeze like I'm thinking of a weeping willow you know I made one of my ritual wands um one of my first ritual wands way back in the day out of a willow tree piece of wood and when you think of a willow tree your visualization are these branches flowing in the breeze in the air so yeah wand air wand air it made sense to me same for me as well and also because the act of breathing even after it's become a piece of wood that no longer breathes it's still representative of air in that wood and I don't like the idea that it represents fire because it can be destroyed by that element that never fit well with me what I did like was having a dagger or athame represent fire because they are actually forged in fire right they're created by fire they become something better than itself in fire because of fire yeah and so it very much fit for me that way I think that's why it's such a pervasive argument because the the people who created wika and brought this type of Pagan information into the mainstream came up with a lot of their own ideas and they said wands fire daggers air and so everyone kind of is like well they said it and wrote it down so we have to follow it even though it doesn't really sit right with most people and it has to sit right with you I mean we say what works for you and it sounds very flippant that actually covers a much deeper message and the message is what you're really doing is self- hypnosis what you're really doing is trying to change your own brain and your own subconscious and to be honest our brains like simple and easy that's why spells are little lims and little Rhymes that are simple and easy and repetitive because your subconscious mind responds the best to that right it wants things to make sense and that's the best way to get your subconscious your conscious your body everything in alignment with your spell and your working and so if it doesn't sit right with you if it doesn't work for you that will throw off your whole working so that's why we say things have to work for you it has to feel right it has a very scientific psychological reason behind that well since we we were debating the tools let's jump right over to fire real quick hell yeah you know people think fire is destruction I look at fire as a as a cleansing fire can be very therapeutic when it comes to Cleansing I don't know why but you know those videos you see of like where they do the top grass burnoff yes I always picture that when I picture a fire cleansing burning off that top layer of garbage and but with with fire me personally I'm looking at swords and athm and and red and orange those are the things that that spark fire in my mind you know obviously on an altar if it's not an athme it's going to be a candle actual literal fire but they all work together you know you say that you know wands could be fire and swords could be air Well incense is air but you can't burn incense without the fire you know they all kind of work hand inand I I think that fire gets a bad WAP like I said people kind of look at it as the destructive element but when you look at the elements as correspondences to Seasons fire is summer fire is when we Thrive and when we're I don't want to say happiest but everything is thriving in the summer everything is thriving during that fire season and I I think that maybe we should pay a little more mind to our fire element sometimes absolutely agree and that the magical correspondences for fire follow right along with that it is cleansing it can also be destructive it also is transformative fire changes fire changes metal into that dagger or AEM it changes you fire can represent sexuality sensuality it can be the energy of motivation the energy of inspiration that pushes you forward in your job it can be that passion in a relationship or the passion that drives you to find something new or to move all the way across the country it's the fire that created the ashes from which the Phoenix Rose from exactly exactly and I would actually say in my personal views I think that fire seems to be the most popular element everybody always wanted to call fire in our rituals everybody wants to be part of fire tribe everybody likes to play with the fire fans and the poy and the burning hula hoops and and all of that and let's call a spade of spade that's because fire is associated with Sexual Energy yeah and everybody loves that that flaming energy especially in the summertime when Festival season is at its peak I really love the way one of our favorite places to go Brushwood folklore Center when they have their festivals and their whole seasonal thing they have always had fire tribe even before the current fad of calling yourself a specific type of witch like I'm a herb witch or I'm a crystal witch or I'm a water witch they had fire tribe and the reason they had fire tribe they've had fire tribe for 30 damn years plus I think plus and the reason they had it wasn't because fire is so cool and we all like sex and energy it was because Fire's dangerous and people are fascinated with it and we do need to be careful and so recognized that very early and made it it's an honor to be part of fire tribe but you actually have to work to get there you have to know the rules you have to be careful you have to be a willing Steward of fire especially amongst pagans we love to have bonfires we love to have ritual fires we have tiki torches everywhere candles everywhere and fire dancers so we do need to have that fire tribe yeah that's those safety people to take care of it so it's not just a safety function though and I think that's the important part yes there is a safety function with it but they wield that fire they do they master that fire they manipulate that fire they are wielding that energy as well as keeping them safe the land safe participants safe but they are wielding that fire energy the whole festival has been transformed because of that and they very much there do honor all elements all five elements they have air water Earth and spirit and each element has its own section on their land where they honor that element there are other tribes there's air tribe water tribe and they do kind of take care of the rituals in that kind of quarter and and like you said it all works together it's all wielded together to make ritual and Magic happen I do want to point out I had said this about fire but I do want to mention as far as uh seasonal correspondence is you've got North is associated with winter I don't know why is it because of snow all I can picture of is like these snowy wooded areas the directional associations are very much situational and they started because it was Western European Traditions yeah because they have like East with spring and fire with summer water with fall but if you're in the southern hemosphere it would be the ass opposite right and because they were on the west coast west was watered North was where the ice was South was where the warmth was East was where the sun rose so they made those correspondences based on where they lived and then when it all started getting written down in written tradition and books were created about it people just kept those same correspondences because that's how they were told rather than where you live right now I have found that because I have had too many decades of those correspondences it's difficult for me to fear away from ite away from it because that's where my that's where my brain goes and that's what's easiest for my brain to recognize I will do spells and rituals that are Place specific but that's usually for a specific reason or you know to honor the place or for some specific ritual or spell but if I'm just going to go to my go-to correspondences I go right to those directional traditional correspondences again that's just because they were written down it doesn't have to be how you do it and they were created for any particular reason other than place correspondences so there there's nothing any deeper than that I think the most important thing to remember is you don't have to incorporate any of this into your rituals or spells you don't want to call quarters don't do it no harm no foul man if I'm just doing a little ritual to get a parking spot somewhere I'm not going to cast a circle and call quarters well I mean you could if you really wanted to get all drama but you don't have to right I'm just going to in my head get into magical space and say a few words that I associate with getting a parking spot and uh push that magic out there I'm not going to do a full-blown ritual but you know there is a whole different um and we can touch on this in a different episode but there is a whole sect of Elemental Magic you know all of your magic focused on the Earth element all of your magic focused on the the the southern element there is a a community of folks that do focus on Elemental Magic and that can be a really fun way to do some rituals but I think as far as that that would be a whole separate topic uh that we might want to touch on in a future episode but quarters themselves I kind of like having on my altar the the literal associations sometimes and again it depends on the ritual but I've actually gotten like a pile of dirt and then a little bowl of water um a little a little flame you know and the feather that's the best way I can bring air into my house is with a feather when you think about what works for you just remember it doesn't have to be in a book to be right exactly exactly doesn't have to be like you and I you know we're so stuck on what we were taught because we did that for 30 years what if we moved to Australia and everything was flip-flop we would go into like turmoil over it just because it was what someone else said if you're doing your normal thing and it starts to feel off to you that's the time when you need to kind of sit with that do some meditations on it Journal it out kind of figure out what's feeling off what's not feeling good and if it's because you're calling water from West and you have the shell has the ocean on her East maybe that's what's feeling off to her and if she kind of goes through it a little bit maybe she'll switch and start calling water in the East and Air in the west and see how that feels and speaking of feelings you know let's let's kind of wrap up real quick with the West I always think of blue West Blue Water and we've done that we we we've actually called quarter That Way West Blue Water that's true I do remember that ritual I think every single element I think we had three words you allowed to call say you had to say three words for that and I remember it was West water blue yeah but you know when I think of water I'm not just thinking of water I'm thinking of fish seagulls I don't know why I think of Seagulls when I think of water so really it's your own representations what works for you I love blue when it comes to West sometimes people like blue for Spirit again whatever works for you but that emotional EB and flow when I think of the water I think of the Moon I think of the EB and flow it's that cycle West is very cyclical to me for some reason I associate West with the moon probably because of the water element but again that might not work for everybody but it works for me and the Magical associations that we have for water are water is the subconscious it's your magical mind it's emotions it's all those undercurrents of our life that we really should pay attention to that sometimes we don't you know it's our past it's the the grooves in your brain from Habits it's the things that we do over and over again like shell said it's the Cycles West is why we're stuck in our quarters and elements the way we are that's right that's exactly right it can be one of the more difficult uh elements for people because it does deal so much with the subconscious and it can deal so much with emotion and baggage and and we have a hard time moving through that you know Earth feels comfortable and grounded and air is a breath of fresh air and it's spraying and new beginnings and Fire's exciting and happy and thrilling and water is just all deep and emotional blah yeah it's scary West can be scary just like all of them sometimes you know it's patient it wears down the stone over time it's very strong but it's Relentless that can be difficult for people and so all of that water cleansing that wash of emotions all of that can be freeing liberating but also difficult sometimes but you know um when you try to when you break it down to the basic terms everybody does a water ritual daily or every other day hopefully when you wake up in the morning and you're tired and you're groggy and you're like ah I got to go to work today but when you get in the shower and you've got that water just like flowing down there's some you know you always wake up you're groggy and tired you get that shower and you get out of that shower and like you're like all right I can do this you know it's almost like that cleansing ritual of showering away the negativity from waking up it can literally be a ritual it's one of my favorite mini daily rituals to do we've talked talked before about how popular ritual baths are because of how pretty and photogenic they can be for Tik Tok and for Instagram I want a claw foot damn it but honestly there is nothing like a shower to magically cleanse yourself and it's super super easy you get in the shower you feel the shower beneath your feet and you ground yourself you breathe in that damp air and just fill your lungs and breathe feel the warmth feel the Steam and then literally again like for like our brains and magically we love to have things be the same so imagine that water coming from the crown of your head down your whole body washing you magically as you wash yourself physically and all that negative energy any negative emotions any negative attachments down the drain right down the drain and I think that's where people where where it started coming from you know women used to cry in the shower I'm sure there's been a time or two in life where you and I have cried in the shower maybe couple it's therapeutic because you're just getting it all out and letting it go down the drain exactly it can be a great place it's not even necessarily dirt and grime it could be dirt and grime of your soul oh deep very deep shell I love it exactly just like water just like water and people have shower beers have some shower incense you know have a shower candle have all these things around and make it an actual ritual for you that you can do as you're doing your quick hour in the morning while you're late rushing off to work another thing I've done um you can get stems of eucalyptus oh I love eucalyptus take a bunch of branches tie them off at the top in like a little bundle and then you can hang that in the corner of your shower so they're not necessarily getting fullon water beating on them but they're kind of in that Steam not only if you're sick because if you're sick it does really help that eucalyptus smell it does but also is part of a a showering ritual that eucalyptus can't beat it man can't and you can do that with anything put a couple drops of your favorite essential oil or if you're doing money spell or you're trying to do better at work put a couple drops of Five Finger grass or something on your loofah or on your washcloth so that when you're in the shower doing this little ritual you also have that scent you want to activate as many senses as possible when you're doing magic and ritual because our brains love that our magical selves love to have everything kind of immersive and involved in order to in one big happy bundle yeah we can AFF change so much better that way I just think that sometimes if people take a moment to connect with each element that's one thing I went wrong in the beginning I kind of you know way back in the day I got stuck with an element and I just didn't want to hear about any other one I don't know if you remember but I used to always insist on calling the same element in ritual until one time some so's like hey Shell will you call I don't even know what it was North and I'm like uh why would I call North I don't call North and I'm like why don't I I don't know why I don't so you know you don't want to get stuck in one do some work with each one and it can be simple stuff you know take a walk in the woods if you if you have that ability where you're located go outside breathe some fresh air um if you've got a fire pit build a fire one night you know go swim if you're able um just try to make some sort of connection with each element and don't get stuck into the I'm going to focus on one and only one because you're shorting yourself not only magical experiences but it kind of makes your practice a little lopsided I like how you said that because again I know that there's the the tendency now to be a certain type of witch or a certain type of pagan we all like to have labels because it helps us to feel like we belong and I get that we're all connected those four elements five elements if you include Spirit they're representative of everything of how everything works together and if you focus on just one side of that you're missing out on so much of how it all works together so beautifully to form everything and I think that like shell said don't get too caught up in one try to experience as much of them all of them sit with each one do a little meditation on each one go out into the world and pay attention feel each one honor each one when you're sitting at your altar you know touch each piece that represents each element to you whether it's a a small little item or bigger ones however it is you know just kind of pay attention to that a little bit every day but all of them work together that's the important part I think you know doing a ritual focusing on honoring a specific element is a great thing but again keep the balance try to do that with all of them you know honor each one think about each one feel each one interact with each one because each one of them is great separately but together can make your rituals and your spells so much more wonderful brings everything right to the next level once everything's in harmony together we will definitely get into these deeper in other episodes we'll go into each one we'll talk about Elemental creatures themselves from different cultures we'll go into Elemental Magic but hopefully we've answered a few of your questions about what quarters are what elements are and how they're used in magic and ritual if you have any questions email us at back onth broomstick gmail.com and of course join us next Friday for the next episode where we delve into another topic of Witchcraft and magic and bring you along for the ride I think I'm going to go take a ritual shower and go honor the West within me oh I love that I think I'm just going to light some incense and uh clean my house because that's how I can best honor all the elements today I think little spring cleaning is in the air maybe go honor the elements folks Now's the Time it's it's getting warm out Spring's coming so honor all the elements and we'll see you next week see you next week on back on the broomstick
