join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to another episode of back on the broomstick on this episode we'll be talking about leap your magic magic of that ephemeral day that comes around once every four years are there spells you can do are there magical correspondences here or is it all made up bull crap helping you sort fact from fiction I'm Lea and I'm shell who always looked at leap day as an extra day to take it na oh that's a good one yeah I have um a lot of birthdays in February and I know some people that were born at the end of February but I think I've only ever known one person that was born on Leap Day actually fun fact and I know you know this but I'm I'm giving our listeners a fun fact myself and my siblings all four of us were all born on holidays and although I am not the leape baby in my family I do have U my youngest sister is born on February 29th my little leap sister and I never remember how old this kid is I think I I she might be 36 but I'd have to do the math with the leap year like she gets a real birthday this year that's all I know there's the isn't there like a a play The Pirates of Penzance or something where part of the funny thing is the main character was born on leap day so they said he wasn't really 21 he was actually seven or something like that yeah when my sister turned 21 I think we used to tell people she was like six or seven it's been a family running joke poor kid I love that your whole life well you know not only people who are born on February 29th get like the short end of the stick but February 29th itself actually has some Infamous history o do tell well there were two serial killers that were born on February 29th and I don't remember their names I'll either remember to put it here or I won't future Lea here there are actually two serial killers who were born on leap day one of them is Richard Ramirez is also known as the nightstalker he was born on February 29th 1960 and one of the few female serial killers eileene waros was born February 29th 1956 and fun fact although these two were born in February most serial killers were born in the month of November but interestingly enough according to the Salem witch Museum on February 29th 1692 the very first warrants were issued issued in the Salem Witch Trials I happen to have known that yeah cuz that's just like right down the street from my house yeah they issued they issued the warrants for Sarah good Sarah Osborne and Tiba on February 29th you know if I was alive during then I would have said this doesn't count because this day is doesn't exist except for every four years oh I like that you said that we'll get into our magic about that later and some of that you know Lial space of this day well there are you know people always think oh gez it's leap day there can't be any magic or spellwork or anything you can do for that oh friends what there is now what is a leap day what a leap day essentially is and this I kind of knew from my sibling being born on this day is that basically the Earth and the Sun like doesn't work out to be 365 year after year after year and if we didn't have leap day I think it's something like six hours every year we'd be six hours Short of that 365 which then in turn would be like every 5 years we'd lose a day so you know as as humans do we just make up at a day yeah the history of leap year is essentially that h a solar year if you're going by the sun it takes 365.25 or 6 hours like shell said roughly for the earth to travel around the Sun so that's not exactly our 365 day year and back before the calendar that we use now they still had leap years occasionally actually at one time they had a whole freaking leap month o and it was kind of funny so before the gregan calendar that we know now which again is solar based they had a lunar-based calendar I mean people could follow the moon right it was pretty easy to see the moon changing over 13 moons came from yeah kind of but even weirder their calendar only went from roughly the Spring Equinox to the winter Solstice so about from March till December January and February were kind of like no man's land they had no name what are you talking about right okay and most of these months were like 28 29 days because they followed the lunar cycle right so this worked out okay until they added two more months they added January and February to make it a 12mon year but that doesn't exactly follow the lunar cycle there's 13 moons in a year right so basically when when we as a civilization don't like things we make things fit into our BS yeah we make things up so because the seasons very quickly after this 12 month cycle started to get out of sync with the lunar cycle the priest decided to make up a month called marcedonia that they would just randomly inject whenever they decided it was time they would literally come out and be like surprise it's marcedonia month and they would just add this random month in whenever was needed I love humans so this made time you know people we like to keep time and this made it kind of wonky so juliia Caesar came in changed everything changed all the months made it a solar thing kept February is 28 days and then added one day every four years that just makes me think so Julia Caesar goes in and and flips the script what was that first year like when you're like okay so we're following the lunar calendar no no no no now you're folling the solar calendar I would have been like that would have been the most confusing year of my life even worse if you lived like out of the city you might not even know what the  they're talking about when they start talking about the new calendar who's going to know there was no Twitter there was no social media for everybody to find out quickly it probably took generations for this to catch on people would get on a horse with some scroll to go to these small villages and tell them the time has changed yeah so we have this weird ephemeral day that sometimes is here sometimes isn't and to me that is like a literal day that embodies the magic of a time out of time and a place out of place an extra nap day like I said that too so is it really a magical day in historical witchcraft history and lore shell well there's stuff you can do yeah I'm not I I don't want to say that it might be some historical day but you know I I talked our last episode about how I don't know  about numerology I know enough to get in trouble but I am definitely no numerology expert you know if you if you figure out that leap day comes once every four years if that year is divisible by four imagine how rare this day is people think that because it only happens every four years that it's like some portal to the spirit world could it be I don't know in our old podcasts we used to talk about how there's a portal to hell like in every corner of everywhere so this could be you know one of those leap portals I don't know but there is you know there is something to be said for it this is a time I don't want to say I look at it as like this hidden day but it's kind of a hidden day you can do things like speak to spirits do fairy magic you know things of that nature I think maybe I'm the crazy one I don't know it is a madeup day but madeup things can have power too because everybody knows that this day is special that gives it specialness just like we said about Friday the 13th enough people think Friday the 13th is a thing it becomes a thing right I like what you said about how rare it is and I kind of think of it like there's that saying once in a blue moon that we talk about when something is rare but those happen about once a year not very rare at all I know right this is so rare not only does it only happen once every four years but like we skip one every 400 years it's super rare and it's special and so you can use that as a day to reflect on the past and on your future because it didn't exist you know this day for three years and now it suddenly does so it's a day to uncover hidden things like you said and you know I I joke about it being a nap day but there is something that that's said out and about in the world that this is a good time to be doing like Dream Magic um and visualization magic well what better time to do Dream Magic than when you're napping that's true it's it's a good time to do banishing spells as well because the day itself is going to disappear it will not exist anymore you can do curse breakings for the same reason if you have spells that you need to break or hexes or curses the 29th is a you know leap day is a fabulous day to do it because the day itself will no longer exist as of dawn the next day it's a balancing of the lunar and solar calendar so you can use it as a day to balance yourself to balance your lunar and solar side you could also do um things that are are I don't know if positivity magic is the right word but because it is kind of this special once in a blue moon kind of event you know um so you can bring in positiveness and you can also kind of put out long-term intentions yeah something that especially if you're going to set it for another four years because it's going to go internal it's going to go inside what a great time to do Shadow work and intentions that that are going to take a long time to come to fruition kind of like how people do that on either New Year's Day or on their birthday quote unquote set the tone for the Year this is a good way to kind of set the tone for the next four years take your New Year's traditions or your birthday Traditions multiply it by four and there's your Leap Day tradition exactly exactly it's so it's a it's a great day and the energies are very abundant for that I also like it as a day to take a leap of faith you know if you want to take a chance now is the day to set your intentions for that you know you can leap over a hurdle that you have or a problem you've been trying to solve you want to know a fun fact I always want to know a fun fact yes this is actually it it happens in a lot of cultures but I guess for some reason it's predominant in British culture any of our folks in Great Britain let us know if this is true this supposedly is the one day where women can actually acceptably propose to men because it is a society men generally propose to women and that's just the way it rolls but on Leap Day In some cultures it is acceptable for women to propose to men well I sounds like a pretty outdated tradition and more than likely it was something because the day was you know a time out of time and literally Topsy chvy it's a day that doesn't normally exist so I guess you know back then they thought it was a time to do things out of the ordinary you know something different and I guess you know o women proposing to men I guess that was about as wild and crazy as they could get at the time and it was exactly what you said because it was such a time outof time day it's such a magical day it doesn't really exist we're changing the whole calendar the world is upside down women could ask men to marry them how unusual and strange so you know take that kind of energy even they thought that it had some sort of Supernatural surreal energy and they they expressed it that way so have it be a day to take a chance to do something different to do something outside your Norm I I do like the the banishing and that you touched on um that it's a good time for banishing magic because this whole damn world is full of a lot of negative attachments and a lot of negative energy and for those of you that are that are think think that negative is prevailing this is kind of a good time to push that away put some time and energy into getting negativity out of your personal space or for those that are kind of for lack of a better word world healers to kind of you know put out there to maybe quell some of our worldwide negativity oh I like that a lot of worldwide negativity going on a big ask it is a big ask but you know sometimes you just got to do it and hope for the best in the worst case scenario as you did it and it only helped a little bit there you go and I always say start small you know do things to make your corner of the world better you know banish the things in your life and your family and your relationships that are difficult and that are negative and and start there and then move out to the community and move on for sure definitely a great time a great energy to let things go that no longer serve you but I like to talk real quick about how it's a good time to do fairy magic I haven't heard that one tell me more more well like you said you know it's kind of a place without Place time without time sounds awfully fairy realm doesn't it it kind of does yeah those Lial spaces are definitely where the Fay like to hang out well you know kind of like the spirit world you know the fairy world is kind of easier accessible when the veil is a little thinner and if this is going to be such a special day it would be my assumption that the veil would be a little thinner I guess I mean doing fairy work you need to be careful but this is a good time to put out I I almost don't even want to say this fairy magic wish granting oh I don't know be really cautious working with the Fay that's all I'm gonna say you go on with your wish granting I'm gonna say be real careful asking the fa for anything I hear you and and I get it but I'm just saying that this this is a time where folks kind of do a lot more of that you know leave an offering to the fairies and they say leave an offering during the golden hour which is either right after sunrise or right before Sunset it's easier to contact the fairies during those times but you need to you need to be I don't know if cautious is the word I know you're working with Celtic magic and Celtic traditions and so I I know that working with the Fay is a little differently there but for sure be careful you're asking anything that's why I said you know I wanted to put it out there because it's a thing for this time of year but I just want to please exercise caution I have definitely heard about you know the vanishings working with Shadow Self long-term goal setting um those are for sure good things to do I have a a leap of faith spell that you can do that's relatively simple oo D tell it requires two bay leaves or two small pieces of paper a charcoal incense burner and a candle that's all you need so you're going to set up your space and light your candle and get into meditative space and on each of your bay leaves you're going to write on one you're going to write something you want to leave behind and on one you're going to write a four-year goal something that you want to have come to fruition by the next leap year so once you're ready you're going to place the bay leaf with the thing that you want to leave behind in the charcoal incense burner and then holding the bay leaf of what you want to come to fruition in four years you're going to push all your energy into that raise your energy for your spell and jump over your candle I recommend a tealight nobody needs to get crazy here with a big tall candle so just a little tiny candle jump or leap over the candle and then once you're on the other side release your energy to the universe blow out the candle and save that bay leaf in a journal on your altar someplace safe and keep that until the next leap year and then that should be your bay leaf that you leave behind as you set a new intention for the next four years o so there's your leap of faith candle spell for leap year oh I like that I like to always go back to tarot I don't know why it's my thing love it but I also a little birdie told me that you uh came up with a leap day tarot spread I did I did I can't wait for you to try this show um but while I was doing my tarot journaling I came up with a leap year spread and it's four cards and I'll put pictures up on our our social media and maybe even do a post on our website so you can see this so you go straight down in a row one two three and then to the right of those cards you place one card that's four that's the leap card and what they stand for is the first card is what your Shadow has to teach you uh what things you should possibly leave behind I like I like the second card is the biggest obstacle that you're facing right now the third card is what is going to Aid you in your transformation what is your greatest gift and then the leap card the leap of faith card is the major theme from now until the next leap year so the theme of your life for the next four years I like that last year it's a lot less complicated than what I did last year what did you do last year y'all are gonna laugh at me don't stop laughing before you start here folks last year I laid out 29 cards oh yeah that sounds like you well that was like 29 days 29 cars and you say you don't do numerology I have my own spin to it apparently there you go you know that is one of the times you know I generally don't do a read or do a spread that's more than maybe eight or 10 cards at the most so to actually lay out 29 cards talk about getting an inp depth full picture and I did them in rows um I kind of did the five five55 all the way down to the last row could only be four it's a lot of cards but I feel like you get kind of more detail and more in depth I didn't necessarily go into it with you know this row means this or this row means this I just kind of looked at it as a story where the top card at the top row and kind of read it like a book all the way down and kind of what do you got to say for me for that leap year so I didn't really have no Rhyme or Reason To The Rose I just kind of treated it more like a 29 card story and I started at card one and read all the way to down to 29 I like that for big events like this I like bigger readings you know if I'm doing my New Year's spread or my birthday spread or a sa spread they're usually much larger you know not necessarily 29 cards although go Bigg or go home I have done on a wheel of the Year spread that was quite large but I tend to do bigger spreads at those times so it makes total sense that you would do that my leape tarot spread is only four cards it's a more condensed you could certainly do a bigger spread now because like shelle said earlier in the episode this is a great time to set intentions treat it like a new year treat it like a special day I mean it is a special day we have given it special meaning and just like with other things when we're doing spell work you take the meanings that this day has come to be associated with and apply that to your spellwork and to your magic and that's when you're going to find the most power the most alignment you're going to be able to get into the flow of your spellwork easier when you go with what's already there exactly and and I think the reason I liked that big spread is because like I said it is it was just so much more detailed than say a six card spread or a eight card spread it was almost like instead of filling in some of the blanks the blanks were all there right in a row for you all filled right in you didn't have to ask any extra yeah those are those are intense those are really intense oh yeah beautiful and magical readings to do and you can really get if you have the time to get into it highly recommend doing one of the larger spreads on a on a special day and you know that would be something that might be a little hard to journal because of the extent of it but it's definitely worth if are going to do a big spread like that for for this time of year to journal it and then go back four years you know every four years if you if you keep these journals and kind of this is where I was four years ago this is where I where I am now this is where you know you kind of can chart that but happening only every four years you got to hold on to those notes and those journals for a good minute yep you know I do digitally Journal some of my things I've said before that a lot of times my New Year's readings are recorded digitally and I have a whole bunch of them going back years online in my digital folders so I will often take a picture you know I'll take a picture of the spread I just don't have that much trust in the digital world yeah oh no I I feel you I definitely have handwritten and digital but I I have both but you know actually I might now that I've I've talked about it I might actually do that spread again and I might take advantage of the wiser tarot Journal stickers by the way that tarot Journal has some badass tarot stickers that I love might take advantage of the stickers um and journal Journal it out with those stickers that's very cool yeah I think it's a great day for journaling I mean who am I kidding I think every day is a great J you love journaling every day I do it's true every day it's such a great day for shadow work to go within it's a linal space a magical space it's if you dare fairy realm space it's ancest work space it's space to get into your own head it's time to uncover that which is hidden and to set plans in motion that you won't realize for years to come and you know one thing and that that just kind of sparked something that I had forgot about this is also a good time to do to do rituals and spellwork for courage because this is kind of a day where the mundane is replaced by the unexpected um so it's a good day to kind of be bold and try something different do things that you've always wanted to do that you've never done you know have that courage have that strength have that passion to just like Lila said take that leap if you're not going to take a leap of faith on leap day when the hell you taking it just saying find that courage it's a day that doesn't really exist everything is topsy turvy you know do it go for it I love that you said that I love that or you can nap all day and do Dream Magic or you can nap all day set your spell jar I've seen a lot of people talk about spell jars and Spell bowls for leap day and I think those are fantastic I should try that I'm such a spell jar person and I've never done a leap day spell jar I might do that you know what might be fun is a time capsule spell jar oh what a great idea set up your spell jar write a letter to the to Future you four years from now with all your hopes and dreams for yourself put in all things that you would love to open up little presents for yourself crystals put in there little trinkets Keys whatever you like maybe an actual wrapped present or two and put it in your jar seal it up just like you would a spell jar with all sorts of good intentions with the idea that when you open it four years from now all that magic all that good energy that you put into it is going to come out to you as you receive all these gifts and read that letter from past youth you're making me feel bad because you know if I if if my my four year ago self I know I accidentally said I did it last year but I meant I did it four years ago my four year four year ago self that did that 29 card spread I wish I would have wrote it down so that I could reflect on it now and I hadn't written it down at the time and here I am four years on and I'm like damn I wish I knew what those 29 cards were so that was one time where I I was lazy there I said it and I didn't write it down and now four years on wish I had because four years ago was a was a minute ago and I feel like I wish I I just really wish I knew what those 29 cards had said yeah yeah what a great gift to give to your future s so write down your tarot readings write down your spells and make a time capsule spell jar you know for your future self to open oh my God you've given me a project I'm doing this well that being said shell and I have got to go round up stuff
