on this podcast two best friends on opposite coasts of the United States tell each other's stories designed to would you stop I'm trying to record I know you have a lot to say on this podcast it's witchcraft [Laughter] [Music] it's 4:20 a.m. the stoned Witches Hour the perfect time to get really high and tell Trish Tales of a town haunted by shadow people and a bridge with a troll that may lure you to your doom welcome to episode 23 of the stoned witch's hour on this podcast two best friends on opposite coasts of the United States tell each other's spine tingling scary stories designed to harsh their mellow which may account for why we smoke so much weed I'm Leila and I'm hi and I'm shell and I'm from the east coast and here we are warm happy hi how you doing I'm doing pretty great summertime has rolled in I'm Feeling Fabulous Everything Is In Bloom and I have an amazing Harvest to share with you can I tell you what's In Bloom right now my freaking allergies my allergies are and Bloom and it is a [ __ ] and I hate it but it's warm and I love it you know I saw this thing on Facebook today and I so wish this was a reality I wish that mosquitoes would crossbreed with fireflies so at the very least we could see them coming but I might not hate them so much if they were like all cute and phosphorescent that would be fun maybe because I was high that sounded like a great idea but I don't know fireflies mosquito if if mosquitoes were like flashy light at least it' make the itch less annoying I think so too you know I don't think there have been as many mosquitoes lately and I certainly don't think in my travels that I have seen any fireflies this year I'm very disappointed yeah I have oh good good yeah for the last couple of weeks I have in the backyard so that's always nice not like years and years ago when we saw a whole field of them but I I occasionally seeing one or two or three at night yeah I definitely don't see any around in California and in my travels I haven't seen any either are you referring to when I got hand fasted with my husband I am that was a gorgeous night and it was literally blanketed in fireflies I did like I don't think I've ever in my life seen as many fireflies as I have that night the only time I've seen as many fireflies was when I was a baby witch and I was doing a a spell to open a portal to a on we've done that a couple times we have indeed and you know I was camping out at a was a boyfriend or a former boyfriend at the time his family had a bunch of fields and I was with a friend of mine that we were both kind of exploring witchcraft together at the time and we decided to go camp out in these woods and do some magic we were going to try to open the realm of Avalon basically we're just going to kind of do this spell workor we're going to do some meditation and and you know go out in the woods and challenge ourselves to be a little scared you know see what we could find and yeah one of the fun things that we saw on the way out on the four-wheeler was we just had to stop because we crossed through a ditch in a little a little gring of trees and this clearing was filled literally Filled from side to side top to bottom fireflies all the way down that's all you could see was fireflies everywhere and I miss that kind of view I haven't seen that in a while A Midsummer's Night Dream exactly exactly it was beautiful I'm so glad you've gotten to see some though so I hear you puffing on that bong of yours let's just Dive Right into what just smoking today I am very happy to announce that my strawana is ready oh my God is it as good as what I had was oh my God I have waited for this day I have waited for this too it's amazing it's phenomenal you were so spoton and it does it does it have like that fruity flavor maybe not strawberry banana flavor per se but kind of that fruity tint almost I would say it definitely has a fruity flavor it's very sweet it's delicate almost a dare I say a little bit of strawberry oh my god with a little bit of like peppery at at the backs side I don't know if peppery is the right word but maybe a little spicy tingle I'm not sure if people could see my face right now and how excited I am over this oh my God that's so pretty light and pretty it's all ready to go this is an autoflow I don't know if what you smoke Auto flour but this is from a company called Fast Buds and this is their straw Nana autoflow and it's fantastic it grew beautifully it it was very strong very robust easy to grow took about 13 14 weeks and then a couple weeks to cure and it's fabulous wow how much did you get out of a sea I don't weigh it unfortunately I use uh Mason jars and you just fill a jar till it's full and then go to the next jar yeah yeah and once it you know it's a lot of jars in the beginning when it's wet it's a lot fluffier it's a lot it compacts up that's right so I got about four jars four of my blue mason jars so I would say roughly eight ounces I am so glad that worked out because that was just such a tasty delightful treat it's delicious it's very very good I do love that peppery in the back taste that little bit of spicy some of my favorite Jack hair cultivars have that and it's it's delicious so thank you for the recommendation very very good I wish it didn't have to take me so long to try it well unfortunately because we can't just randomly throw a bud in an envelope and mail it across the country so unfair I just have to give you seed recommendations right and I'll just keep trying to grow it and hey any of you listeners out there if you have something that you'd like me to try and grow send me an email but stoned Witches Hour at gmail.com and I'll try it she is a good grower guys i' definitely give her some suggestions just thank you I do okay and it's a lot of fun and it cuts down on my weed bill because as we know it gets kind of expensive nobody needs to pay that much right what are you smoking tonight anything delicious I am smoking something delicious right now I am smoking I know I've smoked this before uh during the podcast because I feel like I remember talking about it but I'm smoking kush mints o very delicious it is I don't want to say piny but kinda um I mean it's not like you're drinking a shot of Jin by any stretch but a little Piney um but it's it's very delicious it's it's very dense this is again one of those where it you're you're kind of better off using a grinder with it because because it's just kind of hard to smoke doing the old stuff in pack so you really are better to use a grinder with it but it you know a little goes a long way which is usually what I favor the most I I like it I I'm almost out of it though at the moment so went through it pretty quickly e well you know well when you like something you like it I had a couple days off and you know how it is when you have a couple days off in a row and it's warm and you're hanging out getting high doing fun things going to pot festivals you tend to you tend to go through a little bit more a little bit faster yeah so the Kush is great it really is you know I really wish it was minty but it's not but it's good now I've heard from Fast buds that their straw Nana goes anywhere from 27 to 32% THC and again I haven't tested it I know there's kits out there I'm broke I'm lazy haven't done it so what does that mean does that mean you're you're pretty much guaranteed to have it be least 27% like how accurate is that statement I would say they're pretty accurate but honestly you can how you grow when you harvest what type of nutrients you use if you have any problems with light or humidity all of those things can affect your tricomes and they can affect the THC content of the final product there's no way to tell exactly there's no guarantee but but they can say that they've grown it a few times anytime somebody puts a a seed out for sale it really should have been the genetic should be solid every single plant that comes from that should be relatively uniform and so they could grow some and test it and get an average THC and say depending on how you grow it or whatever you're you're going to get something like this type of THC out of it nice nice yeah so how about your kush mints what kind of uh THC do you get there wow per usual It's relatively on the higher side but this is actually a little low as far as what I usually have um 27% THC but I'm telling you it does the job it's an ass Kicker 27 is no lightweight THC percentage maybe for you but 20 27% is is is definitely on the higher end for your average smoker plus as we've talked about before sometimes the the tpin and the the different cannaboids that are in the bud can have an effect on the high even if the THC isn't at your 32 or 33% it could be at 25 22% and still kind of kick you right between the eyes and give you couch lock the way that higher percentage can sometimes well I was actually thinking about trying a lower percentage next time I go to the store just to experiment nothing wrong with experimentation oh experimentation is good I'm hopeful that this time you can save a little bit of money and have good results again exactly because you know weed's expensive I don't know why it's a weed but you know they can monopolize it taxwise and whatever it takes for me to be able to use my debit card to buy it I guess here we go I'm hearing that in some markets retailers are complaining about the overproduction of weed I mean it's a weed it's really not that hard to grow once you get it kind of dialed in it really isn't that difficult it sounds difficult but honestly if anyone out there is thinking about jumping into growing do it everyone should grow their own it's fabulous it's not that hard anyway retailers are bitching about overproduction because it's going to drive the price down and I've been saying from the beginning that this should not be anybody's Cash Cow this should not be the goose that laid the golden marijuana [ __ ] nugget because you just grow it it's a weed and they need to get their hands off of it and they need to stop trying to commoditize it and trying to keep it from everybody and keep these prices artificially inflated and artificially High because the only people that are making money off it are the [ __ ] that okay not entirely I know there's a lot of good businesses out there I'm kind of getting out of rant but what I'm trying to say is the people that should be making money off of it half of them are still in [ __ ] jail and the other half get priced out of the market because of regulations when it should be like a tomato I should be able to go to a farmers market and buy it like a tomato do you know it's like over a million to get insurance just to open a store do you remember M sitting on your couch high as [ __ ] kites I do and we were going to start a weed business writing business plans until 400 a.m in the [ __ ] morning because we knew legalization was coming and we were G to do it we were grow remember that I was gonna be a farmer I was gonna [ __ ] grow the hydro you were gonna have a store we were gonna sell the [ __ ] out of that [ __ ] we are gonna make so much money and we were going to have like the mom and pop shop we were going to do so good we were going to help people out we were going to we were even going to hook up with glass blowers and sell pieces we were GNA have like a whole Wellness Center we were G to have glass blowers and like people doing yoga and and Tin meditation readings hypnosis the whole thing like we had a plan man it was going to be beautiful and then we realized we couldn't even afford to think about it oh my God H yeah no the cost to enter is prohibitive there's no way it was something ridiculous I can't remember if it was 2.5 million or five million just for the insurance that it was like another I want to say like 1.5 million for the application just the application who comes up with these numbers greedy people greedy [ __ ] for real greedy [ __ ] greedy greedy [ __ ] but I think as time goes on you know and and I can say say this I'm already starting to see it here as time goes on you know there is kind of a over production and and a lot of competition right now and I yeah as it should be found as it should be I found a store that I am going to actually check out next time I go to the store and this particular place you can actually get eighths as low as $25 when the cheapest I've ever seen so far is like about 48 but they usually range about 60 an eth they kind of have it on a sliding scale based on THC percentages but I'm going to try some $25 weed next time I go and and and see if it's worth the while shall we say but I think this store could potentially be on to something as far as dialing into lower prices I really like that way of looking at it if it's really tasty and you know if it's really top shelf whether it's top shelf because it has that higher THC content or it's top shelf because it's got that amazing Aroma and smoke that you know I love and look for every time I want something that tastes so good it just makes me want to smoke it over and over again but that could that could be your once in a while weed and then your everyday weed could be the $25 weed which I think ranged between I want to say 16 and maybe 20% t HC yeah that's not bad that's a great daytime smoke right so so I'm I'm I'm going to experiment this next trip out I make here I'm gonna try a new store I'm gonna try me some $25 weed I'll report back next time folks I love it I love that this podcast has got you trying new things and kind of breaking out of your box a little bit and being more willing to to try something a little on the cheaper side you know I know we don't have unlimited Pockets but I know we also budget for budget for weed I know that's my entertainment budget but you also have to remember I I remember when I used to say quantity over quality that's true it's true and I know you have grown out of that I know you are definitely more of the quality although you still smoke a lot of quantity I do so no wonder you're looking for a little bit of a break for the moment right if you lived closer I'd share as long as you did trimming oh see I trimming is not my favorite I could do trimming actually my my boyfriend has special curved trimming scissors we've talked about this before if you would come out when I'm trimming I will buy you whatever special scissors you want I'll buy you a special chair I'll get I'll show you how to smoke scissor hash o it's the best oh hey I'm not for trying anything exactly scissor hash is one of the few things that makes trimming worth it you know get some good music Good Company it's not that bad honestly I just I just hate doing it by myself it just takes so long it's not that bad you put on it music you get high and you just don't out that's what I do that's what I do and I think about festivals oh I went to a festival like I was telling you before sometimes all the things we talk about don't make it into the podcast gasp shocker but yes we were talking about a festival that I've been to recently and I'm going to share my screen because one of our listeners who also happens to be a friend showed me something that reminded me of this so can you see my screen I can so just recently we went to a Pot Festival for the first time in a long time I was so happy and it was so boring but it okay it wasn't really it wasn't that bad it was kind of nice actually to see all the Stalls and everybody offering their different things and I was I guess maybe it's the economy but there were not as many freebies as I'm used to I love getting free joints and free dabs and free Edibles and and it just really wasn't there and there weren't even a lot of deals like the prices I saw seemed to be the same prices you could get things in store so it was nice to see the variety of places not what you expected you're exactly right so it was great to see there was some local farmers there there was some local businesses I I really enjoyed that and there was some performers there and I did see my first smoke Cannon it may have also been a covid cannon I'm not sure looked like some sort of wild flamethrower but it was a huge canister of weed and it blew out smoke like a flamethrower into the crowd and people would just kind of put their faces up to the end of this like vacuum cleaner like hose and get blasted in the face people were falling out coughing it was great you know my husband in and puts his face in there and I I think people were a little worried about him they had to like go find him in the smoke but he was just all Blissful in there just taking it all in it was wonderful so that was kind of fun that is interesting yeah it was really neat to see all the different things that people had I got some infused honey that I had on our last podcast I got some infused chocolate and uh I saw this wonderful stash box was I thought it was super cute it has the compass rose on it that you know I love and and inside it had a a hempwick lighter have you ever tried the the hemp Wick to light your bowls with no no there's a school of thought that the flame from a lighter is too hot and you burn off some of your cannaboids some of your Tarpin and some of your THC from the lighter so this has a hemp Wick wrapped around it which was just like a thread that's cut usually some type of paraffin or some type of wax on it soy wax Maybe um so it doesn't burn very fast and you light that with your lighter and then you just use the little flame at the end of that hemp Wick to light your bowl and it's it's a it's a lower temperature flame oh you get a better taste out of your bowl and you can get um you can potentially get higher because it's it's not going to burn off some of that THC before it gets into the smoke but you can see there's a bunch of different types there the grower said that he kept back a little bit out of all of his favorite cultivars over the past couple months and he created this little stash box and I think it's adorable I like the jars I do too aren't they so cute I love things to put things in and this is like a box and then Inside the Box are these little jars and little tubes and it's just fantastic I love it it has so many things I like I wanted to show you that because this is from a listener and this is someone that we know I'm going to give a shout out to Mel hi Mel hey Mel I adore Mel she's fabulous she's also a maker kind of like I am and I'm going to show you this video I absolutely flipped out when she sent me this she has made herself this little stash box and it's amazing it's amazing you said you liked jars check out these jars it's so cute but I'm going to play you this little video and I know our listeners can't see this but it's this beautiful little old timey medicine cabinet just a little small medicine cabinet with like raw iron instead of Glass on the little doors inside she's got all these different jars labeled with the different types of weed and she's got a spot a little Shelf at the bottom for her bowl and her lighter and it's just beautiful I absolutely love it it's so feminine and delicate and it's got all these different types and she has a stem jar Lisa an she has a stem jar i' I have never kept my stems and here are two people that I adore who keep their stems I think I'm missing out on something so isn't that like the most adorable thing I love that it's all so pretty and organized and I don't know what I'm missing out with the stems but she had a jar labeled stems clearly that is very cool very very cool that's just amazing what do you keep your weed in Shell do you have anything special or pretty what I do actually is I have um you can buy them at Target they're like let me show you I'd love to see it than are actually four or five inches high they're mini mason jars my brother has that exact same one I was just smoking up with my brother and I told him I wanted to steal that jar and he won't let me have it because it's all coated with ke on the inside yeah I'm still gonna try and steal it anyway while we're visiting yeah mine is too but it's it's it's a little hand siiz I mean you can fit about an eighth maybe a little more in there depending on how compact it is but it's a little Ball mason jar you can get a four pack at Target for about six seven bucks I love it that is super cute yeah so it's basically just like a mini mason jar and then I have another one same size that I put all of my Keef I store all of my Keef in that one so I have one for buds one for Keef I like it it works it's cute little screw top you know I'm not a huge fan of packaging right but I did find this one shop that carries these oh little jars and it's that's it that's all it is and they actually take these jars back they will take these back put them through a sterilization process and take the labels off and reuse them that's cool I love that so much I also really like and unfortunately in some of my moving I I have broken a lot of pieces and I used to have some hand blown glass jars that had all the little you know the knobs ands yeah that's right I love those so so much yeah I have a couple I just am afraid to use them because I feel like they're so pretty I don't want to break them I have a stoned witches public service announcement that I want to make to all the companies out there that package cannabis first of all stop that [ __ ] secondly stop lying to yourselves and to your customers telling us that we're going to reuse these glass jars do you know how many of the these glass jars we end up with or the little plastic jars nobody [ __ ] reuses more than one or two of those stop saying that that's a selling point because it's not it's a lie and honestly if you're going to package your weed and anything other than a baggie provide recycling for your own [ __ ] correct if you sell it at a shop provide recycling at that shop for your packaging all of it we have spent what 70 years getting we a a damn Ziploc sandwich baggie we are cool with it it's okay we're all right with it even get the Ziploc sandwich bags that's what makes you happy we kept it away from our kids and our pets just fine so nothing more than a ziplock sandwich bag like you can get a hundred for a buck 50 at like Stop and Shop like let's do this give me a discount if I bring my own glass jar that's the one that's the one complaint that I could probably make about Happy Valley is they're like these thick glass jars they're heavy like you could like knock someone out with one of these damn things such an environmental waste right this particular company works with a lot of local farmers and they recycle all this is all top shelf weed comes like this but they T they accept all of these back and again they sterilize them and reuse them and I love that and I will I'll pay top shelf prices all day long for that packaging companies they lie I got into a Twitter fight with with a weed company because they're like oh yeah our packaging is so cool look at how cute these jars are you can use them for so many things no no we can't we don't want to we want you to take them back and recycle them and we really like you to have made them out of a hemp product first of all thank you rant over so this is really good straw Nan shell it tastes so yummy I'm G to have another bong while I'm having another bong I have a story for you if you're ready so you have some some fabulous Story You're Dying to tell do tell what's your story What You Got Tonight spook me shell I am so ready to tell you this story I dived into this story expecting to find something that was very similar to a Sleepy Hollow kind of Spectre oh and I did but I also found like some Town Intrigue back at the Civil War I learned a lot about Shadow People this is a town with a lot of Shadow People type hauntings and a little bit about the stone tape theory that we've talked about before well start off by telling me where is this story from it's a little town called ailla and it's in Missouri ailla Missouri like ailla Milla Villa Milla only only someone high would go there I'm a little high Grape Ape you remember mcgilla right mcgilla gorilla mcgilla gorilla we are totally age dating ourselves people totally okay so a villa Missouri is a very tiny town and I mean super super tiny I think it says on the sign that it has population like a hundred but according to some of the residents it's less than 50 oh so that is like kind of tiny it was once a booming town and it was on his it was on Route 66 back in the Heyday back in the Heyday what did they move Route 66 well yeah weird okay well that's what happened to a lot of 6 Route 66 was was hugely popular but then they did move sections of it and some of these smaller towns got completely bypassed the only reason some of these towns sprung up was because of Route 66 not not a villa in particular but but some of them and then when they moved 66 or they they moved the main highway to a different area other than 66 all these didn't you watch the cars you watched Disney's Cars right that that really happened that was real life oh oh yeah and and a villa was one of those little towns on Route 66 that kind of died out once it once it literally moved so it's kind of it's called a um what do they call it a living Ghost Town not just because of the shadow people and ghosts that walk around but because it was once a thriving town along Route 66 and due to a lot of different factors it's become smaller and smaller until some say it has a population of less than 100 today but back when it was founded in 1856 it was a thriving City when the Civil War hit in 1861 most people in a villa like everywhere in the country were divided and tensions ran very high by 1862 Union soldiers were mostly in control in a villa but skirmishes were very common and roving bands of Confederate soldiers called Bushwackers acted like gorilla combatants they would literally go around and attack civilians of families they destroy properties and farms uh they would Rob doors they'd attack Travelers oh I feel like I've heard of Bushwackers before you may have it was definitely a dark time not just because of the Civil War but because of some of these Confederate soldiers would run around like gangs literally and they would terrorize towns and people and they would they would burn down houses and in a villa in particular there was a man named um he was a doctor Dr Jacqueline M stemens and he was a a vocal Union supporter and he was having a meeting at his home in a villa when a bunch of Bushwhackers came to his home and were threatening to burn it down and Dr stemens came outside and he started yelling at these Bushwhackers and he was telling them you know go ahead kill me I don't care what you do to me but don't burn down my home my my wife and my children are here this is the only thing that's going to help them after you kill me he's like please you know don't burn my house and and of course they killed him and burned the house down anyways this was recounted by his son they have an actual book in a villa of firsthand accounts of people who a lot of them who were children during the Civil War but anyway that's kind of brutal it is pretty brutal so after they killed Dr stemens uh people got really upset in the town so this was March 8th 1862 when Dr stemens was killed and his house was burned To The Ground by these Confederate Bushwackers and so the Union Soldiers in the area had a very good excuse now to to hunt down and kill a lot of these Bushwhackers and so they did the town itself got taken over uh in 1862 by Union soldiers and so it was it was becoming part of the union and they were trying to eradicate these Confederate soldiers anyways so burning down Dr stem's house they were definitely after them so one of these roving bands of of Union Soldiers is kind of patrolling the town and they come across the B of a bushwhacker that looked like he had been killed a little bit before in a skirmish he had been shot in the head and his skull his head was detached from his body so they weren't sure if he had been decapitated or if animals had gotten to him at some point so these soldiers decided to warn other Bushwhackers to stay away from a villa and they they hung his head from a tree at the edge of town some Reports say it was an apple tree at the edge of an orchard some say that it was an oage orange tree I have no idea so they hung this rotting head from the tree to scare people away to scare other Bushwhackers and show them what would happen if they tried to do anything in this town again Jesus right so despite being completely disgusting they did that to kind of worn off these other Bushwhackers from coming into this town and trying to perpetuate any of these crimes and so they hung this skull from the tree and all the fruit in this tree shortly after they strung up the head rotted and fell off and no new flowers and no new fruit would grow and crows started coming and I imagine crows were coming because I mean it's you know free lunch right oh ew ew ew I know but so it's like free lunch so you'd get some scavengers but after a little while there's nothing there to eat left it gets all dried or whatever but the birds kept coming and they came in such numbers that the tree itself would look BL black from the roots to the crown of the tree because of the number of crows on it they called this victim this this Confederate bushwhacker whose skull was hung there they called him rotten Johnny Reb the skull hung there for about a year and as time passed and the skull became more just bones and rotted they say it still stunk like a decaying dead desiccated body around that tree despite the fact that at this point it's just a skull with maybe some hair left on it people of the town of a villa would remark that the death tree still smelled like a weak old corpse rotting in the sun it was rank it was disgusting until one day the skull was gone and all that remained was a rope hanging in the tree that had once produced gorgeous apples but now just cracked dead limbs covered in bird poop and it looked like something out of a nightmare that's weird it is weird but time went on as time does and most people forgot about rotten Johnny Reb hanging in the tree and they moved on but I don't think Johnny did soon after the Civil War ended in 1865 people in the town started reporting a disgusting stench of Decay and death wafting over the town particularly on the side of town where the death tree was and then much like the headless horsemen stories started to pop up of his body wandering through town searching for his head usually dressed in like a long dark duster sometimes carrying a rifle other times carrying a lantern strange stories of a headless man walking the roads at night began to circulate and there was Talk Amongst people of an eerie moaning wind that would accompany the smell and the sight of this headless man roaming the streets some reports said that he seemed like he was searching for something and sometimes he'd crawl through the grass they'd see this headless body crawling through the grass and they could smell the stench of his rotten body preceding him and the Rumor was is that if you could smell him you were in danger oh and the legend says that he wants to kill all Yankees and kill anyone that may have had anything to do with him losing his head and there were several murders in town that have all been attributed to rotten Johnny Reb and quite a few towns people even to this day have said that they have seen him he's sometimes called the ailla Phantom bushwhacker and supposedly he's cursed now the reason they say that his ghost is tormented and stuck here and has to find his head is because when he was killed I bet you can guess when he was killed sh I know you can just think for a second use your use your psychic powers when do you think he was killed probably Halloween whoa shell how did you know I'm just guessing oh my goodness you are like the world's best guesser you there's no way you could have know CRA psychic abilities yes of course he was killed in the fall and the rumor is that the reason he's searching for his head continuously is because he was killed and decapitated on all hollow's Eve and so this headless body much like the wanders around looking for his head now again supposedly this head is hanging from a tree and the rumor is is that it never disappeared it's just it kind of maybe shifted reality and that his head is still hanging there and that if you smell him your only chance of survival is to find the tree where his head is hanging and cut it Loose oh Lord and if you don't he's going to get you and kill you and so it sounds like a fun ghost story but then the actual deaths began in a villa oh [ __ ] now this one Ghost Story I Heard said that either in the late 1890s or the early 1900s that people began reporting the stench of rotten Johnny Reb walking through their Town more often than before so one morning after particularly bad evening with a foul smelling Cloud that had been following people around town people are waking up smells beautiful today yay you know the stench that followed us last night is gone it's a bright sunny morning until they found a body outside the Local Tavern a young poor woman by some accounts a street walker or Lady of the night was discovered dead nearly bloodless and with her head practically severed from her body oh wow no leads no suspects nothing no blood oh [ __ ] the death was of course blamed on Rotten John rep there have been supposedly more unexplained deaths in the town all blamed on Johnny and again to this day people say that you have to use caution at night in a villa and if you're unlucky enough to smell him coming the only options that you have are to run far and fast so that he doesn't take your head or hope you have a knife with you and that you can find the death tree where his head is strung up the only way to survive an encounter with rotten Johnny Reb is to find that death tree cut his head down from where it's hanging and bury it on Holy Ground wow so they say even to this day in a villa that you shouldn't go around after dark without a sharp knife just in case you do happen to run into the Headless rotten Johnny Reb so that you can cut down his head if you find it otherwise and what eat it like an apple so headless horsemen so Sleepy Hollow it's one of those myths much like the lady the hitchhiking lady in white that kind of perpetuates in in some form or another so yeah rotten Johnny R powered by Satan oh who did it Satan or you know maybe it's just a ghost story who knows this town has more than just the curse rotten Johnny maybe there's something in the Land There that holds ghosts but this town is known for being Rife with shadow people and as you know shadow people are those humanlike forms that you see out of the corner of your eye or full-on Shadows of people that you see in front of you when there's no person there and it moves like a person it walks like a person but it's not really a person it's a shadow it's a ghosty now there are numerous accounts people say that they see shadow people all over this town mostly the stone tape type ghost the the recorded type ghost that is just a brief snapshot maybe a the shadow of a woman in a dress walking down the street or or a lot of people report seeing them them in the houses both the houses that are currently occupied and the ones that are abandoned or emptied which this town has a plethora of so they'll see shadow people walking past the windows inside a house that's abandoned just like your mom's house not that not that her house is abandoned but occasionally people will see oldtime dressed people just walking down Main Street shadow of people in big hoop skirts or in in suits and big hats when there's nobody there right outside of the bar very often people will see a shadow person kind of stumbling backwards clutching his chest as if he's a drunk about to fall down or maybe someone who got shot and it's seen repeatedly outside of the same bar in town so I couldn't find any current accounts of people having smelled or seen rotten Johnny Reb but I could find accounts of people who have seen shadow people even recently the stories of The Shadow People go back to the 1900s and has continued to this day oh wow so mostly they seem to be shadows of people from another time that are just going about doing the same thing that they did either shortly before they died or maybe at a moment of extreme emotion or at the moment of their death like that bar Patron where you see him clutching his chest and staggering backward even though there's no one there to cast that shadow just two months ago uh a woman Amanda Collins from a villa says that she had been living in a villa for about a year and had never heard of The Shadow People or the shadow man but she reports that things kept happening to her 2-year-old she says he caught his top lip with scissors and her older children said that it wasn't the 2-year-old that did it it was the dark man that made him do it she says there were countless things going on with her little boy and that one night the whole family witnessed him fly out of his seat at the dinner table like he was pulled he was constantly getting hurt and the older kids said it was the black man and it wasn't until they moved away that she saw an article about the shadow man and The Tall Man from that town so she didn't even know things kept happening to her kid that were really freaky and she didn't even know until she left there's a gentleman also uh ree Phillips I've seen him in a couple documentaries to be fair I've also seen it commented from people in a villa who say that Rees does not represent them so I'm just giving you both sides here but ree Phillips says that he lives in what was once the General Store and also possibly the original meeting place for the Masons before they built their uh permanent place back in the 1800s and he says that he sh he and his family are sharing this space with at least five known ghosts he says that objects regularly move both when they're watching and when they walk out of a room and come back in and that he says he and other people that come to the house are regularly grabbed like grab their ankles grab their clothes grab their hair to him these shadow people seem very interactive and he says he's had several encounters with them he says he often sees them kind of peering around corners but if he looks at them full on they disappear in particular there's one ghost that the family calls The Tall Man and this tall man Shadow actually grabbed his wife Nicole out of bed dragged her out of bed and although no one saw the tall man that she says pulled her out of bed she had red marks all around her neck right his wife Nicole reports that she once woke up and saw what she thought was her daughter six-year-old in the room just kind of standing there motionless so she gets out of bed and the girl's gone no one there and feeling a little freaked out obviously she goes to her kid's room and finds her sleeping soundly in bed but she distinctly saw her standing oddly Motionless in the center of her room just minutes before another Resident of a villa Jake Pennington he says his home was built on the foundation of a home that had been built in 1884 behind his house is a barn that no one wants to go in the barn was built in the early 1900s and he says everyone even their pet is scared to go in there everyone feels immediately creeped out just going out to the bar and one time while they were working on the fence line of the property they found a headstone a marker stone for a graveyard and so they checked into records to find out what it came from and discovered that their property had actually once been a church and the church itself sat where their driveway currently was and the back part of the house and where the barn sits had been a slave Cemetery he says that they can often hear people talking in other rooms of the house even though no one is there and he hears shushing when they come in the room and then it goes quiet very often on their baby monitor and this would freak me out I mean don't mess with kids I hate it when gohost mess with kids but he says sometimes they can hear what sounds like heavy breathing and moaning coming through the baby monitor even though there's no one but their child in their room sleeping soundly or sometimes when no one is in that room at all and he says that sometimes items will move move so quickly like not just you know you go out of the room and you come back in and a chair's moved he says sometimes like a bottle will slide across the table so fast when they turn to look at it the bottle's not moving but the liquid in the bottle is still sloshing there was also an investigator um this town has been investigated by numerous amateur uh haunting investigators as well as a bunch of other groups um this's one group haunting history online uh they were doing an investigation in a villa and I believe one of their investigators Holly she caught um an EVP like a musical EVP when she played it it almost sounds like um some of that like old tiny music I don't know like those old cylinders like a like a music box almost like that really tiny music box type music she was in a completely empty room alone doing some EVP recordings and she caught that that music and a lot of ghost seemed to be from that earlier time period from right around the Civil War you know from a lot of our investigations we've discovered that sites where Mass brutality or or something terrible happened tend to be places where these recording type hauntings happen so I wonder if that's kind of what happened here oh wow oh wow so is it like so there's the cowboy Shadow there's the Grim Reaper Shadow the evil Shadow and the happy Shadow it kind of seems like that it's like the inky Blinky stinky Pinky and Bob I'm not sure but there's a lot of different kinds of Shadows there's orbs everywhere much like a lot of the different Civil War sites that you've talked about orbs seem to be everywhere in this town well and I think probably shadow people are the most common thing that your normal everyday person is happen going to have to see yeah it's that kind of thing I guess it could be it could be parelia that thing where you see we tend have a tendency to see human faces and forms so it could be that but a lot of people report seeing the same human like a This Bar in a villa people see a shadow person clutching his chest and stumbling backwards as if he was shot or if he was drunk that's not parelia I mean if people are seeing the same thing over and over again right right it's kind of interesting and but you know I wouldn't want to be wandering around town at night and smell something stinky and then see a headless guy with a lantern crawling through the grass in a duster at me that would that' be pretty freaky I would be freaked out I'd be freaked out I'd be freaked out it's just it's a town that's just resonated with activity and and it seems to be you know the the area itself might have might be conducive to yeah activity yeah exactly but yeah so this is the Phantom bushwhacker he's one of those headless horsemen type myths that wanders around the town and searches for people to kill and murder I want to go there I want to find them a villa Missouri yeah carry a knife and walk around town avoid all the shadow people and uh if you smell some horrible stench look for the nearest apple tree and hope you find a head hanging there that you can cut free I am going to get on that [ __ ] right now news this isn't like oh God I don't want to hear current news let me pack this bong first because [ __ ] the current news this is good current news okay hold on I just one more I'm sorry maybe it's the strawana I don't know one more PSA I'm only gonna say one [ __ ] thing about the Supreme [ __ ] Court [ __ ] them man [ __ ] them and links in the show notes yeah for yeah yeah yeah anyway tell me some good news shelle so now this is a couple weeks old I forgot about it last time because I was high but I wanted to to Circle back to some news that happened in May for me locally what was the date I want to give you the exact date here so this was May 26th so May 26 2022 finally it took more than three centuries but the last Salem quote unquote which who hadn't officially been pardoned up to this point was pardoned yay yep Massachusetts lawmakers formally exonerated Elizabeth Johnson Jr clearing her name after 329 years for being convicted of Witchcraft in 1693 and sentenced to death at the height of the witch trials oh wow now she was never executed but neither was she officially pardoned like the other wrongly accused of which craft so lawmakers agreed to reconsider her case check this out this is why you just got to you got to love kids because they don't give a [ __ ] okay lawmakers agreed to reconsider her case last year after a curious eighth grade civics class in North Andover Massachusetts took up her cause and researched the legislative steps needed to clear her name that sounds like a really interesting civics class right that would have gotten me to pay attention so the statement the North Andover teacher whose students championed this legislation praised her her teenagers for taking on the long overlooked issue uh of justice for this wrongly convicted woman she was the last which accused like I said to be cleared these kids eighth graders they did it they made it happen how many eighth graders do you know that give us [ __ ] about civics class exactly exactly how fun and as we all know now in case case you're curious none of the women or men who were tried in Salem were actual witches I mean it's possible that one or two were maybe but for the most part I'm pretty sure they were just regular average people 20 people from Salem and neighboring towns were killed and hundreds others were accused during the frenzy of puran Injustice in 1692 stoked by Superstition fear disease and strangers scapegoating petty jealousy and gossipy [ __ ] greedy [ __ ] and gossipy [ __ ] yep 19 people were hanged and one man was crushed to death by rocks so A's [ __ ] Corey so two things to point out here a out of the 20 people that were convicted and and killed for witchcraft weren't witches and B none of them were actually burned you know there's whole burned at the Stak thing they weren't they were hung or crushed do you remember the poem never again the burning I do I do powerful [ __ ] man I do powerful you know you should link that [ __ ] in the bio today but one more thing I want to State about this and this this is where injustices happen and I think this is where this eighth grade class decided to take this on you want to know why she was the last witch after or last supposed witch after 329 years to not have been pardoned yet by the yeah why did it take so long for them to Pardon her what what was special about her that she didn't get a pardon because she didn't have any family to Advocate on her behalf so nobody actually nobody went to the government and was like pardon her so basically so these eighth graders picked her picked up her cause 329 years later so so all of the other folks that were accused of richcraft had descendants that kind of fought that CA on their behalf at one point or another and made it happen and this particular person did not and therefore the government just didn't do [ __ ] about it so because she never had children and no descendants to act on her behalf there she sat basically not exonerated so it kind of you know her story and struggle really kind of resonates in some issues that happen in this day and age you know while we've come a long way since the horrors of the witch trials women today of find their rights challenged and their concerns dismissed and we'll leave that at we'll leave that at what it is and again refer back to previous links in the bio whole different [ __ ] podcast but you know isn't it just shitty that the government can just kind of pass you by because nobody kind of speaks up for you like what the [ __ ] like what the [ __ ] yeah I mean they knew it was wrong why wouldn't they just exonerate her why did they have to leave it yeah you know it's wrong you exonerate every other person that was accused of Witchcraft you're like she didn't have any family so screw her whatever so leave it on the books like you said they knew it was wrong that's such [ __ ] such [ __ ] I'm so glad though what a cool thing for an eighth grade class to do these kids they made it happen where adults kind of dropped the ball for oh I don't know 329 years just saying this eth grade class like got it done and kudos to that teacher for coming up with such a good idea to help the kids learn about these things because it how better to get interested in what you're learning than to actually do something instead of just like memorizing facts and regurgitating [ __ ] on a homework you know you're actually doing something interesting getting involved I think that's so cool I think it's cool that the kids did it I just wish it didn't come to that yeah but I have one more news story oh what's your one more news story I love these news stories so this one was actually from just a couple days ago and you know how I just love crazy weird haunted [ __ ] this guy I'm not even sure where he's from I don't know we'll get to that so there's this guy he's like sleeping and he actually runs a page called really haunted a YouTube page called really haunted oh really yeah how haunted is it really haunted really really haunted really it's really haunted and kind of it makes you afid of ghosts and Technology colliding so this this is where you don't want ghosts and Technology to collide no no you don't so this dude runs a YouTube page really haunted and you know he has alleged paranormal Adventures that that he records within his house sounds like our type of guy so his whole house is super haunted too apparently apparently so the guy you know like any other Rando in 2022 has an of course he does woken up in the middle of the night by banging sounds and then all the sudden his Alexa device activates and starts talking to him it says she was my wife the Alexa said that yeah and he kind of jumps up and it's like who was your wife and the Alexa speaker says you took her from me and he's like I didn't take anyone who you know what he's like he didn't know what was going on and then Alexa says I found her here and then the speaker began laughing before the guy then tried to turn it off what do you say to that so the speaker began laughing yeah hold on that's so weird that's so creepy I mean there is I guess a feature where you can have Alexa dictate messages but like what the hell it was more about I found her here like what what you find here like what's going so there's actually a video of this and you can find it on YouTube like I said this guy what did I say the name of his thing was uh YouTube channel really haunted you need to check this [ __ ] out wow wow that sounds holy cow that sounds super creepy those Alexa things scare me I mean when they say random things you don't need an Alexa you have your whole life lived without an Alexa listeners you don't need one get if you have it get rid of it ah scary or remember it's just a ghost box it's a what a ghost box they are not why not why are they a ghost box why not oh my goodness well I guess if they're gonna start talking about you took their wife from them maybe it is a ghost box exactly that's what I'm saying if my Alexa started talking in the middle of the night I would [ __ ] bricks that would be terrible I don't even use the the Bixby on my phone oh no I don't use that either first of all I'd like to say before I start my story that I am proud of you you went first I always go first and you went first today so good job well thank you thank you very much I'm sure all of our listeners are surprised Lea went first today it happens hey it happens I've been on this kick lately I don't know why but I have been we're going to talk about another crypted oh okay what crypted do you have for us today so so I'm actually gonna we're we're kind of teetering on the same part of the country we kind of both went like Mid America this time around instead of like perfect total East Coast West Coast my story is coming out of little old Louisville Kentucky oh okay Louisville Kentucky I should say it's it's a it's a town called Fisherville that neighbors Louisville so basically right next to Louisville Kentucky in a town called Fisherville okay so there is What's called the pop lick monster the pop lick monster it's really I'm making this up really the popick monster how did it get that name we're getting there we're getting there okay some of the locals just call him the goat man that's not near as fun it's the pock monster the pock monster um so as you can tell kind of by the name um where we're headed and what type of crypted a pop licking one po licking one now this crazy one this crypted is part man part goat part sheep and it is reported to live beneath a railroad Trestle bridge over poplick Creek so that's why it's called popick Monster poplick Creek because it's it lives in a Trestle bridge over the pop Creek okay so numerous urban legends exist about this creature's Origins and the methods it employs to claim its victims I always find the Cryptids Lila that are going to kill you yeah you do you seem to like those I don't know they're not soft and fuzzy shell I don't care how many sheep they say are part of them they don't want you to pet them none of these Cryptids want you to Boop their noses I don't know why you like them they're murderous evil you want to hear something crazy about this particular crypted I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna tell you anyway I'm gonna tell you anyway so this particular Cryptid is like able to hypnotize people what a hypnotizing crypto right up your alley here's the crazy thing it can mimic voices once it hears your voice once it can mimic it well that's not fair that's got to be like cheating so like imagine if you're at this Trestle with a friend and then your friend disappears but it hurt its voice it'll start talking to you in your friend's voice and you just won't know and you'll be like no so it could like pretend to be you yeah that's not fair that's so un so it has the power to hypnotize and mimic voices and what it does cheating that is a cheating crypted right there I mean the best I can tell think of it as like the troll at the bridge he lives at this railroad Trestle and if he feels that you've trespassed what he'll he'll do is he'll use um he can e the creature can either use hypnosis or the voice mimicry uh to lure trespassers onto the Trestle to meet their death before an oncoming train so he lures them onto the tracks and then they they get smashed by the train because they're not paying attention oh gross that's terrible also there are other stories that he'll actually jump down from The Trestle onto the roofs of cars passing beneath it wouldn't that just freak you out if something jumped on your roof as you're going I would hate that I would hate that there's other legends that tell that it attacks its victims with a Blood Stained Axe and that the very sight of the creature is so unsettling that those who those who see it while walking across the High Trestle are driven to leap off it makes you want to LEAP to your death yeah oh my goodness now here is an interesting I I kinda I've always been interested in this kind of of tale so to say but kind of An Origin Legend like I said it was part man part goat part sheep but it seems to one of the origin stories so to say is that it was actually a circus freak that that vowed Revenge after being mistreated basically one of the stories is that it was it was a caged circus freak forced against its will and that it escaped after the Train derailed on The Trestle and that it basically made its home underneath the Trestle also another Twisted origin story yeah that one's sad yeah this origin story is commonly told by locals and they claim that it is reincarnate it's a reincarnated form of a farmer who sacrificed goats in exchange for satanic Powers just saying not cool not cool and that's it's never it's never a good uh swap guys I'm telling yeah the whole get satanic Powers it's like the crackerjack prize it's never how you think it's gonna be and generally a disappointment yeah yeah so as you can imagine as people have heard about this story because really there was only sightings from about the 70s up to present so this isn't like a 100y old myth or a 200 year old myth we're talking like the last 45 50 years basically there's because this is you know word has gotten out people have heard of this what have you people go there they want to meet the pope lick monster they want to get licked e there's actually been a number of deaths and accidents at The Trestle there is actually an8 foot fence around it and people scale it just to get on it so that they can try to find the public monster and whether it be maybe it is accidents who knows but maybe it is this popick monster and they're dying people are falling to their death from that TR well there's a big misconception that The Trestle abandoned and no longer used when actually it carries a major rail artery to Louisville they it gets used several times a day so it's easy for someone to be on it and I would imagine it's probably one of those that you're not going to necessarily if you're on the trestl and train's coming you're kind of screwed you know what I'm saying yeah yeah there's nowhere to go exactly and and some guy in 1988 made a 16-minute film called The Legend of the pop monster it was just like a short film he did shoot some scenes up there but then shot scenes in in a safer location the Northern suffk Railroad actually shut it down shut his movie Down because it was drawing people to this Trestle but see the thing is is that the town's people are kind of split you got some Town's people who are saying you know there's just a bunch of kids up there who got hit by a train and then you got the other Town's people saying that the PO monster lured them to their death essentially there has been video evidence of this you know I'm not saying it wasn't photoshopped or altered in any way but there is video um of this creature there is reason to believe that there's something freaky going on at this strle to be honest it sounds like there's something freaky going on there I mean for sure something's happening and yeah I mean there has been a couple people that have actually been able to kind of get away so to say before they've meet met their untimely death and one of those was in 1988 and the guy is named Mike he will not reveal his last name and he said that he had been up there with a bunch of friends they had just graduated high school and so probably what 18 19 years old and that he had gone off they were going over to The Trestle they wanted to see what they could see what have you and they had gone didn't see anything no hypnosis no mimicking voices no train nobody dies and they were getting ready to leave and he had kind of stepped off the path while his friends waited and he was kind of relieving himself we'll say okay and all of a sudden his friends kind of disappeared and he was kind of there by himself like they ran off and left him or like they they appeared to disappear they were I it didn't really say it was just they were no longer there they might have just continued on to the car without him okay all of a sudden while he was peeing he could feel on the back of his neck um the breath of an animal like an animal breathing that close that close that tall right there oh no no no no no that's a vulnerable moment it is a vulnerable moment you don't really want anyone to be breathing on the back of your neck while you're taking a piss he turns around there's nothing there so he thinks that is that good or bad both relieved and freaked out I don't even know so he kind of thinks that you know maybe he had had a little too much fun and was kind of freaked out because he was alone and was just like oh I must have been imagining things and then he started hearing footsteps behind him and he turned around and it's what he described as roughly a six foot tall part man part goat part sheep fully covered in fur walked upright on two legs kind of had more of the goat head more of a sheep's fur but the stature of a human looked right at him and then turned around and ran away well oh no way and this kid kind of questioned his own sanity for a little bit oh I bet he had seen a few mental health professionals the guy ain't crazy which is I think part of the reason why he didn't want to put out his last name because he kind of wanted to put the story out there but not be ridiculed because he says he claims he's not the type of person that necessarily believes in the ugly blies he felt that he got away basically with his life sounds like it wow that's super creepy and then there's also one one more Legend so like I said one of the one of the theories is that he was a circus freak that got away from a derailed train there's also a legend of a ghost train which is also cited on The Trestle so you know there's there's also again some theoretical Ghost Train That's popping by every now and again right in addition to the regular trains that are running through that's just wild you know a lot of kids go there as kind of I don't know bravery tests or whatever whatever yeah like that write a passage thing that kids do you know go to the scariest place in town yeah and and unfortunately every few years there there is a death reported um whether it's they fell from The Trestle to evade an oncoming train they were hit by a train just disappeared never to be seen like there's reason to think that you might want to you know tread lightly near this Trestle that's all I'm saying absolutely I mean if it especially if it can hypnotize you you know make you do things that you wouldn't normally do it's just crazy and the whole vibe just kind of makes people kind of pushes them in in negative directions yeah yeah and like there was one guy I I'll give you one kind of one more example of of something that happened one guy um actually described it as being me mentally crushed as far as being a a survivor of the pop monster mentally crushed so that's how he felt afterwards that's how he felt after so I guess this Trestle is about 90 feet above ground first of all so it's not like if you jumped off it you know the chances are you're gon to get kind of squished I would imagine so there was this guy from Ohio kind of a touristy guy his name was David KNE he hadn't heard a train coming he was he was checking it out he was touristy on The Trestle all of a sudden he turns around there's a train barreling down the hill towards him he had not heard the train train was at this point now about 40 feet in front of him and he still hadn't heard anything oh wow now this guy was about a a six foot two martial arts instructor you know regularly lifts weight um kind of shifted into survival mode and jumped over the side of the Trestle and kind of held on to the ledge with both arms and basically you know barely missed getting hit by the train and like the lost boys kind of thing yeah but kind of like dangling off the guy said he didn't think he would die he thought he was gonna get out of the way and and and be fine he had his girlfriend with him and he thought that his girlfriend would have jumped and kind of done the same thing um she never made it to the edge the train struck her and knocked her 80 feet to the ground oh wow oh no yeah that's awful yeah yeah she did not make it you know want you want to hear some [ __ ] and and I understand the law and don't trespass people it's not a good thing so the nor the Northfolk Southern Police charged this guy with misdemeanor trespassing on Railroad property so you know his girlfriend just dies and you know here here's a trespassing charge that's terrible he you know obviously would get some PTSD from it but come to find out I guess right before at when he was going to see you know a psychologist and stuff you know after the initial you know news reports this happens everybody hears about it you know story's over he goes to to counseling come to find out he remembers hearing voices right before the train so the theory is he feels that the pop lickm not only voice mimicked but maybe hypnotized in such a way that they didn't hear the train coming until it was too late so they couldn't even notice that it was happening and kind of kind of like they took the reaction time away so that you have no ability to react and no option but to die so she didn't even jump she just kind of stayed there did it sound like him like was it was it talking like him it didn't say the article didn't say in this article article was um that that I had found on this was from 2016 um so we're not talking like a ton of time ago I am gonna vote end the story that there is a crypted in the outskirts of Louisville definitely seems like there's something going on on that bridge certainly a lot of death happening there my my greatest feir people is plunging to my death so this might be one of those things where I might just I think I'm good I think I might skip this one this is not one I might to visit yeah that sounds like super super creepy so creepy sh so weird that we both did like the middle of the country tonight I've got a headless ghost crawling through the grass wreaking to high heaven who just wants to chop your head off and I got some Goatman who want you to plung your death off a damn rero Trestle yeah Middle America not a fun place to go right super creepy and scary I think I think the moral of the story is there's ghosts encrypted everywhere not just on coasts yeah no matter how small your town is or whether Route 66 has passed you by you probably have some sort of scary ass ghost or Phantom in your town you got something [ __ ] up too and you probably got good weed in your town too look at that probably I don't know I guess these uh these small towns can go either way they're either completely dry or they've got the most amazing Bud ever right right at least in my travels that's what I've found I think we'll wrap up our our our show tonight with a little uh Happy Ending I don't think that means what you think that means I was talking about a big fat Chillum full of weed oh that's the kind of hyy ending I am definitely here for all right big fat chilling full of weed I think it's time for a big fat ending smoke and a wrap it up and a we should for future episodes we should have our listeners like vote on how funny would that be we should have like a like a closing jingle that you and I like sing or something I I can't hold a tune I don't think anyone wants me to sing I mean that would be pretty scary it'll be fitting in the theme of scary things but other than that I can't I I can't sing you could sing a jingle we'll have we'll have to get a singer someone sing us a jingle yeah sing us give us a little tune to kind of close things out with anyway since we don't have a jingle I guess we'll
