welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your collagen and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick and this is part two of our three-part spellcrafting series for a witch's spell craft summer last week we talked about Spell components and correspondence and this episode it's all about how to write your own spells that get results and I'm sure she'll and I'm just so excited to be able to be on step to where we kind of talked about putting it all together because I look at this is the fun part this is like literally were you make the magic I think that that's something we'll dive into to it can be an actual craft so I'm really excited to talk about spellcrafting let's put it all together we got it and it says we got our ingredients we got our tools now it's the step where people tend to get very confused and they want to look up a spell on whatever get love in their life find a new job at Block in their life in a new Romance  so what do you do next after you found your ingredients that match your correspondences how do you write a spout what is a spell well I say there's so much I feel like a record in 10 and I think a lot of people feel that when you write a spell that it has to be some Whimsical rhyming fantasized when it can really just be like you no bring love to me bring me my desires bring me what I'm looking for this doesn't have to be stuff that they feel like it has to be this like 10 paragraph long rhyming thing and it doesn't spell is essentially a structure a scaffolding for you to raise your energy and direct it towards your intention that's all it is your intention written down yeah it's a framework for your intention for you to ask the universe or tell the universe this is what I desire  and this is the energy I'm putting towards it that's all it is it's a framework and the best way to start is what is my intention what do I want to get out of this and that's the first place that you should start when I think of the money so you know we both been doing this for quite some time and you know sometimes it's just a very simple I would like to attract money to me I would like to attract money to me I would like to attract money to me it's not even anything that has some a lot of verbiage to it it's all about the antenna in my intent is I would like to bring money to me so that's kind of the Mantra of my spell what you're talking about is a very simple Bare Bones spell what is it the kernel of every spell is literally just a statement of intent I want a new job I have a new job that could be your whole spell right there on the flip side I think sometimes when things are more part of a ritual something a little more formal something a little  or long-term then you may want to take the time to maybe write out something still doesn't necessarily have to be rhyming but you know you may want to write out like a paragraph or two of a spell to kind of layout long-term framework long-term intentions so I think really your goal or what you're doing the spell for is going to dictate how you want to put it together you know it's just going to be just something short and sweet and simple and compact or is this some grandiose long-term thing as Step 1 and that is defining what is this spell for you need to know what that is and I have two rules for your attention when you write down the goal of your spell number one don't be too vague and number two don't be too specific  that's it those are my two rules for when you write down what you want out of this fell well and the reason for that is because when you're asking the universe for something when you're directing your will to something you need to definitely have a goal you can't be too vague you can't say I want success because the universe then has a very wide leeway Grant success to you specific so you need to State realistic goals realistically you would like to have and stated in a present intention words are very powerful to your magical brain into the universe words have extreme power what you state is reality what you tell your subconscious is your reality so when you state your intention it really should be I have the best job that suits my  satisfies my life goals and makes me feel fulfilled agree 110% on all of that but you know in the same respect you don't want to be specific with things especially when it comes to romance and love you know you don't want to be I want Joe Blow from down the street who works at the Kwik-E-Mart third shift to be my next husband you want to be super specific because you know Joe Blow down at the gas station might be an abusive drunk in love that was meant for you you don't bring your perfect love to you and to your life if you have it you would say I have a relationship that is strong and loving feeling and list the qualities in that relationship that you need in a relationship to a person but just ate what you want out of a relationship I have I have a thing  with how you're saying I I sometimes have a hard time and I'm sure other people do too with the stating it like you already have it I don't know why that comes hard for me I don't know if it's a to Humble thing too presumptuous kind of thing it's hard for me to read these things in a I already have it context I always generally go more for the asking for contacts and you know how I could be doing it all wrong and have been all this time with the comfortability is that a word with being comfortable with speaking of it in the context of it having already happened and in spellcraft you need to be comfortable with what you're saying so obviously you've been doing spellcraft for a very long time and it's worked for you say I want this I would like this to come to me please give me this for me that feels too much like begging so by stating what you have in present tense  only do I feel that it makes the spell more powerful and more like I am in control of the energy I also know that there is psychology behind stating your intention as if you already have the way that your subconscious works is very literal and so I don't want my subconscious to always be asking I want my subconscious to feel like it has it and that gets into a manifestation principles as well as attraction which I don't know hundred percent agree but some of it works by putting out there that you already have this thing like you buy a blue car and now you see blue cars everywhere so when you tell yourself feels like you have this thing it's easier for it to draw it into your life so if it works for you by asking go with it there's absolutely nothing wrong with that but the reason why a lot of people say stated as if you have it is to keep your magical brain and  and working as if it has it because again subconscious is like a toddler your magical brain is extremely literal sometimes it's just I don't know why but I feel weird being presumptuous like that okay I'm going to skip ahead to the very end because this is a very similar thing at the end of your spell and we'll go over it again at the end I promise but at the end of your spell a lot of people will say so yes it will say so mote it be and that can feel really weird because it's very formal so mote it be some people don't even know what that means feel that way with that so that's just weird and that's okay everybody is magical working is going to be very individual but the reason I'm saying this is because a lot of people feel very  we are old is this weird so mote it be I have to stay at the end and really it just moat is Will so will it be you're basically just saying this is what's going to happen so you don't have to say that I do recommend that you say something the same thing repeatedly because your subconscious your magical brain is very literal is very toddler like it likes to know what to expect and that gives it that repetition that magical quality so you recommend you find a phrase that works to help you know when a spell is ended but it doesn't have to be so mote it be if that feels weird to you good I'm not the only strange one out there but you know  I do think that having some sort of something written down helps because especially for me what you know in the moment I might have forgotten something awesome I should have said and I remained I came up with something I forgot it is sometimes I feel like if I personally write something down that it almost gives it more validity maybe if I ask for it but if it feels like as a permanent thing I say something out loud but I also like to burn things and spells frequently and do you know when you're making your plan for your spell first step  Define your goal what do you want what is your intention and write that down then you should write down different items deities energies the things that we talked about in the first episode of this series what items are you going to gather it should be things that you have in stock what do you have in your kitchen what do you have in your altar in your ritual cupboard one thing I like to do in this particular part of the process is you know a lot of things have different correspondences different significances so I try to just focus on what does this particular thing mean to the spell I'm doing right now like I don't need to write down that 85 uses for bay leaves just the one that's applicable overburdened with kind of all the extras and you're focused on your intent  stress cuz I got a lot of things have multiple correspondences and you just want you just want to stick to the nitty-gritty what's your focus what's your what's your immediate intent and Scott and gather your ingredients but I have your attention and you have a bunch of Spell components that match that intention your next thing what kind of spell are you doing is this a one-and-done kind of spell is it a longer acting spell is a spell that you'll need to do over multiple days or multiple times what kind of spell are you doing and that should match your purpose if this is a I'm going to put someone in the freezer spell that's pretty much a one-and-done kind of thing gather your ingredients you do your spell you put them in the freezer or done is this going to be a jar spell a lot of people like to do the jar spells I only think you should jar up your magic if it needs to be seen or carried or used as a token or Talisman in some way and then there's what I like to color  spell that is something that I do some sort of spell work and either have it on my altar or if it's something burnable burn on my altar I don't know there's probably some bucket name for it but I just called an altar spell and this goes a lot back to like-for-like Magic sympathetic magic and the doctrine of signatures and we talked about in a quart in the correspondences episode because the type of spell you choose should correspond to intention you have exactly freezer spell quick done over with but if you're doing something where you want to draw energies into your life maybe you want to literally have a candle set on the far side of your altar and every day at a certain time you do a spell and you bring it one step closer and then one step closer and that represents drawing in that energy so what you do for your spouse should match what's your intention is what you want to get out of it  another way to look at it as representing the actions that you want to happen in the world by doing similar representative actions in yourself you are so hard to make sure that the type of spell you're intending to do you have the tools for for example if you're going to try to do a a candle spell you are going to need the candles of course whatever you need with what you've got at home it's a great excuse to come it is but I think that I think you you reminded me of something you know you can also do a spell with as much as we talked the whole episode on correspondences make sure I interjected you can do a spell without any sort of anything if it comes down to it just you and your friend all of this applies if you're not going to use any items that all you're going to write your intent you're still going to write your correspondences.  especially if you don't have Spell components to help you raise that energy and get into that land Spirits are other energies that you work with to help bring that and to bring that energy into your space so you can still do this without any items whatsoever so once you figure out what type of spell that's where you're really going to kind of get into the back injure your ingredients your correspondences so you know are you making an incense with the Arabs who gathered the stones are you meditating with a crystal grid take the components that you spell how are you going to use those coins in your spell so this is where you know I kind of take stock of this is what I picked this is my intent  makes my path forward you know what I have what my intention isn't going to utilize those what makes you feel which he and Powerful do you like burning things like she'll do you like candle magick do you like carving rooms in the candles or drawing sigils do you like chance do you like dancing what makes you feel witchy incorporate that with your components into the framework of your spell make that part of of the spell that you're doing and again make it match if you're asking for something you might want to put runes around a candle or write it on a bay leaf and burn it because that sends it to the universe maybe you've got a yarn in your braiding it intentions into your spell you know figure out how am I utilize these for my end  something fun like weaving you know weaving chords make rounds these are all grown types of spells that are like fun craft so to say those again should fit with your intention if you want to draw something into you maybe weaving or crown and thinking of pulling in that energy and holding it in that we've or those not that could be part of your spell and it matches with what your intention is and you know there's been times during certain because of the type of thing I was doing I would either braids braids my hair you know kind of tying those things together making those buying just so anything goes I think is the best part of spellcraft it's what I have and what do I want to do with it and you know I don't want to say there's no rules but there's no rules you know I have six herbs for Stones three coins  half a candle what am I doing with this actually sometimes part of the fun of it and you can absolutely take parts of spells that you see on Tik-Tok are you find on Reddit your Facebook or you've heard someone else talk about you can absolutely take those and modify that to fit in your spell episodes in the past do the tailor it to you and your situation your spell these exact words might have worked for someone else but that doesn't mean those exact words are going to resonate with you and your spelling and in your ingredients in you're working so take those things and then put your own personality and twisted magic into them so you've read what you're going to do what you're going to do with with and what the main part of your spell is going to be  now the next part that you need to decide is how are you going to raise energy to empower the spell and we'll talk more specifics on raising energy directing energy in the next episode just for now know that that will be part of your spell framework is how do I now raise energy to empower the spell that I just did you know I'm glad we're going to actually spend a whole different episode on that because I think this is another piece of the puzzle that people find be a little scary the raising energy part whether it's I don't know what to do I don't know how to do it I don't know if I'm doing it right so I'm I really think that'll be a good one for folks to tune into because  I think getting through the hurdle of your own mind of what you think is the hard part so what you think of the scary parts once you do it you're like oh you know this is where that part comes in and you can decide how you best likes to raise energy do you like to chant I I know you mentioned shall that you don't love reimy chance but I hate to say it there in a mazing way to raise energy no no no I like chance I just don't like rhythmic reading  in my mind that makes so much sense by the way chance powerful to your subconscious mind into your magical brain for an example of that just think of your favorite nursery rhyme  there is a reason why those stick with you your whole life actually I was just thinking about like nine different chance that we knew back in the 1990s that I'll just flooded in my mind all that yes and repetition is a huge reason why these hold power against your magical brain loves repetition so pick a type of raising energy that works for you maybe you like to chance maybe like to drum maybe you like to have sex or an orgasm maybe you like to dance maybe you like to run around maybe you just gather the energy with your arms in your will and directed however you choose to do that find one that works for you and then repeat it over and over again until it becomes second nature I just literally had the 12 year old boy go right through my head and I'll repeat it right that down on your framework raising energy and what your preferred method of raising that energy is then directed  and however you choose to Direct Energy directly to the universe to enact your will to basically I kind of put your spell in motion that right if you don't Empower your spell all you've basically done is is a kind of a nice little meditation for yourself explain this to my kids that raising energy was like getting the rocket ready for liftoff and then directing it was like it lifting off and that's you know that is you know I love to have my weird analogies but that's a good one you know you have to kind of build up all of that that fuel to get it off into the universe you can wrap that into other parts of the spell it the raising energy doesn't have to be separate from the crafting that you're doing maybe you could be doing your chant while you're putting all of your incense ingredients together and directing and raising the energy into those ingredients while you're asking them for their  even your spouse they can all be happening at the same time if you choose or they can all be separate parts you know I've I've done things before way I've made incense blend is a part of a spell and kind of did I won't I won't say it right now but did a chance that we are both very familiar with while mixing my little incense food in Mexico and everybody has their own way but again as long as whatever way works best for you is the right way and the last thing that you should write down on your framework is how are you going to end your spell how are you going to ground the energy that's left and come back to an equilibrium and how are you going to close and this is back to that phrase you can choose a phrase like so mote it be or you can choose you know by my will is one that I like to stay cuz it feels powerful some  closing remarks over but I like to have a formal phrase it should be easy and it should be easy to remember because of the more you do it the more second nature it becomes and you'll be able to close out a spell and ground just by saying your phrase it'll become that easy for you like she'll talk about sometimes raising energy sometimes you can just do that just feel that energy rush into you it's because we've done it so often by Raze energy for spells so many times that is second nature now you can just feel it gather it and know that it's ready to direct at a moment's notice and it's because you do the same things over and over again no Layla one of the things I remember the most about doing ritual during this stuff all over everywhere  don't care she's walking in mud and in the Snow Well yeah if I have socks on but yeah just something simple and but I just had him call me I might have your feet on the ground like that physical literal grounding is what I always remember you perfectly without his Pomp and Circumstance on the ground do you remember in our community after a large working after a large ritual what they would very often do okay so in our old Community we had people that were brand-new we very often had people that that was  very first time they have ever been to a real school and then we had people who had been at their whole entire lives decades and decades and decades so we had people on all at so things were kept pretty literal a lot of times in these rituals and what I remember very clearly is at the end of every ritual they would literally have people after the cone of power was raised and the circle was released people would literally dropped to all fours or lay down on the ground and we would talk about letting that energy ground literally into the Earth you know come back to an equilibrium there's like one of my favorite and so you would literally acted out you yourself would go down to the ground as you felt this energy release into the Earth and come back to a nice balance and it was just a very nice physical way literal representation and so you can do that you can walk outside in your bare feet go touch grass it's good for you or you can do  in a representational way whatever works for you you know if you're envisioning a waterfall going down over you and down into the ground to bring you back to Center but whatever you need to do it again we'll talk about this more next episode but whatever you need to do to release any excess energy and come back to a balanced equilibrium episode okay you guys are going to have to be in suspense till next week so now you've got your framework you've written it all down hopefully in your book of shadows now it's time to actually do the spell this is the fun part when you begin your spousal I feel but it's best to start by creating Sacred Space and whatever way works for you and this is also another part that I think should be ritualize but should be the same as much as possible so that your magical brain knows so it's Bell time it's ritual time you know it has that trigger like Pavlov's dog you've trained your brain to know when it's time to do so  so should always be the same my my anal retentive self back in the day I never did spell work without casting a circle I don't know why I felt like I needed to that's what we were taught that you create Sacred Space and to create that Sacred Space Wherever You Are You cast The Circle I just I never did a spell it out casting a circle whereas I would say that's necessarily the case now but it's because I can do it so second nature and right off the cuff and you know 30 years ago I couldn't get into Alpha and 1.2 seconds now I can't you know so I'm in a different place I don't think either is right or wrong but I do think that if you are newer there's something to be said for doing that because it creates a framework you know like we always say  and do these things just in an instant as second nature on your brain to know when it's time to do magic and that will allow you to get into that magical space faster and more powerfully every time so set your space do you always do ritual in front of an alter do you always Do It Outdoors but take a space that makes you feel magical and set it up to be even more magical and even more focused on whatever your intent is change the colors change the sense like we said in the last episode from you know Mr allister Crowley everything should put the magician's mind towards your intent after space vulture and started from scratch the altar matched or set up a brand-new altar in a different spot whatever works best if you're going to be doing love magic Romance  magic with your partner maybe you want to go set up an ulcer on your bed or on your nightstand you know that kind of thing so I got your space wherever it happens to fit best for your spell if space is lacking you know use what you got that's fine. Yeah and if you're sitting on your couch you know put some candles there maybe put a throw blanket or pillow that are in the colors that match with your intent you can still set your space even if you don't have a full-on witchy office so after you such a space maybe you've cast your circle another thing we used to do that we don't do anymore so much is I really felt I needed a representation of every element and I still kind of do that but it's not as hard and fast as it used to be you know I still kind of do that to not going to lie that goes right back to the whole week in DNA thing is freakish about what I have like if I don't have a feather in the east  but yeah I know I'm totally with you on the elemental representation because when you're asking the universe asking all the elements I look at it and you know that I look at the universe is made of all these elements I'm asking I'm asking everybody let's our framework are magical system tends to DNA your magical system might be very different maybe you're coming from a very Celtic framework of folk magic or root work or Greek or whatever your magical system is it might look different so this is where you're going to set things up to match what your system looks like how do you get into magical space this is where you're going to start to do that set your magical space however that works for you and then you're going to introduce the idea of a spell this is so now you're in your magical space and go down your list State your intention this is why I'm  here and start to ask your items or bring in your items to that spell in whatever way you've chosen so now you bring these in and now you're saying your words and your doing the actions that you've chosen in your framework you know you basically you kind of make this quote on quote list prior and now that you've got your list gathered now you're going to start doing the things are you okay now it's time to talk to the you know I have a conversation about your intentions with them and then burn them or you know prior to or you just light it up in symbols what are you doing with your candles are you going to start or what are you doing with the Stones it's time to do that so now is the time to act on all of the points on your list most spells are based around sympathetic magic just like correspondence  the actions that you perform in your spell are a symbolic representation of what you want to happen in the world what your intention is so use your imagination and your intuition to create a spell that looks like what you want a symbolic act you want romance your spell could be you and anointing yourself with sensual oils while changing a love poem you know when I make it back in and gestures to call in a lover you want prophetic streams create a pillow you don't get it sweet dreams pillows and fill it with streaming and all your tools your action should all be and everything should work together for like a recipe or play everything should work together and Slow and Low together nicely and it's okay if you need to stop and look at your notes it's okay if you need to grab a book I've literally done it with the notes right there before and I mean  he talked in a long time ago either even recently I've done it with the notes right there do I like it better and do I feel more powerful like the spell feels better if I'm able to kind of get into a flow and just let it work yes but can I still make it work if I have to kind of stopped that magical energy and losing so I feel like once you have done all these things to you know like you said it's kind of your left with now you raise your energy you ground your energy then you can wrap it up with that so thank the items that you asked and thank the items that you worked with thank the deities or energies that you brought beer grateful which everybody know that's good job well done everybody thanks team wrap that up and then and you're still there and again repetition and in doing these things in a in a way  is familiar can build that power and can make it so much easier for you to slip into magical space and do the Spells and I think that that's where a lot of the meditative work and you know store strike me down the journaling comes into play one thing I do like this I like those spells that are like you know like a seven-day spell our 5-day spell cuz I feel like that gives you time to create that repetitiveness but when it comes to doing things over and over again everybody wants to be that head witch in the forest that has been doing this for 100 years you know what the hedgewitch in the forested practice practice practice practice field silly in the beginning Until you realize that practice is getting you somewhere  practice and that's because you do an awful lot of it a lot of what you feel you want and need create your framework follow your framework raise the energy send you can't go wrong I don't think the basis of a lot of spells comes down to correspond how can you use your imagination to best represent with the items that you have the goal that you want to achieve you use what you have and you can draw correspondences between pretty much anything so no matter what you have you can find a correspondence probably that works for you but that also works for the steps of your spell the reason why that candle cord-cutting spell is so popular is because somebody came up with the idea that two people cutting a cord and having the Flames looks like toucan  leather cord wrapped around you know so just come up with what you want to do and think of a way to represent that visually with the things that you have and you know again I want to just make sure we touch on the fact that if you have nothing your spell can be equally as effective maybe all you have is you and your mind and your voice you can call in the elements call India calling the elements of the powers of financial gain or the powers of love the powers of peace and serenity and in used to the idea of your spouse to then turn back to the universe so as much as all the corresponding tools and and stuff is all wonderful and pretty and smelly good if you have nothing you do always have your voice in your intention it's just kind of hard the only thing that the thing to do for you is help get you into the match  space easier they help you to raise the proper energy easier they lend their energy to your working so you don't need them you just can make it a lot easier for you that's why I love Stones cuz I feel the MMA energy like so easily compared to other things really start to have energies of their own I was almost going to say their own personality but kind and so sometimes items that you work with feelings and correspondences that might vary wildly from anything else that you know or understand but that's a little different will have to chat on a different episode about how my malachite definitely has a mind of its own yeah and I have a Tarot deck they hated me and everyone actually know there was one person that likes I remember you gave it to that person that's true you're exactly right I did  you were doing those workshops at universities yeah I would actually love to hate you to go to the young person that went to Binghamton back in 1999 fish dish that was given it to her if you're listening updates on the status of you and the decks relationship we need to allow that would be really really funny and I doubt it would ever happen but that wasn't really funny I was just seeing if you got any mail  sure and I'll believe you anyway all right so next episode next week we will doing our third and final episode in the series on raising energy how do you raise energy to power spells what's a cone of power we're going to need to talk about this is absolutely so thank you so much for listening to this episode of back on the broomstick please give us some like some stars and reviews it really helps the show that helps people find us a little witches well I think I need to go Journal Layla I mean write in my book of shadows next episode so let's talk about raising energy part 3 will see you there being wise be Wicked and keep it with she folks
