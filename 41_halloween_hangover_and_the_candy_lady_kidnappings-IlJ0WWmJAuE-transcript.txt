it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 41 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two best friends who found themselves living all the way across the country from each other hang out and tell each other frightfully paranormal Tales while smoking as much Crystal coated ganja as they can representing the Western half of the USA I'm Leila I am just I'm really high today wait I'm shell but I'm high today and this is different from every other day how it's not but here on the East Coast there's like this just this Vibe this Vibe and it it it melds with my weed what kind of vibe like a like a fall crisp get out and do things Vibe you're sounding kind of sleepy there is something when you live in Salem there's something called the Halloween hangover I believe it and that shit's real man that shit's real real have have the crowds died down at all or is it still absolute bedum out there man I haven't left the house I don't blame you one dayit I haven't left the house I do need to leave the house tomorrow but yeah thus far I'm recovering I'm recovering yeah well there was certainly a lot of spooky festivities going on you and I partook of quite a few of them and then there was the big sa Halloween weekend thing you know it it was crazy I've heard some initial reports of of 250 plus thousand people just on sin yeah wow yeah and you know here's something interesting in years past when I've been here the costumes are far and wide and and they I can't even begin to give you an idea of of the types of costumes because there was so many this year no this year the vibe was if you were wearing black that was that was the thing there wasn't really any costume except okay I will say Sanderson sister overload but other than the Sanderson sisters there wasn't really a lot of costumes this year everybody was wearing black everybody was wearing witch hats but like there wasn't like the costumes like you used to see like I remember last year seeing like Freddy Krueger's and Michael Myers and Jason's and clowns and you name it vampires this year everybody just wore black I don't know it was weird I wonder if everyone's just kind of feeling more the need for protection and less the need to be exuberant and costumed I don't know I don't know but it it almost felt more witchy oh okay that sounds interesting well unfortunately I was not there for sa itself in the past they have had public rituals public sa celebrations were there any Circle celebrations out there there was at the Commons at 5:00 p.m there was a a public Circle I did not go I had my little grandson visiting from out of town a little witchling himself such a doll so I I did not partake but they did have a a public thing down in the common but I think what's interesting and I think what may have switched the vibe kind of you know we've had two years of being locked inside more or less and no matter where you're from or or or what have you we've all had that same experience I think a lot of people have found witchcraft in the last two to three years it does seem like there is an explosion it's all over Tik tock It's All Over YouTube it everywhere and I think that a lot of people that have come into witchcraft recently have come into wiah who've come into paganism in in the last few years that was kind of the vibe of people like a lot of witches in the under 30 category oh I love it a lot of new witches a lot of yes you know younger people gen Z coming into it that was the vibe that's been the vibe for for at least the last week or two it just seems like these are all people that are coming to find their MCA I guess fantastic that's the only way I can describe it people weren't here to celebrate Halloween the commercial Halloween as they have been in past years people were here to find their Mecca I feel like they were there for sa they were there for the Witchcraft for the for the magic of it yeah yeah and you know that that was another reason I I really had no interest in going to the ritual this year because there's a couple hundred thousand people like what the what the what the heck I'm a little too much of a Hermit for that type of crowd yeah that's hard that's difficult I I will admit when I first went I don't know how many tens of thousands but it wasn't that many I went to a ritual on the commons and it was freaking amazing that's a lot of people it is a lot of people but for me again I was looking for my Mecca at that time I didn't know any other witches I hadn't met you yet I hadn't met the community that I worked with I I didn't have a Coven I learned everything I knew from books and from online and from what little like information I could gather so when I went to sin at Salem the commercial Halloween was the furthest thing from my mind all I could think of was the the magic of the witches New Year and finding other people of of magic and power and witches and just being among them it was amazing that seemed to be the majority of in my opinion that the tourists this this go around they were looking more for the spiritual aspect instead of the party aspect I guess fabulous I think that's really great so yeah I know it was it was a great time oh my God the weather holy crap for folks that are living on the East Coast this was amazing this is not what we're used to remember Leila that that one s we went camping where we would do our community rituals and we woke up to like six inches of snow outside of our time yes this was like 60 degrees man polar opposite it was definitely a good night for magic it was a good night for trick-or treating it was a good night for everything Ah that's fabulous now did you happen to do any ritual personal ritual for sa yourself or um I just was able to do something real quick um just kind of more some ancestor offering um I did have visitors so I didn't have my full freedom of time and space um but I had a little ancestor alar up and talked with my child about Grandparents past and that's a lovely way to spend the evening and then I outside offered a little weed to to the ancestors yeah I have to say that a nugget of weed is always on my ancestor altar too one of my not my ancestor but uh in my husband's family very near and dear to us I always leave some weed on the Altar for him on sa and uh so I set up my mute supper with a plate offering for the ancestors and our beloved dead and then I took that outside to a little Stone altar that I have there and cut an apple lengthwise so it had the star and poured out some little bit of alcohol offering and had a candle and a nice little ritual out back at midnight so that was really nice well I was I was able to take my grandson outside and I think he saw the moon I pointed at it he was looking in that direction but he's a little baby who knows oh he's a little witchling you know he saw the moon we we talked about the moon and we talked about the leaves and he we tried to talk to him about his little ancestors and he giggled and then it was so cute you know they say that they say that kids see and hear things that adults don't always This Little Child let me tell you he was talking to somebody and somebody was going all around the room cuz he was just watching something on the ceiling and there was nothing there I would not be surprised if it wasn't your grandfather I know and that's what I was thinking at the time I'm like I know who he's talking to there's any spirit that stays with you whether I don't know if he's as apparent to you anymore does he seem to be less and less in your life or does he kind of come and go but his energy doesn't seem to be as strong as definitely less and less absolutely less and less I kind of I don't know I think back in the day when I know you had seen him a lot especially I think I had a lot more turmoil in my life and he would show up when there was turmoil and he would back off when there wasn't and I just think maybe the the the fewer and farer between visits maybe correlate with he would show up at termoil and I have a less [ __ ] up life now makes absolute sense I I totally that I think I you know we like to feel our connectedness yeah we like to feel the our family the people who have our backs to be around us when we need that energy so it makes sense that he'd be there at those times but you know I I think that one thing we all sometimes do is spend s and almost begging them back come talk to me come talk to me and then you have that how come this one didn't show up or weren't they listening and I think that sometimes that makes s and sad for people because they kind of try to reach out it's like calling and they don't answer sure trying to make a connection and for whatever reason you can't that can be very sad very lonely and I think that's a misconception um people think that because it is when the veil is the thinnest that that's like a guaranteed connection and it's not right right and just because it's later in the year I mean the veil is still very thin right now and it hasn't like slammed shut or anything right you know so you can still continue to try that but there's nothing to say that four months from now you couldn't again try to contact your beloved dead and you don't have to right now and it's not impossible later right right so do you have any spooky stories I don't I don't know I think I'm spooked out this be this this whole draining Salem month of people and spookiness and ghosts for the love of God give the people something Leila well I'm going to uh pack another bowl of my uh homegrown weed here now that I'm back with my stash and can uh fill a little Bowl here I got some nice purple straw Nana going so I got this stuff it's new I'm trying it it's called Boo Berry and it was very it was very Halloween sounding and you know who doesn't love blueberry cereal so I thought i' give it a go let me tell you this [ __ ] [ __ ] you up folks if you can't tell in my voice this stuff is like I think it's like melled into the bed stuff because I'm definitely more subdued than usual awesome and I love the name blueberry well like I said I got it the week of Halloween how could I not get it exactly is it sweet let you know let me give it a sniff I don't even know you're so high you don't remember what it tasted like here's one thing if you are G to make weeds so hard to open don't oh does it have a child safety cap yeah you know very hoppy okay so not so much sweet that kind of hoppy green yeah that's the best way I can call it well I can tell by your face and how relaxed you look that you are definitely really high and that's a good thing yeah I have a spooky kind of Halloweeny story for you sh oh what you got what you got I have an urban legend out of Texas about the candy lady ooh oh oh I'm glad this is post Halloween because I just ate a bunch of candy yeah she's super super creepy it all starts in a little town outside of Dallas Texas some reports put it outside of Austin but I couldn't find a name for the town all just said it was a small rural town in the early 1900s so in this little town parents woke up one day and discovered that their son wasn't in his bed Not only was he not in his bed but it looked like the bed hadn't even been slept in it was perfectly made and the window was open weird and their young son was nowhere to be found somewhere between 8 and 10 depending on who's telling the story so these parents were distraught this was their only child he was doted on adored and he loved his parents by all accounts he was a very happy child no no reason to run away but of course this was dismissed as a runaway and the parents tried everything they could to get the town's people the sheriff anyone to listen to them their son would not run away but no one would listen there was no body no signs of Foul Play and it just looked like he'd open the window after going to bed that night and disappeared so they kind of closed the case and the parents just got more and more upset as the days went on until about a week later another child disappeared from their bed after putting their daughter their middle child to bed uh the next morning these parents woke up and when she didn't come down from breakfast went to her room and discovered that her bed had not been slept in and her window was open oh my God oh my God now this was taken a little bit more seriously because you know girls in the early 1900s don't run away or something and you know being the second child that had disappeared under the same circumstances it seems a little more mysterious you know a little more urgent this time but again blame the witches blame the witches they didn't actually but which is surprising shocking seriously they searched the town they search the nearby woods they could find no trace of this child and no signs of Foul Play so now the whole town is kind of on edge and of course they're telling the children to be home by dark and they're checking on their kids in the middle of the night everything seemed to die down until another child went missing oh jeez quickly after that two more children went missing on the same day two best friends two boys went out to play and never came back and again no fou Play No bodies no nothing they couldn't find any reason why these children were disappearing so shortly after the two children disappeared on the same day small group of remaining children in the town started telling their parents that they'd been finding candy on their window sills in the morning after waking up oh and the candy had started appearing on their window sills shortly before the first boy disappeared oh jeez oh jeez they said that inside the candy rappers sometimes would be a note and occasionally the note would say come outside and play with me oh God and the notes were always signed the candy lady the children hadn't said anything about the candy because at first they hadn't realized that it was connected in any way and kids love candy who's going to you know interrupt a source of free candy right I mean I don't know it sounds creepy yeah the sister of one of the last two boys that one of the two boys that went missing on the same day his sister is one of the biggest reasons why the children came forward because she said her brother had been getting candy and the day before he disappeared he had gotten a note in the candy that said come outside and play with me and her brother had said he was going to go find the candy lady with his friend who had also gotten candy and that was the last that she had seen him oh my God why does this like remind me of it and going to the the water oh my God no right well it's the same that childhood good thing right a clown is supposed to be a good thing of childhood a happy memory candy is supposed to be good and a happy memory the candy lady should be a nice childhood thing but in both of those stories it's very Twisted so the town of course the the sheriff's department the local police and the town are are very involved now very invested in trying to find this candy lady and to see if they can figure out what happens but for a little while at least to their knowledge no children get any candy and no one goes missing and there's one police officer in particular is determined to find out what happened and he has been questioning the families of these missing children and then one night candy starts appearing again oh [ __ ] no one sees anyone come or go and everyone's on high alert does anyone eat the candy yes the children have all been eating the candy from the very beginning okay now when the C candy shows up they give it to their parents and the parents of course suspect that this candy has probably been poisoned or that something has it's been drugged in some way they check out the candy and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it no needles in it no poison no drugs no nothing it's just candy in a plain rapper no notes and then a farmer walking his field finds what looks to be a ball of wrapped candy on the ground weird yeah just kind of out there on the road next to his field so when he picks up the wrapped candy he discovers it's not candy it's teeth oh my God inside are children's teeth and some of them have cavities you know some of them are very rotten and some of them are in very good shape but it's a whole bunch of small children's teeth oh my God so there's no more clues unfortunately of course the town is completely freaked out at this point and then this police officer that was investigating it also goes missing right his body was found the next day in a ditch not too far from where the candy wrapper with the teeth in it was found and his eyes had been stabbed with forks oh my god there were no visible marks on his body and his pockets were stuffed over full with candy the same kind of candy that had been left on the children's window sills then when they did the autopsy it was discovered that he had died of poisoning not Forks in his eyes not Forks in his eyes I don't know the forks in his eyes seems like a really weird detail but the thought is that maybe he had gotten a little too close and that this was a warning to kind of stay away yeah but it seems like the person's only leaving candy and not doing anything except leaving a bag of teeth like I haven't seen no harm no fall yet well they kidnapped all the kids and they never came back you don't know that that's true you don't know that for sure you don't know that for sure no more kidnappings happen for a couple of years and then the candy started showing up again and a couple more kids went missing a [ __ ] and then nothing happened they were never seen never found and they it seems to resurface you know every few decades oh so it can't be one person not anymore the legend says that they're being kidnapped by the candy lady who takes them somewhere pulls out all their teeth and then leaves them to die you're not going to die your teeth being pulled out I don't know well I don't know I don't know she maybe she poisons them I'm not sure maybe she tortures them to death but kidnaps them with candy and pulls out all their teeth what a [ __ ] right so although it seems to have lasted since the early 1900 so obviously can't be a mortal candy lady there is kind of a truth to this tale Oh Boy tell tell tell there is an origin story and even better it involves an asylum o it always does right I know how you love an asylum and do the asylum in Texas I believe it's the north Texas insane asylum what was this like the dental assistant at the Asylum like what that would be a good guess but no so this urban legend actually starts with a woman named Clara Clara crane was a young woman in the 1800s who moved to Texas and met an much older man that she became involved involved with and married Clara married Leonard Gilbert crane who was a good 16 years her senior and he was a very wealthy Farm owner in Ellis County Texas so she marries Leonard and they have an okay marriage uh she mainly married him for money which was the rumor and he married her because he wanted children that's kind of what it was back then to be honest yeah doesn't seem to really be any particular bad thing about their marriage other than the big age Gap but I guess that was kind of then very soon after getting married Clara finds herself pregnant and she gives birth to a healthy baby girl that they named Marcella and Clara unfortunately living in this Farm on the outskirts of town is kind of lonely you know and her husband's much older than her they don't have a lot in common and he's very busy with the farm and he's kind of a drunk from all accounts so she busies herself with Marcela and they are very very close and she calls her daughter Marcy so one day Leonard decided to take little Marcy with him as he goes about his chores on the farm unfortunately he was wasted drunk and he wasn't paying attention to little Marcy and there's an unspecified accident there's a newspaper article about it but they don't exactly say what accident caused Marcel's death just that the poor little 5-year-old girl was killed while under her father but he was probably drinking exactly Clara was distraught with grief completely beside herself and blamed her husband there was an investigation and they found no wrongdoing they said it was just an unavoidable accident but Clara knew her husband was drunk and knew that he was not the best father on on the best of days so she kind of harbored a grudge over the next couple years uh the couple just got more and more aranged and they fought more and more often by some accounts in the town got a little crazy she obviously had some form of PTSD or over the grief of her daughter which is I don't blame her Jesus completely understandable but her husband isn't any way caring or understanding or or helped take care of her he's just moved on he's just totally moved on from it and so she kind of holds a grudge and starts to form a plan of Revenge and then one day she made her husband his favorite candy she made him some caramels unbeknownst to him she'd laced them with por poison oh Jesus of course she did of course she did so she fed her husband his favorite caramel candy and he promptly died and according to the newspaper article this was found when a neighbor the next day came to the house and found Clara outside trying to build a very large fire and she seemed to be very agitated the newspaper says quote in a shaken and frenzied state so the neighbor gets the sheriff to come out and to see what's going on when the sheriff's deputy Fred Springer got to her home Clara actually started attacking him and became physically violent and they had to restrain her and take her into custody oh wow after they restrained her that's when they found the body of her husband in the house and determined that he had been poisoned to death according to the newspaper she faced first-degree murder charges and she did go to trial and was found uh Not Guilty by reason of insanity and they put her in the the North Texas insane asylum also called the Terrell hospital and she stayed there for several years however the north Texas Lunatic Asylum had some budget problems don't they all they needed to cut down on the population and so Clara was told that she would be getting out now Clara didn't really get any better while she was at the hospital according to the doctors and nurses she spent most of her time in her room talking to herself and she had even fashioned a doll out of bed sheets and named it Marcy oh jeez she spent most of her days playing with her doll Marcy and talking to it so when she found out that she was able to leave she wrote a letter to her sister and in the letter she says dearest Aggie I am elated I have been informed by Dr Matthews that Marcy and I will be returning home in less than 3 weeks as you can imagine Marcy can barely contain her excitement every night she asks is tomorrow the day when we go home mother very soon I will be able to tell her yes that tells you a little bit of what her State of Mind was yeah yeah so she was released in 1899 due to overcrowding of the hospital she was never seen or heard from again not even from the sister not even from the sister oh boy she went nut to cucko and then in 1903 the first child that went missing in that little town outside of Dallas was less than a mile from her Old Farm oh yeah oh that's horrible so the urban legend goes Claire crane is the candy lady and she is somehow taking her revenge and trying to kidnap all these children and for whatever reason pulling out all their teeth they've never found any of the bodies of these children just that pile of teeth in a candy wrapper that's so crazy that's so crazy so that's it that's like actually kind of spooky right that's kind of a creepy tale out of Texas and I thought that was very fitting the candy lady nice urban legend for this time of year absolutely I mean you you you're good at these like perfectly timed stories and that was a perfectly timed story I try I do try yeah absolutely well I love them how fun I mean I remember you talking about the um the time we did Sin at community and everyone told ghost stories and I don't know maybe that kind of bubbled up in my subconscious when we had the idea to do this podcast but how fun is it to tell spooky stories I mean it's a great way to connect and honestly I think that even some of the urban legends have truth to them so I love spooky stories because yeah there might be a million white ladies out there but there's some truth to each story right right so yeah they might have been turned into something Fantastical but there's a root of Truth to each ghost story absolutely now this particular story I I saw a little bit of information online I also have relatives in Texas who have heard of this urban legend and they provided quite a bit of the information for this particular tale as well oh how cool right how neat so there's the true story of claric crane and you can find newspaper articles of her and the north Texas insane asylum did exist and it is the place I'm going to cover at a later time and see if there's any other paranormal tales that come of it nice I'm not exactly sold on the whole idea of a a creepy lady leaving candy on the window sills and kidnapping children for decades but it certainly makes for you know it could be a variation of the boogeyman tale that parents told their children you know don't accept candy from strangers kind of thing but there could also be truth to it and we really don't have enough substantial evidence either way that's right we know at least that she killed her husband with caramel right now now I know everybody's sitting there wiping their tears because poor poor shell just doesn't have a spook for you tonight but next week I'm going all out there's been recently a bunch of UFO cases released and I'm gonna talk about some UFO stuff next week
