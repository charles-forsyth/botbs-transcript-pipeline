welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and in this episode we'll be talking about candle magic in particular a handful of candle spells that every which should have in their grimoire I love fire and I'm sh so welcome we're gonna chat about really some things you need to know things that you really should kind of have in your back pocket and candle magic is a very accessible type of magic candles themselves as we talked about in our old episode which I'll link in the description contain all of the elements that you need for a spell you've got air fire water and Earth all in one neat little container and everyone loves candles people have candles in their house all the time so if you're a witch that's kind of undercover candles can be an easy way for you to do spells that no one will know what you're doing now the first thing I want to I want to touch on real quick you said there are four elements involved in the whole candle thing yeah and for folks that are like where does water and Earth fit into a candle give us some Deets on that sure air is obviously when you light the candle it displaces air it also uses oxygen to burn the fire you have fire when you light the wick and that burning part of it then with the water is the liquid wax as the wax melts you have that liquid form and Earth is the candle and the candle wick so you have all of the elements wrapped up into little thing right there because it contains all the elements that's why sometimes it's all you need for a spell is to light a candle and by candle you can use a big jar candle a Yankee Candle a votive candle or a birthday candle you know if you have a spell where you have to burn the candle in its entirety I highly recommend birthday candles I love those or even you know chime candles usually don't take too long to burn those are the little ones that are like 3 4 in tall less than 5 Ines usually and they burn pretty fast but if you want a super fast burning one birthday candles are amazing my Gemini mind I really need you know the birthday let's do this and be done yeah but I like those if you have like a weekl long spell or like a money spell I like those you know fore they're good some spells like one of the spells that we're going to talk about today takes time you burn it every night for seven nights or the spell might call for burning it for three nights or five nights so you'll want a bigger candle for that and although all you need is the candle you can also add just a few simple things like oils and herbs to the candle to make your spell that much more potent and that's one of the parts of candle magic that I really enjoy I've always loved dressing candles for a spell now let's talk about that for a real quick minute dressing Candles now we are not talk in your doll clothes here although you know whatever I have done I'm not sure about you but I have done a combination of taking a little bit of the of different oils depending on you know the spell so that kind of depends on what oil I use I kind of like the grape seed the most but I will put different loose herbs and mix that in the oil and then kind of dress that with both the oil and the herb oh yeah if I'm going to do a candle spell you and just light the candle but it's way more it's way more fun to go all out take your candle and put your intention into it in multiple ways by energetically by holding it and then thinking or speaking your intention to that candle pushing your energy into it and also by taking a sharp object like I have this little tiny knife and I love to use that to carve into my candle either in runes or in sigils I'll draw symbols or write names or in tensions into the candle and then you take your oil you can like shell uses a a plain grape seed oil you can use any you know hemp seed oil that you like or you can take maybe a blessing oil that you have created for that specific intent and if you're invoking something you would rub the candle from the wick to this to the base to pull something into you and you anoint it with that oil if you're banishing something or you're trying to get rid of something you would anoint the oil from the base to the wick sometimes if you're looking for balance you'll go from the center outward or outward in if you're trying to draw energy into you so the way that you put that oil on can mean something as well because I I kind of do a oil and Herb mixture I actually mix the herb with the oil like on a a plate or or like a flat dish and then on the plate I either do it docile or winders shins roll it so you know rolling it winders shins depending on the spell you you know it really depends so I just do it rolling instead of oh okay see I put the oil on the can so I I carve the candle and then I put the oil on and then I will take my herbs and grind them really fine I like to have a super fine grind oh see I do the chunk I like chunky and then I'll put it on my charging plate and then I'll roll the candle towards me in the herbs if I'm trying to bring energy into me and I roll it away from me to coat it in the herbs if it's something I'm trying to project out so basically the same thing except I do the oil and Herb together and you do them separate yep and actually there's no wrong way to do that whatever works for you you don't even have to do all three of those you know that would be to supercharge a candle you seriously can just light the damn candle exactly but it's a lot of fun to do the steps and the components of a spell by adding each of these things to it you're adding more energy and more power and if you wake up each herb or each component if you ask it to assist in your spell that's going to give you even more energy towards that so you can do as much or as little with Dressing Your Candle as you like generally with candle magic I am very much a go big or go home same so I do like to you know go through the whole pump and ceremony with it you know yeah you want to cleanse the candle you want to charge the candle I love all the steps every part of preparing a candle for a spell makes me feel very witchy and so I like putting the oil on it I like putting the herbs on it I used to call it ruining a candle BEC and I thought I was so badass and I would literally take these long tapers and I would just write in runes I would write from top to bottom or from bottom to top my entire spell I'd carve it in the whole thing and dress it in the oils it's just fun and it adds in my mind it adds to the power of the spell because it gets into my subconscious you kind of get into the the craftiness of it the witchiness of it and that really does add to the magic there's a lot to be said for PP and ceremony right yeah exactly and candles themselves are transformative I mean in a dark room light a candle it immediately elevates that space transforms that space if you have candles when your friends are over if you have candles on your dinner table it immediately changes the atmosphere so candles themselves are very powerfully transformative all right let's get into what the people want to hear now specific spells yeah yeah my top three candle spells that every witch should have are the three Basics a protection spell a blessing spell and a get the  away spell a Return to Sender spell I I I really like that I knew the third one would be right up your alley shell and we'll talk about my top which is money bow oh yeah I really like the Flames scrying SL divination oh yes that's on my list too and we will talk about love and relationship candle magic oh yeah manifesting that is also on my list so okay cool well let's start with let's start with the basics let's start with a blessing spell a simple blessing candle spell would be something that you could use to bless your home or bless your new car or to bless your space before you do some type of magic in it now I am big on the whole correspondence thing so I would you know again dress by candle in that type of you know blessing type herb I might even use honey instead of an oil because honey it's attraction it's it's warmth you know it's that abundance of home you know if you're blessing your home and your space I might actually use honey I would probably use a blue candle because gives you that you know peace and tranquility and you know you're creating your spiritual space you know what I mean you can always use white white is kind of like a quartz crystal white is like your yeah it's like the switchblade knife of you know you can just pretty much when doubt use white yeah exactly but blue I I agree I would also use like a light blue and I would probably write runes for you know happiness and blessing peaceful home on it you know maybe you draw a Sigil I love sigils so I will always create a Sigil because it kind of activates that magical creative part of my brain you know something simple that it's easy to draw on a candle and then as an oil you could use any type of attraction or blessing oil you could even use like Florida water if you're looking for a little bit more protection in that blessing but I would probably go with honey just because it's sweet it brings in that sweetness that lightness that Joy of I guess not really Joy of hard work but I guess kind of that too but you know brings in that joy and actually instead of using oil you could use the honey with herbs yeah just use the honey to dress your candle or mix it with the herbs in the beginning like shell does and for herbs again I would stick with like the sweetness theme I would probably use lavender and Rose those are simple and easy you've got those at home if you want to maybe a little bit of just regular garden sage if you've got a little sage in your kitchen just for that base of protection and and happiness maybe a little cinnamon if you want a little prosperity in there as well that's probably all I would use now what I would personally do and I'm sure there are a million options out there online I would just kind of write my own maybe four line I don't want to say poem but I kind of write spells and poems but my own little protection spell you know what am I looking to get out of this we all have a different view of having our house blessed and what have you so I would kind of lay out my intentions and then set a time frame for myself am I doing this once till the candle is out for seven days you know kind of lay out my parameters you're going to want to know going into this is this like a one shot spell or is this something like the money bowl that we're going to talk about where you you maybe do it repeatedly and just kind of refresh that spell you know if this is a a home blessing maybe it's a maybe you want to set it up in a bowl that has symbols of abundance in it and then just burn a candle every time you want to refresh that but the point is either write it down or have it outlined in your head what your parameters of that spell are going to be before you start it another option is is if you have for lack of another example I'll say a horseshoe um you know how people like to hang horseshoes for good luck you could for seven days have that candle lit in the middle of that horseshoe to kind of Empower that horseshoe to then at the end of the seven days hang it up outside your house you know kind of like if you had physical talismans basically yes that's perfect if you're charging an item it could be that horseshoe it could be a statue it could be a crystal it could be anything just have that near or under the candle that you're burning with the intent of all that blessing gets charged into that item and once you're done burning these candles whether it's one day or seven days you're going to have candle residue left you know there's going to be something left and disposing of those candle pieces should be part of your spell now I know we are going to have different opinions but let's really talk quick about what to do with them what would you do with them and then I will tell you what I would do with them it's really going to depend on what the spell is for me if it's like say it's a banishing spell I might just throw it in the garbage because that's something symbolically that gets taken away from you and it goes in the trash you know so you're getting rid of something dirty and gross right so I might just throw that in the garbage if it's a house protection spell I might take that wax and bury it uh in one of the quarters of my property or I might put that into another jar like a a home protection jar and make it part of that spell because it's already got that energy into it if it's something that I want to transform I might burn it in fire so say maybe it's a relationship that's bad that I'm trying to change I might burn that wax in a fire or possibly bury it in the earth to get that longer lasting change I don't like burying things that are not organic so it would really depend on what that candle was made of same thing with putting it in running water I almost never do that anymore if it was you know just like beeswax maybe but again that would be something that would need to be cleansed or transformed so it would really depend on what the spell was how I dispose of the last part maybe I keep it as a Talisman maybe I turn that wax put it back and get made into a different candle but it's really going to depend on what the spell was now I am very much a waste not want notot kind of person and at my old house in New York in my garage I had like two old you know those like tin coffee like the coffee things yeah like the metal coffee cans yeah yeah I had two of them in my garage and what I would do is if the candle spell was used for quote unquote good love and light things that wax went into one and if it was kind of more a not so love and light thing the wax went into a different one and then when I got however much or if I needed it for something like you know how we've talked about like the banishing jars you know the the spell jars and stuff and sometimes they're not pleasant sometimes I would take the not so nice wax and use it for or melt it all down and make another candle to do maybe a similar spell to that energy same with kind of the positive energy wax you know maybe I would use that melt it down and use it for maybe Another Blessing spell or or what have you but that's just me I know some people wouldn't reuse it but waste not want not ma'am and I really like how you separated that energetically because I do feel that it makes a difference well why would I use something bad for something good exactly exactly and can you cleanse that some people believe that they can and I feel that if you've used it in a spell that's pretty powerful it would be very difficult in my opinion to cleanse all of that so by separating them energetically I really I think that's that's pretty smart so again it comes down to whatever you did for the spell that's going to kind of determine how you or it should determine how you dispose of that or use it again later it should be similar so that's how you would get rid of it so in a blessing spell like shelle said you could use that to charge something and then you can take that wax maybe you could shape it into a little ball or into a cool little shape and have that wax itself be a small charm or Talisman that you you know keep on a shelf or put someplace in your house to radiate that blessing so what's the next spell that we've got cleansing being able to cleanse your space is a wonderful talent for any witch so definitely in our top three and for cleansing I like to use a half a lemon salt pine needles Rosemary and a white candle super simple and what I like to do with that is I like to take a lemon and cut it in half and honestly any Citrus will work it doesn't really matter the Citrus is the important part because every type of cleaning product known to man if you put citrus in it it's going to help cleanse right like for like symbolically Citrus cleanses so if you use that as your base for your candle you're already one up on the game right so I like to take a white candle and again same thing dress it write on it write your sigils on it right you're cleansing the space You could also use a black or gray candle I think do you have a preference for candle color for cleansing I guess I never really thought about anything other than white but I could I I could see how gray might be good yeah so white black or gray maybe yellow put the lemon cut side up on a plate put your white candle in the center of it the herbs that you can use to dress the candle would be salt crushed Rosemary and crushed P I like crushed pine needles so you can either sprinkle that on the lemon or you can dress your candle with those herbs we like to dress the candles what I've actually done before is I've picked one to dress the candle and put the other on the lemon oo okay I like that too you know then you can just light your candle and maybe say a very simple blessing poem something like this is one I have in a book of shadows from the last time I did this which I think was when I was living with a terrible roommate so that was a little while ago but anyway cleanse the space with salt and light purify by day and night this place is cleansed all negativity Band by my will the universe's hand so say whatever you can just say Cleanse This  space cleanse my spot you know anything negative get the out you can say whatever you want to say make something elaborate I like silly little Rhymes because they get into your subconscious they get into your head the easier it is to say and the more rhymey it works I don't know it works for some reason so you don't have to say anything you can just think cleansing positive thoughts and then once your candle has burned down this is something that you could either just throw away because again when you're cleaning you throw away all the the refu you can also dry that lemon or Citrus whatever type that you used and use that you know use the lemon peel or something as protection you can put them in spell jars you can bury it in your yard but this one again it's cleansing just throw you can just throw it away all right the next one that we think that you should have one of the top three is the Return to Sender spell I actually love this I love this what I do with this is I incorporate not just I don't just use a candle for this particular one m I use some sort of mirror setup as well now in my old house I used to have like this beautiful VOD of candle holder that had mirrors all on the inside and out I don't have it anymore so now I would have I would set up mirrors but I basically put a candle inside a shape of mirrors okay so you like have mirrors standing up around it so that the flame is being reflected back at itself oh okay I like to put the mirror as the plate I like to use a reflective plate or a a round mirror to place the candle on oh good idea yeah and you can actually buy at like Walmart mirror coasters that would work perfect oh yeah that would be great I like to have a reflective surface on the bottom but I also I like the idea of having multiple mirrors standing up so the light is bouncing around inside you know reflect like you said said reflecting back on itself well in my opinion whether it's candle magic or not any type of Return to Sender has to involve mirrors in my mind that just a me thing but like that is the perfect you get back what you put out kind of thing to me for this one I like to have if you have any broken mirror or broken glass I like to incorporate A Shard of broken mirror or broken glass into this one red pepper and cloves are big for me for Return to Sender because I like to send it back with a little bit of Sting hey they started it I've actually used some like dried different types of peppers that I dried myself oh even better anything that I personally find distasteful I use anything I find offensive I use I like to keep it simple I like to use a reflective surface a Black Candle to sever any ties banish any negativity the mirror to send it back to them I like black salt for this you know you want that heavy powerful protection right there I know some people will use graveyard dirt yep that's really going to depend for me I think that's kind of like the big guns I'm I don't like to collect it but you could use graveyard dir here but I like red pepper and cloves little bit of black salt I like to write their name on a bay leaf you could put it on a little piece of paper or what have you but I like the symbolism of a Bailey no I I really do keep this one super simple because usually if it resorts to this I'm pretty pissed off so you know I do the same thing I I write their name I might write either what I would like an outcome to be you know like hey they end up with a stick up their ass um no but you know I I write something and what I end up doing is really simple whatever you send to me send back to you times three whatever you send to me send back to you times three and I say that n times I have found it has worked oh yeah banishing Return to Sender spells like this are super good whatever I write on the paper or on the bay leaf whichever I then burn in that candle flame I also like to burn the bay leaf before I light the candle because I like to incorporate the ashes of it in with my black salt my red pepper M are you using the candle to burn it nope oh I like to dress the candle with their name so I'll take the bay leaf write their name on it burn that I get what you're saying because it burns them away that's right I add those Ashes to the bread pepper and the cloves and the black salt I will dress the candle from base to tip and I'll either use a banishing oil or I'll just use some type of like you said grape seed oil actually I have an I have in the past um with a banishing candle spell Ed vinegar to dress it oh there you go that's nice too and then I will coat it with those herbs then what I do is I cut off the bottom while I'm thinking about how pissed off I am and how much I want to the bottom of what the candle oh you shave off the bottom of the candle to expose the wick so now you have the bottom of the candle with the wick Expos vulnerable and you burn it from the bottom down return it back to them you're taking that spell and you're turning it backwards and so you're sending that to them let all of that melt down onto that Shard of glass or Shard of mirror and whatever herbs left you're going to sprinkle around the base of the candle and then let it all burn down onto the herbs and onto The Shard of glass and then throw that away bury it in your nastiest garbage and throw that away if it is mirrors that I am not going to reuse or if it is broken pieces I have before used a Sharpie and actually wrote the name of the person on the actual mirror it's like reflecting it right back to them them you know and there's several different ways to do a Return to Sender spell but they all involve writing that person's name down projecting the idea of reflecting it back to them whatever you send bounces off me and sticks on you right and that's exactly the idea so yeah I do like to burn the bottom of the candle uh that's an old folk magic if you really want to return that back to them flip the candle over and do it that way so those are your three Basics those are going to assist you in pretty much anything you need to cleanse your space protect your space and bounce bad energy back so what have we got next everybody wants more money okay yes so let's talk candle magic money bowls you have had a damn money bowl for months yeah I started it in the be the beginning of the year we did a Triant spell I created a money bowl that I had never done before and uh I feed it regularly it's burning right now actually now first of all in my opinion green candle green green Green what color are you using the candle I have in it today is blue okay for reasons okay okay but yeah it's it's blue right now the first candle was white and then it was green so it's been mostly white and green but this one's blue okay but you but it's blue for a reason not just correct that is correct blue and gold make green so no I have mine right here and what I have in mind because obviously it's an actual Bowl I love all things British in United Kingdom shout out to our UK listeners I have a bunch of coins in here really a Queen Elizabeth coin I actually my friend in England brought me I I have a coin now with King Charles on it I have a Susan banthony and I have a I don't even know who that is is um one of our the dollar coins two cinnamon sticks I love these little shells cowy shells yeah and they used to be used way back as a form of money currency yeah currency so I always try to have one of these in a money bowl and then I have a adventurine and a green tormine in here and then obviously I have my candle oh and by the way I'm not going to say what year it is because that's a a TMI thing but I have a penny of the year I was born oh that's cool okay so money symbols are obviously one of the big things that you'll put in a money bowl at the base of my bowl I have rice which is considered a form of currency I have sand in mine they're all going to be different whatever you want to use as your base is fine I used rice because it's a traditional symbol of money and I have a $2 Bill and a $1 silver certificate o the reason is is because it's real money but it's fantastic money it's exceptional money it's different you also have interesting money in your money Bowl I have special money in it and I also have special money in mind I also have like a little Monopoly piece house because when I first created this we were looking to move yet again to a fantastic house which came true but I have other little symbols in there of things that I would like to attract I also have cinnamon sticks in mind because those are you know Everyone likes to do the cinnamon blow cinnamon is a symbol of money of wealth so having those symbols is in there is very important I also have a green aventurine and I have some uh three bay leaves that I wrote different intentions on that are in there as well I did but my cat ate them yeah cats are where a lot of my money goes to so you want to put symbols of wealth symbols of things in there that you like and I mentioned feeding my bowl I like to add things to it occasionally add money to it and I like to make sure that I keep the candle refreshed do you do anything like that for your money Bowl well when I first started it I only had my English money and that was very special because it had the queen and now the King on it but then I came across you know you know how you go to the store and you're supposed to get like 50 cents change in the next thing you know you got a Susan banthony in your hand I got that store has changed I was like I need to put that in and then my my my gold dollar same thing that was given to me has changed because a cashier thought it was a quarter and I put that in my my penny I looked long and hard for a penny from the year I was born and I finally found it yeah so adding things to a money bowl is traditional uh some people like to create them at the beginning of the year for the year but you can pick any time it doesn't really have to be you know the beginning of the calendar year this is a spell that's not meant to be a oneand done this is meant to sit in a specific place a prominent place where you will see it and by seeing it refresh the spell by lighting the candle and allowing it to burn that refreshes the spell and then by replacing the candle uh with intention with thoughtfulness and adding items to that bowl with intention and thoughtfulness sometimes called feeding the bowl or feeding the spell to keep that refresh to keep that energy going speaking of refreshed one thing I I had to do a couple of times is my wax dripped on my sand and what I ended up doing taking everything out disposed of the sand put new sand in and basically put it back together because I couldn't stand having dripped wax on the sand see I like to keep mine all together it's starting to form like a little wax thing at the bottom because I use candles that just drip down and then I add another candle to that puddle of wax at the bottom it's starting to incorporate the bay leaves and some of the rice and the cinnamon sticks so as it burns it's kind of forming a Talisman at the bottom of that so I I kind of like to keep that yeah but see I don't always use drippy candles like recently holiday stuff hit the shelves and I have like a green tealight in I've used a vodo of a taper you know I just always me personally I always try to stick with green I like usually green or white White's Universal but again using the blue one for specific intent with that being said a money bow is a type of manifestation spell so a simple 7-Day manifestation spell that I learned it might have been from Lori cabbits book I'm not sure but you can use this to manifest anything uh basically requires two candles and you can carve them dress them however you like but use herbs and oils for your intention so say you want to manifest a new job or a new place to live or you want to manifest a a new car I don't know take one candle and signify that is you and then the other candle you would charge with your intent for whatever it is that you want to manifest and dress them bless them however you like and the idea of this is you burn them for 10 minutes every day so you're going to want bigger candles for this so you're going to burn them for about 5 10 minutes every day maybe you have a chant or something that you say to invoke those energies of what you're manifesting and then you move them one inch closer to each other each day you move them one inch closer to each other and let them burn for 10 minutes until at the end of the seven days they're touching each other and that's when you let them burn completely and that should draw whatever it is that you have asked to manifest to you and I like that because that's almost like visually happening you know you're not just you're not just projecting it out there but you're visually seeing it come together yep and you can do this you know if you're looking for a relationship you can have this other candle be the idea of you know I want someone who loves old movies as much as I do or you know that type of thing just write money on it and have that come towards you but just move them together and there's a simple manifestation spell now since you brought it up we're going to Quick bounce to love and relationships oh yes first of all this is potentially going to be a little x-rated if you're under the age of 18 please turn this off for the next four minutes oh now I'm really interested right what kind of candle magic you doing all right we're gonna get there hold on generally speaking pink red or white would be my go-to color-wise now being that I am in Salem and there is a lot of magical shops here you have the option to get and you can get these online too a candle in the shape of a man a candle in the shape of a woman depending on your intentions you can also get a candle in the shape of a very large penis well I seem to recall someone who made quite a few of those out of a mold of their significant others junk and I think there's a few of them still floating around even now like years later I recall that same story and I'm giggling in my head um so you know you can you can kind of take this to whatever level you want and I'm not saying I am totally For Love or relationship Magic but you know if you're just going to do simple p a pink taper or a pink tea candle you know same thing dress your stuff generally you know roses peppermint honey honey is a good one that would be something you could use that as your base to dress it you know use that instead of an oil unless you're going to use like a rose oil or an edible oil I really do like for a love spell a picture and have that picture is the base or if you're already in a relationship a picture of the two of you together I'm not I'm I'm going to put a disclaimer here I want no part of doing love spells on specific people unless like you're already in a relationship not a good idea they almost always end badly I just don't like them I know and I agree with you but people do it so I'd rather kind of give a good opinion if you're gonna do it you should at least know how to do it least half ass as possible all right I'm GNA say if you're going to do it to a specific person always throw the caveat in there of you know for the good of all and to harm none or I don't know I would throw something in there to like give them an out because you don't want somebody to fall in love with you that doesn't really love you I didn't say fall in love with you well you said love spell so I just went there what if you've been married for 10 years and you get one of those big dick candles to get your groove on because you want it four times a week instead of one time a week well that's different I mean if you're going to you know if you want to like enhance a love that's already there or spice up your love life I'm all for that I mean that is what I'm advocating that is what I'm I'm not you want to curse your ex with a a little bit of a limp dick because he kind of totally deserves it I I'm also kind of for that I just don't necessarily want someone to be like this person will love me and love me only that is not good on any level first of all we won't talk about the moral issues of that but when that wears off and they don't love you anymore then how you going to feel how about that for you it's not good for you girlfriend I mean really I don't give a  about them it's not good for you it really isn't and you know it's better to get a booty call than be in a bad relationship so get the cand get the get Thea candle get the W ever gentil you want candle just don't do a love spell give it a generic idea you know if you're going to put the qualities of someone out there that you want you know Say Hey I want to attract someone that wants sex five times a day and loves old movies and likes to go hiking you know if you want to put that out there without attaching a specific person I think that's a great idea Leila I just I I can't for a minute I had to turn my mind off because I just immediately started picturing you dressing a c a big penis candle oh really and I was like oh my God oh my God there's a visual for you but any who I was actually going to do more of like you know kind of talk more about like a enhance what you've got because again I I agree with you I do not I do not condone making Joe blow down the street Fall In Love With You Bad Bad ending but you know maybe you and your significant other got in a funk or you know maybe maybe things are distressful and you want that to not be projected onto your relationship that is more kind of the love and relationship and Dick candle kind of thing I'm talking about yeah all right I'm totally up for that but you know I do Advocate having the other person involved you know maybe if you are a witch couple this would be something good to do together you know maybe one of you can dress it one of you can write out a little I'm I'm big on kind of writing a three four five line thing basing it around what you want and being kind of rhythmic you know maybe it's something as simple as enhance what we have make it grow by the Light of the candles glow oh or even better reverse that by the Light of the candles glow enhance what we have and make it grow simple easy exactly but I also I like the picture thing and I actually have done that before I had a picture and had it kind of at the base and had that wax go down we're going to talk in a few few minutes about what I did with that wax um because that didn't go in my tin can but I don't want to mix divination with this particular topic oh okay I do think that divination can play into this because I don't know I don't have a specific spell written out for this but when I have done this in the past I've kind of used that flame to kind of I don't want to say project what was written on the paper but almost talk to the fire mhm does that make sense so you're as you're as it's burning you're like saying the the spell Into the Fire as if the fire were a conduit to take it to where it needs to go to be manifested okay all right I like that you know what I mean the idea of a candle flame and that energy is putting that energy out to the universe you know that's the whole idea of a candle spell is that as it burns similar to incense you know like incense that smoke goes up and and the whole idea is that it brings your your intent your your power out to the universe to manifest that desire to make that real but I have a weird relationship with fire though because I was burned a couple times very badly as a small child and it created a weird relationship and it's almost like when I do things like this I don't know it's like I'm talking to the fire as if it were like a spirit being so it's not even so much projecting it out to the univ ierse it's almost like Whispering into Fire's ear to have it then go do its work so Whispering it to the flame itself to the power of fire to manifest your will right not the universe as a whole but the element of fire itself and fire is pretty powerful that way it is transformative some people say that if you're talking to one flame you're talking to all of them but fire has a lot to do with you know like lust and passion and so you kind of talk to it about what you want you know what I mean and if you want that energy to grow that type of burning passion you know for sure tell it to the fire and have it so it's not so much about the words you say as far as you know words of a spell it's more about creating that passionate relationship with fire to get the passion back that you want you know like for like the burn of the flame is a lot like the burn of romance or relationship so using that fire using candle magic you can grow a relationship grow desire grow passion but not create we're not creating relationships we're not creating passion we are Fanning the flame that is already there oh I like that oh I should trademark that that's a good one yeah yeah you're not creating that flame you're Fanning what is already there you're telling that F you're telling that flame that is already there what your desires are what your wants are so relationship building that's another type of manifestation you know it it's it's just a specific you know you're manifesting a specific thing so you could use that 70 candle spell or like shell said you know just the single candle and you know hey anytime you use a a longer lasting candle or the human shaped ones because they would be pretty if you burn that every time you and your significant other are in the same room you know that will reignite those energies and kind of bring that or doing your thing yeah but that kind of leads into because I mentioned the word divination I want to kind of segue into that not a spell per se but I do use flame as a divination tool not necessarily candle I will do that with a bonfire there's a lot to be gleaned from a Burning Flame fire scrying is a very easy way to get into an alpha state to get your brain to kind of let go of your conscious mind and get more into your subconscious into your magical mind it's pretty easy to get lulled into that semi hypnotic State and start to fire scry some people are natural at it almost everyone can get lulled into that Alpha meditative state by fire pretty easy if you just you know let your eyes kind of unfocus and stare into the flame and just kind of let everything be soft and drift away a little but that's when I start seeing like shapes or like thing is moving almost like a little movie reel and that's where like the Divination comes in it's good good to have a recording device or a person there listening that can record for you a notebook so that you can write things down as soon as you start to come out of that state because it's a very dreamlike State and the more you do it the easier your recall will be but it can be a little disorienting yeah but fire scrying is fantastic I I recommend that you set your intent if you're going to do candle magic it should be either a spell or a divination I know it's popular sometimes to turn your spell in you know if you're using candle magic to do a spell a lot of people try to interpret how it burns or how it melted honestly not everything is a sign okay not everything is a damn sign you wanted to bring up another type of spell that a lot of people turn into a divination oh boy all right here we go right now the big thing is cord cutting yeah that's the big one that type of spell in particular is one that you really do not want to do a scrying of how it burned or how it didn't burn at the end because that goes against the nature of the spell itself I know I know but it's not about you and it's not about me it's about the people and the people on the old Facebook and the old Instagram seem to be in love with cord cuttings you know first of all did you do a binding to begin with that needed to be cut was my first question but okay let's say you did I do like the candle to represent one candle to represent the other wrap whatever type of chord you want around them too and light each candle till they burn and then the cord Burns I like that it just is so cliche right now it's not just that it's cliche it's that it looks good and it sounds good I mean we even talked about it back in the beginning but I don't think people are doing it right it's a really shitty way to do a cord cutting it's a very passive way to do a cord cutting and I prefer energetic actionable ways to do a cord cutting can I just point something out it's called cord cutting for a reason it ain't called cord burning it's called cord cutting in my opinion you need scissors not a candle but people love the candles so let's talk about it they like the candles that like you said one candle represent you one candle represent the other person they tie the cord around them the string to represent the binding whether it's something you did on purpose or whether it's an energetic cord I mean we all get energetic cords from people that we meet and some of them can be pretty deep and if you want to actually sever that connection the idea is that you then let the candles burn down and the candles will cut that cord by burning it first of all that's passive I don't like to let the candles burn down and and sever the cord you should cut the cord if you're going to tie two candles if you're done be done if you're done be done take those candles and if you're going to tie them together then take scissors and cut that cord actively your power your hand you cut that don't just wait for a candle to burn down and cut it dramatic looks good on camera dumb idea in practice then the second thing that people like to do with this is they then want to know this is how both candles melted what does it mean didn't you hear me I said that not everything's assigned and you also said when you're done be  done try to read it you're done throw that  away don't worry about how it burned or what happened you don't want anything to do with this person what part of close the door do you not get thank you you're cutting cords with this person you don't want to analyze them you don't want to analyze your feelings about them when you're done be done be active about it cut that cord on purpose and then be done and move on that's the next part is the mundane part of that spell is you need to move on close the door or walk away don't think about that person anymore don't worry about that person anymore you are done you have cut that cord don't bother doing a cord cutting spell if you're not ready to do a cord cutting spell thank you and if you just want to do a pretty one and and divine what it means for your relationship set that intention when you're burning the candle because like shell said not everything is a sign just because the oil caught fire and burned half the candle down it just means that the oil caught fire and burned half the candle down if it wasn't a sign you would know you would feel that you would feel that energetically be like oh this means that I'm only half done with this relationship you wouldn't need to ask someone else what it means you would know that it was a sign because signs are meant for you specifically not for other people to interpret and if your candle flame goes out on its own the sign might be that you have a draft in your house and you maybe should like get some better insulation I don't know exactly so I don't I don't love those cord cuttings they they're kind of cutesy and nice and I was sucked into it in the beginning too because they look so good on camera clich it's so cliche and after thinking about it why cut a cord passively the idea is to cut it actively and when you're done be done so don't confuse divination spells with your regular spells and if it's a sign you'll know cuz they're meant for you signs are so personal now I feel like we might have talked about candle magic to exhaustion so how about we wrap this
