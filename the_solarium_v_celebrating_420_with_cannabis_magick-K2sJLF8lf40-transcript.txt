hi and happy 420 before we get into today's Solarium episode The Witches want to remind you that smoking anything can have a negative effect on your lungs and your health so please make sure before you start smoking that you consult a health professional and as always we may be amazing witches but we are not doctors it's witchcraft [Laughter] [Music] welcome witches pagans heathens and magical souls to the solarium shell in Lea's herbal Haven a sunlit sanctuary where we take Serene moments away from our computer screens to sit in the sun drink a pot of Enchanted tea and take a few Mystic toes while we talk about topics both mundane and profound today we are talking all things cannabis for 420 happy 420 everybody I'm Lea and this is my co-host shell and today we'll be talking about the magic of cannabis wow happy 420 so shell we have actually had something happen that we have not had happen yet do tell we have been invited to someone's wedding are you freaking kidding me no no I'm not we have been invited to the wedding of Brandon and Morgan now Brandon and Morgan are getting married in Utah on 420 so unfortunately we won't be able to make it but we wanted to say thank you for inviting us and happy freaking wedding congratulations oh my God guys congrats and you know what this bowl is for you this one is for Brandon and Morgan congratulations we're going to smoke up in your honor and thank you so much we are so honored that you invited us to your in your reception so we hope you have a wonderful day hey Morgan can I just say there is someone who is very close and dear to me that I love deeply who has the same name as you so yeah you if you guys ever have a baby name it shell seriously just so there you go straight from Shell's mouth maybe that's coming soon so enjoy your wedding congratulations and many many blessings to you and your brand new family congratulations congratulations and I can't believe it's April first of all you know 420 I I got into this conversation the other day how did this become our day do you have history on this I do and that history that history is fraught with shall we say controversy but there's a few different takes on what 420 means well I figur that might be a good place for us to start our salarium like why are we here other than you know get high it happens that's a damn good enough reason but 420 became a thing supposedly because back in the I think it was in the 70s there was a group of friends that would get together after school and they would always be able to meet up by 420 so it quickly became slang you know hey 420 today sure 420 that was the time they were able to get together and that became their slang for smoking weed and it's one of those things that caught on and grew like wildfire and I think that's the most accepted history of it okay so that actually makes sense because back in our Heyday you used to show up at my house at about 820 um which is a little bit double of 420 so yeah I get it I get it now because this is our salarium and you know for all things weed you are the wizard why don't we we delve into how does marijuana translate into your magical practice cannabis is not just something fun to do with your friends like we always did it's it's not just a medicine it can also be something called an entheogen she says did like we didn't do that two weeks ago just yeah like that's not a regular occurrence but it is also a sacred plant it is a plant that can help you find Oneness that can help you be in touch with the deity within yourself and within all things that's what an entheogen is and cannabis kind of falls into that category it has been used that way for thousands of years you know they have found cannabis in Shaman's graves in medicine people's Graves It Was Written in I believe we both talked about a Chinese scholar Emperor Nung that's right yes he was the inventor of cannabis an te he's the first person to write about the properties of cannabis and its medical uses and he is considered the father of Chinese medicine he also invented tea so they have those things in common which is you know another reason why we love blending those things here in the solarium and speaking of fathers I just got to stick it in here you know the father of our country Mr George Washington did smoke marijuana just saying had to put it out he did indeed inhale yes he did inhale that's right you recently uh just did a workshop at Sacred Space that had to do with cannabis and herbal smoking and things of that nature so aside from the ritual one of the things I want to also talk about a little bit about your Workshop without you know giving away your whole workshop on this episode because that's a different episode folks I also want to get into how you can utilize it that way as well so cannabis as an entheogen is something that you can definitely utilize in your practice one of the things that I really like to talk about in a workshop or presentation about cannabis is helping people to get in touch with what uh Kathleen Harrison who is an ethnobotanist she was married to Terence McKenna and has worked with entha Jens including cannabis all over the world she likes to talk about the spirit of cannabis and I truly believe that this plant is alive in a magical sense and is something that we can connect with and by connecting with the spirit of cannabis you can connect better with yourself you can connect better with the world and with other people people our bodies are specifically designed to work with cannabis we have an endocannabinoid system in our brains that the Active Components of cannabis like THC CBDs cbgs the tpin all work with and so it seems like the perfect fit the perfect match to working with magic so I like to help people get in touch with the Green Goddess I like to help them get in touch with the Confluence of magic that happens when you add cannabis to the mix whether in your insect your tea or in a smokable spell there's definitely ways that we can honor the herb as well as use it as an En the engine to help us get deeper into our practice either by using it before you do magic in order to help yourself get more easily into magical space or into a magical headp space or if you use it as a sacred smoke you know using it as an incense or as an offering in your magic you know there there's lots of different places where you can use it and that's basically what the focus of the word Workshop was was breaking down the different types of cannabis and how to incorporate it into your magical practice and we actually have have done it all of those things we have done it prior we have done it during spell work we've made it a part of ritual I've added it to our incense although in small quantities because man waste not want not that shit's not cheap we've even used it as offerings to deity I think we've used it as offerings to Fay in the past we have we've we've even given it up as a sacrifice we gave up as a sacred sacrifice back before the year 2000 before the turn of the century our coven had called the big ritual of the year belan which is also coming up after this episode airs and belane 2000 was a big deal and we were very very excited to not only have the honor of putting on this Festival which could be for 200 300 plus people but also because it was the year 2000 it was so special it was like some sacred it like some sacred event because it was beltine 2000 yeah we were super stoked about it we're very excited and so prior to I mean this was a year-long preparation you know there was a lot of work that went into putting on this ritual for our community and one month before May 1st we as a coven got together because we were pretty much all smokers not everybody but most of us we got together and we gave big sacrifices and for those of us that were smokers we gave up smoking cannabis for a month and the couple of people that were in the coven that were not smokers gave up something of equal spiritual value to them um and and we all committed to kind of like a a one- Monon sacrifice think of it as our lent it was our lent yeah it was a it was a big one too you know and it's not like I know people that for Lent you know they'll give up brussel sprouts or whatever something they don't like this was a big deal for us it was very much so it was something we gave up something very important something that we did like you said as a group we would get together and smoke and do magic or smoke and hang out it was very much a part of our lives and our friendship and so giving it up was not easy it was an amazing transformative experience I think that whole year-long trial before we put on belain it was amazing and giving up weed as a sacrifice was part of it and and I think that that was definitely some like I had never prior to that you know thought about that whole sacrificing thing you know not necessarily being raised Christian lent wasn't something I was necessarily familiar with and I didn't realize mentally spiritually even emotionally at times the mental fortitude it took to get through those damn 30 days yeah and we did it as a group and we were better for it on the other side do not think for one second that on day 32 we weren't puff like dragons right right oh we were blazing we wanted to go into that big facilitator role I don't want to say with a with a cleansed Spirit or but kind of and yeah it has nothing to do with what weed is or what people think weed is it was more of that making that sacrifice that's just what we chose to sacrifice but cleansing of the soul of giving something up exactly and that can be good for you in any situation if you give something up and you commit to that that's a very powerful magical act no matter what it is that you're giving up and for me one of the things that giving up cannabis revealed to me was how sacred it was to me and how intrinsically I used it in a magical way without even realizing it you know that was my real Awakening to the fact that I wasn't just smoking to get high I was smoking for other reasons as well and the biggest Revelation was that I missed the ritual of getting ready to smoke more than I missed actually smoking and I remember you saying that at the time and me looking at you like what the holy Jesus are you saying to me yeah but it it makes so much sense I I have a place a special place not all the time but I have a place where I like to smoke and it's set up kind of like an altar I have a a beautiful pipe that I like I have a lighter with a pretty lighter case on it even taking the canab out breaking it up and either rolling it into a joint or packing it into a bowl those acts all have meaning and I I think it hit me when I was in your Workshop about tea when you were talking about the Tea Ceremony and how the ceremony itself is the important part and the drinking of the tea is not really the goal preparation is the ritual not the consumption yes yeah a light bulb went off in my head because that's exactly how I had been treating cannabis most of the time I mean obviously I just love sparking went up with my bestie but there is usually a ritual to it and that that's what I missed and so after that sacrifice after that belan ritual I started consuming cannabis more intentionally more magically and I was like hey this burns like an incense why not let it be an incense why not smoke it with other herbs and and so that's where things really started to change for me that's a good segue into I wanted to touch on the incense Factor because we've done the same thing you know I would make these awesome Blends for us as a COV we'd burn them for specific occasions sometimes adding some cannabis to that incense mix was called for you know there is a herbal Tarot deck which yes it's part of my collection I love it and the 10 of cups is the marijuana card and I remember showing you that for the first time and you being like finally yay it's the happy family card it is but at the bottom of that specific card on that specific deck it says happily ever after that always stuck with me after that deck that when I use marijuana in an incense or in a tea blend it's for that Joy factor that happiness Factor you know maybe you're making an incense to bring happiness into your life throw a few pinches of weed in that [ __ ] so there is magical properties that you can utilize in things such as your incense your teas and let me tell you that gorilla glue it does not taste like grape and a tea it's sad I can't help it but it doesn't no and she's talking about the weed Gorilla Glue not the product gorilla not the product or or like Grape Ape Grape Ape does not taste like Grape Ape if you put some in a tea it's sad but you know you you can utilize the magical properties not just for smoking you know maybe you don't want to smoke it for whatever reason which is absolutely okay we're not judging but you can utilize it in things such as incense for sample and before I lose the thought if you're lucky enough to know a grower and can get your hands on just the fan leaves you know your the five fingered leaves or seven fingered leaves that you see all the time in pop culture or whatever yeah probably if you can get your hands on like a handful of those leaves and dry that and use that for your incense then you won't feel so much like you're wasting your flower you can just use the fan leaves and get the same properties if you're using it I loved seeing cannabis in the herbal Tarot and the biggest reason why is because herbalists don't think of cannabis as an herb and it's weird to me how often I'll talk to an herbalist and they just start blinking when you talk about cannabis as an herb but it is it's a plant it's an herb it has magical properties it has medical properties it has cooking uses it's a very useful herb but we have been so brainwashed I guess it has been written out of so many things that even herbalists forget that cannabis is just an herb it really is I mean you know why they call it weed why because it's a freaking weed man you know just like a dandelion but you don't see people sitting here saying oh you know we can't talk about dandelion wine because that's a weed dandelion marijuana both weeds but yet we respect dandelion and we don't respect marijuana I'm just saying I do love dandelion and I'm going to have to stop you right here because my stoned ass is looking at all the dandelions in my brand new yard and I just have to say okay I've moved cats out of the bag I have I am living in the path of the solar eclipse if any of you have heard that episode I called it just saying shell read the Farmers Almanac yep y Eclipse Farmers Almanac Eclipse said that aquarians follow the solar eclipse and somehow two weeks later I ended up moving following the solar eclipse following the solar eclipse I am now living in the Wilds of Northern Pennsylvania and absolutely loving my little former church that's now a house in the woods and I have dandelions all over my beautiful yard if you would asked me three months ago if you'd be living in northern PA right now I would have giggled in your face just well as you know I have kind of a nomadic soul and so I I end up moving more often than most but we really love here and real quick before we get back to our cannabis and tea and herbs I do want to say that when we moved in I made sure to follow a bunch of different Customs do tell real quick do tell do tell I only brought my magical brooms and we purchased a brand new house broom to sweep with because you're not supposed to bring old brooms from one house to another so we got a new broom now I have to interrupt here and just just put this out there I actually was with you when you went to the house to get the keys for the first time she literally people hands me a salt shaker and I'm like and a thing of bread I'm like what are we eating when we get there and she's like it's because we're going in the house for the first time I was like oh yeah like here I am holding a salt shaker and a freaking bag of bread thinking that she's making me a damn sandwich no it's Lea's rituals it is shell brought in let's see shell carried the salt I think one of my daughters carried in the bread I brought in the New Broom I took our basm calling herbal tea and smokable blend and I sprinkled that on the threshold and swept that into the house first because you're supposed to sweep in something good to your house before you ever sweep anything out of it we forgot one of your new house rituals what's that we need to get high in your living room man you'll be coming down soon enough and we'll be playing Katan and getting high all over the house so yeah so I followed a few rituals there I have to say oh and we all blew cinnamon in every door and you helped with that I I helped with that I actually have a picture of your daughter blowing the cinnamon super cute I love that so yeah we followed a few things going into our new house so I do love that all right so back to our regularly scheduled program cannabis is a weed just like dandelion and uh yeah I wish more witches would add it to their herbal compendiums there's one thing that weed's bad for and it breaks my heart to say it it's not the tastiest drink I've put in like literally a pinch a tiny pinch in a couple of Blends for Magical purposes but like you ain't going to want to be drinking marijuana tea because it kind of tastes like ass if you're if you're of a Gen X age if you were kind of smoking a little bit in the late 90s early 2000s think of it as it tastes like bong water that's all I'm going to say to you now that really is going to depend on how you prepare it my father who is a cannabis grower himself from way back was actually incarcerated back in the day but different podcast he likes to make tea out of his sugar leaves and what sugar leaves are to a grower is they fan leaves but they have started to get tricomes on them they get some crystals just like a bud does not really worth smoking but they make a fabulous tea okay see since I'm not a grower I was not I you know I don't have necessarily access to that so I was just going straight on buds so that could be the difference that very well could and I'll make you some tea out of that now using anything like a fan leaf or a bud to make tea you're going to want to make sure that you have maybe some heavy cream in there or or just drink it quickly because the hot water will activate your THC especially if you've decarbed it first by cooking it in the oven at a low temperature so what are you saying if you let if you let the liquid cool it gets lessen first of all you need to activate your THC in whatever you're going to eat and so if you're going to make tea out of it if you're going to cook with it you're going to want to do something called decarbing it you put that in your oven at a low temperature we'll put a whole recipe on how to do that get it bake your weed than than what that does is it activates the THC much like putting a lighter to your flour in your bowl does so that your body can process it once it's decarbed you can then put it in your tea and then the heat will again activate the THC if it cools down if there is no fat in your tea it will not stay there it's going to burn off in the Smoke basically what you need is some type of fat that's why people make butter a lot of times with your weed because the fat absorbs the THC if you don't want to use cream if you put honey in the tea would it stick to the honey or does it have to be cream any type of fat and I think sugars will also work but not as well but basically it just means if you're putting it in something like tea just drink it drink it while it's in there and experiment with it a little bit I'll make you some sugarleaf tea and see if you like that any better shell look at you teaching me something about tea you know I guess I guess my problem is is you've been like this marijuana connoisseur I I remember I used to call you a pot snob you did and a horticulturist because you are like the best grower ever in life not true but thank you I just smoke it I just smoke it and I'll put it in incense so maybe so we could kind of left turn back into something I'm more familiar with with let's talk about a couple times we've used it during actual ritual oh okay let's do that you know we've done various things like dream walks astral projections things of that nature we have utilized marijuana within ritual space to kind of put our minds in a different place so to say or maybe make that thin veil a little clearer to us sometimes if you focus too hard on on stuff you don't see it and when you can't really focus hard everything becomes clear does that make sense oh it really does it sounds like very much a magical mindset and and utilizing cannabis as an entheogen as something that allows you to see the connections and the Divine in all things you want to be careful make sure your dosage is appropriate to you and to where you're at because you don't want to be so stoned that you can't do ritual right this isn't a time to be silly and funny that's right you want to use just a little bit just enough to help you get in touch with that magical mind and and get to the point where you're comfortable and happy and can start to direct your thoughts and your intentions towards whatever ritual or spell you have put together and I know that ilila doesn't like these names because she's like way much more of a pot snob than the majority of us here folks but you're going to probably want to kind of go more with a sativa for this type of working they don't call it indic couch for nothing so you don't want to be smoking indicas and then you know just be drooling on the couch you're going to want a sativa where you are going to be able to still function in within ritual space and and do what you're intending to do so I know you don't like indica and sativa but I'm just putting it out there you're exactly right and we're not going to get into it in this particular podcast but sativa and Inda are not the best ways to categorize things anymore however shell is exactly right you do want something that's more upbeat a higher sativa type cannabis just roll with it Lea stop your judgment I like to get more into the Tarpin because I do think tarpine content is going to help you much more than sativa indicio or hybrid will but she's right you want something with more of an uplifting high you can even ask your bud tender hey which of these has um an uplifting High that's not going to make me paranoid and if you don't want to tell your bud tender that you're doing in you know some witchcraft business just be like hey do you got any weed that I can smoke while I clean the house yes there you go exactly so or weed that I can smoke while I'm listening to music and studying that type of weed something that'll get you not in the couch but can keep your brain and your body active and so I do recommend that you go very very light on it unless you're an experienced person with meditation or with magical mind States because it will immediately put you into a deep Alpha state where if you're not experienced with it it can make you feel laded it can make you feel dizzy you know you might not be able to direct your thoughts as well as someone who has worked in meditative and magical mind States frequently and the other thing I wanted to point out about using it ritually is um depending on your style of doing ritual you know you may at the beginning kind of quote unquote bless all of your altar or bless your altar tools that you are abs you would just include marijuana as you would with any other alter tool so you know if you were going to bless say cakes and wine you would do this the same way again the purpose isn't to get you know Silly and giggly it's more to get you in for lack of a better phrase that non- mundane mindset exactly if you use just a little bit of cannabis it can really help you feel like you've done a full relaxation meditation it can get you into a place where you are better able to reach out to your deities reach out to your ancestors that's why this isn't the time in place to be getting like totally blazed no this is this is like you want to be think Thanksgiving dinner you want to go out with your cousins and get just blazed enough to be able to get through dinner without being mad at anyone but you still want to be able to hold a conversation with your grandma right right so you want to be about that high but I really liked what you were saying about blessing your items and that's a very fun first thing to do is you can find a small pipe that can be your magical pipe you know this is a pipe you only smoke when you're doing spell work or this is the pipe that I use when I'm offering smoke to my ancestors you know and and do a full ritual to dedicate it bless it and do the same thing with your weed if you have a stash jar bless the jar and then bless the weed as you're putting it in there makes a little more sacred than say your party weed exactly and so then you know this isn't just weed for getting high or for pain management this is weed for ritual purposes exactly and now one of my favorite simple things is to roll a joint I like a good joint I can't roll a joint if my life depended on it 30e smoker I'd have to go without before I could roll a joint I hate it one of my favorite simple spells to do is to take a rolling paper and just with a tiny bit of spit draw a Sigil you know come up with a Sigil beforehand like sh was just talking about cleaning her house so maybe I'm doing some spring cleaning and I want to turn this into a little bit of a belan pre-ban ritual I would create a Sigil for um a blessed house and I would draw that sigil just in a little tiny bit of spit on my rolling paper then I would take my herbs just a little bit of cannabis just a small amount of cannabis and I would add to it maybe some Mullen for protection some lavender for peace a little bit of rose petals for happiness in the home and make that about 50% of the blend and the other 50% cannabis and then just roll a little joint and then as you're smoking that joint walking around your house cleaning your house when you're blowing out the smoke you are essentially smoke cleansing your home you're bringing that smoke internally and then you're blowing it back out blessing it with your energy combining all that energy together and then blowing that spell that smoke out with your intention to bless your home and that's also while you're smoking that a good time if you did happen to have say a chant or some rhythmic spell that you wanted to speak do that in between Puffs yeah play some great music with an excellent beat in the background use that music as well because you can use sound to cleanse a space you don't have to use smoke you know so you can combine that and use the the music your voice and the smoke to help cleanse your space very simple and you know if meditation is your thing which l loves meditation almost as much as journaling almost as much as cannabis cannabis can be a good way to kind of get you into a more deep meditative State you know that that deep Alpha State and again no Overkill here like Lea said just smoke enough to deal with your grandma on Thanksgiving but you can kind of harness that into going into that deep Alpha and that's a good time to you know some personal Shadow work oh that's a good one yeah or ancestor work you know think of that nature just kind of that that going within type work so that is also I don't know if you want to call that a spell or a ritual I don't know how you'd phrase that but that's a thing you can do yeah it most definitely is and and I I love that you brought up meditation shell because we all know you are very meditation resistant but if we give you a really good Bowl something that you very much enjoy to smoke with the intention of okay sh we're going to smoke this fatty and then we're going to get me there exactly and then you know once you're once you're like all right I'm already stoned I'm in the couch then you know we would do the meditation and we would go through the whole guided meditation and it would be no problem because you're already when you get stoned when you get high again you don't have to get so blazed you can't talk to your grandma but when you get a little high that kind of breaks down those barriers sometimes and allows you to get into that meditative State well and I think I think for me personally as you can totally attest to you know I'm kind of always functioning at at top speed at Mock speed go go go you know one thing to the next and that's probably why meditation ain't my bag um because that that's like a Slowdown that I don't have time for and and that's why marijuana can get me to that spot because it's almost like it forces my brain to slow down and stop thinking about ABC dxyz and focus on a meditative Journey yeah and it it can do that for a lot of people and you have to experiment a little bit and find where you're comfortable with that so that you can incorporate it into your meditation or into your spellwork you know we we've talked about using it as a Aid when you're meditating as an offering to your ancestors and I started that because my my father-in-law my husband's father very wonderful guy I've smoked with him we've smoked with him a lot and he and I used to grow together I you know I'd get out of work I'd head over to his house we'd work a few hours in our garden and you know then I'd go home to my husband and my kids for the night and and we did that for a long time we were very close he was killed in a motorcycle accident and I remember reaching out to him and I reached out to him while smoking a joint because it was very natural to do and that's where I really started using cannabis with ancestor work because it was simple to call him in meditative space you know while at my ancestor altar it was natural to spark up a joint and and reach out to him that way and a few times after doing that he wasn't the only ancestor that came to say thank you for the offering so I was like oh wow you know this what you're saying is he wasn't the only one to come to your spiritual smoke session that's exactly right and while most of them didn't come to partake like he does they did come because it was a smoke offering because it was an offering of the heart because it it was an offering of something sacred to me they smelled the good weed or they just smelled the good [ __ ] and wanted in on that so but yeah that that's when I realized that that could be an offering for other ancestors as well even if they weren't necessarily or if I didn't know if they were cannabis users in life it was still a good offering to the spirits and to the ancestors they accepted it and I've actually used it as an offering to deity now before people flood our our email and and say what deity is an offering of marijuana for you know what I made it up did it on my own as as we've talked about in the past I I am I'm hiat's girl always have been I probably always will be I have used it as offering to her oh hekate loves a good joint it's a torch baby but are you going to find that in a book or in in a Wikipedia about hkat I'm guessing no but in Shell's Book of Shadows it is official offering to hiate exactly Lea says a joint is hiat's torch and she has been more than happy to accept that as an offering now there are deities and we'll get into that again some other time but sashet is a lesser known Egyptian goddess and did you really just say SES hat I did I know isn't that terrible she is the goddess of SES right she literally has what looks like a cannabis leaf over her head and there's some debate on whether it's a palm leaf or a cannabis leaf but my vote's cannabis mine too she really fits it there's also the story about Shiva Lord Shiva is the god of bang uh b h n g bong it's a drink made with cannabis sounds like bong don't it it do now there's a whole full story with Shiva where long long ago there was a great poison that was released that went around the whole world and in order to save mankind Shiva went around and he ingested all of this poison he took it into himself and he was dying and his wife made him a cannabis drink bong and he drank it and it cured him so cannabis not only cured him it was his favorite drink I totally believe it absolutely so there are a lot of deities that use cannabis and you can like shell said they don't have to explicitly be a cannabis deity in order for you to offer that it's it's an offering just like apples or oranges or your first harvest or your sweat your tears whatever it's an offering like any other you know you know how I kind of looked at it way back in the day was way back in the day you couldn't get a lot of information on hiate you know she wasn't what everybody was to be you know following it was kind of a oh wow good luck and it was hard to get information so I didn't know or didn't know how to find out what I quote unquote was supposed to be offering to her so I took it as because it was sacred to me then it must be good enough to be sacred to her you know what I mean like if it was important enough to me and I'm willing to use that as is an offering then she is going to respect that and accept that as an acceptable offering is kind of the mindset I ran with that's what offerings are supposed to be that's why we gave it up as a sacrifice before we did belain because it it was something that was important to us was one of the first things we did we'd get together we'd spark up you know we'd smoke we'd talk about the day we'd talk about everything while we were smoking so to give to give that up was important and that's really an offering that you give to your ANC to your deities to whatever it's supposed to be something from the heart it's something that you feel that you're giving up now I want to kind of hit you with a blast from the past I didn't tell you prior that I wanted to mention this but in our old podcast the stoned Witches Hour we always opened every episode with hey what you smok in so I really just want to kind of circle back to that good time and ilila what you smoking tonight tonight I am smoking some blue dream very delicious very good that's so funny because right now I actually have a little bit of Blue Dream it's not it's not when I'm smoking but I actually have some how funny keep going tell me about it before I tell you about my it's delicious it has a nice smoke I'm very happy with it I haven't actually added any herbs to this today I'm just smoking straight blue dream with all the moving I'm a little sore so I need the extra th H C hit that muscle relaxing yeah oh yeah so I have planet of the grapes that is a great name that's a great name anybody who's listened to the stone Witches Hour knows that the THC content is a priority to Shell so this is 28.8 THC number good number you know 28 28 grams 28.8 [ __ ] works out but I have a complain and I know I've talked about this before but I I have a complaint what's your complaint if you're gonna put grape in the name damn it could it taste like grapes is that too much to ask this is shell rule number 376 if you're going to put a fruit in the name of the weed it should taste like that fruit damn it what are they thinking damn it what are smokers mostly associated with Munchies eating so you're going to talk about a fruit and not have it tastes like that really really really so so rude so rude so rude but aside aside from my [ __ ] about the name good [ __ ] I think someone asked in a Spotify comment about I think they were asking about smoking mug wart in use in ancestor meditation yeah I don't I don't smoke some like talking about freaking whiskey I don't necessarily smoke herbs straight no I almost always smoke them with cannabis there are so you break up your herbs into base supportive and flavoring herbs and I would say mugw is either a base or a supportive herb you know they tend to have a thicker smoke you know they can be like the most in your mixture all I can think about is how it would just taste like [ __ ] to be honest with you not gonna lie I've never had it in tea so I don't know how it tastes there but in a smoking blend mugart is actually kind of it's it's a little sweet it's a little earthy it's nice I've never used it as the main herb mostly because mug can have some psychoactive properties but as a supportive herb I really like it in a blend and yes mugart does have some properties to it that help you very much get into a meditative mindset some of these herbs do have psychoactive properties and mugw is one of them so for an ancestor meditation I have a blend that I like to smoke along with my cannabis that is mug wart Blue Lotus skull cap and wild Daga you want that to be about a quarter I usually like that to be not a lot about a quarter of my smoke a third to a quarter and what that mixture does is it really does help your body your brain get very relaxed it helps you get into Alpha state it helps you to reach out through the veil to the other side you know so using that type of blend in your meditation or ancestor work can help you connect so to the person who asked if I do smoke mug wart yes it's not my favorite I don't add it all the time but yes uh mug wart Blue Lotus there's a couple other herbs that do have a little bit of a psychoactive property and will help you either get into a meditative state or go to sleep depending on how you're using them yeah I smoke cannabis but other than that I don't smoke any other herbs I I stick kind of to the incense piece of that burning yeah in cannabis too for tea and for incense she's not so much on smoking the herbs whereas I like to you know I use them when making incense mixes I use them in teas and also in smokable Blends because I I do like the flavor of extra herbs added in with my cannabis and I do very much enjoy the feeling of smoking my spells you know what I actually just thought of something I just told y'all a big fat lie I am a cigarette smoker as well and it just dawned on me when I was thinking about that as you were speaking that you and I actually together um have smoked clove cigarettes which clove is technically so I I have smoked cloves before but not anything we smoked those ritually those were more like after Rocky hores clo we were trying to be cool remember they were in like pink and green and orange paper well they just tasted good I like I'm not a tobacco smoker but I do like I do like clove so I I I have smoked or that particular one before but yeah that's it's I don't know you've even tried especially with you know your current workshops that you're doing to have me do the blends with the Cannabis and I've done it with you and it it's tasty but in the same respect I haven't come home and done it you know what I mean we have a lot of the same herbs I believe for our workshops we kind of mixed and matched our herbs for the different for the tea you're smoking some of them and I'm just drinking them that's right that's right you you more drink them I more smoke them but when I've when I've been with you I have smoked mixtures with you um but again not really straight on herbs minus the Cannabis they've always had that cannabis mixture in them yep and on our high holy day today of 420 you know I'm going to say pick four different kinds of weed for your directions pick one each for the god and goddess and smoke each of those straight you don't have to add anything salad but I do I really do enjoy the feeling of breaking up the different herbs and putting them together as Spell components and then smoking that taking those intentions taking those ingredients and bringing that smoke and combining it in me with my intention and then blowing that back out to the universe it feels very powerful to me I I very much enjoy that in spell workor I will also say that this is absolutely just as powerful as an ingredient is any other ingredient in your spell work or your ritual work damn the stigma but it is also equally a magical tool yep and I I do have to point out that now I live in a Prohibition State I live in a state where it is only medically legal it is not that blows my mind why did you move there I'm not sure but I can't smoke here uh they actually do not allow you to smoke in Pennsylvania even if you have a medical card so once I get my medical card transferred to here I still will not be able to smoke it it has to be eaten or vaporized so I know that there are initiatives here to make it legal which I will be joining uh but until then I will only be smoking herb across the border in New York state because well sister get yourself over get your witchy self on your broom pull out hagatha hop on come over to Salem and let's just light that puppy up oh yeah you know you got to roll I can't I'll roll all the joints we'll make some sigils we'll throw them on there we will smoke it up just like back in the day thank you all so much for joining us on this High holiday of 420 guys normally we have a little funny thing and I just want to say keep it witchy but please keep it legal as well stay high stay happy and we will see you next Friday on our regularly scheduled program keep it witchy
