it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to episode 70 of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast two witchy best friends from way back get together to blaze summer bonfire siiz piles of sticky green buds while spooking each other out with the scariest ghost stories from across the US OFA telling you a [ __ ] around and find out story I'm Lea I am this week's birthday girl I'm sha happy birthday sha thanks man like and you know what the first thing I did on my birthday was what's that I woke up and smoked a big fat fat pipe you know why because I took the day off of work because everybody should take the day off from work on their birthday you should not have to work on your birthday and I didn't I agree I think birthday should be a national holiday you absolutely should be able to get the day off on your birthday I shouldn't have to ask for it off it should just be like a given on my work calendar oh that's her birthday yeah she won't be here I agree whether you're a stay-at home parent whether you work for yourself no matter what you do you should have the day off from all responsibilities as a national holiday and not to be not to be greedy but having it off paid is a bonus oh [ __ ] yeah I agree and all your weed should be free that day you should be able to smoke whatever you want whenever you want your wake and bake should be the sweetest stickiest buds ever so how was your wake and bake on your birthday shell it was fabulous and before before I get into exactly what I smoked on my birthday and what I'm smoking right now I want to just quick touch on this picture that I had texted you on my birthday what is your zodiac nug and I found this really funny because first of all someone actually came up with what is your zodiac nug just that they came up with that as hysterical I laughed my ass off I mean it helped that I was pretty high when you sent it but it's such a cute idea but I had to laugh because everybody you know anybody who's listened to us for any amount of time knows that you are a jack hair lover like you could live off Jack hair like I could live off tacos oh yeah it's one of my favorites but that is for Aries and you're not an Aries so no Jack hair for you no that's true but some of my favorite people are Aries so that makes sense so for you my friend well actually we're gonna wait for you because that's what I'm smoking right now so for us Geminis so if you are a Gemini like I am Maui woi wow I haven't smoked that in a little bit that is an old school cultivar I have not seen in a minute at least since I've been in New York no not in California either but that definitely fits you I think now for you this happens to be what I am smoking today for all you Aquarius folks out there your zodiac nug is blue dream and today I am smoking what they're calling Blue Dream number two is that like Mambo Number Five maybe I've had Jack hair number two I didn't know if it was like a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone and that's what they meant I think it's more like your grandpa cookie situation where it's possibly when they were breeding Jack when you breed to get a certain volar you'll get all sorts of different variants and so sometimes you'll get like Jack haa number one Jack ha number two and Jack haa number three and they'll all be very close to Jack hair and have the same parentage but the genetics combine just enough differently that they're a little different in flavor and effect now I don't want to disappoint people at all so I'm just gonna rattle these off quick Aries you are Jack hair Taurus Gorilla Glue Gemini Maui wawi cancer Grape Ape Leo Dosey Do Virgo bringing it in with Girl Scouts Libra cherry pie I wonder if that tastes like Cherry one of my adult children's favorites and is also a Scorpio Sour Diesel nice Sagittarius Blackjack Capricorn super max OG Aquarius blue dream and rounding it out with Pisces with sour dream I've never had sour dream I like blue dream though that makes a lot of sense being an Aquarius I would little dreamy little watery with the bluey y so this blue dream I got today this is another one of those deals this was like the Cheapo ounce good quality Cheapo ounce by the way 28.8 and this one actually has um a 1.12 CBD spring in New England is damp is a mofo and one day it's 80 and the next day it's 50 and rainy so I went with that 1 12 CBD also because my back has been hurting with the weather shifting that'll do it CBD should help the thing is you know me and my sweet love we're laughing our asses off because this [ __ ] makes you so hungry H like look at me I have a bowl of Cracker Barrel mac and cheese in my face right now last night he's eating the head off of a dark chocolate bunny it makes you hungry yeah you you've had a few two of those strains lately that are really give you the munchies hry I hav't in a while I haven't had munchy weed in a while and all of a sudden I feel like that's all I'm getting I am also smoking a very inexpensive ounce I'm not exactly sure what it is to be honest but it was 125 an ounce and I was very happy it's not the tastiest it's got that kind of heavy green piny taste that you don't like yeah it's not my favorite but it's very very Stony makes me feel very comfortable very relaxed as you can see my eyeballs are all squinty so I'm feeling very good physically it's kind of that melt into the chair weed kind of Zone into a topic so perfect for today except I keep losing my train of thought if you can stick on the topic then you can Zone in on the topic exactly before I forget though we have an email shell okay first I want to say thank you thank you thank you to everyone who has been emailing you people crack me the [ __ ] up and you are giving me life I am loving all these emails I'm not sure what happened but you know we'd get a few emails here and there and then all of a sudden like a month or so ago the dam broke and I can't keep up with all of them so if I haven't emailed you back I apologize it's just me and there's quite a few of you but thank you keep them coming and I'll get to you you're you're the email Checker so I don't know what you're talking about tell me I'm curious okay so this one stood out I wasn't going to read any emails for a little while because you know we kind of spent a little time on that lately but this person has asked for help shell and and I'm I'm scared and intrigued so let me read you this email if they want help and you're scared and intrigued I'm all in and I don't even know yet I knew you would be you've got that [ __ ] around and find out kind of attitude so let me bring it up okay one second all right who wrote us so this is from Selena and she says help help a needed haunted Ouija board situation oh my God I already love it I don't even know the rest and I love it all right so grab a bull shell this is a little long Selena's wordy okay she says Hey Leila I got to start by saying how much I adore the stoned witch's hour as a fellow very high witch and a massive fan of your hilarious podcast I'm constantly Bewitched by the way you and shell dive into all things spooky and Supernatural seriously you two are the ultimate spooky Duo I have something weird to ask you but want to give you a little backstory first to hopefully get you interested enough to help me out [ __ ] I was already interested just by the subject line Selena here's the tea I was at the first garage sale of the season in my area a month or so ago and saw an old Ouija board for sale ooh I immediately thought of you guys and decided to buy it just for fun and to maybe [ __ ] around and find out if the opportunity came up I love Selena already she's so awesome she's our people I was hoping there would be a frightening backstory but to my disappointment the lady running the sale just told me it had been hers as a kid and she barely used it her daughter had used it a bunch with her friends and was now at College boring and now she found out that that too was a lie she says I almost didn't buy it because without some past tale of a slumber party demon summoning gone wrong I wasn't as interested I love her but for $5 I thought it would look good as part of of my it's Halloween o'clock somewhere Decor so I bought it anyway good choice well spent five then she says okay I brought it home [ __ ] happened and now it's giving me the heebie jeebies and I have regrets wait a minute so she's pissed off because it's not like some badass demonic board and then she's pissed off it is right I love her so much she's just like me she says the problem began immediately like literally immediately my my car wouldn't start when I put the board on the front seat I didn't think much of it at the time because a really cute guy gave my battery a jump and everything was fine didn't connect the two she wanted to connect the two though right uh then my roommate's cat went missing the first night after I brought the Ouija board home oh I don't like cats missing that's sad she says we found her two days lat later under the neighbor's porch and the formerly sweet Cuddy K cuddly Kitty would not budge so I don't she doesn't mention the cat again she says things started going missing my roommate was getting seriously pissed at me thinking I was pranking her and weirdest of all the Ouija board that I had put on the top of the bookshelf in the living room kept being out of the box and on the table I thought my roommate was using it without my permission and in one of our fights she was accusing me of moving her angel statues and even breaking a couple and I started bitching back about her using my stuff like the Ouija board she denied it and I denied it and then we finally realized neither of us was doing what the other was mad about and we really talked and realized some seriously spooky [ __ ] had been happening since I brought the Ouija board home so of course we invited some friends over to use it of course D that's your first goto I agree I would have been there yeah I think it's a bad idea and she says and yes it was a bad idea really she says it's too much to write out here but if you agree to my proposal I'll send another email with all the creepy Deeds but let me leave you with this one bit that I know will get your interest there were orbs during our ffo [ __ ] around and find out session and now every picture taken in my apartment looks like it's infested with enough orbs to fill a Civil War battlefield all right Lea's in I was in from the subject line and Ila's in now so we're good let's do this what are we do she knew the orbs would get me absolutely she says so my proposal is this your stories on the podcast have inspired me you seem

cleanse it please help me figure out what's going on with this Eerie Ouija board your stories of ghostly encounters have given me life and I'm pretty sure you could handle the spooky board like a boss

service if you would like to send anything for us to take care of for us to do our own [ __ ] around and find out session oh I'm so excited now it should definitely be fun so I wanted to just tell you a really quick story today real quick one because it is my birthday week and I'm old as dirt now I feel like actually no but it feels that way sometimes so I wanted to see if I could find anybody who had birthday hauntings oh that's a good idea like a consistent birthday haunting because you know sometimes on your birthday you get nostalgic and you think about loved ones who may have come and gone and so I didn't know if anybody had any annual experiences so I looked it up sure as [ __ ] yeah so I came up uh upon this story and the title of the story was called I know I'd come back from heaven for a slice of that cake oh okay that sounds like some seriously damn good cake right now I want cake and this story made me think that I wish I had this thing going on with me as well so it's about this girl and her grandfather who had birthdays that were two days apart which me and my one grandfather our birthdays were eight days apart so there was it already touched a cord right from the get-go yeah I can see that and they both loved chocolate cake there was this family recipe that passed down generation to generation for this chocolate cake and the grandfather had always loved it and then the girl had always loved it so as she Grew Older grandfather passed um she got the recipe for the cake from her mother and and this also by the way this story was told by someone who lives in New York state um they lived down in the city U but grew up in upstate so that also touched a cord so every they would drive up State um to see the grandfather before he died on his birthday and they would share this cake is like you know how families do like a like a mutual birthday party because your birthdays are so close yeah so it was like their tradition to have a mutual party and share this chocolate cake you know as their special birthday thing right right so she goes up the last year that he was alive she drives up State goes up has the cake the grandfather sits down and he's eating the cake and he's kind of old they didn't say how old he was um but they made it sound like he was you know in his maybe early 90s and he said the only thing I'd come back from heaven for is a slice of this cake and they all laughed oh not to brag but you know of course I'm bragging my cake is that good yeah yeah but these weren't like spiritually kind of people these were more like hardcore Catholics when you die you go to heaven and that's it there was no I'm coming back to visit yeah so this was more of just like a sweet idea you know just yeah kind of haha I'd only leave heaven for this cake ha right wow so then you know a little while later the grandfather passes the next birthday oh that would be sad the next one would be hard the family doesn't really do much for the girl's birthday because the grandfather was really what brought in the bigger wider family so she decides on her own to drive Upstate again to the family home and spend her birthday up there alone goes up there by herself makes this I'm going to have my damn birthday cake even if I'm here alone kind of thing yeah sounds like a nice ritual to do for yourself I would do that she felt this nagging voice in her head saying leave a slice out for your grandpas kind of like what you and I would consider like an offering yes yeah something that you and I would probably do as a matter of course especially on someone's birthday after they passed especially when you've spent your whole life celebrating together like that as well yeah very much that would be a tradition that you would want to keep going it would it would feel right to keep that tradition so she said she kept feeling this nagging voice telling her to leave a slice for him so she gets the cake done she sits down she cuts herself a slice cuts a freaking slice and sets it in the like what would be the chair next to her and kind of does this you know happy birthday grandpa I miss you thank she starts eating her cake sure as [ __ ] a chunk of cake goes missing from the piece of cake next to her wait a minute really like a chunk of cake is just gone no person there no mice no Fork just gone then she said she could just smell like I guess her grandfather had this specific cologne he always wore and she just like had a wave of this cologne so she kind of had the my grandpa's here oh yeah didn't think anything of it well kind of was a little weirded out but then like went about her life the next year goes up to the family home makes the [ __ ] cake I'd be waiting for it to happen again I'd be freaked out she didn't leave out a slice of cake this time she said that it like didn't think about it or whatever sits down to eat the cake and all of a sudden starts getting these wafs of her grandfather's cologne really for the third year she lost lost the recipe had a move or what have you lost the recipe went up to the house again anyway and was just going to go spend the weekend up there without the recipe and the cake all of a sudden out of nowhere she goes to read a book pulls a book off the shelf opens it up there's a copy of the recipe in the book oh [ __ ] yeah that's awesome it seems as though every year on her birthday when she goes to the family home now the cake the grandfather the alone spooky [ __ ] happens he came back from heaven for that cake oh that's so sweet that he's keeping the tradition alive I just it wasn't some long deep oh we're all gonna die haunting but I thought it was cute and birthday and there was cake and I'm high and I like cake I want chocolate cake no that is super sweet I would love that that would be such a nice connection that would make me never spend my birthday anywhere else or with anybody ever again I would definitely want to have that cake every birthday and try to go back there for sure to keep but imagine losing the recipe and then showing up and opening some random book and the recipe is on a paper inside that book oh I know I love that part coincidences like that just make it I love those those make me so happy they apparently had made that recipe for multiple Generations so it was bound to be lying around somewhere yeah it makes sense that there would be a copy somewhere in the house but how synchronistic and how just freaking fun that it happened to be in the book that she opened up you know like he led her there I mean just being the type of person that doesn't necessarily believe in that type of stuff if you're sitting there and your grandfather says oh yeah I'd come back from heaven for this cake and then for like three or four years after like he literally shows up on his birthday for the cake yeah I'd have a hard I have a hard time with like the piece of the cake going missing that sounds pretty epic to me that that's big they said the Piece of Cake missing was only the first year yeah I know but I I I don't know I have trouble buying that I mean the rest of it sounds very plausible to me but I don't know I I would love to see something that blatant happen I just have a hard time believing that part but the waves of cologne oh absolutely I've actually experienced stuff like that before so I know that that stuff can happen but I just I'm kind of with you there's energy shifting and then there's just making stuff materialistically just appear yeah that would take a lot of energy from what I understand but the scent thing I mean smells are so tied to memory oh yeah and they can really help trigger memories and and it's amazing to me how many different hauntings and paranormal experiences will have that scent tie in for me for my father's father he used to smoke Cherry tobacco and it's a very distinctive smell it's very comforting to most of the people in my family because we associate it with him yeah I had a relative who smoked that Cherry tobacco out of a pipe and the minute I smell it it takes me right back to that person in that moment yeah and there are times when particularly if anybody in the family has gotten together and talks about him when that scent will start to kind of waft through the room because I know that some sense will like walls will hold on to them or floors will hold on rooms will hold on to a this is different than that but this will happen even Outdoors or in a place where he never was and you can still smell it yeah and it's such an ubiquitous part of so many different hauntings it's one of my favorites because it's such a common universal theme I love haunting some birthdays that are nice I do too that's a nice thing and I'm glad you had fun on your birthday I didn't have no ghosty experience though but that's okay I'm okay I'll make it you know they're having over this summer there's a couple different groups that I want to get in touch with including a paranormal group that's in Upstate New York that I'm going to try and see if we can get on the show and maybe even go on a paranormal investigation with so I think you and I should try to get together and do some active [ __ ] around and find out sessions like go to a couple of these haunted places while I'm in an area that's not too far from you over the summer we should maybe check out one or two of these places sh what do you think okay I'm putting it out there and the listeners are my Witnesses I am free the whole month of August oh okay book me up book me up I'm
