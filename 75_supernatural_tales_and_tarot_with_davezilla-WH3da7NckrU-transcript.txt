illustration most of his life he's also been reading tarot since 1979 has been initiated into various Traditions from Garian to Santo to accordion and more as a true seeker of knowledge welcome Dave hi thanks to having me thank you so much for being here and actually before we get into your fantastic new deck tarot of The Unexplained that's coming out on August 5th from Red wheel wiser Publications shell has been on pins and needles waiting for this deck and she has a little story for you Dave so we have a partnership with red wheel wiser and you know we get get the cataloges in advance so I'm looking at these cataloges last fall okay we're talking September October of 2023 of yeah of 2023 and I see a deck listed there that's about Cryptids now in our previous podcast that we did a few years back the stoned Witch is hour I am crypted girl I love all Cryptids if I could go and find every single one I would so all I wanted in life was a Tarot deck that had something to do with cryptids in it I find this and it says it will be released I think I said April April and I'm like all right it's September I can wait till April and see I'm a Gemini have no patience so September to April was really hard for me so then it gets to be about February March and I I was like Lila you know we're we're getting ready to put in an order from Red wheel Weiser you need to get me this deck and I've known now I've known this has been at the top of her list she has been waiting every time I put in order she's like Lea can we get that deck I know it says April but can we get it I'm like no no just wait just wait so February March comes along and she's like sorry sh it says August I'm like are you kidding me I said I'm gonna go find the Creator flipped a chair I did I'm gonna find the creator of this deck and somehow get my hands on it before August well granted it was July but I got my hands on the deck so I've literally waited 10 months for this deck we've wanted this deck for quite a while because we are very much into paranormal stories uh the the foran phenomenon all of that and so we would love to talk about some of this with you absolutely yeah and also I I couldn't help the deck being delayed that wasn't on me I was told the same thing I was told no I was told oh this GNA be our spring highlight the deck I'm like great and then it was like spring came around they're like it's coming out in August I'm like oh okay I'll I'll be honest with you I was ready to come hunt you down well you could have gotten from me the original deck um because at first I during covid was when I designed it and I printed 150 decks on my own dime and they I didn't spring for the boxes I just did like velvet bags they gave them really cheap um with the ducks like was like 25 cents each or something for a velvet bag and I'm like oh that's worth it so um I ordered 150 of those I sold 100 of them and the other 50 I mostly gave to friends or people that were in the deck and I still have some laying around but yeah if you had asked I would gladly have sent you one don't say that this deck is slightly different I'll send you one now because you have to see the difference because they're two there are six cards that are different really oh wow okay mainly because I couldn't get some um model releases in time okay and I had one Flatout refusal um the skeptic of ghosts was originally James rondy and his family thought I was making fun of him as a state so they out refused but some of the other ones were just more um like Avi lman he we just couldn't get a hold of him in time he was a UFO expert James Meldrum who's a big foot expert said absolutely you can but he that's all he wrote in the email and he didn't sign the PDF so they were like we can't use it I'm like oh oh No and then one of my friends John I don't know if you guys know John Tenny he's uh he's been on lots of the ghost hunting shows and he does he does research for almost every paranormal show but he happens to be a neighbor of mine and we did our first ghost hunting together like 20 years ago and um he was going to be the the fo card the ghost stalker and I had him on the card and then he he was on in England somewhere inaccessible on some ghost tour for like a month and I couldn't get his his uh signature back in time so he did send it but it didn't make it in time for the printer they were holding as long as they could so his card had to be replaced too okay so that actually brings up two questions that I have for you sure I do love the art it's very vibrant I like the amount of detail that you put into each card but in particular what I very much like are the court cards I like how you've reimagined them as the the fan the skeptic the Hunter and The Advocate and the skeptic yes The Advocate those energies still kind of matched what the real Court cards are they do but I I love the characters I love the realism and the are these based on real people all of them or just Okay skeptic of portals is my wife um the skeptic of of knockers is my best friend Dave um he and I have parallel lives and we were born three days apart oh wow the skeptic of saucers is Patrick from gusoline alley he's the he's the bartend head bartender there and it's a notorious if you come to Detroit everybody knows about gusoline alley it's his hidden notorious Dive Bar okay and he is a hilarious guy so he was great for this their personalities absolutely come through in the energies of these cards and that is one of the things that I very very much love about this deck thank you yeah I tried really hard on that I kind of feel it a little more of an oracle deck rather than a Tarot deck because of a lot of the differences but I love it for that and we'll get into that a little bit later but I am just absolutely in love with the people in this deck because they are so vibrant and so alive and the the energies of them the personalities very much jump out and make the cards that much richer and deeper in detail now I have a question for you Dave now you've picked a set of Cryptids what made you pick those particular Cryptids to use in the deck because there's hundreds hundreds oh I I agonized over that I agonized over it like some of them I couldn't figure out like I really want my favorite crypted of all is the totel worm from Germany and I could not find a place to put that I was hoping for the Wampus cat oh so I have been asked by several people who have the deck will you make an extension pack with more Cryptids and more ghosts and I was like well I'll talk to wiser there's no reason I couldn't so there may be more coming I'm going to put my vote in for that vot in because one of the workshops that I teach is on Frankenstein or Magpie decks and the Alyan tarot is a very popular Kickstarter type deck and it's based on the idea of adding more or taking away from the deck until you make a very personal deck I would love to see a compan Oracle deck or something that could be mixed in or added to this deck that would be very cool especially if you could add more ghosts more C more ladies in white which are my favorite yeah I thought about I really wanted there was a whole bunch of Lady and whites I want I could almost do an entire deck of them yes a whole suit you could do a whole suit of ladies and white absolutely I had to throw in a Detroit crypted which was the nine Rouge which is our local devil uh the nine Rouge has been known Detroit since the 1700s when uh Cadillac first discovered the area and conquered it we used to be a French colony and he was told by fortune teller um that he was going to run into an imp and he was to ignore it and and leave it alone it was a local spirit and she was basically describing like genius Loy and telling them this is this is a land Spirit leave the hell alone good advice usually he ignored her he sawed along the Detroit River and beat it with it came and said be gone you imp oh no everything fell apart in his life he ended up getting losing his military rank his company collapsed he lost his fortune and he ended up in jail back in England so that's what happens when you with land Spirits you mess with the genus loai yeah so and now we have a giant there's a giant parade every year if you look up nine Rouge Detroit you will see this parade for this every year where they either half the people are trying to chase it out and half the people are like no no keep the D Rouge yeah there's a lot of them like that depending on the crypted and the and the location a lot of them become a little bit like anti-heroes maybe yes same thing with the Hodag the Hodag in Wisconsin is a big Festival too The Moth Man and I think you you had that with the the bridge Silver Bridge yeah yes because that was The Moth Man didn't The Moth Man appear and like foretold that point yeah in Point Pleasant Pennsylvania I love that oh yeah Pennsylvania is Rife with with Cryptids we we have them around every corner corner here do you really oh yeah like one of have you heard of the squonk yes the first time I've heard of it actually was in the early 70s from that uh Genesis song There's a okay hold on Genesis has an entire song about the squonk legend are you kidding me it's in the trick- of the tale album it's actually one of their bigger hits even though people for their old stuff I feel like I failed as a Pennsylvanian and a gen xer I feel terrible oh my God you love it it's all about how it cries and cries and disappears and everything and yeah all right well yeah that's the squonk now I'm going to go back a little bit to something else that you said just a little bit ago and you talked about going on ghost hunts now I understand that you have seen quite a few phenomena maybe not a crypted but you have experienced quite a few different phenomena in your life and could you tell us about anytime you've seen a ghost or gone on a ghost hunt yeah um the first ghost hunt I went on was was like I said with John Tenny um and it was we got covered by the Detroit Free Press for some reason a whole page about it back then there wasn't a whole lot of equipment so we had a a night vision scope a tape recorder and I mean the oldfashioned you know with an actual like cassette tape and buttons yes great yes are you talking like 80s is what's that are you talking like the 80s is early 90s yeah late 80s so you know handheld tape recorder with all the buttons and then we had a I think a we had something up for magnetic detection it wasn't like an EMF reader like they have now but um I mean now there's so many apps and things that canest back then there wasn't that much but our City Royal Oak is is like goes back to the early 1800s so there's a lot of very very old Graves out here and so we were walking around in there and we that night we didn't happen to see anything and I think it's because we were being followed by a whole crew of media people from the yeah that can change a Vibe for sure yeah um but my first encounter actually with something was when I was in college I had a friend and she and I used to like go around in like abandoned places down at the end of our city there used to be an old abandoned Rest Home called Manor Haven which is an evil name already that just sounds creepy and yeah and we went in this place and everything had been left from the 60s and not changed like there were still clothes folded on the edges of the beds oh wow the whole place and just covered with dust and the first thing that happened was we opened up Carrie walked over and she opened up the the refrigerator in the the looked like a kitchen and all these bags of dried blood fell out that were for transfusions oh no and they were just covered in maggots we were like I think the maggots the maggots would have freaked me out honestly yeah it wasn't a good start and this is on a Saturday morning well then we saw this attic there was like a stairwell going up the attic Rock oh there's got to be something cool up there so we we walk all the way to the top and then we hear a noise behind us we both look around and there's this dark shadow at the bottom of the stairs and the door slam shut and we went running back down and we were locked in and we're like crap and Carrie goes whatever let's just go look around the attic while we're here maybe it'll open up later or we can find a window that's like everything that you were there for yeah well maybe we'll find a window or something we can get out I'm like okay so we go up there and then you know how back then they used to have Rafters with all the insulation but they never really oh with no floor yeah so but the floor was covered with clothes and we were wondering if the staff had been like stealing clothes from from the people who stayed there and just throwing it up there or if it was just left over from people who may passed on and they just that's just where they threw it all but you couldn't see the floor at all so she was walking and she thought she was on the steps and she went boom right through the roof and got like caught up to her shoulder and as soon as I pulled her out the door opened up at the basement wow to the stairs we were like so weird yeah weird see now I would think between seeing the black figure the door slamming and locking and falling through the floor I'd be like should we maybe at least go down a level well we kind of left after I think we're done here I think we're done yeah yeah and another another one I saw that I did not like at all was one night I lived in a used to live in a flat where there was two an upper and lower flat and I was dating a witch and downstairs was like uh some friends of ours or a couple and they were both witches and we woke up the two of us woke up and my girlfriend time she like pounded me she goes what is that and up in the corner was this black pulsating mass and it didn't seem to have any shape to it it was like almost like smoke that was stuck in a corner almost like cloud like very but you couldn't see through it and we turned the light on and it was still there so we grabbed some um salt and threw at it and it just made it go away um but the next morning the downstairs neighbors met us for coffee and said oh my God we couldn't sleep there was this black thing that showed up in our room and it was I'm like oh my God we did too but we were smart enough to throw salt at it they did too we don't know if we s it to each other or we both had one and it disappeared but it was the same time roughly we figured I I've never seen that thing again and I don't want to it was really awful now what is your experience with seeing portals because I've heard that you've seen portals I've yeah there's some portals that are like um when you're mainly in a forest you can tell the trees are kind of bent in a way that then not right and you know and you can get that feeling where there's like there's some kind of ancestral Spirit going yeah you know that that's that's a land Spirit that's like I'll talk to you wink wink nudge nudge exactly and I'm all for those so I will follow them but I've never had anything where I went through those and ended up like in another place or another time or anything like that like Charles for has reported people having done but definitely they had some good experiences with land spirits that way it almost reminds me of like going in a Fairy Circle or going down a fairy path you know you're going down it and you're not sure you're staying in this reality so that's kind of the same thing yeah absolutely it's like I know if you go in those things too you can just sit down and close your eyes and you know and start going like a meditative journey through and see what they're goingon to you and usually it's a lot easier to talk to them that way than just hanging out and waiting for them to show up and a lot of those places like particular like you were talking about genus loai and Lance Spirits when you go into the woods or you go to some of these sacred places or you know to a river or something there's sometimes you can just feel these places energetically as you're walking along you be like oh you know this feels like this has a really really nice Vibe this has a really nice feeling to it I'm going to sit here and maybe meditate with this space for a little while those I think are more common than people think right and and then there's also the reverse there's times when you feel those when you're like they definitely do not want humans here right yeah they're like get out that was that was kind of my last experience um the last time I was in Lea's backyard really she she led me down a path where she's creating like a ritual Circle and we went down there late lsh at night and it really felt like we were infiltrating a party that we were not invited to and it was like we were being stared at like what the hell are you doing here like it was literally like we walked in on a dinner party that we weren't invited at and it it was it was weird because it was definitely like it wasn't a bad feeling but it was a we don't want you here feeling yeah right most of the time it's not antagonistic it's just kind of like this isn't your place kind of like you're invading my space kind who invited you exactly can I see the invitation yeah exactly yeah okay here's a question for Shell you for Dave Zilla as magic users as people who feel energy and work with energy if you encountered a place like that say say you're on vacation and you go to an Airbnb in a cool place and you walk into this house and the vibe is get out what do you do like what what do you reach for like what would you do as as someone who who's an energetic magic worker type person well one thing I always bring with me is um I'll never not have it on me he's reaching in his pocket right now you know what um Ela looks like in in santaria the little clay head with the face yeah okay so you can also get a stone that's fed to him and it's it's a like extension of him that you can bring with you and I feel 100 times safer because he's he's the Arisha of travel and he's kind of like Mercury he's like travel and obstacles and trickster enough so I bring him with me but also um I did have that happen there was a there's a hotel I had to stay at for work one time that was notoriously haunted in San Francisco and they gave me the haunted room of course I'm like well course and sense something about you and put you in that room yeah and I I took a really creepy picture that I think I still have it I'm almost POS I do I just don't know where but I know I have it uh faing the window looking back at me and it's I'm up on several floors up oh wow but it was kind of disturbing but yeah that those I usually just like sometimes I'll I'll draw a pinnacle on the pillow and on the door with my finger and just you know and talk to be like the out of here I'm an over Packer Leila and I went on a road trip a few months back I just pack a fullon altar I just bring the whole  with me um I actually do have a a separate travel alter um and when I am going and staying somewhere that is part of my packing list yeah a lot of times I wear my le to the um the beads that you see because each of those is fed to a different Arisha and they're those are pretty potent but um sometimes I don't like carrying them because they're they're heavy and they're sweaty when you wear them and um a lot of times I just I don't like people touching them and always when you travel the um TSA wants to pick them up oh these are pretty people are very hands when it comes to ritual stuff people get all of a sudden real handsy espe with bright colored things yeah but Dave Zilla literally pulled out of his pocket right here and now his protection Talisman the re show y having something on you that's charged for protection is great you can use incense smoke you can use music all sorts of things to create a temporary safe space for you even if you can't if you're not going to be there long enough to make friends or at least get along with the genus Loc sky or with the energies of that place there's temporary protection like that yeah yeah and I got the pentacle idea from um a Hindu friend of mine who said oh I draw the OM on my pillow before I go to bed if I'm having bad dreams and I'm like oh that's a great idea and I tried it it does work you can even get those fancy pillow sprays and do it be all cute like that if you wanted to Y I love that I'm I'm a Sigil person I like sigils sigils yes I know you are a uh a discordian you're also U chaos magic I'm into a little bit of that but I love I love sigils and drawing sigils on your pillows on your blankets on your windows on your doors yeah fabulous fabulous signature in my in my artwork is gave but it's also a pinnacle but I made sigil out of my name so I've seen your art on uh Instagram and other social media you you have your art up there I just recently saw an aquarius which I guess you've done a little while back that no I didn't work on that I just was I was posting that just because I was so amazed by that book Evo Dominguez wrote that book and I was like so good oh oh no it was a picture oh the picture oh yeah I did do I did do a whole series of witches by the Zodiac sence yes yes no the picture that you had done not the book that I am actually desperately waiting to get my little Aquarian hands on but no it was it was an art piece that you had done yes I did do this year um 42 paintings of witches this year and each one was like one was like storm witch or swamp witch or whatever and they're all most of them were done in sort of a early art nvo sort of style which I like working in a lot that's something that I really love about this deck because so often nowadays not that there's anything wrong with this but you'll see a famous author or a famous witch or or magic user of some type work with an artist to create a deck which is fabulous we get beautiful works of art really creative interesting things but I love that this is one person this is you you did the art here you came up with the meanings for the cards this is all your input from start to finish which gives it a whole different feel than something that's created by multiple people um not that one is better than the other I just think it's different and I I enjoy the seamlessness between the actually that that that was one thing that stood out to me I was like Wow sweet someone who did all of it all of it um and again not knocking you know but it's rare to see someone who's done all of it and that stuck out to me with this deck and by the way since we're speaking about that kudo on the book because I love that you actually I have a card I'm I'm holding for down the road in a minute I love the fact that you actually have colored pictures of each card in the book you know the little pamphlet books are great but this is like a comprehensive book in pamphlet size and I love that yeah it was really I worked really hard with Wiser's art director Katherine to make sure I had enough room to get in like the correspondences the descript deson of the card the meaning of the card and a meditation if possible and also whatever phenomenon would be be their experience that you wanted to pull that card for or that may be caused by that card because I did notice that this card seem to bring up a lot of unusual energies too it's a weird deck it is and I I love that you reimagined each of the suits you know you went with um the knocking sticks and ghosts portals and flying saucers instead of Wands swords cups and pet yeah I tried to stick with the elements but not the yeah not the same suits yeah you definitely kept you kept the feeling of it although I'm gonna have to say I am not a fan of say ITA say it I know what you're gonna say no you think you know what I'm gonna say you think I'm going to talk about the gilding but we'll get into that in a minute um but no I um I do feel that wands are air rather than fire and swords are fire half of us I think out here believe that way but I like how you reimagined all of the suits for this deck in the tarot of The Unexplained the suits are a little bit different you have made the suits swords are ghosts Pentacles are flying saucers portals are cups and Wands become the Sasquatch knocking sticks and if I'm correct with the knocking sticks that's the same Sasquatch going through a long mural is that right it is correct she's going through a whole story now did you paint that all as one piece or yeah it's it's a N9 foot illustrator board going yeah it was really hard to break that apart and make it work but I did get it to work there's stories within stories here in your suits Beyond just what the regular tarot meanings are and now you have a long history of tarot not just of art you've been reading cards since like 1979 yep you are a Tarot reader this wasn't something I decided to do yeah no you you have a solid background I do love the different stories that are told like the portals I just happened to open it up to it I know the fan of portals this yeah these two whoops got backward fit together they match up together yeah and you have a lot of instances of things like that in the cards where they they tell a bigger story than just what a traditional deck would tell yeah and some of that was an idea I took from um I used to use for a long time the witches tarot by Ellen Ken Reed that's sh's favorite yeah that was my I think I had that deck longest and it's finally mine is so worn out I can't even use it there's I got three copies so yeah I had yeah um yeah that was a brilliant deck and I had the original with the it was borderless I know they redid it with borders and it was like yeah mine doesn't have borders good because the barded one looks awful but the uh original one was so good and I loved how a lot of times the moon or whatever Planet would be would line up with another card up in the corner and you make different types of arrangements and you just see the cards and the relationship ship between them differently and that's what made me think oh God I need to do things like that like take these cards and think about which ones actually I've had interesting relationships with and then put those together in this deck so that I other people pick up on that too hopefully now I I said earlier that gives a little bit of an oracle vibe to me partly because a lot of the the meanings are different they're not exactly the same there's so much different here yeah which is fine I love that in in someone's deck it should be it shouldn't be cookie cutter or something else yeah and I think part of that is to this day I have never owned a r Rider weight deck didn't you start out with the th deck like who would do that to themselves worst freaking deck for a beginner I didn't know any better I didn't know any better I knew who aliser Crowley was as a teenager and I'm like oh this probably a good deck aler c i can Trump you Dave because before I got that witch's tarot I thought the Aquarian deck was the way to go oh the one that's an Italian yeah I have that one too yeah yeah that one's real tough I bought that one too I'm like are nice illustrations and I'm like I don't read Italian very well yeah yeah not not the best introduction no and I love Pamela Coleman Smith's art I think she's brilliant she did so much for the for tarot but that kind of style it doesn't really appeal to me too much so I was like and I think that's that's what's made me a Tarot collector um because one secret I need to tell you is I have about 200 different decks it's an obsession we'll call I don't know if we'll call it an addiction or Obsession but we'll call it it grows every time I leave the house I have access to a spreadsheet so I don't accidentally get her one that she already has oh my god wow yeah reach spreadsheet level but what I like about this deck is I like the vibe is it gives it it's something about the blues and the purples this is very blues and purples heavy and it kind of I don't want to say it touches a deeper spiritual cord but a little bit um and I don't know if it's the color combinations or my fascination with everything you've combined into this because she likes Cryptids and ghost stories more than just about anything what I love more than that is UFOs so this is like this is like the everything I've ever wanted in a deck right here nice GL I like to hear that for that thank you you're welcome um yeah the deck palette was a little different for me but it was it just seemed like it was the right kind of colors like using a lot of cayenne Reds and yeah deep purples and a lot of deep sea greens and things like that colors that aren't normally used in decks before I unleash Leila on you what made you or what would make any any person and and this is just an honest question what made you pick the Gilded edges I did not that was wier's call okay that was a surprise to me okay why they're not my favorite I I think they look pretty they look look beautiful you look at it it's gorgeous but I am a user of decks I am not a looker at of tarot decks so I've been shuffling your deck not even a lot and the gilding already started to like Bend and like flake and you know it's pretty it stands up okay but from other gilded Decks that I've had and just from using it for a couple days if I heavily use this deck those gilded edges are going to look terrible and it's it's the curse of the Gilded deck it's not any deck in particular it's it's we've talked about other gilded decks in the same thing and and I think that sometimes that I'm glad it wasn't your choice I didn't even know they were doing that it does look pretty and I know people like the gilding but I'm just going to tell you right now listeners it does have silver gilding and it looks beautiful it goes great with the color of the deck but like most gilding you're going to want to be very careful how you Shuffle how often you Shuffle because the gilding tends to Chip and Flake and dent very very easily so your beautiful gilded edges if you use this type of deck a lot um will show signs of wear pretty quickly if you're using them for meditation or Journal PS uh you don't have to worry about that quite so much the back of the deck has a nice uh you can't tell if it's reversed or not I am a fan of that's important to me yeah me too that was one thing I didn't like about the witches tarot was you can always tell when a card's reversed because the pentacle was either upright or it was upside down and it was slightly up above the center too yep um and the back of mine is actually if you look really close there's a pieces from each of the four right yeah and skulls and yeah this is great skulls there's UFOs there's um the sticks are little pointing these things sticking out yeah it's it's very simple but also full of meaning which I fully expect from someone with an illustration in chaos magic background that was my favorite part was doing the back so as I was going through the major Kaa I did notice that they all have I love that you have injured cold in here so freaking creepy so creepy he's so creepy but I loved that you had the astrological stars on a lot of not all of but most of the major ARCA and it matches up with like the general I know that there's a lot of different ideas but there's a general idea of what sign goes with which when I was researching that I realized how much tarot uh creators disagree on Stars and um went generally with what the uh old Golden Dawn did because they seem to have the best and the most consistent approach to to the astrology um and other readers I've spoken to said the exact same thing they're like yeah the gold Dawn's only ones that got it right everybody else just kind of guessed at it and like there was a couple cards I saw that had 13 different constellations but I think it adds an extra depth to these cards that I really like I have already picked a favorite card it's a extraction card number 12 oh yeah that's a that's a cool one and honestly other than the person being swept up by the UFO the next thing that popped right out to me was those constellations and that was really what almost what my focus went on almost like my focus kind of ignored the rest of the picture so to say and honed in just on that constellation I'm looking at I a lot of people told me they immediately knew that was the hangman card because they were like he's in the position of the hangman I'm like yes on purpose yep I wanted to Quick ask you speaking of the of the UFO piece to this I too when I was in ninth grade which was just a few minutes ago when I was in ninth grade most of my town saw three distinct UFOs people calling the police similar story to you people calling the local Army Reserve Base and basically all of us being told that we're not so cuckoo and it really didn't happen even though a town of about 40,000 people saw it right did your experience seeing a UFO as a younger person did that influence any of this suit of cards at all absolutely yeah I didn't I same thing like when I was a little kid I didn't know if there was aliens or not but when I actually saw this thing and then us our entire neighborhood being told it's an advertising plane and I'm like planes don't hover unless you have a Harrier jump Jet and those things would have been blasting exhaust into our face and we would have been burned and and also harer jumpjets aren't round they're triangular kind of yeah we all saw this thing it was not marked with uh you know there was no military advertising just yeah it was just it was just a set of lights that went around and that was it everything else was dark and I noticed that on the cards they have little sets of lights that go around yeah that's why I was wondering did that experience influence that and I I also kind of wanted to pay an homage to the old 50s kind of look of flying saucers being like and I used to work at the Los alos National Laboratory and I got we got to go down to Roswell a couple times and so I got probably can't talk about any of that can you um I can't not not a lot um but if he tells us he'll have to take our tarot decks away no no take mine away yeah no it's we're the ones go away that's not funny that's not funny no yeah you get erased you get disappeared you get disappeared yeah um I didn't work on anything big big enough like that to to worry about it but it was kind of cool when I was there they had just started the human Geno project so that kind of cool to see and they were working on a particle accelerator and a lot of coolu it was neat yeah it was a really neat experience and working with these people that were so intelligent that they never even wrote wrote their math out it was just in their head all those complex things you always see on blackboards and pictures and stuff it's like these guys just did in their head in seconds you know and they're always like oh yeah yeah you're right yeah that Matt checks out like wait no one got out of calculator so after lunch did they take you down and show you the spaceship I tried so many times and so many way to ask them and they would just be real quiet for a second and kind of look down and then change the subject talk about respond with a yes or no they would never deny or anything they just changed something now there were things that they would deny like if I asked about a certain thing that was in not in my clearance level they would just go you know I can't go there which is kind of how we were told to talk about things like if someone ask you how was work today you say it was great I worked you know gotcha but that was one area they just were not funny about not funny no no wink wink nudge nudge just Chang the subject but was that was any of that ever code for we have alien is in the basement oh I know they did they something there I know they did absolutely we know they do we know it the military has practically admitted it we know yeah I didn't get to see it but they did they have something I know they so you've experienced everything but a crypted are you a crypted hunter are you seeking out finding a crypted and if not why not my theory is crypted our our genius low guy okay Spiritual Beings that appear and disappear and don't want to be seen by most people and the people that don't want to see them and aren't expecting to see them are the ones that going to see them going along with that thought apparently I'm from a weird place in Upstate New York because we also had a stretch when I was probably in about eighth grade where for two weeks all around our town there was Bigfoot sightings for two weeks straight which I'm from a region just a tad bit south of ader on Deck mountains so it's plausible and near the cat skill mountains as well but for about two weeks straight every single day in the news there was Bigfoot sightings in the area so do you think that some of these Cryptids sometimes want to come out and be seen how how can a bunch of people see this constantly I think there's also you know like group think of mass where a lot of times people just start getting caught up in it like a hysteria they want see it too and they see a squirrel or or a bear and all of a sudden that's a that's big but there black bear from where I'm from look so much like black bears and you are talking about an area of New York state where people regularly go hunting and shoot cows that they think are deer so factual statements factual statements yeah so it's possible they saw a squirrel and went Bigfoot no yeah the only thing that throws a wrench in that for me is up in parts of Michigan where they see the the dog man and I don't know if you've read about that one but these people say it's basically looks like a wolf looks like a werewolf and it is attacked people and animals so there's people with literal bites out of them from oh wow so that's what that one kind of throws me off I'm like okay there's something out there whether it's a Rabid wolf or a because we do have wolves in Michigan whether it's that or there actually is something strange out there but so many people have seen it and they're very very specific about their descriptions and real real consistent um the only ones I don't believe is when people tell me it had glowing eyes so I'm like eyes don't emit light they did you'd be blind maybe they just see the the Reflection from the toped they said that that would be one thing if they said it's eyes were reflecting like a dogs I'd go okay a lot of the Dogman people that's they said they said their eyes were pink like a dogs that doesn't sound as cool though but I don't hear but other people are like it was glowing red eyes that sounds better they get S dramatic effect lay off to Jack Daniels okay Travel Channel call us send the three of us we'll go crypted hunting across the country we'll bring a healthy dose of skepticism and and all the tools we can muster and we'll see if we can find them so I I'm not leaving Massachusetts till I find that puck WGY man that's got to be list all right P that's a good one right next to my Wampus cat there you go he's right up there so I do have okay we're gonna get serious for a second because I have a terrible complaint about your deck okay one of my favorite favorite myths Legends ghost stories are all of the lady and white stories across the whole country love them I I love the lore behind them I love the truth and the Legends I'm just absolutely fascinated with those ghost stories in particular and one of the most famous maybe the originator of Lady in White stories is Laona um the I knew you were gonna mention that card and yeah she is the this is like a a cautionary tale this is a woman who her husband or her lover took another lover and in a fit of Madness and rage she drowned their children and then right realized what she had done came to her senses and either killed herself or either way spent eternity trying to find her children and make up for this how did you come up with her as the empress because those two things seem completely opposite she kept popping up to me every time I looked for something else she wanted to be the empress is what he wanted to he did and I was like that was the only card where I had like a spirit literally like insisting they'd be in the deck and which card it was and that kind of makes sense okay then I really didn't really wanted to do some of those English white ladies or gray ladies that made a little more sense and I also thought about some of the spiritual um like enlightened kind of enlightened Master kind of people that would have been better for an empress but um that one she just was I'm like okay wow you want this card I'm like I'll put you in never argue with an insistent woman no not La especially but no the empress is more like that that nurturing fulfilling Maybe Who was in life you know yeah but there are there are a lot of of tales to her where she protects other people's children and I was like oh okay that's true and sometimes people do call upon Laona to protect children but I don't know how common that is so I don't know I'm not really sure if I can buy laurona as as the empress I mean that's okay it's it's all right to re-envision these cards to have different meanings and the meaning for Larona does not have to match the empress just because she's in that Empress position I mean La yarona is she's the Wailing woman and she's in some Legends she's out to kill other people's children to take them for her own so it's very difficult to see it as an empress card replacement but as its own card as its own thing I can see it as that so I I can see that I I can I can get into that and I also saw one version of the tale where she was blamed for the for the murder of the the children and she didn't do it yeah it's certainly A A Tale of a mother who's grieving so hard for her children that she's walking the Earth forever looking for them um so so I can see that a little bit it's still still a little bit of a a difficult one for me to see as the empress but if I see her as the card laurona in your deck it makes perfect sense she fits in beautifully with the description um I don't know how she would feel about threesoms but I suppose that that could be part of it pulling in one little bit of traditional in there yeah but so if I I do have to separate her a little bit from the traditional idea of the empress in the deck and look a little bit beyond that like some of the other cards in your deck have different stories to tell yeah like the lovers card you cannot it we had such a different approach on that that I was like all right you're this is gonna throw people off a lot but that's too bad and that's okay and that's why we go to different types of decks to get someone else's Viewpoint and opinion and different angle on this card so but that's a little bit why I said I have a hard time looking at it as like a traditional Tarot deck because some of the cards yeah it's just not and that's the beauty of it yeah that's what when I pick decks to read for myself or to do like tarot journaling I like to pick Decks that have non-traditional imagery and non-traditional meanings because I'm I am so steeped in the the writer weight Smith you know idea of what they are that this really helps me tap into a different part of my magical self my subconscious so I I really love your deck for that but I definitely could not call it a traditional deck that's not an insult but deck at all this um is one of my friends locally and he is also really into cryptides really into ghost and he has a podcast too so Chris uh he um actually came up with a lot of the ideas while we were talking over beer and one of the ideas he had that I loved was the lovers card that he said what if instead of two people you had two Spirits in one body and I said oh that'd be cool he goes maybe it's a skin changer maybe it's like some kind of shape-shifting thing and I'm like that's a great idea so we thought of using the starts with skin and ends with w and I won't say the rest of the word because I got a when I was posting these to Instagram every night I got a nice little comment from someone that said no and I dm' the person back and it turned out he was a part of Navajo Nation and he said I said did I get the details wrong he goes no no they're very good uh please do not call that energy up on us or on you you will regret it so just please find a different safer Shape Shifter we thought okay well the Irish puka is pretty safe but same thing the puka can appear as a woman as a as a rabbit as a horse that takes you off on a ride or or all kinds of things so can offer choices you know it's a can be a trickster can be I I love that card I think that's a great card and relationships can be all those things too you know yeah yeah I think this deck is fantastic for that not only does it scratch the itch of all these different paranormal and fantastic events you know that shell and I are fascinated with anyway it's fun but it also has very serious very solid very good tarot background in it uh some of it reimagined which I absolutely adore that's the point of why we want more than WR orwe Smith decks is because we want these things reimagined you know I want to see the yeti as the hermit these are why we we as a people me as a obsessive addictive collector tarot collector this is why I always am seeking out a bigger bad better deck because I don't want every single hermit card to mean exactly the same thing every time you know this strikes a different chord to me as a crypted lover than the hermit card is going to you know what I'm saying absolutely and also when I look at the writer way duck I see a lot of very gender typical roles too which I don't think apply to society right now right correct a lot of those things I tried to like eliminate or make them thr because I I feel bad for people who don't see themselves in those cards and when everything is done is a very you know very old-fashioned binary relationship type thing we don't live in the wrer weight world anymore no no and that's one thing I have a big problem with so I was like well I I can make my cards a little more fluid um and much like you you know I've been reading cards for 30 years I didn't buy a writer weight version until within the last five or so years because I don't know I I was one of those that's tooo basic but when I when I got my hands on that Ellen Canon Reed uh witches tarot that spoke to me in a way that writer weight didn't and this speaks to me in a way that writer weight doesn't I like that it's different that's that's 110% of the reason why I like it is because it's not like every other damn deck you're gonna get yeah thanks I appreciate that a lot actually yeah I didn't I didn't want to be like everybody else good I mean I a stellium and Aquarius there's no way I want to be like everybody else and I would also like to just quickly mention we are giving you tons of credit and tons of Kudos here I have an unsung hero that I would like to to thank and give a shout out to and that is your wife for pushing you to do this so kudos to your wife tell her I thank her because it was worth the year weight yeah it yeah she was she's great it was funny because she's like a real grounded atheist and doesn't this is all woo woo stuff to her so but she actually a lot of times would give me some of the best ideas for the for the deck and and if nothing else she gave you the confidence and the push and the drive and the okay to take the two years and do it and it was it yeah I don't know if when people say like oh I'm gonna do a deck Someday I'm like do you really have any idea how long that takes like I spent 900 hours of drawing 200 hours writing and I didn't that doesn't count edits that doesn't count revisions that doesn't count research time which was God knows how many times I I mean I read figuring out how to cut up that Bigfoot painting how many uh I was so lucky that year in in uh during covid Hulu Plus had so many uh crypted and UFO and ghost shows on I just could just watching all of them while I was drawing and I'm like shush I'm studying shush I'm studying basically yeah I'm sure drove my rest of my family nuts to see that before you came on here shell and I were talking and I did the math and realized that we started our the stoned Witches Hour paranormal show right around the same time started this deck so I told sh you obviously made this for her you must have been channeling shell he's like there's some crazy girl from New York who really has to have this deck or she'll die and I think what's good about it is is a blend of old and new because there are traditional symbols and ideas in here there there's importance in in the archetypes and in you know having things be as close as possible to what people know is true because that that activates part of our brain that activates that that whole thing where we're all seeing the same images in these AR repetitive recollection yeah yeah and but at the same time it also has enough New Vision to keep you interested so I it's a very good blending of old ideas old archetypes and what you're going to be familiar enough with as a regular tarot reader with this deck to be able to pick it up and read it without even having to know the supernatural side of all of it but you'll get so much more out of it if you go into these Legends if you go into the cards and the art themselves and see beyond the traditional so that's going to give you a lot of good magical Insight I'm not surprised that an atheist helped you with this because you don't have to believe in magic or any of that to use tarot tarot is an amazing Mental Health Journey Aid I think it's first and foremost a psychological tool and secondly it's divination absolutely absolutely um another car kind of if we did another extension thing of this I would love to do creatures and Spirits from Africa because they never get mentioned there's so many of them and what I've learned just from uh being in santaria and Pa mayom and seeing there's a whole range of spirits that regular European witchcraft doesn't encounter and doesn't see and that we get to see and I see all of them now and it's just a completely they just some of them are just so strange and hard to comprehend um from a western Viewpoint and you really have to rechange your brain a little to understand things from the African point of view of where everything's Community First to see from a different way that's magic and you're absolutely right a lot of our magic in our traditions and folklore is heavily you know European influence and so to have ideas from other parts of the world with the same land Spirits are land Spirits all over the world everybody every culture has some type of idea of these energies and so to to talk about all of them there's a lot of power in that I would love it if you did a companion deck we're giving this guy like the next five years of work here he's got to do an expansion he's got to do another deck but I I I think that this is is a kick-ass deck and if you VI this Motif and are a Tarot reader you will be able to easily use this deck and I might about the gilding but it's very pretty my only complain about the guilding this is a funny story so I I took these to my mundane work and I I was shuffling them at work and I'm you know I'm like I'm gonna check these out and you know you know work lights the way the lights shined on them and the way I had the cards angled I I thought for a second I burned my retina yeah it's like Chrome it is it Chrome it is mirror like finish we haven't even touched on spreads that you like I know you have a book about AI magic or people who use AI magic coming up in the fall we haven't even gone there I was gonna say we might just have to have them back okay I would love that certainly if you do an expansion pack and if anybody out there has his original deck email us we want it oh I can you I'll send you guys I still have some so oh W that would be like Christmas you and my birthday all together yeah they're they're they're different enough that it's it's it's worth seeing the difference you know that would be very cool and of it out of this one
