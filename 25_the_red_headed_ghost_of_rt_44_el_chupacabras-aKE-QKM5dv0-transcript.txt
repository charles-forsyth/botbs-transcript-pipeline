stuff True Crime ghosty things representing the best weed the wildest True Crime and the scariest ghost stories oh you're gonna introduce me dang it you got me again shell all right all right so I'm Leila I have the munchies and I'm high and I'm giggly and I'm also shell shelle I cannot believe that we are still having fun making this podcast and that people are enjoying getting high and spooked right along with us we always geek out when we see how far away some of you are listening from so today for our special episode 25 I'd like to give a shout out to zed a new listener that gave us a five-star review thank you said and also say hi to our newest listeners from around the world so yeah shout out to our new listeners I'm I'm going to actually give my shout out to the people of Australia because you know right now um Australia is winter time right now that's true that's right that's right southern hemisphere winter time hey winter time in Australia listeners cuddle up is we're complaining about how hot we are they're probably like you [ __ ] so hot right now oh my goodness the heat wve the lack of water everything is just absolutely crazy right now so wild but yeah they're in winter time does it snow in parts of Australia do you know I don't know but for our Australian listeners hit us up on like email or Instagram or something and let us know does this snow in Australia and the other thing I want to know besides if it snow is there does anybody keep kangaroos as house pets well that would be interesting I like the walas I mean they're cute all sorts of interesting things and and the big spiders like they have the big okay I'm done what I'm curious about is does Australia have any Cryptids they have cryptids in Australia no actually the another interesting question you know East Coast West Coast Australia versus Africa our South African listeners um I want to know what crypted you got going on there there because you got some badass animals on your continent so you got to have some badass Cryptids would be my guy I think so we should do a worldwide tour Cryptids on every continent and just check them all out go everywhere everybody tell us your Cryptids we want to know whatever continent you're on tell us your Cryptids Australia if if anyone doesn't have Cryptids I would say it's probably Australia because I think the wildlife there is scary enough on its own like already mentioned the big spiders you know they've got everything there wants to kill you pretty much freaking Tasmanian Devil that's like a crypted that everybody's aware of and accepts right yeah it's like if everybody it's like if everybody in America and Canada embraced freaking Bigfoot that's that's what theyve done in Australia freaking Tasmanian devils are Cryptids and they've embraced them yeah they just know it's real you know they're they're a little more badass than we are they can handle their Cryptids out in the open unlike here in America we have to hide our Cryptids away which ironically enough Tasmanian devils are from Tasmania but you you always hear these stories about illegal what do you call that smuggling anal smuggling smuggling and there was actually an outbreak of Tasmanian devils in Australia a a a what an outbreak of Tasmanian Devil smuggling are they the ones in the cartoon that would spin around really fast do they really I don't I imagine they don't really do that but I don't know I've never seen one but yeah so I had read this story a while back a couple years ago it wasn't like recent where there was like a bunch of Tasmanian devils smuggled into Australia and they got loose into the wild Sandy so like an invasive species yeah and kind yeah and basically did the old reprod of like bunny rabbits invasive species [ __ ] I gocha I don't know obviously they usually with stories like that they don't post follow-up stories a couple years later I don't know you want to know have they proliferated theyes contain I didn't know if they contained them or or if there is still a population of them but at one point there was a illegal population of Tasmanian devils in Australia my cat is meowing crazily in the background so hopefully he will be quiet it's his birthday today your cat's birthday Milo is three today now is this the cat that you told us in episode one that you weren't keeping yes and is he my boy now and do I love him and are we celebrating his birthday in style also yes 25 episodes later the cat's a part of the family the cat is no part of the fam yes and as you all know he is chipped and so we did get some of his information like his original name and his birthday and where he was from unfortunately the the contact people on his chip never responded after months of trying to get in touch with them so or fortunately because we adore him so he's part of the family now his name is Milo but we know he's three today a he's three happy birthday Milo happy birthday kitty kitty speaking of kangaro in Australia the Cryptid that I'm going to talk about today some people say resembles in some way is a kangaroo oh does it have a pouch that's all I want to know does it have a pouch I wish I could say yes but no there have been a couple random reports but they're very minor that said that they were marup like most just said that it was kind of about the height three to four feet tall like a short kangaroo and it kind of had the hind quarters and stood upright and moved similarly to a kangaroo so that's about where the similarities end is the stoned girl I have to ask about the pouch duh Yeah well yeah where else you're gon to statch your weed right yeah you got to have a place to put your glass you're gon to break it that's probably why I imagine that Cryptids carry silicone right because I love those silicone ppes right unless you're a marsupial crypted you don't got pockets so you have to carry the unbreakable you must you know I I have a feeling that we're we've both got to be smoking some good stuff today yes absolutely I am still smoking on my homegrown because you know me I'm a cheap ass [ __ ] and I like things to be good and not expensive so I'm smoking my delicious strawana but I'm also splurged a little bit because I got to keep up with my my heavy hitter THC shell so I needed to get something a little special what' you get what' you get looks boring as hell it looks just plain you know regular old standard looking green with the orange hairs lightly frosted it's called apple fritter oo apple fritters yes it smells amazing it smells so delicious sweet you know that that really light green scent when you smell that you're like oh yeah that's weed can I have some that smell I bet it doesn't taste like an apple fritter though does it it does not and it also does not taste like it smells damn it does that just mean when you smoke it the first thing you want is an apple probably the munchies are off the chart absolutely off the chain so interestingly enough I I like to eat cheese with my apple fritters or apple pie you ever have like a nice sharp cheddar with your apple pie absolutely not shell it's so good it's delicious I love cheese too you should try it it's it's one of those things that when you first hear it it doesn't sound good but a nice sharp cheddar with a really good apple pie or apple fritter is so delicious and interestingly this sweet smelling apple fritter Bud tastes kind of cheesy you know that kind of cheese funky taste that some buds have yeah I don't always love it it's okay in this particular case it's a little more just green and funky with that kind of little hit of cheese so it's not bad but it's weird that it doesn't taste like it smells interesting but it's good and you would be very happy to know that this has like a super high THC of um 32 to 35% that's what I like to hear good stuff it it's described as being euphoric and creative but I would say only in the sense of talking about growing weed on Mars again if we wanted to have you know really out there conversations probably not a good good strain for getting things done this is this is not the go to work cultivar this is the this is the this is the get rid of your pain this is help you go to sleep if you are especially if you are a um not as regular user I would go light on a on a cultivar that has this high of a THC because I'm a regular user and I can immediately feel it right in my eyes and it's gonna knock somebody out put you right to sleep in a beautiful Blissful coma you'll be just so happy but uh but yeah so go light if if you're not a regular user otherwise enjoy to your heart's content but don't expect to get any work done just expect to be happy and comfortable and and uh hopefully not eating too many apple fritters how about you sh what are you smoking over there today obviously not that good of [ __ ] damn you always come back with some amazing amazing cultivars you have some fabulous stores out there I'm very happy with your uh with your selections what did you find today today I have gone back to a a good standby the GMO Skittles I love GMO I looked at those you know it's it's interesting I wonder East Coast West Coast aside a lot of times the the strains or the cultivars that are popular there are also similar ones that are popular here um just because of legality now is there bigger Distributors that can kind of distribute some to the legal states what whatever state it is I think access to seeds uh from the legal states makes that easier I know you're not technically supposed to cross state lines with a lot of them but I'm sure they have different rules for these places have um like more wholesale places not like you giving me seeds or something right exactly they may have different whale yeah I'm sure they have access to a lot of the same things so it's interesting to see a lot of times um something that I looked at at at my local shop you'll mention that that you got or sometimes we'll get something you know the same around the same time so I love seeing that things are kind of starting to spread and and be more I just love that you grew that straw Nana because that was some good [ __ ] when I so good I love it I love it it's fabulous it's fabulous you have to come out and have some but this this is kind of a up high like you can do [ __ ] talk hang out you know I wouldn't say it's a power nap high it's a getting [ __ ] done High I like it I love those you know me I love my middle of the road and now I guess depending on who you talk to anything over 20% THC is considered high but I think with the way things have been growing nowadays we're going to have to kind of raise that that bar up a little bit because you're consistently coming in with over 30% thc's right so if if you're using the scale like some of these places like wikileaf or Leaf Le and they're saying high is anything over 20% I think they're kind of missing the bow on where things are nowadays well one thing I've noticed there are starting to be some stores to pop up around here that have a different pricing scale it's kind of based on THC level so you can get it's kind of like a low medium high so the low is going to be like your maybe 13 to 18s 13 to 19s and then your mid is going to be like 19 or 18 or 19 to maybe 2527 and then high is going to be anything over 25 27 that makes sense so then there's the pricing scale difference too you know like the level one the Newbie th SE levels are like 25 35 bucks mid-range 35 45 bucks and then the top the top levels you're looking at 50 60 bucks for an eighth wow yeah those prices absolutely need to come down right they really do especially because I I know a lot of times the farmers are not the ones that are benefiting from those high prices it's the middleman or the the the end seller and everybody should you know make their money on this I'm not saying people need to go broke there's a fine line between making money and being greedy don't be greedy don't be greedy exactly I think I'm worried that once we start seeing the markets take off and people see how easy it is to grow and how how much of a Overstock a lot of these places will start to get because they it is able to grow a lot in a very small space and so it's it's going to get bigger and bigger and then the prices are going to start to fall and I wor that once that happens these corporations will try to do a money grab in order to keep their profits and start making hom grows illegal because that's the only way they'll be able to Corner the market and keep the prices artificially high oh [ __ ] oh why would you think of that because that's been my crusade from the very beginning any time there has been any type of law in the works you have to support the groups that are making sure that hom grow language gets included in any type of legalization if your area is considering some type of laws or regulations make sure that you sign petitions and fund groups that are fighting for home grows because it's even if you don't grow at home having that option available prevents corporations from cornering the market and inflating prices well even here I think you can only have like three plants per adult in the household yeah and they usually cap it at a certain number per household even if you had a lot of adults there so there there are limits and I would like to see those raised as well I think people should be able to even without a medical license should be easily able to grow you know 100 plants as many plants as they would like for personal use well one of these days I'll figure out how to grow it's a big money saver especially when eths are going the good eighths are going for $60 $60 that's a lot and money doesn't grow on cannabis trees I guess for some people it does but not necessarily for us good pot does good pot does yeah I am loving what you are smoking today you're definitely in a good mood and super giggly so that is some good GMO Skittles right there you know what I forgot to tell you that I actually so I got a Pax pod because I'm going away with my parents next weekend and always good for the discreet to correct correct so I I go and I get a pack spot is so I can start packing for my trip and I realize that when I put it away I had a full one in there oh so surpris that's like finding money in your pocket that's even better so not only I forgot that not only have I been smoking the GMO Skittles but I was also puffing on my pack pod Vape nice very nice yeah yeah and of course they have all different flavor not flavors what's the word tpin tpin yes and they're like you can never get a tpine that is basically the same in a vape is is in a weed this is called lime fire skunk I'm drinking a seven up to go with it oh you got like the whole lemon lime kick going nice nice it's a theme it's thema in Salem today it's very thematic today very summertime all the Citrus I don't get the pods that often or the cartridges CU I think they're a little wasteful there's always a little at the end man that I can't get out right drives me nuts I'm such a scrooge I have to like use every little thing that's right waste not want not that's right so yeah I don't tend to get those often but man are they fantastic for being stealthy and super discreet so nice you would think as a adult I would not going from a legal state to a legal state that I wouldn't have to hide the fact that I'm going to be smoking but that's a day in the life of vacationing with your parents even as an adult since you brought it up and it's legal let's talk about smoking with your parents going on vacation with your parents and and bringing wheat now are do they know you smoke you're a full ass adult with full ass adult children do your parents know that you smoke the wacky weed um I do not believe the parents I am going vacationing with do and we you know some parents are just better left in the dark even in their mid 70s now your dad was in well let's just say in a law enforcement type capacity back in the day it was not something that we ever brought up to him correct and he looked like Gorbachev correct I remember I remember that but like even now that it's legal he's just not an accepting person right yeah that's just not in his world view so you bringing a vape is is a Lifeline for you because this is you know it's odorless you can do it quietly discreetly you could even say it's cigarettes because I'm sure those would be okay with it I'm a cigarette smoker I don't like it it's a dirty habit I'll admit it but here I am I'm not allowed to smoke around my dad either I'm kind of treated like I'm still 10 years old so even cigarette smoking is not accept like like on this trip I'm actually gonna have to like walk away hide like he knows I smoke but he just can't witness it you know some people are just like that now for me I've mentioned before that like the first time I got high was accidentally at a party my dad was having and uh he's someone that I have smoked with pretty regularly even as recently as like this year so and my mother is fully aware that I smoke she actually is a CBD Enthusiast she loves CBDs she has muscle pain joint pain and it helps her quite a bit with that as well as uh keeping an emotional stability when dealing with the family trauma well my mother is a whole different story my mother has actually bought weed off of me before but she's not a part of the parent group going on this particular trip that's a no fun but no when I'm around my mother I just you know pull out the pipe here I go but when I when I'm with my father we're we're vaping in a bathroom yeah it does seem that the boomer generation tends to be more they're more caught up in like the reform Madness and you know the the misconceptions that were prolific at that time well I I actually I have I have a parot from each of the stereotypical groups from from the Boomer age I have a I have a parent that buys into re for madness like nobody's business and then I have a parent who is peace love happiness sex drugs and rock and roll right right so I I kind of have that coming at me from both opposite direction and sometimes that's how it goes you know and and I don't know how best to bring up that conversation you know we all kind of have to figure out how that is in our own families you know and and what what's acceptable and what's not accept for those but I will say this though if my father does not know that I smoke marijuana then I have done a very good job over the last 30 years of being super high in front of him and him not knowing it never knowing that's right I think I like to follow my husband's rule you know when you meet people just make sure you're stoned right off the bat and then they'll never know anything different that's right that's right first day of work make sure you go in hide as [ __ ] so that they they get used to you that way and then no one's surprised it's good advice good advice stay tuned for more tips by Lila there you go don't probably shouldn't get high at work actually you probably shouldn't you probably should actually most jobs never mind wrong podcast so yeah so good smoke and good stories today okay so crypted today I am talking about a creepy crypted called chupacabras I have been waiting for you to talk about chupacabra for so long it's so good it's such a good story it's so scary and and this one is fun because it's a relatively recent crypted it's kind of a new addition to crypto zoology like how new how new are you talking 1995 chuper CRA only been around since 1995 now there have been some stories and there are some older references to chupacabra but the the legend that we all kind of know of the Goat Sucker the the blood sucking evil looking creature in uh South America and the Southwest us that really only started in 1995 no [ __ ] that that was only a year after I had my first kid like I thought chuper Cabra was like hundreds of years old I am I am today years old finding this out I I also thought that it was older but no chup abas are 1995 that's when the first one and there are a lot of theories as to maybe they're aliens or the pets of aliens or that they're some type of an escaped us genetic mutation gone wild oh I vote for aliens alien pets sounds really fun right or alien pets aliens or alien pets that's my vote yeah I'm I'm super curious but yeah so that's what I'm goingon to be talking about today what are you talking about today so triaa we've we all know triaa I actually I actually have a AAA card triaa puts out a list of most haunted roads in America each year do they really Triple A puts out the most haunted roads in America yeah oh my goodness so one of the most haunted roads in America just happens to be here in Massachusetts so we are gonna of course it is of course it is course it is um I had to laugh because what you know how sometimes when you think something in your head like when you're reading something you're you you think you read what it and I thought it said redheaded stepchild oh no there is um a a a a road called Route 44 um and there is What's called the redheaded hitchhiker oh a hitchhiker ghost story I like it yeah so um per AAA this is a good one so we're going to go to ro 44 um in Massachusetts Triple A who would have thought Dale Triple A so we do have to address the elephant in the room here that is we we didn't do a switch we said last week we're going to do switch we we got too high and forgot people let's be real yeah we got too high so we're gonna try again next week I will look for a haunted Asylum or building I've actually already put a sticky note on my computer to do the Lori Manion but we just as you can tell from when we were talking about what we were smoking Lea and I got some really good [ __ ] this week yeah we just got too [ __ ] up and forgot too forgot it happens hey it's episode 25 man I cannot believe six months in we've done 25 regular episodes how amazing is that it's pretty cool and you know what we've got a listener or two that aren't related to that aren't one of my brothers or one of our friends I love that although some of our friends do listen hey you know I speaking of our friends who listen we have a friend who listens and I just want to give this this this poor guy some love oh this guy we've talked about him he has participated in two of our stories that we've talked about um in our 25 episodes shout out to Tom we love you dude we love you man always a fun Ghost Hunter with us Ador he was with me when uh when I did fallberg cemetery and he was with us when we went to Connecticut Hill Cemetery that's great much love to Tom he needs it and and we need to do a ghost hunt with Tom before the end of the summer oh I am so down for that we you know I think let's plan it right now Shell let's put a pen in it Tom if you're listening we're doing a freaking ghost time and you still better own that creepy van for us to go in Tom Mel both of you where's that creepy van we need to go on ghost Hut bring the mystery van head into a cemetery that's right damn it that would be so much fun how great would that be we have got to find an East Coast Cemetery I'll be there I'll bring some great weed and we'll get really high and really spooky but yeah you know we've got some we've got some great friends that listen we've got some great family that listen and we've got some great listeners all around the world and we just love you guys I wish we could do a smoke sesh with all of our listeners how fun would that be that's why I really love your idea for book four of your stories to make it weed Stories We want to here your weed Adventures what's the best cultivar you've ever smoked what's your favorite what was your least favorite what's your funniest buying weed story tell us all about it did you ever have a creepy paranormal event happen while you were getting really high with your friends what's the scariest place you ever smoked up imagine if you saw a ghost for the first time and you were high you'd probably [ __ ] yourself if any if that's happened to anybody I want to know I want to know I also would like to know I think we really need to do High ghost hunts yes we'll get some super yummy weed with crazy high THC content we'll get everybody super baked kind of like those like have you ever seen the wine like the paint and drink things oh yeah they paint a little picture and drink their hearts out I actually did a paint and puff and one of the presenters had to leave because we smoked so much weed she couldn't stand up straight anymore but anyway we that's awesome yeah that was fun but so so they have paint and puff we should do a haunt and puff ghost and smoke smoke and ghosts I don't know SM and ghosts oh actually that that kind of sounds like a strip club advertisement smoking how do we always end up there we always do we do but yes so we should come up with something like that and we should have some of our listeners come with us we'll bring the weed we'll find some haunted location and we'll go do a paranormal ghost tour we'll just get really super high oh my God that would be so fun and see if that helps us take better orb photos you and your damn orb photos but I love them they're so great if they're fake and if they're bugs how come they all show up where there's a ton of paranormal activity answer me that how come in places where people report tons of ghosts there's tons of orbs how come come if it's dust and bugs I don't always get orbs just taking pictures around my house I want to know maybe you should do a whole episode on orbs I do think they're mysterious enough that there's something there but it yeah they're probably all dust and bugs but I don't know there's something about them that's kind of magical and weird and I just want to know maybe I should do but orbs aren't really West Coast or east coast they're they're Universal they belong to us all they belong to us all you know I I was just on Route 66 now you're on Route 44 so I'm feeling a Vibe here why don't you tell me about this hitchhiker I love redheads now okay so we all know that I am from New York and moved to Massachusetts while these people here they say words and names that I don't understand where they get the pronunciation because if you look at how it's spelled and how it's pronounced they're two different things people wor that's all I want to say right now explain yourselves yeah like I need to know this who decided that was pronounced Worcester and then you know they got all these these other towns so this one I'm probably gonna mutilate and you know probably my my darling boyfriend is gonna laugh at me okay I'm gonna listen for the Laughing go for it so roote 44 now I'm gonna laugh is near see and reob booth seeon and re hold on hold on I'm I'm either too high or not high enough for this all right try again the it's bad they don't spell things the way they pronounce them and that that's true I'm not gonna blame you I that makes me look stupid when it's really the people of Massachusetts you're gonna blame a whole state I am Worcester to to it's true that's true that one right there just kind of explains a whole lot of things Massachusetts I'm sorry wer proves that you're in the wrong here reho both I think that's correct raob and seon how do you add letters and then act like I'm the idiot pronouncing it then Worcester they take letters out when are supposed to add them and when are you supposed to take them out we don't know the rules okay so we're gonna okay people we're gonna leave it at this it's you know Google has a pronunciation guide if you want to look it up they can I actually I actually tried to and it doesn't for this town it's so bad okay okay so folks just to give you a better idea of besides my mispronunciations it's right across the Massachusetts border from Providence Rhode Island yeah okay so it's seon maybe and riobo maybe okay all I know is there's a town called sagus and I just call it sausage sausage yeah yeah again they add some in they take some out so we're going with seon and rith I guess yeah we're gonna go with that all right so this place where Route 44 is groupe 44 Massachusetts that's easy to say groute 44 um the way I obviously it's longer than this but it'll take you directly from Providence uh Rhode Island to Plymouth Pilgrim country okay so it kind of crosses the state like that right above Cape Cod so one of the most popular you know like I said Triple A they think that this is one of the most haunted roads in America I can't get over the fact that triple A of all places publishes a most haunted roads I love that and and just to kind of speak to that real quick I think part of that is is there's now more of an interest in stuff like this that's very true and it keeps triaa relevant but yeah so there's this guy that The Hitchhiker of Route 44 the redheaded hitchhiker of Route 44 this is a road uh that actually a lot of people have died along this stretch of road including a man that matches the redheaded hitchhiker's description this is probably I if I remember correctly from what I was reading this is about three or four decades worth of sightings that long yeah so now here's the problem 40 years ago was the 80s that's true so in in my mind it really wasn't that long ago because it was the 80s right it was just yesterday right just yesterday so no one really knows for sure who the redheaded hitchiker is but they it does fit someone's description that died on that road it's kind of during this stretch of town this particular Road gets into a kind of woodsy near some bogs there for foggy at night kind of atmosphere rip for Ghost Stories ripe for ghost stories but also ripe for accidents and people crash in their cars and dying good point good point yes to then create said ghosts so this guy is described as being more than six feet tall well-built having red hair and a red beard and he's often seen wearing jeans or work pants sounds hot actually I know right but and he's always described as wearing a red flannel shirt sometimes tucked in and sometimes not tucked in also my type so people like let's just say that people are seeing him clear enough to basically some people say his shirt was tucked in and other people say it wasn't tucked in like describing his clothes they're clear Visions some Travelers seen him as well-kept but have also seen him with um like disheveled hair and dirty hair interesting people who' have come come in contact with him can tell that he's not Human by his eyes which are described sometimes as lifeless o so they see some hot you know '90s looking flannel red beard hair and sometimes he's neat and sometimes he's dishel like even to the point where his shirt is untucked he's all sexy except for the dead eyes yeah and out of all the people who've seen him over the the decades the real only discrepancy in the description ends up being with the eyes themselves every single person has described him exact except interesting except for there's discrepancies in what people say about his eyes oh what are they what do they say different um some people say there's no eyes they're just black holes some people say that they're just lifeless like you know how when you look at someone they just look like they're just out there yeah but other people have have described as just a void of black hole and no eye in the ice socket kind of thing wow that sounds creepy I I'm curious hot hot sexy guy with no balls I'm pretty curious about the um the fact that he looks different you know like in some ways he's clean cut and sometimes he's dished I wonder if that's like two separate times or something or you know how sometimes you know ghosts that kind of appear he had ghost work to do and he hadn't gotten a chance to clean up his ghosty self before he went out for his nightly haunting maybe it's the the I'm I'm a Lumberjack and I'm going to work in the morning all clean cut and then I've had a hard day lumberjacking and I'm going to come home all disheveled and sweaty and sexy right right my manly redhead Lumberjack ways with creepy eyes no matter which way you see him I think I dated that guy I think you did I remember him but most of the encounters follow a similar pattern tell me this ain't some creepy [ __ ] because love a good like actually I actually I'm going to try to convince my boyfriend who's an avid listener so sweetheart when you're listening to this we are you're taking me here so we got to figure out when hey shelle sweetheart please take her to Route 44 I got to travel on Route 66 I'm gonna T do some pictures shells should travel on Route 44 and do some pictures it would be fun listen to this [ __ ] so if you're if if you're driving um and you're you'll you will see a man in or alongside the road and like if he's in the road you won't see him until like you're four feet away from him and run them over oh no that's scary when people like when something like all of a sudden is there when you're driving I hate that but then when you look in your rearview mirror because you think you just hit someone he's still standing there like you drive through them what like you you think you hit him but then you look in the rearview mirror and he's still standing yeah yeah yeah yeah oh creepy or he will be on the side of the road like just walking or hitchhiking the guy is like so visually there that people have actually pulled over and stopped to pick him up to offer him a ride oh wow a lot like some of the other ghostly hitchhiker stories yeah so like this isn't just you think you see something and then it's gone like people legit think it's a person right and check this [ __ ] out he'll interact with the person no way he'll thank you for picking him up and giving you a ride and then he'll eventually vanish much like the lady in white ones where they vanish leaving a puddle of water in the seat Well there wasn't a puddle water left in the seat but yeah he'll just be like thank you for picking me up I appreciate it poof gone wow I wonder what his story was I wonder I wonder if if that was like a real person and something happened to him not only does he interact with the person and then eventually vanish before their eyes or will no longer be there when they turn to look but it's usually followed by some type of audio finale where he laughs yells at them or taunts them what yes no so he's gonna [ __ ] with you too so he's gonna thank you and then he's gonna laugh at you or taunt you or yell at you like if I'm gonna pick you up you ghosty bastard don't laugh and yell at me why you gonna yell at me I picked you up I wonder if he like do they drop him off somewhere and that's when he thanks them or does he like in the middle of the ride just be like hey thank you you stinky dirt bag and then disappears I think it's like that no one ever really said anything about dropping him off he disappears in your car wow wow um a woman uh one woman rude what a rude hitchhiker one one lady was driving by herself in the evening she reported that she stopped to pick up a hitchiking redheaded man and when he went to grab the door handle of her car he disappeared and then her car battery died and she heard a man laughing at her although he was no longer there 10 minutes later the car started but not before the woman had started to break down in kind of a mental breakdown of fright and minutes is a long time when you're out in the middle of nowhere and you just hear her disembodied laughter one man man was driving alone and he saw the redheaded redheaded man on the side of the road he stopped and called out to the man who started to walked towards him and as he got slower got as he got closer the guy slowly faded away until he had completely disappeared I cannot even imagine having someone walk closer to me and then just like gradually disappeared away in front of you another person had The Hitchhiker appear they didn't even pull over they just had the redheaded hitchiker appear in the back seat of their car that they could see through the rearview mirror the radio started to scan stations uncontrollably and then it became so loud it shook the car and then the redheaded hitchhiker disappeared and began laughing through the radio speakers of the car oh wow interesting the electronic phenomena that seems to accompany this redheaded trickster spirit and that's what kind of tips me off because when that starts happening I tend to more believe it's real yeah yeah another local Legend says that whenever there's three people driving in the same car on Route 44 the redheaded hitchhiker appears in the empty seat making it the fourth person imagine being the guy in theing back seat I volunteer to ride with you guys I'll go I'll go with you pick me up I'll fly out and we'll make it a trip and and you can sit back there and ask him like where he from and what happen I'll roll joints we'll go out at the witching hour we'll go on Route 44 at 4:20 a.m. with lots of joints and uh I'll see if I can offer this hot redhead oh gosh I hope my husband forgives me I don't think he's that hot I'm just gonna smoke up with him that's all we don't even know what he looks like we just have a description hey it's The Lumberjack thing help it but like the one thing the one thing I haven't been able to to kind of find in this story is it did say that this guy met the description of someone who died on that road but they never say who it is right right one of those yeah I know who it was it was a person who died but I'm not going to offer any corroborating information the earliest written record of occurrences was by a guy named Charles T Robinson in his 1994 book New England ghost files and he does describe several Encounters in detail here's one that'll freak you out this oh my God I don't even I'd rather have the hitchhiker appear in my car so check this out some accounts are he will be outside your window while you're driving like 40 miles an hour as if he were running 40 miles uhuh no that's not acceptable ghost should not do that that's rude so like you're driving and he's keeping up pace outside your car window what kind of mean trickster is this guy I mean these are like nasty tricks these aren't funny these aren't funny jokes it's almost like he thinks he's being funny but that's that's not funny there was a couple in 2001 boyfriend girlfriend uh husband and wife I don't know they broke down on the road about 10 p.m. the woman stayed in the car while the man went to get help and they actually both had their own separate experiences the man saw him on the side of the road and was trying to talk to him and like ask him I don't know for directions or help or whatever and the redheaded hitchhiker began yelling at him and disappeared laughing at him from all directions trying to kind of make him crazy wow and then the woman scary the woman was sitting in the car and all of a sudden with the car turned off no power onto the car the radio turns on and his voice comes over the radio taunting her until she ran screaming from the car that wouldn't take very long for me yeah seriously seriously but nobody really gives a like I said nobody's really giving a name but like everybody in the town knows about it law enforcement hates the attention you know the police don't like the attention it brings to the town so this guy who wrote this book in '94 he made several attempts to try to quote unquote Reach Out to The Ghost and wasn't able to but strange things did happen he just didn't see the redheaded hitchiker the first time he had a tire explode when there was nothing visibly in the road that could have popped the tire uh the second time his car just randomly stalled for a few minutes and then just all of a sudden started working again almost like the redheaded ghost wasn't going to appear to him but was going to mess with him right while he was waiting for the tow truck driver he was hearing noises most of the night in the woods um rustling it didn't sound he says it didn't sound like an animal it sounded like something kept walking away from him and then walking to him he didn't turn his radio on because he was afraid that the guy would talk through it turn turned his cell phone off because he was a little freaked out but never was able to kind of entice the redheaded hitchiker to come out so he kind of thinks that maybe he knew he was coming and want to give him what he wanted yeah it almost sounds like that like like he didn't want to have anything to do with the investigator but he was willing to kind of [ __ ] with him a little bit but you know it kind of gets past through the town like kind of like a highway Boogeyman basically anytime anything bad happens The Hitchhiker takes the blame for everything on on that road yeah it is definitely something that enough people have encountered that it seems like there's substance to it it's just that no one has been able to necessarily produce a this is who we think it is right no no good solid origin story just a lot of corroborated sightings right right nobody can necessarily say this was John Smith that was a lumberjack in 1981 who got killed on this road doing blah blah blah but there's enough cooperating evidence that there's something there it's just no backstory right interesting wow that's one of those Mysteries right I want to go to Route 44 and get a hitchhiker yeah you should ask them be like hey what's your name what's your story maybe he just needs a ghostly uh reporter I know we'll we'll kind of do a like a like like haraldo you know tell your side of the story tell us yep yep so I I want to before the end of the summer I want to go see what the redheaded hitchhikers got to say and what his deal is that sounds like fun Count Me In I'll be the third we'll keep that fourth seat open and I will roll lots of joints for the redheaded H hitchhiker so that we can get his story what you need to do is just keep blowing the smoke in the seat next to you entice them with weed it works have you seen that Snapchat filter that turned you into the motion capture turns you into the motion capture stick figure no I haven't people have been using that for ghost hunting because every once in a while if you have a ghost in your room it'll put a stick figure on the ghost if it sees a ghost in the room and I saw a video of someone doing this SnapChat filter and you know they're kind of moving around in the room and they've got the motion capture stick figure on them and all of a sudden next to them appears a childs siiz stick figure and it's dancing a little bit too and she realizes on the screen that there's a person there and so she looks at it and reach her hand down and the stick figure reaches its hand up and touches hers I don't know what this is it's probably the computers and video gets parelia too it sees figures and faces I wish you guys could see Shell's face right now she is completely motionless absolutely shocked I want to get Snapchat just to try this so I'm pretty sure it's just seeing figures and faces where there aren't any cu this is not the first filter that people have said is a good ghost hunting filter I'm pretty sure it's just kind of like parelia but I don't know that one seemed like it was I don't know I don't know that's the thing I don't know and it seems like fun and and it's I mean that seemed an awful lot like uh it was interacting with her so even if it is just the app seeing things that aren't there and trying to fill in the blanks it was kind of copying what she was doing and it like high-fived her so creepy stuff okay okay so since you have Snapchat already get this filter well also because also you're in you're you're staying in a we're just gonna call it a semi- haunted house yeah it's definitely got some activity so I want to see if you have any interaction on the Snapchat filter where you are currently located okay I'll do that oh my gosh that's GNA be so scary I'll do that later and we'll if we get anything we'll put it up on our Instagram um is there a way see I don't do Snapchat I'll have to because now I'm intrigued by this this filter is there a way for your phone to record while you're do like could you record it so that if you did get something you'd be able to go back and see it again yes okay but yeah we'll have to try it and see it'll be great fun I want to know what you got in your house oh my gosh I do too I want to know what's here H creepy stuff so What story do you've got today well like I said I'm going to do a crypted today I'm going to do something that very famous across the southwest and in California I still can't believe 1995 I am blown away I am away especially because in a recent episode you brought up the news story about the Texas zoo and Amarillo that said that they had a possible chupacabra sighting right right right right right and we talked about that they have some surveillance camera video of what looks like a maybe a wolflike creature with maybe scales or something something down its back on two legs person yeah wolf goat dog thing it's definitely got a long snout and big ears not really sure what it is could be a person in a costume could be a chupaca you know I saw the footage from the Texas Sue and I really don't think it was a person in a costume I really don't and even in so that was the most recent sighting I've heard of and in 2017 I was had just moved to Riverside California and in River side County there were actually sightings of chupacabras right when you moved there the same month the same month that I moved there yeah so it was uh 2017 and there was a sighting well actually I should probably say what a chupacabra is first if you've never heard of it aupac cabadas is a creature it's a crypted that was first reported in Puerto Rico and also in Mexico Texas New Mexico California Florida all over the uned States the original sighting said that it was about 3 to four feet tall and it looked like it had like a reptilian head and a big mouth with lots of teeth in it and down its back it would have like a row of spikes or some type of spiky quills that would come down there either to a tail sometimes they said it had like a very skinny hairless tail like a rat tail oh yeah they said that they had very very scary fangs big claws all of them reported having three fingers and three toes and they say that it's the size of a big dog or a small bear about three to four feet in height and often they say that it looks like it might be Park kangaroo so some sort of like reptilian porcupine beike hairless dog rattail kangaroo thing now I happen to know something about a chuper Cabra okay what do you know you know what I know what that the name chupacabra comes from like a it's a derivative of vampire chupak Cabas literally means sucker of goats because they drink blood of [ __ ] they eat that's right yep chupacabras means sucker of goats goat suck you have you have more chance of becoming a vampire from a chupacabra than you do a bat I I've never heard of people turning into chupacabras but I have heard that they do suck their blood of of their victims and that's where in 1995 in Puerto Rico these I believe it was about eight farm animals were found and they were completely drained of blood ex sanguinated they were so they were not eaten they were not ravaged in any way they had three puncture wounds on their chest or on I did see some articles that said neck but most said chest and there was no blood in them or around them now if it had been a wild animal people would think that it would chew them or eat them or tear them apart but other than missing blood nothing was disturbed because they found these sheep these farm animals completely drained of blood you know they were worried that some sort of creature had caused it but at that time no one had seen it it was March of 1995 and then later that year over 150 more farm animals and pets started turning up dead all of them completely drained of blood I'm surpris they didn't blame the witches everybody blames The Witches more attacks happened in 1995 so again 150 Fir manels and pets by August of that year by the end of 1995 Chupa Cabas had been blamed for more than 1,000 mysterious animal deaths all of these animals died from blood loss and were found with no blood in the ground around them no blood in their body and not having been eaten and maybe one or two animals I have heard sometimes um especially if they're sick sometimes coyotes or wild dogs or animals will kill another animal and not eat it but this is over a thousand all of them had been drained of blood one thing one misconception I think about chupacabra that people think is that they think it's something from just like the Southwest in Mexico but I've heard in the past of sightings um anywhere as far up as Maine I have as well even though it's started in in Puerto Rico how did it get across the water there's a lot of theories to that in the beginning they didn't know what was happening and until a woman Maria Maria Tolentino was the first known witness to see what was causing these deaths she says that she saw a creature that was about 4 foot high and it had WID set very dark scary eyes with very long thin arms it had three fingers sounds like an alien it did stand up on two legs she said it was kind of lizard looking and it had Spikes all along its back and so again this is more like The Reptilian kind of chupacabras that people started saying especially in uh South America and in Puerto Rico and in Mexico this is the there's two distinct types of chupacabras and this is the first one Maria tolena was the first witness and her description kind of went viral for the time in 1995 and it was picked up different news stations and and went all around and then more witnesses started coming forward and their descriptions were all very very similar to maras and they all reported that some type of spikes or quills or feathers uh in a ridge down its back like a large dog they described it as having a muzzle and having yeah creepy red eyes oh they always have red eyes yeah they always do right so for about five years there were a lot of reports of chupacabras that looked like this in Mexico Nicaragua Argentina even like Florida it started to come into the United States people were reporting it and around the same time people would find usually pets or farm animals with bite marks odd bite marks not like what would look like a full bite mark from an animal but like two or three punctures and completely drained of blood did they ever get a human there were reports that some humans um in 1996 in Mexico and Miami more attacks are starting to happen and this uh chupacabras this uh kind of alien reptile looking Tupac Cabas was reported as as being seen around some of these attacks I just didn't know if they just kind of were like a quote unquote threat to animals or a threat to humans as well in the beginning it was mostly animals and then as the as time went on and it started to spread to um North America and in Mexico and and in the United States then there were reports in Sonora Mexico verra Cruz uh there were reports that people were killed and again found completely drained of blood with odd wounds because that would I I'm just thinking you know fast forward to that news story that I read a few weeks ago about it being outside the zoo that makes total sense it went to the zoo to get food oh my God right most again most of the attacks are on animal anal and it it seems to particularly like goats and sheep and that type of animal in Calderon Village in caloa which is in northern Mexico they actually started to form squads vigilante squads because they were finding all these goats bled dry and they're trying to figure out what was doing it and there were reports of these creatures seen near the animals before they were found dead they were telling people keep your women and children locked up inside at night because they didn't know what was happening really keep your goats locked up at night and it was reported there that one human was attacked by this by this lizard looking spiked creature and they did manage to escape some people report that it chitters at them or almost like it's trying to talk to them like some sort of chattering noises that it makes like it's trying to communicate but not in any form or fashion that we would get that's right um one the Espinosa family in Mexico uh they reportedly saw this creature again 3 to 4 feet high scaly type skin clawed hands with three fingers and they said that the creature was like mumbling and gesturing at them so there have been people who have said it almost seems like it's trying to communicate with them when they see it but didn't attack them just that's what they said now a lot of times people will describe a putrid smell I know with some of these Cryptids that's almost like a Hallmark card for some of the Cryptids like I know that uh Sasquatch is reported to have like a really stinky smell and so does chupacabra they often say that it smells like a wet dog the reports do get into the United States in Florida New Mexico Texas and particular is a hot bed of sightings for chupacabras California as well and I did ask my youngest daughter she has friends all over the country and a couple in Canada and I asked her if any of her friends had heard of chupacabras and they all had and again some of them were as far away as um Minnesota all the way up in can I believe in Vancouver Canada one of them lives and they had all heard of chac Cabas two of them even said that one of them said her father and the other said his sibling would tell them Tales of chupacabras to scare them and try to keep them in at night even though nowhere near Puerto Rico or Mexico or the American southwest where most of these sightings have happened so they seem to kind of originate from Puerto Rico that's where I think some of these alien sightings kind of come in they kind of all of a sudden just appear in 1995 in Puerto Rico don't they have a ton of alien sightings reported in Puerto Rico like on the regular they do and there is a theory that these are either aliens or some type of pet of aliens that escaped didn't wasn't there an alien theory about like we know the gry heads love the grey heads yeah wasn't there a theory about lizard people or is that or is that just a movie I've seen one time well there is a movie called species that also came out in 1995 and some people do say that Maria's description of the chac cabadas that she said she saw around the time all the animals were getting EX sanguinated in her Village they say that it sounds very much like the alien creature in the movie species that she had seen they always say that movies like that are just made to prepare us for the truth that they haven't told us yet I'm just saying kind love I'm just saying she had seen the movie and so they say that that maybe she was just trying to get her 15 minutes of fame and described a creature that looked like the one she had just seen in the movies but it did get picked up and then like I said kind of went viral interestingly enough the South Americans so there there's that version of the chupacabra that came from Puerto Rico and then it gets a distinctly American twist as does everything you know once it kind of hits Texas and and California and New Mexico now this kangaroo lizard spiky creature starts to resemble more of a more of a very large dog that sometimes stands upright and sometimes walks on all fours and has an extraordinary elongated muzzle and a it almost like a bear-like head on a doglike body with a big long kangaroo rat tail and this weird visual yeah and this chupacabra creature is seen again mostly in New Mexico and Texas and there are sightings all over the place of of this creature Phyllis Canyon 2016 she does a or she was interviewed for the Texas Observer she says June 2007 was the first time she saw a chupacabra and she saw some type of hairless doglike creature that was like blue gray very bony very elongated and shortly after she saw this strange creature she saw that some of her chickens had had their throat bitten and were completely drained of blood but nothing else had been eaten at least she still had the chicken meat yeah but you gross if it was like chewed on by some alien creature I'd be scared of catching some sort of weird alien disease right point over the next couple days she kept seeing this creature it looked like some sort of large hairless dog with extra big teeth and strange colored she tried to take a picture of it and actually got kind of a picture of it and became famous for a little bit I guess so yeah she actually has this creature stuffed and I I'm looking at a picture of it right now and it looks like a dog so I'm not really sure but so she says she saw this chupacabra and it's definitely a chupacabra she says because the animals it killed it only drank their blood but it doesn't look anything like the Tupac Caba from Puerto Rico again stood on two legs kind of had a lizard head and this very much looks like a a dog with sarcoptic mange where all its hair's kind of fallen off and its Skin's gotten very thick and gnarly so they look scary are they the same thing because they almost seem like two different animals I would say the southwestern American chupacabras and the the Puerto Rican Mexican Latin America chupacabras do sound very much like two different creatures yeah our Chupacabra sounds and looks much more like a very large dog like Wolf Man kind of like a wolf man but mostly walks on all fours has a big bear-like head extra large teeth my idea of a good time right and still is definitely drinking the blood of animals which you wouldn't think if it was a wolf or a coyote or a wild dog you'd think they would tear it to shreds and kind of eat the meat whereas these only drink the blood kind of sticking with the goat sucking kind of thing so maybe the lizards in Puerto Rico are actually the lizard people aliens and then the dog creatures of the Southwest and United States are the alien pets maybe that's possible I I kind of wonder that myself if it's just two different things the the thing that I think kind of freaks me out is where did they just all of a sudden come from randomly out of the blue in 1995 like where the hell did they come from and they came with a Vengeance because they they killed over a thousand animals and throughout the United States there have been different times where farmers and Ranchers have found groupings of animals deceased just with all their blood drained in Riverside California uh was mid July this gentleman named Carrie shukar he said his cat freaked out and ran outside the house and when he got outside chasing his cat he saw the ugliest thing he had ever seen about 80 feet away he said it had teeth jutting out in every direction oh [ __ ] it was standing up on hind feet and it looked like the biggest coyote you had ever seen but it had a long tail like a awesome and he said the creature snarled at him and then started making like chattering noises before it finally left he says he thinks it was cussing him out because it was hunting his cat for breakfast and he stole its breakfast from it that's why I say aliens because I think they're trying to communicate they sound like they're smart now here's another story and ever I kept looking it up because I was absolutely sure someone had to be pulling my leg with this name MJ blunt I was sure they were [ __ ] me I was like this has to be the onion but no MJ blunt is a real person Mary Jane blunt she is an early childhood educator in Riverside County California and she also saw chupacabra in 2017 and she said it was the strangest looking creature that she had ever seen she also gave an interview to the Mercury News the paper the Mercury News and she says that it was the strangest looking animal she's ever Scene It had the ears of a deer kind of like that picture that Texas picture it had very long pointy ears oh yeah yeah and it had a long muzzle or snout like a like a wolf no hair tail like a rat and long hind quarters like a like a kangaroo and she said she thought it might be some sort of weird coyote or a sick wolf but she said there were too many differing characteristics for it to be that that's kind of what it sounds like like I actually saw the visual footage from the Texas zoo and you can actually Google that you can actually find the still images and that's actually what it kind of looks like June it was June 10th 2022 Amarillo Texas Zoo you can definitely see the pictures and this one does kind of look wolf likee more doglike much like the South Southwest American chupaca yeah yeah yeah but it's standing on two feet like the Puerto Rican chupacabra but you can tell those are not human legs the way they're angled they're Ang L like animal legs like I can't there's no way I can like better Des they seem very very long they seem like a lot of people described the chac Cabos as having very elongated legs so even those these seem like two different species they do have a lot of similarities the elongated bones it looks like a bunch of different animals put together and that might give a little Credence to one of the other theories is that this is some sort of US Government experiment gone wrong and that it's a esed and that they've done some type of animal hybrid things and it's gotten out and that might explain some of these and like you said why why did it appear so suddenly on the crypted scene well and the shitty thing is is that the government's pretty shady so you kind of can't rule that out that's true that's right you never know you never know what's going on and of course they're not going to tell us they lied to us about UFOs for so many years what else are they lying about did they make chupacabras did chupacabras come here with the alien to alien ship crash land and they oh and they're they were here on vacation and their pet dog got loose yeah it's probably what happened and they probably because Puerto Rico is a a beautiful destination but it's a US Territory that's what I was yes and so they could have gone ahead and done some sneaky government [ __ ] in Puerto Rico and then this thing got let loose and here we are that's right maybe they're there trying to get around some of the rules exactly so and then experiment gone wrong it's loose here we are it got on a Navy ship and made its way to Texas yeah that sounds awfully specific sh what do you know that you're not telling us I know right but it's almost like you're hearing a lot about it especially lately you know like you said last month that news article chuper Cabra out and about it's it's definitely more of a socialite than Sasquatch that's right they like to have their picture tap taken much more often and it's it's interesting because they showed up in 1995 they were like boom right there in in the Lexicon they're they're all over the place and they haven't really let up since I mean they're still being cited there's there are still animals mysteriously being drained of blood places and and obviously evolving and procreating along the way obviously I I just am very interested to see all the different species breeds like dog breeds I guess like is this the lab dooodle of the Chupacabras World whereas they you know did did like the reptilian chupacabras come to Florida and find some mangy dog that it thought was cute and now we have the New Mexico and Texas Chupa cabadas I don't know I don't know maybe it was a Sasquatch aupac Cabas and a Sasquatch had a baby and that's why we have the the hairless hairy weird looking combo yes yes Sasquatch and chup Cabra the Sasquatches migrated down from Canada along that Corridor and yeah met up with the Chupacabras that that got abandoned here by their alien family when they on vacation I don't know yeah right I think I've had enough of this weed I'm I've gone around the Ben shelle that's okay it's it's probably time for us to to wrap it up on our our 25th episode we we've been fun we've been silly this time yeah we have we've had some pretty
