I'll be right there the weed guys here it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey it's 4:20 a.m. hi and welcome to the stoned wiches our book two of your stories this is where we read your spooky story your ghost stories your personal experiences I love these and you know we get such great stories from people I think this is one of my favorite types of episodes to do is these listener stories I love it there's so much fun people's experiences just blow my mind I cannot believe the submissions that we've gotten and the Spooky experiences that people have had we're not the only ones who have [ __ ] up [ __ ] happened to them weirdness is universal everyone has some sort of odd story so all right so welcome to the stoned Witches Hour I'm Leila I I'm tired but I'm high but I'm a shell I don't even know what I am right now I'm here it has been a month hasn't it I mean holy Lord right we have is it retrograde are we in retrograde right now are we are it's Mercury retrograde we just had Friday the 13th and a full flower moon with a full of Clips it was Bloody looking by the way it was beautiful did you manage to stay up beautiful yes I did stay up here here in the east coast it was I'd say it started around like 10:40 where you could start to see the shadow starting and it was starting to go from white to that bloody red because when the moon came up earlier in the evening it came up white and bright but man by about 5 after midnight it was one of those bloody smoky eclipseyoutube Empire movies it was so awesome and believe it or not for the first time in Upstate New York history it was a clear night so you could see it I was really surprised that you were going to be able to see it I I know that when we had talked about it earlier in the day that there was some talk about it maybe being a little too cloudy over there right right and and I am currently not home as you are aware so so I'm recording today from upstate New York back in the Homeland and I'm telling you the fact that it was a clear night in Upstate New York the guy were here man it was a full moon Miracle it was it was a full moon Miracle you know it it was just it was really cool to watch and I really hope that everybody had an opportunity that that had a clear night was able to see it because whether you're spiritual witchy whatever the hell it was just cool to watch I agree and you know full moons are are so nice and and especially in Pagan and witchy Traditions you know that full moon really brings out the magic magic it makes you feel magical it makes you feel like dancing under that full moon especially this time of year everyone's restless and ready to get outside and feel nature and and just being under that gorgeous like you said it was bright and white and beautiful when it came up and and just being outside and the cool thing was though is that I happened to still be up at about 2 2:30 a.m. and I stepped outside by about 2 230 it was back to being that bright white full moon eclipse aside to see it go from that bright white as it was rising to that blood red back to bright white I don't know there's just something cool about that I love it I agree it was beautiful and and you know to kind of get a little esoteric and and bring it back to the goddess you know the full moon the full goddess and and just being like the white of the maiden goddess turning to the red of the mother goddess you know the all wellbeing in the black Sky you know to just kind of bring it back to that Maiden mother Crone aspect that kind of eclipse is a beautiful way to Showcase that and and to kind of feel that feminine energy start to finish the whole transition just it it's just a sight it's just a sight and I really I do hope that a lot of people were able to get out and see it I hope people were able to get out and smoke some flour under that flower full moon and I was obviously oh definitely for sure I got high it was just beautiful being out there here it was you know a gorgeous night a little chilly but you know just perfect perfect to go outside and watch that what time was it out out in the west coast what time did that happen it was about 10: after midnight here it it's about 3 hours different here so it was just after 9:00 p.m. here so it was definitely dark was it I was going to say was it dark enough over there MH it was it was full dark and but when it first came up it was during the day and it was real pretty to see it you know when the the full moon comes out and it's still daylight out it's kind yeah you know as the eclipse started to happen it was just beautiful the night started to set in as the moon got red and just real pretty very cool very cool it's just different it's it's interesting to the perspectives because of the time difference the time zone difference yeah it's definitely it definitely made it a little nicer it was much easier to get out at 900 pm to see the eclipse than it is maybe to get out at midnight and see an eclipse especially like on a Sunday night when you got to work on Monday morning blah so did you do anything did you do any ritual things did you say any spells or light any candles for the full moon I said some spells my current journey to New York has has made me a little tattered and and and and battered so I wasn't able to do any physical things it was more having a private conversation with the moon and the goddess that's why I had to take it last night you know sometimes you got to do what you got to do it's not all about the the props necessarily and and last night was definitely a prop free night sometimes you know that's what you got to do if you're sitting in your apartment in the city and you can't get outside or you know if you're just too busy or too tired I think going outside smoking a bowl saying thank you to the God and the goddess whatever to the Earth to the Moon whatever you need to do to kind of say that little prayer do that you know all the things that we've been working on since the new moon hopefully have come to fruition you know those Min cycles that we all go through month to month we also just had Friday the 13th is that a lucky or an unlucky day for you sh I like Friday the 13th I don't know maybe it's because I grew up like in Friday the 13th movies I don't know it's like the day of Jason I don't know I don't find it to be an unlucky thing personally but I know that that can really throw some people for a loop I mean do you find it to be lucky or unlucky I do find it to be lucky actually 13 has always been my lucky number since I was a kid um Friday the 13th it you know has always kind of been lucky for me I've always figured it was a great day instead of a bad day and I you know maybe it's just me being a contrarian [ __ ] when I was a kid perspective is half the battle truly it really is and you know I hear that like hospitals go crazy on the full moon and Friday the 13th and like I never really understood that I guess maybe because it wasn't unlucky for me and it wasn't something that bothered me on a spiritual level or anything it's all what you make it and I think people have made it a superstitious thing I think you're right on that you know we we can get things in our heads you know we can kind of get these ideas of things that are going to happen and uh maybe perspective is a lot of it you know kind of change your outlook and change how you how you feel about something you know what you pay attention to what's that what's that thing called where um confirmation bias or something like the thing you think you're going to see is the thing that you see so if you think Friday the 13th is unlucky you're going to pay attention yeah you'll pay attention to all the bad things that happen and if you think it's a lucky day then every time something good happens that's what will register in your brain I don't know yeah yeah it's it's definitely kind of a a I don't want to say mind over matter but you know sometimes life is what you make it and if you make it a [ __ ] show it's G to be a [ __ ] show that's true you know and if you make it good you definitely make it good speaking of make it good I'm am going to grab some of this Blissful wizard that my sweet sweet delivery driver just dropped off to me from the gas station I'll be right back I'm actually still smoking this dog patch I got a a couple containers of it I really like it I I really kind of thought let me try Leila's Theory here and lay off the absolute highest th content possible and give it a go so I I'm still smoking the Dog Patch I still like it I still think it's the greatest thing I might my next round going up to the store just check out some other things but for now I'm dog patching it and I love it I am also doing an old favorite here I'm smoking on some Blissful wizard that I just got delivered to me I have had this um cultivar before and I do like it a lot they just got back in stock so I was very happy to see it back on their website and I had to order another ounce of it do you have uh buying limits in California like in Massachusetts you can only buy like an ounce a week really yeah per person you can bu an ounce a week yeah wow yeah I am unaware of specific weekly limits like that here I feel a little bad I should look up those I really should know what those are um I think you can carry an ounce on you and have a lot of ounces at home wow that's terrible that I don't know what the rules are I'm I'm just so slacking really you can only buy an ounce a week I smoke about an ounce a week yeah right so if I hit my limit I'm screwed is that what you're saying kinda or I'd have to find someone else that's not cool you know there's some weeks when I there's some weeks especially if I'm having pain flareups or something I need more than an ounce a week I guess I'd have to just do concentrates for for pain I definitely smoke more like when it's damp so if we get a stretch of like two weeks of like rain I'm smoking way more in those two weeks because the dampness I I'm I'm sure there's some medical thing that I'm unaware of but the more damp it is the more I hurt it's like my back just hates the rain if I was only limited to one ounce a week i' I'd be seriously hurting some some months but yeah I am very surprised that you're not up and and and knowledgeable on your state laws like that's so unlike you that is unlike me again I know what you're allowed to carry that you're allowed to carry an ounce on you at a time you know but I am just not aware of how much you're allowed to buy per week I guess maybe because thankfully the laws at least you know no one's shaking me down outside the pot shop or calling me up to check in on me on how much I'm smoking so that's a good thing it's none of their business anyway you know unfortunately there's probably a database and that that's how they keep track oh I'm sure I'm sure there is as soon as you walk in you know they take your name your address your phone number they know everybody that's buying things at a dispensary oh see in Massachusetts it's um to get in the door they have to scan your license and then before you even order your license gets scanned Again by the cashier yeah here too either your medical card you know you're filling out your forms and giving them either your medical card or your license before you get anything yeah but you know whatever yeah you got to do what you got to do I I just wish that they would do better about some of the rules they need to make more common sense rules I just remember the first time I got a receipt for weed I was dumbfounded and so happy I thought I I was too I mean coming out here and going into my first dispensary I was over the moon I was like a kid in a candy shop I think you said the same thing it's quite an experience to go from just growing your own or or the black market to seeing legal weed on shelves with people walking around being like can I help you find something and they're talking about pot I love that right right that is is awesome that is very awesome and so is this Blissful wizard I'm I'm really liking it a lot it's it's one of the higher thc's you'd be happy oh is it yeah again it's over 30% I don't know the exact one this one might be 31 or 32 but it's right around there it's a nice flavor this one doesn't have a lot of it just has a nice weed flavor I can't really tell you say anything other than that it just it tastes like weed it tastes good you know it's that normal that normal weed yeah that normal light green kind of weedy taste it's it's good I like it a lot it's a good high you always have like this delicious good sounding stuff I like delicious good sounding stuff if it's not fun to smoke why are you smoking it why you smoking exactly you know you got to you got to enjoy things life is too freaking short and uh I would have to say this is a good high for the stories that we're about to launch into that have been submitted by some of our listeners and some you know people on different message boards online that have had amazing experiences and like I said in the beginning this is one of my favorite types of episodes to do because I love other people's stories and to kind of be all deep about it there's been for a lot of time a stigma around seeing ghosts hearing things you know things of that nature a stigma and I think if people started talking more about their experiences there wouldn't be so much oh you saw a ghost you're crazy I ain't crazy my grandpa just never left what are you talking about right I mean everybody has some sort of strange experience that they can't explain and I think we should definitely be a little skeptical we want to look into them and if there's a logical explanation you go with that one but when all logical explanations are gone and you're just left with something that's unusual and unexplained we should talk about it should share that why not you know we should right and not everything can be explained here people I mean yeah and they shouldn't be and besides it's fun this way what what good would a campfire be without a great ghost story that's unexplained exactly and you know same thing with the Cryptids Bigfoot's out there Bigfoot's out there and a quick oh oh I want to tell our listeners about this quick real quick crypted update so I love my daily You' got a crypted update sh I do oh give me the update so my my darling boyfriend loves sharks so we're always looking up shark stuff shark this shark that when you live in Massachusetts he's from Massachusetts born and bred yep and he loves sharks more than anything on the planet now I know how old he is so I know Jaws figured into his childhood absolutely ABS make this make sense how does this make sense so apparently down oh [ __ ] I don't remember where it was somewhere might have been England I don't know somewhere recently in the last two weeks or so this kid was like searching on the beach with his dad finding Treasures you know how people like look for seal glass and all that jazz I love doing that found a freaking Megalodon tooth what now now that dinosaur shark okay so you're thinking oh that's not any shark that's a dinosaur shark there's a bigger stop you're you're too high to say dinosaur I can't say dinosaur dinur cough to get off the other piece to that puzzle was also in light of this tooth being found this research group decided to let loose some footage from 2018 and in one of those Deep Sea underwater trenches they actually have video of a six 6 foot shark and let's just say great whites don't grow that big and a 60 foot shark they basically all but they all but have 100% proof that there is actually still a Megalodon living and breathing in the trenches up our [ __ ] oceans right now no no way like a giant sea monster still living in the wow like Jaws on steroids oh oh like that Jurassic Park one where the that big huge Megalodon shark like leaps up and eats the airplane or whatever they said based on on what they were able to get on the underwater cameras they're estimating its mouth wi like when you know they how they do the mouth width 10 feet it could eat me whole sideways and have room still I could stand on your head and it could eat us both sideways both wow we ain't talking freaking Jaws here like Jaws is like a little freaking T ja it could eat jaws and not think about it Jaws is a tadpole to this [ __ ] Jaws is nothing it's like [ __ ] Jaws yeah no this this was in the news in the last four or five days like this is [ __ ] scary and I'm like oh yeah let me just [ __ ] go jump in the ocean for a swim what the crazy things that we're going to find now that we can put you know cameras in more and more places we're just going to keep finding these crazy crazy things more and more well going to give us more stories to talk about right that just means we'll have more things for the podcast so if anybody is swimming deep in the ocean and you come across a megalodon please send us your true stories and a picture we would love a picture that'd be great St Witches Hour gmail.com my my first thought was oh my God another crypted yeah I went there I went there so when is shark NATO going to do the Megalodon version I think they already did did they there's so many I've lost track there's a Megalodon movie on Netflix like yeah it's all yeah you guys have probably seen all of them since your boyfriend like shark so much oh more than I would like to have seen okay I'm not down in the actors and producers and directors but Lord I'm over it now since this is probably a dinosaur are they sure it's a shark and not a ghost dinosaur shark did their cameras pick up like the ghost of a of a dinosaur shark down there or are they sure it was dark they showed pieces of the video it looks like a big [ __ ] shark man like it's scary that sounds very scary and how how they were able to gauge what they thought the estimated size was like the mouth width and the length of it was that at the bottom of that trench there was a um mangled up old shark cage oh so they could get an estimate of size and it was it was swimming near the shark cage so that's how they were totally able to come up with relativ accurate measurements based on the size of the shark cage now what trench was this the Mariano trench I know that one's like the deepest one I don't think it was that one that's the only one I know the name of give me two seconds I don't know any other like jingle to hum I think Jeopardy has broken my brain jeopard is all we got jeopard all we got um you were right how' you know that did you read the article no I didn't the Mariano trench is the only one I know the name of oh okay I thought you read the article yeah basically it says a giant shark caught on camera scouring the bottom of the Mariana Trench has sparked debate about if megal is megalodons still exist the huge Predator can be seen swimming over what seems to be an abandoned shark cage the giant prehistoric shark called a Megalodon ate everything in its path and was said to lurk in the Earth's deepest oceans holy [ __ ] if there's one that means it had parents right and it says that the footage reemerged after being filmed in 2018 and its proof that they're not extinct um people are still debating it online but one one of the the persons in the research team said that they thought that the deeper they went into the Seas they'd see things like the giant squids that they thought were extinct so this is why they can't be terribly surprised that the deeper they go the more they're finding things we thought were gone wow that may not be gone that's wild that's so scary you got to remember there's still there's still millions and millions of square miles of ocean that we just don't even have a clue about but they estimate that a a shark this size could eat five full grown orcas in one bite like at SeaWorld orcas freaking SeaWorld orcas man free Willie or there says that the giant shark could weigh the same as five buses and we believe because we're pompous human beings we believe that they died off around three million years ago well obviously they did not but again this this video that's just resurfaced is from 2018 so there's that crypted news you're not kidding that really has to make you wonder what else have we missed what else is lurking in the deep dark shadows that we haven't found yet or that's hiding on purpose Godzilla's there man I'm telling you all these different creatures lurking under the ocean or under the mountains who knows we don't we don't know I just want Dragon I just want dragons to make a reappearance I thought the same thing I was like you know if there's giant sharks maybe there's dragons if shit's coming back can we bring back dragons I don't know then there's going to be virgin sacrifices they're going to lay waste to towns and Villages you know people are going to try to hunt them down for their hordes I mean it it's just you're going to run out of virgins eventually I was going to say I will not be subjected to any virgin sacrifices but well I know but we need to protect the Youth of the you the Youth of the planet yeah the uncorrupted we need to protect the uncorrupted wow that is a cool story shell I I have no idea I I wanted to mention that I mean I have no like spookiness around it but I definitely wanted to mention it because I know we got a lot of listeners that are definitely into that type of thing that that may not have caught that on on the internet news but yeah there is 60 feet worth of spookiness right there his mouth is 10 feet wide 10 feet wide 10 feet wide mouth that is spooky that is extra spooky that's wider than a car the fact that some sort of dinosaur could still exist and we didn't know that's spooky that is really spooky what's spooky is the way we're treating this planet and the fact that some of this shit's going to come back and whoop our asses okay different podcast different podcast so let's talk about some more mundane spookiness rather than the end of the world as we know it and we'll talk about some scary stories from some of our listeners we have some some good stories today first of all I want to again thank our folks that sent in our stories that that got us on Reddit that sent us emails you're great we we adore your stories and we the the two times we've done this we do get a bunch so if if you've sent in a story to us and we didn't get to it today never fear we are going to be doing a bunch of these throughout the months and and time to come we just we just can only do so many in an episode so for the ones we're going to do today love your stories and we can't wait to tell everybody yeah thank you guys so much and if you do have a story that you want to tell us and have us possibly read on the air please send them to the stoned Witches Hour at gmail.com I want to start with with with a a fun story this is from one of our listeners Saad sonh home so Satie writes in that this is actually her husband's story but it scares the [ __ ] out of her okay I'm already okay if if if she's getting the [ __ ] scared out of her I'm listening this happened a few years before they met she didn't say when when or how long they've been together so I'm not sure how long ago this was but it happened to her husband before they met she says let me just say that my husband is a man of logic and science oh I know the type S know the type she says he believes in ghosts but it's literally the last conclusion he jumped to to explain anything seemingly unexplainable same same right but he couldn't explain or didn't want to explain this experience those are the ones that scare you the most the ones you don't want you're so scared you just don't want to talk about it yeah the ones where you think try to think of something anything logical to explain it and you really just can't no matter how hard you try those scare me and then you're torn between am i g to sound crazy or Scare myself more by talking about it right Saad sunol's husband travels a lot for work and at this time he was at a hotel in Savannah Georgia well there's the first reason why he was having some ghosty stuff he was in Savannah Georgia Savannah Georgia I think it's w to wall ghost there I'm pretty sure you might as well be in New Orleans yeah you can't walk down any of those streets without running into a ghost remind me I got to tell you the time that I saw a ghost of a stripper on Bourbon Street I I'll tell you the story one of these days that'll be a whole episode in and of itself don't worry guys we we'll make her tell the story we'll make it a whole episode we'll get graphic it'll be great okay so the husband's in Savannah Georgia already haunted in a hotel in the bathroom mirror directly faced another mirror on the back of the bathroom door so like you know when the bathroom door is closed like two mirrors are kind of facing each other type deal like the sink in the back of the door is what I'm gathering when the door was closed it kind of created that infinity mirror look that's already a bad idea I hate that that's one of my those creep me out you know where where where that it seems to get smaller and smaller Reflections that go on infinitely type those are so scary so one night and I'm assuming he was alone one night he was in the bathroom getting ready for bed and the door was closed and he was in front of the sink mirror noticing his many Reflections when one popped its head out of the long line of them and made and and made a [ __ ] up face wait no wait so it was like his face popped out one of the reflections one of his no no it made a [ __ ] up face at him no no no no no no so this wasn't a person in the other room like kind of interrupting his reflection black holes instead of eyes an evil grin no you are no no get out of that house oh my God he was in a hotel he was in a hotel get out of that hotel go go oh my god get a different room now I would imagine if he was traveling for work I mean we're talking about a a a grown man here he was freaked out so bad that he went into his bed and hid under the covers until he fell asleep because he didn't know what else to do that's actually a smart move you know under the covers definitely protection but damn I might have changed rooms now now St Sunol are you listening because I want to know has this happened again and not only has it happened again was it a one-time thing but would he be willing to try to recreate this shell do not listen to no no do not listen shell what maybe there's a message maybe there's a portal to like a demonic realm that you need to know you have to close you can't just IGN you don't open no you don't open it oh my goodness you don't think you should try again and see no no I do not I Absolut you better listen to Lea you better listen to Lea s son home because I'm always the one that gets us into trouble it's true I'm nosy and want to know but listen TOA no I would yes so that's sati's story and and I'm freaked out and I want to know but listen TOA I I understand being curious and and I say yes to your shenanigans more than I say no because you know it's usually fun and interesting but I have a healthy fear of mirrors and portals in mirrors they really freak me out um and and I just think that uh that's not something necessarily that you should [ __ ] with that s's husband should just let it lay and let bu gun I don't know I I think I would be sealing I think I would be doing using sealing oil or some type of spell on any reflective surface for the rest of my life if that happened at the very least I just want to know if it's happened again don't provoke it but I just want to know if he's had other was that a one and done but if he's one of those types of guys honestly and I'm not knocking him but he might be afraid to tell people if it happened again that's true especially if if he's a skeptic would you would you continue to look I know you would I would because I just am a nosy Troublemaker I would because I'm an idiot but and and my curiosity gets the best of me even though half of my brain is usually screaming to stop the other half is right half of my brain is an adult and the other half is like a very curious toddler yeah Shad sonol we we like your story um we think it is freaky we agree with you and like I said listen to Lila but I do want to know if he's had any other experiences let us know and thank you thank you thank you all right I've got one this also has to do with a husband so this is it's always the husbands right maybe they're maybe they get us into more trouble maybe yeah this one's from organic ad 66 77 and she says one day my husband came home and said that his friend had recently acquired a house with air conditioning available and asked if we would like to rent it since the house we lived in only had a swamp cooler the previous summer was horrible and we suffered through some extreme heat I was not going to pass on this opportunity and so we signed all of the paperwork and moved in right away one early morning while getting home from dropping off my husband at work I was suddenly overcome with such a strong feeling of nausea I thought nothing of it and parked the car as I stepped into the house my eyes fixated on the kitchen area there he was a man who was seethrough what yeah he was bent over peeking at me from the wall between the kitchen and the living room hiding himself from the waist down he was just staring at me as soon as I saw him I dropped my keys to the tile floor he quickly stood upright and was not hiding his whole self behind the wall now normally I would have screamed but at this age I was over it having seen so many spirits since my early childhood I had grown accustomed to the unexpected visits I turned on the lights in every room making sure that no one was physically there and went to bed yeah but just just because they're not physically there doesn't mean they're not there to play games and have some [ __ ] sounds like she's used to it and she's just like hey he didn't do anything there's no she checked to make sure it wasn't a real person she's like it's just a spirit she seems used to it so yeah she seems like just over it so she went to bed later that night on a ride home from work I told my husband of this unexpected visitor he laughed at me nervously and told me to quit making up stories I brushed him off because I knew that he had never experienced anything like this before yeah my brother passed away shortly after this a a I'm sorry that's not cool and I have I have four brothers and I would be devastated and we decided to move in with my dad so that he would not be alone during our grieving process my husband did not work on Mondays and he decided to finish cleaning house cleaning out the old house and turn in the keys to the landlord since that was his friend when I got to my dad's house that night my husband said that he needed to talk to me I asked him if he had turned in the keys and he yelled yes he said to listen to him and that what he had to say was serious I sat up straight and gave him my full attention not saying a word he said he had gone into the rental house and started to sweep the floors since there was no furniture inside he said that every noise echoed as he started to sweep he said he heard a man's voice clearly say do you need some help here what he said it startled him and he began looking around and saw that no one was there first of all I would have said yes could you grab a broom please right if you're G to talk to me you could at least help pick up right he said that every hair on the back of his neck stood up and swore that it sounded like someone was standing right behind him talking directly into his ear you know I hate that why can't they why can't ghosts talk to you from across the room like a normal person why all up on your space it's always like right up next to your ear so rude personal boundaries that's what I'm saying talk like a normal conversation you don't need to be touching me to talk to me thank you he said that he ran out of that house so fast he forgot to lock the doors he finally decided to tell me that the landlord had bought the house because the little old man that lived there previously had died inside the home a and that he had been dead for some days before anyone found him he's still home and after having experienced this firsthand it's safe to say my husband is now a Believer see here's the thing the guy still lives there in his mind so he's thinking that someone's there cleaning his house so he offers to help he offered to help you know he was just kind of checking them out when they first moved in sounds like they were probably the first people to move in after the the owner passed wow hearing auditory things like that that's really got to creep you out especially as a non-believer to hear something right there Clearly say do you want some help with that and to know there's no one there I'm just glad their go-to was not a Ouija board yeah that's right they at least didn't take any Ouija boards there smart that well it sounds like she's experienced so she knows better right right gez well I guess it's not so bad because they they kind of put all the pieces together after moving out obviously that spirit is connected to that that land space so right and he doesn't sound he doesn't sound mean just a little spooky you know I I believe and maybe I'm the crazy nut job here it's conceivable but I believe that that Spirits kind of have a sense of who's listening you know what I mean oh yeah I think so too sure I've heard that I've definitely heard that theory before so maybe when he was peeking around the corner maybe he was trying to make his presence known but didn't want to scare her yeah and maybe when he saw that she was kind of nonchalant about it he was just like okay then he turned into more relaxed ghosty where he was like all right we're just going to coexist here yeah until it until it was time for them to move out you know I've noticed sometimes that movein and move outs you know when things are chaotic when you do some type of renovation or you know when when the energy is kind of stirred up in a location I was going to say CU you're changing things yeah sometimes that can kind of make a ghost or a some type of Haunting a little more active yeah in in my next story I'm going to tell kind of kind of the same thing people that just don't know they're gone people that just kind of linger linger in their space so this next story from medicine number 8424 I think that's what it means medicine no 8424 I think that should be number is like what it's short for I don't know medicine n 8424 their Story begins in 1973 uh their grandparents bought a house that had been vacant for several years what is with people buying dead people's houses and vacant houses that's the thing we were just talking about when you disturb things so you leave the ghosts alone for a few years and they're all just hanging out chilling happily haunting their little quiet house and then you come in and disturb everything of course they're going to kind of Pop up it's like adding roommates the previous owners of this house had died in a car accident actually it sounded kind of tragic a mother a father and two small children were killed that's terrible that is tragic they were actually a family of seven so the mother and the father and two small children were killed three older daughters were not with them and were left out oh wow that's terrible those poor kids they basically had five kids and only had two of them with them that died oh the three older daughters went and lived with relatives after that the house was vacant so when when this person moved in the house had been vacant they describe it as literally Frozen in time for about four years our listener was too young to help but remembered them removing like rotten food from the cabinets in the refrigerator so like basically once this family died they just the relatives kind of took the other remaining kids shut the door and nobody touched anything in the house for four years including the food everything was just left like a time capsule not touched all their clothes and personal belongings came with the sale of the house obviously when these folks moved in they threw most of it away pictures and momentos were giving to the given to the remaining daughters uh at the time because they were in their teens so our listener lived in the house uneventful for years till one summer day the grandmother the sister and and this person were sitting in the living room watching TV the grandma was on the phone doing the grandma chaty Cathy thing right like how grandmas are gossiping about all the things how grandmas are um they had the windows open and they had the screen door keeping all the flies out and stuff when they looked uh looked out at the end of a long walk saw people and dress clothes coming through the gate oh never unexpected visitors are never cool especially when they're all dressed up right makes me always wonder like you know if they're door to-door religious sales people or something wait for it so the grandma gets off the phone and looks out the window and sees people coming up and right away the grandmother said oh those are Jehovah Witnesses let's go into the yeah let's go into the kitchen so they don't see us yeah Grandma how many people have done that in those days they were kind of the the equivalent I guess of the let's talk about your car's extended warranty type people we have all had those Jehovah Witnesses at our door yes we have we we feel you so they go and they they go and hide in the kitchen out of sight thinking theyd knock a few times and leave so they're hiding quiet in the kitchen for a few minutes when they heard the screen door open in a few and open for a few seconds and then slam closed again what they came in the house oh no mm- nope nope nope I'm sorry door to religious sales people are bad enough you can't come in the house that's not cool grandma was pissed rightfully so no one was just gonna walk into her damn house Uninvited with the kids there or not right go off on them Grandma so so our listener was ready for for Grandma to unleash her Hellfire on these people I love that Hellfire that's such a that's such a grandma thing to do release the Hellfire right and you never want Grandma to release that because Grandma can be just to warrn everybody out there I'm a grandma now so I'm going to be releasing some Hellfire okay so the kids follow her into the living room guess what what nobody's there wait they came in the door the door only opened and closed once shell they didn't leave where are are they further in the house now the way the way our listener explains it is the breeze coming through the screen door strangely created a feeling like being at a cemetery after the funeral when everyone had left that was the feeling I got and I don't know if that's why I would have described it at the time I don't know if that's the way I would have described it at the time but it was a real peaceful feeling as if they were finally uh at rest oh wow grandma looked puzzled they walked out into the porch nobody just the breeze blowing through the trees they described it as the erious feeling to see nothing and not knowing what happened so they went back into the house and didn't say anything because remember they saw a group of people walking to their door yeah dressed nice that have now poof [ __ ] vanished gone so they saw a group of people dressed up walking to the door assuming they were Jehovah Witnesses so they went and hid in the kitchen they came in the house they did and then now they're just gone and no one heard them leave no one heard them leave so that that no one said anything to each other because they were kind of freaked out so next day Grandma's working in her garden and the neighbor came to the fence and was talking about how good her garden looked and how they really needed some rain after a few minutes of conversation the neighbor asked the grandmother about the visitors and the grandmother said what visitors now the neighbors were old people as well wait why did the grandma say what visitors because no one was there remember right but they saw them that she saw them walking down the walk though right they disappeared Leila they [ __ ] disappeared I would wouldn't you say you mean the ones that dis you saw them too or something I don't know I'm just confused back in the 70s early 80s you don't say that or you're going to the so she was like she was like what do you mean what visitors trying to see what that lady would think to you know see if she had seen them too yeah because you know these neighbors are super old people too and knew the whole family their whole life so the grandmother you know the grandmother and this lady went to school together there's no secrets mhm so she says the people that came to your house yesterday and the grandmother told her what happened and that we didn't see them after that the neighbors saw them too that's wild the lady next door begins to tell Grandma that they saw those people come down an old holler across the road that led to the top of the mountain and there hadn't been a house up there in 25 years she just assumed as they did that they were Jehovah Witnesses going from door to door and that they didn't realize there was nothing up there she told the person's grandmother that it was a man and a woman with two small kids and that they were dressed like they had just come from church after they came through the gate they were halfway down the walk and the man turned and hugged the woman as if to comfort her and the kids were walking and playing with them when they got to the front door the man pulled the door open and held it for the woman and the kids and then followed them in so the neighbors saw way more than the people inside the people inside saw them coming up their walk and went and hid this neighbor saw them walk down the street wow basically what the deal is the family that owned the house that got killed in the car accident on the way to church you know so so the three girls live there with Grandma so the other other grandchildren and I don't know if it was like the son and daughter-in-law or daughter and son-in-law were basically coming home to see their other kids oh that's so sad oh my goodness so basically they went from wherever the car accident was to come home oh wow oh wow but the weird part is is that the like you said the neighbors saw everything damn and so the neighbors saw the kids the neighbors saw them playing the neighbors saw them open the door and go in and at first thought they were real people yep until the conversation yeah yeah the lady's child and grandchildren that had passed were coming home wow that is downright spooky I don't know if they ever had that experience again again medicine no 8424 I want to know was this a one and done or has it happened again does your grandmother still own the house I guess or someone in your family St in the house I guess would be the first question because if you're not associated with that property it might not it might not uh happen again oh my goodness wow and so and then the family came back oh my goodness they were just coming home they were literally coming home two completely separate people completely separate families saw them yeah talk about a corroboration that's that's that's really spooky you know you're not seeing [ __ ] when when the neighbors next door are are coating your story right oh my goodness I'm gonna hit this Blissful wizard because that's that's sad that's sad and spooky it almost sounds like as he was consoling her as they walked up the door it was almost like I know we're dead but we're home you know what I mean right I wonder if that was the first and last time oh my goodness I wonder what triggered it I don't know I don't know wow yeah that one is sad the way the story was told it doesn't sound like there was necessarily A trigger no now see that's a time when you would want to have like one of those ring cameras or home security system well yeah and this next story that I have they did W did they send a video please tell me they send a video is there a video you'll see is there video or is there not this is from Momo 52915 and they say last night around 10 p.m. my boyfriend and I were sitting in the living room trying to find a movie they said last night so this is like a real time story right this yeah they sent it right after it happened ni trying to find a movie to watch on Amazon Prime video as one does we have video surveillance cameras everywhere outside two that point to the front door at different angles one for the backyard and one for each side of the house the monitor screen is kept in the living room on a table next to the recliner that I was sitting in I just sat down for not even 5 minutes then I heard a child's Voice come over the monitor the voice said hello I thought to myself for a minute the [ __ ] does my son have his bedroom window open and he's yelling through the window for some reason and the camera is picking it up because there is a camera next to his bedroom window I'd be freaked out I'd be like who's in my [ __ ] kid's bedroom then she remembered no it can't be because he's sleeping in my room in my bed oh I called upstairs to him and he answered I look at the monitor screen and I see a man who appeared to be very tall what right what is it with these weird people showing up at people's houses at all hours don't [ __ ] with the kids ma'am you want to to all the ghosts out there all the ghosts in the universe don't [ __ ] with the kids man that's just rude leave the kids alone so this tall gentleman in the monitor is wearing a red and white flannel shirt and holding a little girl's hand she had on a like striped long sleeve shirt and she had frizzy blonde hair they were walking up the steps to get into our entryway and I turned to my boyfriend and said Somebody's here we live in the middle of absolute nowhere we live by a swamp my closest neighbors are bears and coyotes and a couple Amish houses about a mile or so down the road preach it sister so this probably is not going to be Jehovah's Witnesses like the last story that's a little too far out right there are never ever any people at least that we know of who go walking down our street in the pitch black with no street lights on a back road at 10 p.m. at night so it seemed very strange to us us too Momo just as the man and the girl get to our front door my boyfriend opens the door and sees no one they were gone ah here we go again not a single trace or sign of them my boyfriend goes outside by the road to see if he could see any cars but there was nothing we thought maybe they were having car trouble and stopped for help but there were no signs of that being a possibility I let the dog outside and my boyfriend went outside with a flashlight but nothing was there that's when you hide under the covers and you send your boyfriend out to handle it or you stick together you know Scooby-Doo people never separate never separate grab your Scooby Snacks grab your flashlight and your pipe and don't separate and get high and figure it out that's right get your blankie throw it over both of you you should be good I sent my dog outside and my boyfriend went outside with a flashlight but nothing was there we watched the camera footage and the people coming to the door never recorded what but she saw it on the monitor now let me ask you this and and and maybe maybe Momo didn't say this but I'm curious you know me I always got questions you have questions was there a blip in the recording almost like it was [ __ ] with like a blip or did it was it a smooth running and she knows she saw it on the Monitor and then when they looked it back it was smooth running like I'm just wondering if there was a blip curious minds want to know Momo she doesn't say here but if you're listening send us an email now Momo the problem is I just want to let you know the problem is this this dog patch weed just is like such an upper in a chatty type weed that like I have all these questions do well she's got some more to say oh boy we reviewed old camera footage and saw nothing that looked or sounded like that we don't even know people that look like that or have ever had anybody that could have possibly come over that looked like that my boyfriend does not believe in ghosts but seeing that we had no explanation for this I think he changed his mind we have lived in the house for 4 years and I personally have never experienced anything until last night then my boyfriend admitted that the one night I was at work he saw something moving in the yard and thought it was an animal but when he went out to look nothing was there but my son's tire swing was swinging back and forth but like crazy oh jeez my son has been complaining for the past few months that he doesn't like to sleep in his bed because it sounds like something is crawling around under his bed and his bed shakes oh my God the original part of the house was built in the 1800s and was used as an old schoolhouse an addition was put onto the house 20 years ago to make it bigger the old school Master used to live across the street in a house that is no longer there I talked to my boyfriend today and we both said that what happened was really weird and we've come to terms with it potentially being a ghost sighting I know that I'm not crazy because he saw them and heard the voice too I've seen many ghosts in my lifetime I just wondered what took so long for me to see one here what bothers me is that it seemed like they wanted to get my ATT attension and it makes me feel very uneasy a few days leading up to this I would sit in the living room and just feel overwhelming dread and terrible anxiety after seeing them I don't feel any of that anymore so weird why would that's that's weird right interesting reaction yeah so like before it happened she was feeling like overwhelming dread and anxiety in that front room that old part of the schoolhouse and then she hears a little kid say hello and sees a kid and possibly the old school teacher on the monitor but no recording and then felt better you usually it's like the opposite type reaction I mean great for her I I'd rather have a happy ending than some crazy Exorcist thing going on but like it's not a normal reaction it's so strange maybe it was kind of building like the energy was building to something maybe an anniversary or or maybe something that they had done had had stirred them up in some way and then it was just kind of a oneandone event or maybe it happened before and they just didn't notice it till that time right maybe they weren't there maybe it happens like every night at 10 p.m. or something yeah yeah and they just this hap this one time happened to see it it's just wild that they both experienced it wow that's cool though very cool story thank you for sending it in that's spooky I like the weird experiences like that so creepy and and just you know you get two people that see it and and that just makes it even harder to explain and more fun and more fun absolutely so I'm gonna I'm going to tell you my my last viewer story we each got one left this one threw me for a little Loop that's why I kind of saved this one for last oh I'm excited all right I'm ready to be creeped out so this is from Mick Kimble 0664 that's so weird I used to have a phone number that ended in 0664 so Mick Kimble writes I bought my first house in 2003 and was over the moon nothing better than buying a house shortly after moving in two of my neighbors began joking with me about the ghost in my house and all right did your real estate agent not disclose that because I feel like they should I'd buy a haunted house aren't some states supposed to tell you if something like that happens isn't having a haunting like one of those actionable events that they have to disclose I don't even know I think it's some state it's true so Mick Kimble thought that they were joking and just played along pretending that that they had seen one and that it was no big deal okay that sounds fun is as time went on that summer they met more and more of neighbors and they all brought it up every one of them finally an elderly woman on the Block who was quite kind and friendly told me the story after I'd asked her I knew she wasn't going to screw with my head which is why ID asked in the first Place turned out the previous owner purchased the home and never lived there because she said it was haunted so first of all all right there's your first clue someone buys the house and refuses to move in well the first clue was everyone in the neighborhood having a story and knowing that the place is haunted it has a reputation I hope you got a discount for that first right I don't know in today's market that might be a selling point you know that you might be able to double your asking price comes with ghosts pric is now doubled sounds in the night of footsteps and sobbing and glimpses of a man sitting at the in the kitchen covered in blood ah that would be the one that would be the part that freaked me out that covered in blood people crying and someone covered in blood in the kitchen no wonder she refused to move in I those are not good roommates those are not good roommates one of the neighbors had helped with the renovations of the house and said that he was putting up drywall when he felt something lift up his dreadlocks why do they have to touch you personal space ghosts personal space ghost boundaries we need boundaries that really ghosts that don't respect boundaries are super scary though MC Kimble has had has had a paranormal experience before it had been years and by then they had just chocked it up to night tears well one day they went to a small Neighborhood video store to rent a movie like Hollywood Video type thing I would imagine well that kind of dates this yeah right Hollywood Video they had to fill out a for with their demographic data and then their credit card info and the owner of the store looked at the form and said oh my God you live in that house another person this reputation of this house is kind of that's you know you don't often this is like an Amityville Horror level reputation when you're walking into a random establishment and they're like oh my God you live there like that's when you know that's a red flag that is a red flag that's when you start to think about maybe may I should put this up for sale or turn it into a BNB M Kimble asked her what she meant and she explained that her former employee had committed suicide in mim's house oh no she came to the house as soon as she had heard but the house been taped off by police as a potential crime scene oh my gosh she told her the video workers the video store worker told her that that he had just moved into the house with his partner and called his mom because he wanted to invite her over to meet his partner and come out to her now this was in the early 90s when being gay was a big deal yeah you know people are [ __ ] people are it should never have been an issue anyway his mother already knew he was gay because he bought the house with a man and disowned him right over the phone oh that's sad too oh that's terrible how could you do that to your kid so you know mother disowns him right over the phone I would have thought in the 90s we would have been better but we're not apparently I thought people were better but I guess not everybody no that same week he received a letter from the HIV testing center stating that he had tested positive for HIV oh my goodness this story just gets worse and worse this was when HIV was a death sentence and he sat guy he sat at the kitchen table ate a bowl of cereal and then shot himself in the head with a Revol so since then she's had she's had multiple paranormal experiences in her store this this is the video store owner that where he worked right she's tell she's telling mckimble that she's had um videos fly off the shelf even levitating off shelves I mean that's crazy it seems like the most they experience is sounds at night sounds of Cheerios being poured into a bowl which Mick Kimble wanted to point out that they don't even eat cereal and sounds of sobbing in the kitchen and mck Kimble often awakens to both because again he ate cereal and then killed himself at the kitchen table so to hear that sobbing at the kitchen table makes total sense mckimble remembers she said my grandmother said when the dead come to you they want something perform an act of Charity in their name and pray for them that's what her grandmother told her to do that's good advice so they did sat down at the kitchen table one night lit a candle and told him that each night I would recite the Novena prayer for him before a lit Candle on the ninth night of the first Novena to St Anthony the patron saint of lost souls uh mckimble heard an uncontrollable sobbing felt a strong presence of grief and despair and then the sound of hyperventilating breathing as though someone could not catch their breath oh wow mck Kimble sat in the presence of this knowing it was not malignant but rather a connection of intimacy and compassion for which she was in need wow How brave basically mck Kimble was providing emotional support to ghost a ghost essentially that that takes big balls and that should be a career that takes ovaries right there so for 45 days a days yeah right so for 45 days mckimble said the Novena prayer before a lit candle for his soul and had a and had a mass set in his name and a few times um they had awakened to feel his presence standing over their bed but knew it was not a malignant presence and it still happens from time to time but less and less frequently wow it sounds like maybe it worked how nice of them to do that you know what it sounds like it almost sounds like you did me a solid and now I'm gonna watch over you yeah yeah it does almost like the ghost is now her her friend because that compassion of helping his soul kind of I want say heal heal is not the right word but maybe come to terms yeah get ready to move on maybe he just needed someone for the first time in his life being a gay man in that time just needed someone to show compassion and mck Kimble showed the pass compassion and now kind of has ghosty friend for life well I think so too oh my gosh that's what a wonderful service that ghost duing yeah so mck Kimble 0664 for first of all you [ __ ] rock and second of all love your story very sad story extra sad story okay so what's your what's your final story what you got today to wrap up our listener stories this one is also kind of sad this one so the person who wrote this story is an artist actually I found their art page after um after reading their story and I'll have to put a link to it cuz it's some pretty pretty interesting art very very creepy cool o yeah definitely link that stuff right up on this on this episode page so mortise malum has a story and he writes when I was 13 my older brother who was 18 and I were on our way to a movie when we were hit by a drunk driver oh [ __ ] that's horrible that is horrible I woke up in hospital 4 days later having lost my right leg and the other leg was in a cast along with many other in injuries oh my God that night I woke up to my brother sitting by my bed telling me that everything will be okay and to go back to sleep the next day my parents came to visit and see how I was doing I asked why my brother wasn't with them and they looked at each other but didn't say anything that night I again woke up to my brother sitting by my bed and he was again telling me that he knows I can get through this and I need to be strong and overcome this and not let my injuries stop me from living life oh oh no his brother was a ghosty don't give it shelle spoiler alert we talked a bit him not answering specific questions but answering more general questions I remember asking him why he was still wearing clothes from yesterday because it was very unlike him to wear anything similar to what he wore the day before he didn't answer that but when I asked how he was he said better than he thought he would be given the circumstances he reminded me to be strong and keep living and not let anything stop me and he told me how much he loved me before telling me I should get some more sleep the next day my parents again came to visit me in the hospital and again I asked why my brother wasn't with them they looked at each other and it was only after I said that I would like my family to visit together and not at different times and that I want my brother to visit during the day with them when he could talk more instead of at night that was when my dad asked what I meant and I told him that Andy my brother had been coming at night to visit my mom broke down crying and left the room my dad then told me that that was impossible because Andy had died instantly in the accident oh my God that's horrible I didn't believe it and I argued and argued and ended up having to be sedated holy [ __ ] that night I had no visit and the next day my parents brought me the newspaper article about the accident years later my now ex fiance had an experience and having never seen a photo of my brother she described him to a tea and what he was wearing the night he died oh [ __ ] that's a story for another time but it was nice knowing that my brother is still around and looking out for me and those that I care about a that's horrible but I'm glad that his brother still comes because he that connection is still there can you imagine having the ability to say goodbye like that I mean it's it's so sad that his brother died instantly but what a gift to be able to talk to him and to and to have him tell you to be strong I don't want to say it gave him a little closure but there was a little more than nothing you know might not have been full closure but at least he there was some peace made exactly sad it is sad it is sad but you know it it's also it's also a little hopeful you know because again his even though his brother died instantly he was able to to pass some wisdom on to his little brother and to give him hope you know what a nice gift that's a nice gift that is and and hopefully there'll be more visits throughout the rest of his lifetime yeah oh my goodness so spooky I'm going to smoke more Blissful wizard let me tell you we had some great stories today I love when we do these these books I do too they're so scary listeners we love you we love your stories you're awesome really you guys rock and have the creepiest spookiest best stories I love them so much so please go ahead and send us more we adore reading them and you know hey what what better to do on a rainy spring day than to curl up with a nice bong and a spooky story and and just kind of chill out and relax right exactly and remember Megalodons are out there people you know just when the beach is about to open and I'm about to go snorkeling again shell now you've got me scared to go back in the water no you're gonna go snorkeling and look for Clues I'm not looking for a Megalodon uhuh no no thank you regular shark scary enough what's what's the matter Colonel Sanders chicken uh when it comes to Megalodon they probably would think I was chicken I'm just I'm like a chicken nugget just a snack just remember they can eat you whole sideways I know it's so scary he wouldn't even blink he'd still be hungry after he ate both of us it eating one human would be like flossing with a toothpick for them it's probably a good thing they don't get high because can you imagine the munchies if you were a 60 foot long Megalodon well I remember when I was reading the article it said something ridiculous like they have 276 teeth like that's a lot of teeth that's too many teeth and I wonder if they're like sharks today that constantly keep shedding and regrowing teeth I don't know but I feel like I have a lot of teeth and I do not have 276 teeth that's a lot of teeth nobody needs to see that when they're swimming I'm very high and that's too much shark and too much spooky for me we should close off on something nice so next week is our episode 20 sh can you believe it oh my God I cannot believe it we

learn about and find about we want to also let you guys know out there you know this stuff happens to us too as you know I read tarot cards and I've often done tarot parties and people usually ask me if I see Spirit and that's not really my forte you know calling ghosts or seeing ghosts that's not a huge thing but I've had a really pushy ghost I did a party right for these people and there was a young man that kept coming and he was very insistent and and I don't usually see ghosts that are his energy was just really pushy and strong and and kind of brash and funny and it turned out that they had had a friend that had passed away unexpectedly so I it was interesting I had a little bit of information for them but again not my forte so I only had a little bit but the funny thing is is about a year later I was doing a reading online um like through Zoom with a client and this ghost kept coming up same one same one but it had nothing to do with the client that I was reading but he had a he was so insistent that he had a message for his friends that he came in during a reading I was doing for someone else that's like interrupting a phone call it had never happened to me before or since it was the weirdest sensation again this was like a year later and so I had to look up her information I sent her a message like you know hey I remember when we did this reading and your friend so and so well he just came back through and he has this message for you and it it turned out to be very timely for her so pushy ghost pushy apparently he was it was very important and he had to be very pushy about it but you know sometimes I don't remember where I was going high but pushy life pushy after death you know some people are just pushy but yeah personal experiences with ghosts U or or
