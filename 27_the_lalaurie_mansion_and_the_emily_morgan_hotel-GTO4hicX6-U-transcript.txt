let me try this intro right because this is the week finally finally you're going to be me and I'm going to be you so I'm gonna see if I can do this as good as you so it's witchcraft [Laughter] [Music] welcome to the stoned Witches Hour where two best friends from two opposite coasts talk about spooky paranormal crypted weedy getting high having fun creepy best friends stuff with a tad and a Sprinkle of witchy fairy dust so join us because tonight sh is Lea Lea shell who can tell oh my God I'm doing True Crime tonight I can't even believe it so I'm shell who the hell are you I'm really stoned hold on I'm so used to going first and I'm so [ __ ] high right now I'm Leila hi you know I'm glad you remembered who you were finally you know it's just so weird because we were separated for a week again and now I'm you and you're me like holy crap people and and I'm so so wasted well we're both wasted but that's okay yes oh this week shell this week you made me go way outside my comfort zone what did I make you do this time you challenged me to find a hospital or a Mental Health institution that has a spooky past oh my god did you find one I did and you know I hate those yes yes yes yes and you know what this true crime thing holy crap there's ghosts there's murder this is like one big freaking ball of like good story all into one yeah there's a lot there there's definitely a lot and that's the thing sometimes with these especially with some of these older more horrific True Crime locations there really does tend to be a lot of Paranormal Activity well and I also think part of it is because there was not the law enforcement followup back then as there is now if you know what I mean like you can get away with [ __ ] back in like the 1800s that you just don't get away with now people were doing some horrific [ __ ] that like nobody was calling them out on and horrific [ __ ] creat creates ghosts let's just it really does really does so while I'm over here having I am doing all the bubble hash and smoking all the good weed I I will admit that this is a jar of something I didn't label oh [ __ ] are you smoking some mysteri stuff I am I'm smoking mystery weed I think it's like six months old I don't even know what I'm smoking I've kind of reached into the back of my cabinet and I'm like hey this looks really good like it's like the weed fairy visited my visited my closet it is it's perfect it you know it it it is older I I it's like four to six months old and I didn't label it unfortunately I think it's kind of a a sativa because it does have a little bit more of that head high I'm definitely more talkative more giggly more shell likee and it's got It's got that really good green gassy taste you know when you you take a h of weed and it almost tastes like that smell when you're gassing up your car on a summer afternoon you have that like it literally it has that gasoline taste and when I was like younger I used to think it was because they packaged it that way because at the time weed was illegal and they'd package it and all kinds of crazy [ __ ] well to be [ __ ] honest shell that might actually be how it happened a lot of times they would use different things like that to try and disguise the smell like like laundry detergent remember when you smoke it was like so much like freaking tied closed laundry soap yeah you had to really be careful back in the day legalization has definitely helped that and and that's one of the reasons why I started growing was because I think we found more than a little weird [ __ ] every once in a while in our weed but yeah no this gasoline taste is the kind that you want in a weed this is the good one I grew this so the only gas here is the gas of like a really high quality sativa and I love it so much The Taste is just absolutely delicious unfortunately it gets me so freaking high so I have to kind of you wouldn't be a you wouldn't be a stoned witch if you weren't it's so good I want to just keep smoking it so I I do I keep having bow after bow after bow and now like I can see myself in our video right now my eyes are all red they're a little puffy they're a little puffy my eyelids are like halfway down and I can't stop grinning so between this the Edibles and the hash I am definitely going to be very shell level high for the entire episode and I'm going to need to be because I'm talking about the Emily Morgan hotel in Texas it's right across from the Alamo and it's so [ __ ] haunted their own website talks about the different floors and the different rooms to stay in if you would like a haunted experience I just want to point out to everybody and you know one of these days we're going to get our act together and we are actually going to to post a video because not only are we funny to Listen to We're funny to look at we are but if you were to see us both right now I think right now we both kind of look like the female version of chi Chin chong because we're both really high today not that we're not really high other times but for those who listen to us consistently please know we're much more higher this time than in times recent past so do you see this brownie this is the second one of that size I am eating that looks delicious I'm so happy I have so much stuff shell so much stuff so what would you try out of that picture probably the Oreo looking things I'll get one and I'll eat it but I'll tell you what though like Edibles just don't do it for me man like I I'll eat a gummy and I feel nothing I am pretty sure that most people with their Edibles are lying to us no this is like from the store oh yeah I know the store Edibles I'm still pretty sure they're lying to us I don't know about what THC content what yeah I think so I know they have to have it tested but come on when was the last time you had an edible that really rocked your world like 1997 and it was something someone made for you most likely right or a ganja gooal at a festival I was going to say at a festival that we would have gone to but like literally the last time I had a good edible was like literally 1990 what so I don't know if it's because we didn't know what the THC content was back in the day we didn't know that it mattered right we didn't know enough to know that we needed to know you know what I'm curious about though and I'm wondering if you've ever tried have you ever tried the the THC Selzer drinks never had one I've seen them seen like the THC water and stuff at festivals but I have not tried it yeah I'm curious if there's if there's any bang to that buck I imagine there is they're getting better at putting THC in things uh whereas before it just had to go into like butter or sugar you know some some type of it's fat soluble so you had to put it in some type of fat gotcha which reminds me I have that huge stick of butter that has over 1,300 grams of THC in it well I am sure we have got to have a listener to here somewhere who's got a butter recipe someone help Leila something not sweet I have brownies I have Oreo cookies I have gummies I have chocolates I'm not really a sweet person give us a new idea somebody's got to have a new idea Bring It On Rice Krispy Treats I liked your idea of the crispy treats because any cereal treats or blander that's right you can use a little less sugar a little less marshmallow little less marshmallow and it's a little better but yeah and and I'm thinking you know I might want to take a a page from one of those you know cooking with marijuana shows and do and do like do some pasta with butter and just take the butter and Infuse it into maybe maybe I'll make a um alfredo sauce is one of those sauces it almost feels like cheating it's so easy to make from scratch it's just basically butter and um Romano cheese and cream garlic probably and garlic that's like it and and that's it so I could just use that butter and make like a really nice alfredo sauce that might be fun you know what you're like one of those like crafty ingenuitive people to begin with why don't you just start trying some [ __ ] that you would normally make that's butter heavy and just put weed in it or you could just have like the butter spaghetti when we come out I'll bring it and we'll have a little THC infused dinner party and I'll just make every dish with THC oh my God shrimp scampy shrimp scampy with butter that's infused with THC how freaking delightful would that be how delightful okay let's come up with an let's ask the listeners so shrimp scampy is going to be one of our dishes what other dishes should we have that we will Infuse cannabis in every single dish right down to dessert when we make this we will be posting photos of these oh yeah pictures of every single one this is gon to be amazing absolutely I can already feel this brownie I took the first half of it about 20 minutes ago and what I found I feel like you took like a sliver and that it wasn't really a lot at all from what I saw I did that was the second half unless Zoom is deceiving but it looked like it was little no it was little I would say the whole amount that I that I ate is about the size of a small brownie I would say about like a 2 in you know like maybe smaller than a 2in square one and a half inch square wow and and it's about an inch thick you know just like a regular dense brownie now these were homemade this gentleman likes to grow and he has is also he's a maker he likes to make things and so he's kind of gotten into making THC infused treats I was going to say like a crafty maker or like a f Baker maker a little bit of both he likes to grow he likes to cook he likes to make things he's just one of those people that likes to do stuff and oddly he doesn't smoke weed so what you're telling me is this guy does all this stuff but he doesn't even like partake no Noe what a bummer like what a bummer he's he's a gardener first and foremost is is how he got into it he he decided once it was legal he really wanted to try his hand growing it and he loved it he had such a good time those people who likes to see things go from nothing to something exactly and so i've smoked some of his weed and it's good I think I've said before it it's really nice it's a little fluffy I think he needs a little more light but other than that I mean for a first time grow well I mean I guess it's not really his first time but you know a new grower an amateur grower he's doing a great job it's very tasty very Stony and he he loves to make edibl so he started and the bubble hash oh man it's so good going to smoke all of it it's so good and he's got some Rick Simpson Oil like you know those little silicone things that you get like for free a lot of times at dispensaries I got three of those two of them are filled with like a really dark hash and one of them is full of Rick Simpson Oil and it's fantastic so this whole thing is um oh wow so this is bubble hash and it's got big chunks of bubble hash like I mean I've got I've got grams on grams on grams of bubble hash if you're not familiar with bubble has you freeze your weed and you basically take bags of different layer different size mesh in the bottom of the bags put your weed in it you immerse it into some ice water and you use some type of agitation and what happens is it knocks all of the tricomes all of the THC producing crystals off of the weed and into the water so when you lift up the bags you first you take out the first bag that's got got everything all the green matter in it and any leftover ice and you dispose of that and then as you go through each progressively smaller Micron siiz bag you get a better and better quality of hash which is again just the THC portion of the weed I feel like that's such a wasnot whatnot thing most of the tricomes and the THC comes off of it some people will then boil that well not boil it but they'll use it in cooking or something else like that but this is such good it's such clean good hash it's it's it's squishy it's good it burns really nice and The Taste is fantastic so this guy's a damn genius and doesn't even partake in his own products that blows me away I have I was given a whole box of things to try for him and let him know what I think and I'm having a little trouble getting away from the bubble hash but the brownies I'm eating a lot of because I don't want them to go bad because the rest of it will last a lot longer oh yeah yeah that's the excuse for us and ilila is eating all the brownies because she doesn't want them go bad wink wink nudge nudge my youngest brother is friends with this guy he happened to oh my gosh so you saw the small size of the the brownie the half the second half of the brownie that I ate now that much brownie will will give me a good body Buzz give me a good head buzz and basically makes me really Smiley and happy however for a beginner user I would recommend going with Edibles especially these are homemade and he has a pretty decent idea of what's in each one because he measures and pays attention but we don't know for sure so you want to start out really small and I had a friend who's a very beginner cannabis user and an almost complete virgin when it comes to Edibles and I gave them just a little tiny bite back off of socks here's some differences for me Edibles tend to hit within 15 to 20 minutes I can start to feel the effects I don't know if it's just because I'm very familiar with with the effects so I notice them right away and they kind of ramp up but for a beginner user I noticed that she was saying she didn't notice anything for about the first hour and then it hit like a freight train and she was really really high uh almost to the point of being too high for quite a few hours then they're done that same so again for me it it starts I can start to feel it sooner and so I can gauge how strong it is by how quickly it comes on and and how it affects me but again that's because I'm very very familiar with how Edibles and how THC in general affects my body my psyche you know all of that now my youngest brother I told him how much she had taken and how it felt how much I had taken and how it felt he proceeded to take a brownie this big which is a good 2 in by 4 in square and that is why me and your brother get along we're like that's the hero brownie right there needless to say he passed out on the couch go Bigg or go home man go Bigg or go home that's right he passed out on the couch watching anime and and I think he got that whole Netflix you know are you still watching thing kind of woke up so hungry he probably woke up and wanted more popcorn than he could shove in his mouth he says he woke up he stumbled into bed and woke up high the next morning had to go to work hi kudos to him kudos to him yeah so good stuff though very very good stuff I'll eat one of those Oreos for you and I'll let you know how it goes as I had said earlier um I had spent earlier today at a party because as all of our listeners know the whole of the nation of the United States of America is like if the depths of Hell pulled out like their ass like this is hot and you know what the worst part is is it was 98 degrees here today and we're not the hottest place we're like cool compared to other parts of the country did you just say that we're hotter than Satan's taint we are we are are hotter than Satan's starfish it's warm out there it's warm out there it's pretty pretty hot there yeah and and and and so you know I I had some my ties to cool myself some nice my ti yummy yummy then there was a sale my favorite store Happy Valley we've talked about Happy Valley a million times they had super Lon Hayes pre-rolls and I was like hook a girl up I love Super Lemon Haze love it you all right you all right over there yeah you're not all right I hiccuped while I took a hit and it was weird and it turned and it turned into a cough to get off yeah I did this weird like hiccup while I was inhaling the hit and it just hit weird folks this is where Lila gets high to a different level than the rest of us damn her yes wow yes so I'm smoking some good weed it's not Super Lemon Haze but it's good stuff you know these These pre-rolls are actually I kind of like how they do them they kind of this weed this the Super Lemon Haze batch that they have is very dense and sticky and these pre-rolls are very dense and sticky so like good bang for your buck good bang I like a good pre-roll and they were on sale does it burn well it does that and that's the difference between how it's packed is how it burns you know if if it's packed like [ __ ] it's going to burn like [ __ ] exactly and nobody needs that I think that's why I like the professionally packed ones because as we know I have no business role in anything no business that's true you can pack a bowl like a [ __ ] Pro exactly like if there were Olympics for that [ __ ] I'd be gold medal in it I have video I have to show you shell of the one of the last one of the last festivals weed festivals that my husband and I went to before covid [ __ ] everything he entered into a bong ripping contest only in California I swear to God only in California do do they do [ __ ] like that so they had to do this they had like 10 people right dozen people or so and basically what they did is each person would go up and they had these pre-measured amounts of weed so you'd get your random pre-measured amount of weed and they'd say go and then you had to pack the bowl you had to pack the bong and you had to clear the bowl and then cash it on the table that's great and they timed you went and was one of the four finalists obviously and they were just like amazed he blew everyone out of the water his time was at like half the time of the next highest person I'm telling you two things first of all I've ripped bongs with your husband before iron lung I'm telling you he he can he he can pull bongs with the best of them and second of all if that were an Olympic sport that's where he would shine with gold now I have video of this so in the finals he gets up there and this is where he would do you so proud sh you're GNA be so happy please tell me he just stuffed it and shoved it yes you called it yes you you absolutely called it he gets up there he's grinning from ear to ear he knew he had this in the bag so he gets up there and the DJ's like hyping him up and be like oh yeah here's our champion here he did so good how's he going to do this time and he pushes forward him out and it's like a big fat nug and just kind of starts the timer looks at it looks at the guy shoves it right in the pipe the crowd went nuts and was like whoa he's gonna do it they're like he didn't even break it up I love it I love the Superman of pot smoking over here just like torches the bud sucks it down and again blew the next highest person out of the water I think the last chick was like I don't even want to go she that was fun that that's one of the things that they do out west that is definitely better than the out e out out here in the East because you don't find fun [ __ ] like that on the East Coast I'm telling no no you don't and I have video evidence of it so that's fun much like last episode where we talked about a ghost story that we have that you actually still have video evidence of you know first of all a couple of things about that I really appreciate you doing that because you know sometimes life gets in the way and everybody loves everybody loved hearing your stories because I listened first thing I did was listened and I was like damn that's good and then the second thing I thought was I still have that VHS tape packed in a storage unit I know you listen because you texted me right after you heard it and girl you know I got you anytime whatever you need but I know you listened you texted me and all you said was I still have that tape in a storage locker but you know the one I I did want to add one little like footnote to that pleas do so for all the listeners who listened last week um with with Lila's solo ghost stories she had told a story about um when I'm like hey let's use a Ouija board um and her dad's one of the rare times that shell has actually been like yeah let's use a Ouija board at a haunted location why not so I I don't know if maybe you don't remember this or or maybe I didn't even tell you I don't even know but one part of that story that was left out was after all was sudden and done and we did try to go to bed I was in that downstairs back bedroom and I was getting tormented by something literally until the sun came up and like it was like hovering over the bed and it just wouldn't let like Let It Go and and and I almost felt that you had talked about people being dragged out of bed um on occasion like pulled by their feet and that man I just remember black hair and trying to get me out of that bed and so when I listened to that episode last week I was like oh my God I don't even know if she remembers that part because that was even worse when I told the story I knew I did remember that you had had an experience but I was going to leave that for you to tell but I I have chills right now thinking about it because if I remember correctly you guys stayed in that back room the back bedroom yes and I was tormented tormented all until sun came up the first floor back bedroom is rumored to be the room where there was supposedly a shotgun and that's where the gentleman that supposedly committed the double murder and then killed himself went and got the shotgun and that is where his spirit and he's very angry yeah and that's the bedroom you're like hey sh why don't you go sleep there after a night of Ouiji in hey I think in my defense I'm pretty sure that's where my dad put you and he should know better because he's had a ton of experiences in that house but yeah that's where upstairs it tends to be a Kinder woman and very rarely does it tend to be the angry man yeah I had the angry guy in the back bedroom and my husband at the time um was a little spooked and kind of just wanted to be done with your dad's house yeah none of us got any sleep that night even though when we tried to contact the spirits nothing seemed to happen it was after it was like when we were making the attempt nothing and then when we were done they were like Hey we're here and we were like yeah we're ready to go to bed and they're like yeah no I don't think so now I I think that there are spirits in that house that try to protect people and I've told a story before I think it's the episode with Tom where I first talked about this house where one of my experiences was where the spirits tried to keep us from going someplace that could possibly have been a dangerous situation but I also feel like what I recall of your dad's house was like every room had a different feel a different Spirit it was almost like like you said the the Kinder lady upstairs but the angry man in the back bedroom everywhere he went was like a different vibe and somebody different was occupy in that space like your dad's house is off the chart depending on what type of story someone tells me about their experience I can tell you where in the house they had it because it's it's consistent people who don't know anything about the house will walk up the stairs and be like I just heard someone call my name or tell me to get out from from this corner that's common it happens it's the same thing same place or they'll talk if they talk about an old woman or a young woman I know they were upstairs in one of the two back bedroom the darkhaired madman if they talk about a darkhaired angry man I know they were downstairs in the kitchen or in the back bedom or possibly in the stairwell because wasn't he what we ended up thinking didn't we think it was was him that was the stomper we did we thought it was him now looking back at it I almost wonder if it wasn't the protector trying to keep us away or keep us from summoning the blackhaired man that could be and got pissed at us and got mad at us because we were dumb we were young and dumb and traveling around freaking Upstate New York with Ouija boards in our trunk I mean whatever what did we expect yeah we fully we fully went into a house that we knew was haunted that we knew haed things we were poking the bear and we were too stupid and young to know it exactly we left that house at dawn none of us being morning people at all I'm like I'm good can leave now it's let's just smoke on the way that video oh my goodness and you know I I know I like to say that some of the weird anomalies in the room really could I guess be smoke and candl light but no not after the way not after the way I was treated in that back bedroom absolutely no no I'm not surprised he not a nice man not a nice man at all no and he wasn't really happy that there was people in that bed he didn't want me in that bed no most of the time that room stayed empty um anyone who has ever had to stay there they very often just kept it as a store room because people didn't even like going in there it just felt depressive oh let's push shell in there for the night time that you stayed there it did happen to have a bed in it is just but you ever know like when you go into basements how like basements often have like that scary creepy oppressive Vibe I do this was a room on the first floor that had that same kind of scary creepy oppressive Vibe much like the ominous Vibe of the house in your story tonight sh the murders that happened in that house you're doing I'm doing the Lori Mansion in New Orleans and and you know New Orleans like I've talked about how the East Coast has some of the most haunted cities and towns and locations in America but like New Orleans off the freaking Hook off the hook I would I so bad I have found articles and I would have to agree that do agree that New Orleans is the most haunted city in America the most absolutely the most there's I saw ghost there they're they're everywhere they're crawling out of every brick there they're like on the street corner they're like greeting you like the damn prostitutes in New York City exactly just like that just like that [Laughter] oddly specific reference please everybody create your own visual for that but but yeah like so the Lori Mansion in New Orleans is just we're gonna we're gonna talk about some crazy this is bad this one's bad I needed to be really high for this one and I'm gonna I'm gonna need to continueous Sleepy high for this one because I I've heard a little bit about it I knew enough to suggest it to you and then I kind of stayed away but I what I do know is horrific so everybody please get your best weed get your pre-rolls get get your bongs make sure you have a teddy bear I was gonna say tonight they need their blankies because you know we're both doing like Southern Middle America and I feel like there's a lot of activity between New Orleans and Texas there really is you know like this L Lori mansion I can't even believe how you found it because I'd never heard of it this is on Royal Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans which I've never been to New Orleans you have been blessed to go there so you know that that it's probably one of the most haunted cities in America it is this building has multiple ghostly entities that like have been documented literally since 1834 there was this lady a mean lady oh so this is about a a mean lady so this True Crime is like a a female who is the perpetrator yeah you know everybody thinks that that men are always the perpetrator hell no because this lady was crazy and and brutal brutal her name was Madame deline McCarthy Lori that's a lot of names those that's mouthful deline that's kind of interesting and she was twice married so I don't know why people like they didn't get rid of their names they just added them on I wonder if it had anything to do with like inheritance or or Prestige or power you know they wanted to to hold on to that part of it that could yeah maybe yeah so you know she married her husband at the time Dr Leonard Lis Nicholas Lori bought this property in 1831 and there was a house under construction that he had finished for them so it was this two-story mansion and back then especially down south in 1830s properties were designed and constructed having slave quarters right unfortunately there was still people were still enslaved at that time right right this woman was born during the Spanish Colonial period and you know kind of Rich Little wealthy had a big house so what year did you say this was uh 1832 no [ __ ] so 1832 her and and and her her husband got this property it was 1140 Royal Street in the French Quarter she was able to get her husband to put this house in her name which back then was kind of weird most properties and wealth was always in the man's name so this is husband number three yeah and and she got him to put this house in her name which oh that's not suspicious at all husband number one and two both died a little bit of Black Widow going on here maybe put your property in my name win quink right that's not suspicious at all run dude run but you know it it was they were they were kind of loaded so it had beautiful chandeliers intricate carvings you know it was it was a beautiful place they were kind of a part of of high society I guess you'd call it in New Orleans they'd have lavish parties socialites would have you know champagne and all that jazz at their house so this marriage started to have problems shocker surprise she wanted to get separated you could do that back then apparently so she had this property because remember she condom into putting it in her name this all started with rumors I don't know how the rumors started I don't know how Stuff leaked out to people but rumors began to swirl um that deline was really badly treating her slaves and that her slaves looked generally Haggard and wretched some people treated their slaves really well because you know the better you treat them the better they're going to work for you you know what I mean weren't there rules at the time there on I mean enslaving people is shitty but didn't they have like some weird rules on how you could treat I believe so I believe so guidelines so to say but she was she was like a jackal and hide because in public she was generally polite to African-American people and very salacious of her slaves Health basically she talk a good game in public and put on that face but then when she got home different story so there were rumors that she was mistreating her slaves right but in public she would be very nice to them and everyone would say oh well you know she obviously treats them well correct so these must just be malicious rumors rumors continued finally it was so widespread that a local lawyer was dispatched to her house in 1832 to remind Lori of the what they called him here's what they called them the laws of upkeep of slaves oh wow I don't know specifically what those law that's so [ __ ] up but check it out however during the visit the lawyer found no evidence of wrongdoing or mistreatment now you got to remember In 1832 in New Orleans Money Talks you give that lawyer $50 because probably $50 back then was a lot of money and all of a sudden you've done no wrong so keep that in mind and did they really care about black people at all like did they even care right this person who went there to like uphold these laws what are the odds that they even gave a [ __ ] so what she ended up doing is after that investigation she sold a few of her slaves but word kept spreading and other socialites were no longer eager to participate in social events with them or interact with the Lori family so basically everybody started talking [ __ ] behind their back because they all kind of they were they all believed it it wasn't proven but people were believing the hype it sounds like the rumors persisted to the point where other slave owners were starting to think something bad was going on in that house like what kind of ship bag do you need to be to have other crappy excuses for human beings think that you're not worth talking to so [ __ ] up it gets worse it gets worse after the lawyer's visit a neighbor reported that one of deli's slaves which was a girl that was roughly 10 years old oh God fell to her death from the roof of the Mansion while trying to avoid while trying to avoid punishment from the whip wielding Lori now the girl whose name was Leah was buried on the man grounds yep yeah 10 10 God that hurts my heart 10 years old like like it's a baby she was a they [ __ ] but she was really trying to in public make it out like you know oh that's fine but what happened was She chased the girl around the room with a whip until the child leapt off the balcony to her death to avoid getting whipped is really oh my gosh wow that's terrible like how bad is that after that that led to an actual fullon investigation of the Loris who who they were found guilty of illegal cruelty and were for they were forced to Forfeit nine slaves but is that all of them or is that just some of them it didn't say it didn't say but what happened was Lori persuaded a relative to purchase the slaves and return them to her oh what the hell oh gee I have to sell my enslaved people as a punishment but the point is is not only did she want slaves back she wanted those slaves back right other stories said that you know that that she was doing she was basically killing slaves throughout the Mansion like slaves would they would disappear what people around town would see a Slave at their house and then just like never see them again po gone poof gone no poof gone so then on April 10th uh 1834 fire broke out in the kitchen of the Lori Mansion when the Police and Fire Marshals arrived they found a 70-year-old woman who was the family Cook chained to the stove she confessed that she intentionally set the fire is a suicide as a suicide attempt because she feared Madame Lori would take her to the torture room as punishment the what she would take her to the what the torture room and apparently she had told the Fire Marshals and the police that the reason she didn't want to is cuz the cook claimed that anyone taken up to the torture room never came back oh oh [ __ ] so the Press gets a hold of this the bystanders demand that the torture room be inspected well yeah the police didn't look for the torture room right then did they not believe her they didn't know about it so that happens and Lori's denium entrance freaking towns people mob their damn house break down the doors and the police found seven mutilated slave bodies some were hung some were stretched from their limbs others were missing body parts one surviving old slave woman had a wound on her head that left her two week to walk oh my goodness so the whole mob attacked this Mansion the surviving slaves were rescued and basically investigators found several bodies including a child buried throughout the Mansion grounds oh yep Madame Lori and her family um were able to narrowly escape the mob at the Mansion before the mob took control of it and no one knows what happened to him for the next 15 years and then they did find out after that deline died and was buried in Paris France in 1949 and now basically that Mansion uh the Lori Mansion is a landmark of the French quarter but like she never she basically essentially fled the country to avoid persecution so she had you said nine yeah there were nine people in the torture room yeah and they found bodies buried all over the the grounds what kind of Tor did it say what kind of torture she did to them some people were were pulled apart like you know how they tie you down and pull your limbs off oh my god um some people were hacked up their limbs ho [ __ ] their limbs and stuff were removed they did find slaves that were like missing fingers and toes so like one of your punishments would like you'd lose your toe wow like stuff that stuff that maybe if she sent you to the grocery store everyday person wouldn't necessarily notice I gota the abuse that's not not black eyes you know not a busted lip like that abuse that can be hidden that torture that can be hidden that's terrible as you can imagine lots of cries screams wailing in the night basically sounds of people being tortured sometimes little kids because uh she did have a slave as young as 10 that again she she drove to Suicide what the [ __ ] do you do that you drive a 10-year-old suicide how could what the [ __ ] kind of person are you that you could have anyone as a slave like what the [ __ ] let alone a [ __ ] 10-year-old holy [ __ ] I mean it sounds like this woman was so bad that even other slave owners basically wanted to take her out wow wow like like I'm not saying owning any slaves are is is is a good thing it's it's not right it's it's a horrible thing even the good slave owners that were good to thees they wanted they they were a part of the mobs that were trying to attack trying to get her their own Justice if if you're if you're so bad that you piss off other slave owners that's got to be pretty bad you know that torture chamber is is still there the noises and you know people people call it they call it uh the house of whors to this day they call it a house of hores so you can just imagine the type of the type of activity at a place like this from what I've heard you'd know more about this than I would that New Orleans is just you can't get away from it oh they're everywhere but like I mean she was she would break bones gouge their eyes out like that it was crazy C it was CRA one of the stories that I had heard about the Lori mansion that made me want to suggest it to you was I had heard that she would sometimes break their bones and make set them in weird ways and keep them in small cages she was a fan of prolonged suffering she was a fan and that's what she would do when she would like stretch their limbs off is is part of it was she was one of the articles I read talked about how she was very into prolonged suffering oh lovely yeah that's that's bad that's really bad that's gross and it's done a lot of things since then you know following the fire and when they fled it had what they called an uneasy and erratic Journey isn't that something for a property it was in ruins for a while it became an integrated School a Conservatory of Music a home for the homeless at one point it was partitioned into a apartments and then it eventually got like a private owner one owner apparent check this out this is horrible I shouldn't even giggle no one ever seemed to own the house for long as you can imagine because [ __ ] was real there one owner apparently ended up in an asylum another fell into a coma and I love the whole house sounds like it's cursed now this is where I was hooked there has been an actor that I have like had a crush on since I was a teenager and everybody thought I was crazy but I have loved this guy forever and okay he's a little cuckoo now but even actor Nicholas Cage briefly owned this house but he lost it in foreclosure in 2009 really he has a plot yeah Nicholas Cage is a is definitely a strange a strange fella love the guy but yeah he briefly owned this house but did lose it Nicholas Cage really loves New Orleans to go down a side tangent just for a moment I actually saw his future grave plot in New Orleans in the same Cemetery where the voodoo queen of New Orleans Marie Lavo oh yeah yeah yeah the the cemetery where Marie laau is he has a grave plot there like right down from Marie Lavo and it's shaped like a pyramid it's a white pyramid so I'm not surprised that he once owned the Lori Mansion he uh was was quoted as saying in 2007 that he bought it because he thought it would be a good place to write the Great American Horror novel how awesome is that pretty horrific but according to local lore the reason that no one owned the house for very long because obviously uh even though deline Lori was long dead it is said that her horrific crimes made it a deeply haunted house obviously yeah she tortured people for fun well you know imagine you buy this house and you're hearing torture shrieks and moanings coming from like within the walls people some people throughout the years and even relatively recently going through the house get that smell of they feel like smelled burning flesh or they chains being dragged because a lot of these slaves were chained to things like the cook chain to the stove they generally uh as far as figures we'll see a large black man in Chains and a white woman with glaring eyes a lot of these ghosts especially the woman they believe the woman is actually Madame Lori self and some of these ghosts are actually violent when the house was a school young girls would allegedly encounter a woman who would grab their arm and leave scratches and bruises oh wow they've had wonder it wasn't anything for very long it's so freaking haunted no one can stay there they pulled in a medium to the house and the medium suggested that much of the evil had dissipated kind of leaving the ghosts to WAND freely without fear of their former mistress so to say it looks really lovely from the outside but it is a house of horrors and true Nightmares on the inside that's terrible you know these people were like essentially tortured to death so many people that's awful yeah yeah so now today you can visit the Lori Mansion it's kind of like a touristy kind of thing and like I said 1140 Royal Street in the French Quarter I I want to go man you know you Google it the pictures look beautiful how scary can it be it's so pretty pretty scary let's bring a Ouija board let's bring a Ouija board come on let's do it no but you know I just I just think that what really makes this true crime in my opinion is the fact that [ __ ] got away with it and I think that was just the time it was just the way believe that it's just the way it was back then you know you could get away with stuff by paying people off and she had the means to just throw money and disappear off to Paris and it's not like in 1832 we did not have extradition to the United States now right right what are they gonna be like oh yeah send her back from Paris yeah so you know she was able to to buy her way to a boat to avoid any any backlash from being a horrific horrible person yeah a torturer I mean she kept slaves first of all which is bad enough and then she [ __ ] tortured them well you know I am glad that I did find out that a medium had gone into the house and felt that that evil had had kind of lessened and that the ghosts were more I don't want to say relaxed I mean you're a ghost maybe more at peace or maybe they've been released from there I would hope yeah I mean I mean it was described as that they were more free as free as a ghost can be I guess but I mean you don't want these poor folk being tortured in the afterlife as well like an eternity terrible like they did nothing to deserve an eternity of torture you know what I'm saying it's not their fault it's not their fault that that's that they were ended up in her clutches gez right and you know unfortunately it's created about two centuries of Paranormal Activity I mean that's this woman literally left her mark on New Orleans and not a good one not a good one at all not a good one so I appreciate the good lead it was a very interesting story but kind of [ __ ] up yeah that's kind of effed up good True Crime way to go shell you did a true crime woohoo oh my God I did it so I'm excited Leila's doing the Nut House okay one floor but it was a hospital okay okay where so so let's start with your where what's your location tell me where we're going where are we going so we're going right across from the Alamo actually to all of our listeners in Texas drink water it's hot out stay cool you laugh you stoner but I'm serious it's no you're absolutely absolutely 100% right you are absolutely totally right no that is a really good PSA that was a good PSA show that was very smart good one that was a good one smoke lots of weed if you smoke lots of weed it won't seem so hot right all right so where are we going we are going to Texas like you said very hot drink your water All My Exes Live in Texas I wish would make it easy just they all live there you just ignore the whole state and be done with it so we're going to San Antonio Texas okay the Emily Morgan Hotel Houston Street right across from the Alamo oh my God I want to go to the Alamo I think it would be so cool and there's a haunted place across the street well well obviously we are on the grounds of the Alamo where over 600 people lost their lives so anywhere near there so like this is technically considered like part of a battlefield is that what you're saying it technically was part of the battlefield they say that right now the Alamo if you go to Texas to see the Alamo it it's very small there's like a church in another building I think and it looks very very small so it's basically kind of like the Gettysburg of the South anything that radius is pretty much spooked okay so history lesson little history the Alamos site sits on about 4 Aces it was held for 13 days by less than 150 men including people like James Bowie Davey Crocket and William Travis against the much larger more experienced troops led by General Santa Ana the perimeter that the Texans and tanos defended was about 480 ft by 160 ft wide the Alamo church that you can still see the ruins of today sits along the South Wall which was also where the entrance was now the Emily Morgan Hotel the point of it faces the South Wall of the alamoo the tip of the triangle of the building points to the part of the South wall called the low Barracks which is where Boe was stationed and also is where the Mexican troops were finally able to breach the wall and end the siege of the Alamo by basically slaughtering everyone that was inside oh oh yeah yikes so the ground itself already has a history right Texas at that time so this is around the same time as your story shell which is kind of surprised me this is in the 1830s Mexico some [ __ ] going on down south in the 1830s right so first a little bit of history in the 1820s Mexico gained their independence from Spain and they started welcoming settlers to the area that is Texas and a lot of them were Americans among them you know Sam Houston and and other famous Americans in the 1830s The Mexican government was trying to to regulate the Americans because more and more American people are coming West and coming to Texas they're really liking this area at first Mexico was welcoming them with open arms into the Texas territory until enough was enough until enough was enough and then they're like you know what we kind of want to impose a few rules here and the Americans are like you know what we really like it here we're going to stay so there started to be a conflict and in 18 in March of 1836 Texas declared its independence from Mexico so that same year that's when The 13-day Siege from uh General Santa Ana from Mexico besieged the troops in the Alo who held them off held them off for almost two weeks and unfortunately all died anyways it was a rallying cry at the time the numbers weren't in their favor Unfortunately they were not time was not in their favor there was a lot different podcast different thing however uh Santa Anna's cruelty during that battle really inspired the Americans to want to to finish this war to kind of to do their best and and a lot of volunteers came in after this happened Santa Anna's kind of roaming around and he's sacking farms and stuff and one of the places is uh a hotel that's in Mexico owned by a general Morgan and he takes some of the indentured people there as captives one of the indentured people was a woman named Emily West who had taken the name of Morgan because she was an indentured servant and that's one of the weird [ __ ] up rules they had to follow they had to take their name it gets even weirder than that shell the [ __ ] Emily West was a free woman of color so she was a mixed race woman she was a black woman living in the 1830s nobody knows for sure exactly what her birth date was let me see exactly where she was born but she was one of the folks that was actually considered a free person correct at the time she was born free and and again she was biracial which is why she was born free because she had yeah at the time people of color even if they were free had to be indentured for a certain period of time it it's so messed up basic and that's how they forced her to change her name correct so she was born roughly around 1815 in New Haven Connecticut and she was free but due to these like really weird rules she had to be an indentured servant for the period of a year which is so [ __ ] dumb but anyway I would not have survived in the early 1800s because I would have been like [ __ ] this [ __ ] you know think I would have too I would have been one of those people burned at the Stak for what I would say and do they would tied me up lit my toes on fire and called it a day thank you sh so if only if only that's why weed's illegal because it it makes women anyway so Emily West born 1815 New Haven in Connecticut bornn free however because she was a woman of color [ __ ] up rules has to be indentured for a year she gets indentured to General James Morgan and again weird rule takes his name but for the military going towards no I believe he had a hotel in Texas at the time somewhere in the Republic of Texas and so she was going to be um a a housekeeper there a worker yeah yeah so while she's there doing this indentured servant [ __ ] Santa Anna's troops attack this hotel and take her and other people uh as captives now folk Legend goes that Emily West was a beautiful woman strong beautiful young woman and that Santa Anna became enamored of her so much so right so much so that even his troop movements after she came into camp are weird he stops early he sets Camp early he's constantly calling her to his tent he's just not on his game so to say he was in love and not acting like a damn Army General exactly his troops are split after the Alamo and he's got some new troops that come in he's got about 1,500 men they're in an unprotected location and he decides to call Emily Morgan to his tent one morning oh God what a perve and at the same time Sam Houston leading a small group decides to attack is it because they knew that she was going there and that he would be preoccupied The Legend doesn't say but they do say that she kept Santa Ana preoccupied for 18 minutes in the tent which was long enough for Sam Houston and his men to overwhelm the much larger forces of Santa Ana and win the battle what they're calling the Battle of San hinto or san jinto so to win this battle in 18 minutes because Santa Ana was so preoccupied with the most gorgeous Emily Morgan she did it on purpose I'd like to think so now part of me wants to be all badass go girl woman power she's amazing she she's so good in the sack that she kept s Anna busy while Sam Houston and his men overwhelmed the forces they had no Direction because their General was getting it on with Emily who was saving America but 18 minutes is all she could get out of them 18 minutes was all she needed she had him so [ __ ] distracted that he wasn't found until the next day and rumors say he was either hiding amongst his army in a private uniform or he was found hiding wearing a woman's bathrobe and slippers I want to go with the woman's bathro up in slippers because that just sounds better he was probably dressed as a private in his army but I'm just going to remember it is a bathrobe in slippers right good visual now however reality says she was an indentured servant okay she is a woman of color okay does that mean that they killed her no no no no no no what I'm saying is she's a she's a black woman who had been captured and she had been in a servant when she was captured odds are she was not in that tent of her own free will oh absolutely not so as much as I want to be like yo girl power woohoo you know that [ __ ] saved America way to go Texas yeah you know that's not how it went not you know no she was probably brutally sexually assaulted Right Time and Time and Time and Time and Time and Time Again and even if she wasn't what kind of agency would she have had back then she had zero power so I would love to think I really want to think that she knew Sam Houston was coming that she did what she could to kind of help the Americans but honestly do you think she really gave a [ __ ] honestly she was probably the sad part is she was probably just doing whatever it took to stay alive exactly exactly and kudos to [ __ ] her for doing that that's what a lot of those slaves had to do back then you know you just had to [ __ ] grit your teeth to stay alive because it lit was life and death and that's what she did she did she stayed alive she took care of business she did what she had to do and she made enough of a name for herself that they helped her to get back she had lost her Freedom papers and so she was having trouble getting back to Connecticut and they did help her get back and they kind of lost track of where she went after that so at least whatever happened gave her enough of of folklore heroin shine that they they kind of helped this poor black woman who had been captured get back home so there was at least that there's rumors that because of this whole folk heroin thing this story was recounted to a gentleman named William ballert supposedly on a steamer trip and I guess this guy was a um he was keeping a diary and so he he wrote that he had met the famous Sam Houston and Sam Houston had told him the story of how he had won the Battle of San jinto in 18 minutes and that it was all due to Emily West Morgan and her magic in the sack with Santa Ana so so when this gentleman's diary was published in 1956 and that's when they found the story of this woman who had supposedly saved Texas and so she became kind of a folk heroine and supposedly the song um Yellow Rose of Texas uhuh was written for her oh yeah fun right okay so the building I'm talking about this is a long history lesson because I'm talking about the Emily Morgan Hotel it was named for that Emily West Morgan the heroine of the battle of San hento now was it named for her or did she ever own it slash live in it it wasn't even named for her until it became a hotel in 1986 I believe oh okay okay so it was more like a like a I can't even think of it because I'm high but when they like name things after people right no no no it became a hotel in 1984 and they chose the name Emily Morgan specifically to name it after the folk heroin so no other than the fact that it was built on the site of the Alamo she never lived there she never owned it okay she didn't have anything to do with it okay but she was kind of close to it and it was built on the side of the Alamo who was she was more she was more tied to the location than the building itself correct now the building itself is kind of trippy it was built in 1924 and it was meant to be a a like a state-of-the-art Medical Arts facility it was built by a builder called JM Nicks and apparently a famous architect named Ralph Cameron and they decided to build it in this unusually shaped spot in San Antonio and it was it only kind of allowed for a triang shaped building okay so they made it a three-sided triangular shaped building first so that's interesting right there now we all know from Ghostbusters and in Magic a anything three-sided that's kind of magical it it's plus it's outside the norm so you're already starting to have some interesting things go on there so they wanted it to be kind of like the flat iron building in New York City and they built it to be 13 stories tall are they just asking for trouble did they just put Ouija board wallpaper up like what so but sh sh now come on to mitigate the fact that they made it 13 stories tall they called that floor 14 oh so let's just pretend like there's just no 12 14 that's right that's right so that erases the whole bad luck of making a triangular building 13 stories tall so what is wrong like like do people not there somebody had to say wait a minute should we go ahead with this and then there was somebody who was like yeah it'll be fine yeah they built this 13 story tall triangular-shaped building in the gothic revivalist style which is like the creepiest spookiest type of architecture that you can get why didn't they just the aliens to build it for them at that point it gets better because it's a medical building they decided what better to put on our spooky Gothic looking thre sided story building but gargoyles oh Jesus come on it is covered in gargoyles everywhere on the outside terracotta gargoyles everywhere and better yet they each have an ailment of some sort because it's a Medical Arts Building oh my God like you can't make this stuff so there's broken legs and stomach aches and headaches and tooth aches and poked eyes and all sorts of gargoyles gee I wonder why we have some Paranormal Activity here folks it's like they designed it to draw in ghosts let's build it on a place of horrific sacrifice where so many people lost their lives let's make it a weird shape 13 put some gargoyles on it just icing on the cake so most of the of the building contained mostly offices it was doctor's offices dentist's offices and and like all their like patient rooms right the seventh floor was the psychiatric ward oh so oh I Goa so not only did they have like regular like Hospital type stuff they still have had the funny fir on the top floor most of the floors were just offices like you would go to your doctor's office and be seen in some of their patient rooms on one of the floors or you'd go to your dentist's office right up to like the 1970s I believe oh wow and on these so the seventh floor was the psychiatric ward they had on the 12th and 13th oh excuse me 14th floors there's no such thing that's where they had the HFF Hospital uh and the surgery Ward so they it was a 50 bed hospital which just just by default you're going to get people who die horrifically during a surgery or a procedure and unfortunately that's the nature of Health Care so there's going to be that that Vibe as well the Morgan the crematorium was in the basement oh so the 13th I'm sorry the 12th and the 13th floor were where the hospital and the surgery rooms were so it was a 50 bed hospital and they had quite a few surgical theaters as well and the reason they put it on the top two floors was so that the smell wouldn't bother the people in the offices it would stay up high make it the windows unfortunately smell like that rises the smell never left shell what one of the things that people report in particular on the 14th floor is that it still smells like a hospital people will still smell like a Band-Aid smell or antiseptic that hospital we all know every single one of us knows that hospital smell and it's one of those this is one of those places that has so many hauntings that are the same it's the same story repeated over and over again obviously consistent and in and yeah yeah what is this today it's a hotel oh Jesus you can go stay at this is definitely one of those where it would be like bring the Ouija board right so while it was a Medical Arts facility there were rumors of some things that went on on the seventh floor but nothing that at all that I could confirm I couldn't even were they one of the testing sites at all for like labotomy or shock treatment or anything did you see not that I could find I couldn't even 100% confirm that there was a psychiatric ward here just a lot of rumors and rumors that things like that happened here but nothing definitive it was definitely a Medical Arts Building whether there was a floor developed to a psychiatric ward or not is Up For Debate but again even having surgical floors people were going to end up obviously dying under some [ __ ] circumstances just by default they definitely did have a Morgan AC crematorium in the basement staff is only allowed to go there unless the haunted elevator takes you there what so the ghost decide who gets to go to the Morgan that the elevator in this hotel is extremely haunted wonder why invit so it's often reported that it will take people to floors that they didn't push and sometimes it will even take people to the basement that's supposed to be only able to be accessed by staff key like a like one of those key card things yeah yeah it'll just go there anyway without the key yeah sometimes it'll take people there it it's a well-known haunting this the elevator taking people to odd places is one of those consistent stories that I could find uh personal account all over the place of people having it happen to them even taking them down into the basement where the smell of burnt flesh is still a common ghostly happening and that that's just like my story with the Lori Mansion people could still smell that burning flesh smells are one of those things that are are very memory triggering so I can imagine it's one of those things that on that stone tape on that like recorder thing that probably kind of sits pretty pretty strongly yeah absolutely absolutely mostly while it was a hospital there weren't a lot of stories it operated as a medical facility until um for about 50 or so years that's a good chunk of time honestly and then it was an office building it uh 1976 it was purchased and turned into Office Buildings but it only stayed that way for a little while and and then it became the Emily Morgan Hotel was purchased by Hyatt Double Tree I think oh wow oh Double Tree by Hilton Hilton Double Tree yeah so it's a Hilton Double tree it's a Double Tree by Hilton Hotel oh wow yeah so they purchased it and it's it's a recognized as a Historic Hotel of America it has also been named as one of the most haunted hotels in America in a bunch of different Yeah by by several different polls in 2020 uh 2021 historic hotels of America ranked the Emily Morgan hotel as one of the top 25 most haunted historic hotels in America oh wow wow that's cool let me get into some of the ghostly sightings at this hotel because they are numerous I have so many are you ready I am ready you got a joint shell I do have a joint that's right you've got those um those tasty tasty pre-rolls nice delish delish I can't even tell you how delicious okay so wait till I tell you some of the spooky things now as a hotel there's floor 12 and then floor 14 because apparently were Silly and are going to forget the 13th floor in addition to that they go one step further there's no room 1408 on the 14th floor why what's 1408 the numbers add up to 13 oh [Laughter] Jesus so is there a room 13 I think there is I'm pretty sure that's the only floor they do that on the 13th floor now the seventh floor again was the psychiatric ward and it's rumored to be the most haunted floor although even the staff of the Emily Morgan will tell you the entire hotel is haunted so the 12th and 14th were the surgical theaters and the hospital and the basement was the Morgan crematorium on the seventh floor people will report saying that one of the things that they see is a woman in white Ghost Shell here we go with the woman in white again there's always a woman in white the woman in white travels the country like no ghost I've ever seen the world she's around the world she a world around ghost she is so she is the bride she's called the bride and no one is sure who she is but she has seen again she's one of those very ubiquitous ghosts everyone sees the bride or worse yet hears her scream in the middle of the night I'd rather see them than hear him scream to be honest it's so common I saw people's reports of that they heard this that they were on the seventh floor and they heard a scream after midnight or right around the witching hour they called down to the lobby and we're immediately told oh you're on the seventh floor that's the ghost bride yeah you couldn't you couldn't have told me that when I checked in right they will the staff will tell you the ghost stories and if you ask for a haunted room they will direct you to the most haunted open room for your stay why would to do why would you not ask for the most haunted room isn't that why you're staying to begin with but the whole place is haunted so this ghost bride a woman in white will be seen walking the hallways shrieking sometimes she's rumored to be a bride who committed suicide but it couldn't find any truth to it but she's seen by so many people on that seventh floor I've noticed that though some of the local Legends in the folklore although not necessarily properly documented do have if not full truth a lot of Truth to them so I do tend to take a little credit to some of those folklore Word of Mouth you can't necessarily find a news article on it but everybody in town for the last eight Generations talks about kind of stories y when I was looking for people's personal stories I saw so many firsthand accounts of people on the seventh floor having heard blood curdling spine tingling screams at 3:00 a.m. on the seventh floor yeah but you got to remember Medical Care back then was not kind and if it was actually the psychiatric facility could this ghost bride be a woman be a woman who lost her mind at the time and maybe she's not in the white of a bridal gown maybe she's in the white of a medical inpatient straight jacket maybe she is and you know nobody really knows but she's said to pop into one room and then out and there's actually um and that could have been the room that was Associated to her possible in October 2021 Amanda M says that she heard the screaming lady ghost on the seventh floor one of the nights of our stay and another Gentleman on that floor said that he saw oh no this was on the ninth floor another Gentleman on the ninth floor said that he saw a black hand reaching down into the room from the corner ah the hand the hand of from the abyss oh my God that would be more freaky than seeing the whole body on the 12th floor people will often hear gurns creaking and rolling down the floor at night like that creaky Creek yeah and even weirder still this is the floor where people who don't even know that the place is haunted will be like yeah it was really strange I came back to my room from dinner and my bathtub was full and the water was this this really strange blue why would the bathtub be full nobody knows on that floor people will often report hearing sounds of water running or dripping and they very often report leaving the room and coming back and finding their tub being full sometimes with oddly blue water what's with the blue water is because it looks anesthetic I don't know nobody seems to really know because remember back in that time period like they would fix every everything would be sanitized by that weird Blue Water maybe that is it Cole ckin the hotel's general manager says that on the 12th floor guests will report that all their faucets are turned on and all they can hear is running water and so they call down to the front desk because they're scared oh you're on the 12th floor that's what they say and they say go into the bathroom and so people go into the bathroom and there's nothing even though they can hear the water right up to the threshold of the bathroom when they go in it stops imagine the training for being in a front desk person at this hotel okay so when everybody calls from the seventh floor tell them it's this ghost and when they call from the 12th floor tell them it's this ghost like what's the training like to work there right and it doesn't even stop with guest like the hotel sales manager a woman named Deborah McNab she stayed there she knows there's something paranormal going on because it happened to her when she stayed in the Emily Morgan Hotel she left to go get dinner came back to her room and her tub was halfway full of selan blue sky Blue Water bright bright blue she said it was so blue it looked like someone had to have put some type of dye or chemical in the water oh now she said she was with a friend so she's she asked them if they had run the water and they're like no I didn't do it did you do it she's like no I know I didn't do it and then she's like hey I work here I'm gonna have them run the key card system and see who entered the room not a soul I bet you no one had entered the room from the time she and the person she was staying with had left for dinner until they came back that helped her because now she has better selling points to all of us ghosty folk that's it only her key was the one who had checked in so so she knows now I've told you about the elevator there's more oh there's so much the elevator will take people to the wrong floor like you'll push six and it'll take you to seven it likes to take people to the haunted floors and sometimes it'll mess up and take people to restricted floors like the basement sometimes when it takes people up to the 12th floor and they're not supposed to be there when the doors open they report that it looks just like a hospital oh no [ __ ] like that Mirage yes exactly like that and they get freaked out then doors close and open again and it's back to normal and it's the hotel I would love having that happen people say that when the the elevator will take them to the basement or when they try to call the desk to tell them what's happening either they can't get through to the desk or when they call the desk the front desk they're just like oh yeah you know we know that that happens the hotel does that and the people that work there say sometimes when they answer the phone that's calling from the elevator it's an empty elevator there's no one there sometimes the elevator just Rings the front desk it just calls itself that's right it just calls them for no reason and when they go to the basement it's super scary because very often they can hear moans and what sounds like the whoo of fire and smell burning flesh like a like something's but getting put into the the incinerator basically and just like in the scary movies when it takes you to the incinerator basement it won't budge ah [ __ ] it's awful so some more stories are let's see oh here's one I loved this one so this this one is from a gentleman named Mike and he he says he stayed at the Emily Morgan around 2010 he said he was traveling alone without his wife and he stayed at this beautiful hotel because he said it was smaller and more historic than the nearby gr hiy and haunted and haunted which he knew the hotel down the street was where he was attending um a convention during the day and at night at the last night of the convention they had a formal ball and he had brought along a tux but again because his wife didn't attend with him he was he was going stag he was going to go all by himself so he says he's dressed in his tux he's about 40 years old at the time and he thought he looked very handsome and dashing so he's in this weirdly shaped Lobby of this triangular 13-story hotel and this bright boy looks in the mirror of this haunted hotel and says I wish I had a fine lady from here to join me at this ball what did he just bring a Ouija board in his pocket he might as well have I don't know but he's looking in a mirror in a haunted hotel and inviting a lady to come with him well guess what who came that night he had a whole bunch of photos taken of him by a lot of his friends and and colleagues there and they sent him all these pictures in every single picture of him there was a an orb a round ball of light either near his heart or near his arm it was like chest height to where a woman would be standing and it followed him around from picture to picture and it would this light would stand exactly like if he had his arm out would stand exactly as if he had his arm around posing posing next to him like posing for a photo he is 100% convinced when he showed these pictures to his wife they are both 100% convinced that some female ghost that a woman ghost took him up on his offer to go to the fancy ball oh my God I have chills I have chills so bad you must have loved that part of it because I know you're an orb lover I do I love that one it was so good but that's one of those orb things that like why him why that particular night when because he looked in the mirror and asked for it he did too it's like rubbing the genie lamp if you're don't rub the genie lamp if you don't want the genie to come out right right right here's another one another woman who stayed on uh she didn't stay on any of the particularly known to be haunted floors but she says this is Diana and she says that while she was in bed she felt like someone embraced her like a friendly hug and when she looked over her shoulder she could see an indentation in the bed even though no one was there oh and what looked like very long ghostly arms around her and she said she tried to scream but no sound would come out because her son was sleeping in the other bed she wasn't able to say anything until the arms finally uncrossed and let her go and the indentation disappeared and then she was finally able to get her son's name out that would freak me out and make me so excited allinone feeling she felt like they were friendly she didn't feel like they were mean in any way but it was so scary she just couldn't handle it just because you know you get that oh my God I can't get sound out of my mouth here's another one back in 2016 this family Fernando and his family checked into to the Emily Morgan and he gave them a bad review on Trip Adviser he says I know this is not the staff's fault but the place is haunted I did not know this when my family checked in it was only in the middle of the night when none of us including my 8-year-old could sleep it wasn't the beds and it wasn't the room temp temp although the temperature kept fluctuating even though we didn't touch it he said we were pretty tired but we couldn't sleep and it wasn't the weird noises and gosh that was a whole other thing though so they kept hearing weird noises and the temperature kept fluctuating and they didn't know the place was haunted and he said his wife could feel an oppressive feeling that would not allow them to go to sleep and it was so bad that every time they would try to go to sleep this like oppressive feeling would get worse and they just could couldn't it's like they could use Trip Advisor to make the comments but they didn't use Trip Advisor to know beforehand that it was haunted right he knows now he said they stayed in room 11:07 and that the oppressive feeling and the the strange noises were so bad that his family had to leave and they were charged an early checkout fee and ended up going to another hotel where they slept soundly next time check Yelp out it'll tell you it's haunted right it seems like this property honestly it seems like this property is kind of never ending it's like story after story after story after story that really makes me want to go to Texas damn it yep here's another one they were staying on the 14th floor and they say that at 400 amm the witching hour the witching hour so they say at 400 a there was a bang on their door and three other doors right near their simultaneously and they all opened the doors and looked out and there was no one there I have question so if I'm not mistaken I believe we have some listeners in Texas yes quite a few actually our Texas folk if any of you have been to this Emily Morgan place I want to know if you are looking for a vacation spot in your state go to this Emily Morgan hotel and tell us what it's like I want to know I want to hear some firsthand experiences and if we got enough listeners in Texas one of you people please I'm begging you spend a night let us know like write us an email the stoned Wich isour at gmail.com I want to hear about your experience in the Emily Morgan Mansion me too and this last story shell I'm gonna tell you because I know you're gonna hate this one oh God I don't know am I gonna hate it and it's spooky spooky or well you're gonna hate it because it's spooky and it's a spooky that you particularly don't like so this is also on the 11th floor now again this whole hotel everybody talks about the haunted people have experiences in the elevator they hear the lady on the seventh floor they hear the gurns they smell so many people talked about smelling the antiseptic and the the weird Hospital smell on the top two floors and what could be worse than any of that yeah there's a lot of that that happens so this one was on the 11th floor uh This was um a woman named Sarah she says that the first night they stayed at the Emil Emily Morgan their 9-year-old woke them up because he kept hearing things he kept hearing something talking and that something kept poking his foot and his back I do not like people who mess with children that is a line that ghosties should not cross so of course they told him to go back to sleep and then the next night the mom started to get the sensation of something grabbing her feet that is like why do they have to touch your feet why can't you touch my arm why can't you touch my shoulder why are ghost attracted to your feet it's like my boyfriend no feet touching people and then it would sit on her feet I have actually experienced um ghosts or Spirits what have you sitting on me and laying on me and I'll tell you there's a level of you're unsettled not only is the ghost there but it's like invading my personal space and there's a little Tad of unsettlement that goes along with that not going to lie so she says the only way she was able to get away from it was when she kind of finally pulled her feet up and curled up into a ball and curled up next to her husband because the weight was so oppressive she couldn't handle it anymore they were staying there with a friend and this friend said that they wanted to check out some of the more haunted floors or the more notoriously haunted floors what was that not enough for him that wasn't enough apparently that's something I would do I'd be like wait they're just [ __ ] with my feet I need more so they wanted to go to the seventh floor and they did and standing in the elevator they could hear the screams of the lady on the seventh floor oh my God I don't know if that point if I'd even step out of the elevator they couldn't because the doors closed and it took them to the ninth floor on its own oh when they were on the ninth floor they kept hearing really loud bangs even though no one else was there see I have this fear of plunging to my death so I would not be down with the whole [ __ ] with the elevator thing because in my mind I'd be like at any moment these cords could snap and I'm plunged into my death so I would actually not be a fan of the ele elevator thing just because of that fear I have you know what I'm saying exactly exactly so this I mean it's in a very historic part of San Antonio it's you have a view of the Alamo so if that's something you want to see it's on the it's on the site of where probably gorgeous that's the thing it's probably gorgeous it it is a very pretty Hotel it's it's a little dated from what some people say now but still the nice hotel part of the charm part of the charm and it sounds like there's an awful lot going on there so even though it's not a it's not an asylum it was a hospital for a very long time so how did I do shell did I did I do a good you you know I think you did good and and I know that this was way out of your comfort zone it really was actually the true crime was a little out of my comfort zone as well but I was able to to keep it under control because the ghosty aspect but we both got we both got very interesting properties very much so right around the same time right around when there was a lot of [ __ ] going and in a similar part in America I mean you're talking Louisiana and Texas in the 1830s and unfortunately at those times they really did not treat black people well at all I mean what the [ __ ] and so your story and mine kind of highlighted that a little bit you know unfortunately those Spirits are just soaked into that land they're just soaked into that land and we've talked a thousand times that sometimes it's more about the land like with your story a lot of the issues that came about were from the property before the building was even in existence exactly exactly the battles that that happened there and then to name it after that woman who probably went through such horrific things they probably meant to like commemorate her memory and I'm sure their intentions were good but I think they just kind of dug up some [ __ ] I think so too and as we've seen here you have it all I mean you you have a trifecta if you will because you have the site of a horrific battle where so many people lost their lives and and then you have a magically inclined building a building that's shaped to be drawing energy and holding it there and then to have it be this I guess at the time it was applauded it was like the tallest building like west of the Mississippi for the longest time was it's like one of the first skyscrapers at 13 stories 13 stories but you got to remember at that time you know west of the Mississippi wasn't really like developed a lot right right right exactly so this was was a Wonder at the time but so here's this building that it's built on the site of a battle a horrific battle it's built in a shape to draw energy and and then it becomes a hospital and and it's got all these gargoyles and stuff on it you've got to check out some pictures it's a cool looking building very cool looking building but it looks like it was designed to be haunted but that's what I'm saying it was almost like right from the jump it was conducive to activity absolutely and then to name it after Emily Morgan and and again such a controversial figure and who knows what happened whether it was yay go folklore heroine or you know sorry for what happened to you because that's shitty whereas in my story Delphine Lori doesn't even deserve to have that Mansion have her name not even a little bit holy [ __ ] I things that that the horrific things that that woman did I know that there are rumors that I've heard rumors that she sewed people's mouth shut yeah yeah like [ __ ] was C and and you know you were you were kind of tied to your job literally like the cook was chained to the stove and one of the quote unquote Maids was chained to like a laundry tub where they would scrub clothing like you were literally chained to your what the [ __ ] is wrong with people you know I think back in that time there were a lot of a lot of people that thought that their wealth and their place in in the in the social Spectrum it worked it [ __ ] worked they felt that it gave them the right to be that way I mean she [ __ ] lost her Mansion but she fled to [ __ ] Paris and had nothing happen consequence no Consequence the only the only consequence was she lost her Mansion [ __ ] that's no but on that note you're taking your final hits I am I'm about out R are gone and it and it's time to wrap up this festive show listen to me being all Lea like you're doing so good I'm so impressed sh I
