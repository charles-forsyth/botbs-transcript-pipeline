hi all you witches pagans heathens and magical Souls welcome to back on the broomsticks Solarium shell and Leela's sunlet Sanctuary we take a break from screen glows and Dusty Toms to relax with a bit of Herbal Magic join us for enchanted teas mystical toes and candid talks about everything from Arcane books to tantalizing trinkets we'll spill the tea on the latest witchy mus haves and find out what sparks those got to have it now moments and what is better left on Tik Tok which magical books and tools truly deserve a place in your collection in this special once a month episode we'll find out it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hey thanks for joining us on the solarium I'm Leila and this is my co-host shell this is great I love that we're doing this and this is kind of a new idea uh that we're bringing to our listeners we want to kind of welcome you all to a little hangout session with Leila and I this is a place where we can talk about the things that we like to use the herbs the tools the books that we've been reading the tarot decks we've been using what's going on in the witchy and magical world spilling all the tea while we drink the tea and Smoke the Herb and we're also sit here and have some chats about you know there's stuff in the sky and tonight we're going to talk about we're going to talk about different things going on in the sky we got some eclipses we've got some weird stuff and we're just gonna hang out and chitchat and have a little drink and a little smoke so right now I am actually rolling up a joint with a little bit of some jack hair that I have I'm adding to it some main some Rose what's that for you know I'm gonna ask cannabis is you know it's for relaxation it's just kind of to mellow things out and the main is good for your lungs actually so I pretty much put Main in everything I smoke it has a nice full-bodied smoke and it's also good for protection so it's a it's a nice reminds me a little bit of sage so I like to have that in anything I smoke for protection what else you got in there I also have a little bit of rose petals some dried rose petals and some lavender just because you know this is a solar eclipse coming up that we're talking about we're in the solarium and these herbs are very uplifting they make me happy and they make me think of Summer and the sun you know funny you should say all that because I'm sitting here and I am actually sipping on some of my herbal tea I'm such a tea lover I feel like I should have I should have been born with a teacup in my hand and what I am drinking today and sipping on is a caramel apple tea that I really really really love o but you know you talked about how some of your contents of your herbal smoke are for protection ironically enough so isn't my herbal tea I have some apple in here which you know apple is a good protection um I still cut the Apple you know Pentacle out isn't that the only way to cut an apple I think if you're a witch it's pretty much you're only allowed to do that by law yeah right but T the season for apples you know apples associated with the equinox and with sin having been in Upstate New York most of my life like this is apple season oh yeah this is when you bask in the life of apples and with apples absolutely comes cinnamon which Speaking of solar magic cinnamon is so wonderful mixed with apple in my tea but you know meditation astral projection I like cinnamon for Prosperity too absolutely but I'm just kind of more thinking time of year type relations you know it's also you know protection power luck strength prosperity but I'm kind of in the zone of that meditation and connectedness the veil is thinning the astral projection you know kind of a t the season kind of thing yeah I also have some orange peel in here some dried Orange Peel oh I love I have some of that in mind as well some blood orange o oh I didn't even go with the blood orange route so good so sunshiny but you know this the the orange you know again there's other uses for it but for my intended purpose uh strengthening divination again it's associated with the element of fire solar energy solar eclipse coming T the season I kind of tried to to get some beautifully tasty ingredients together that were kind of seasonal and tasty Al together capped it off with just a pinch of chamomile and then some sea salt sea salt in your tea here's why because I did put caramel flavoring in it um because I was like well you know if you're going to have something with apple in it it's got to have some caramel in it well yeah and I do love sea salt with my caramel but in tea well just because to kind of balance out that you know you got the sweet from the Apple the sweet from the orange then you got a little bit of that caramelly oversweet so the salt kind of balances it I like that because it balances it magically too it gives you that nice grounding element for the whole thing I was hoping to a caramel apple is what I was going for but what has been driving my my sweet love insane with my tea this week he's been down in it almost as much as I have I started adding sweet cream creamer to it oh no no no see I'm a lemon and honey girl in my tea you go the creamer route well you know and and we'll discuss this as later date and time and and it'll be discussed uh in depth in my workshop coming up I I was a born and raised cream and my tea girl oh no lemon and honey I do have the the blood orange like you in my tea but mine has cranberries and um and black tea and that's it the lemon and honey has it has its time and place I swear it does in everything but so doesn't cream there's got to be someone out there that can back me up on this people if you are listening if you put milk or cream in your tea help a girl out and back me up here with Lea well right now although I am smoking more just to hang out with you and to talk about some of these celestial events that are coming up this is an excellent blend to smoke if you want to relax if you want to do this as a meditation before you do any ritual working main Rose and lavender with your cannabis is a really nice way to get into magical head space now let me ask you this because I don't have like too extensive of a history with herbal Blends and smoking them do you get a sore throat from that no actually especially with the main it's very nice for if I have any type of cough or not necessarily a sore throat but if I have any sort of aggravation due to smoking or a little cough that smoking is aggravating the main very much helps to soothe that in my mind I'm thinking that smoking lavender would kind of be like an irritant but I trust you I'll give it a go I'll give very mellow next time you come over we'll have to try some blends absolutely because I I am curious because like I said it's not something I've really delved much into which is ironic with my herb and tea history you would think that herbal Blends herbal smokable Blends would go hand inand with that but this is new for me I think it's something new for a lot of people but for today in the solarium I think one of the things that we want to do is to talk about all those witchy mus haves everything from books and trinkets and Tarot decks and today we have some lovely things not everything is going to be sponsored today we happen to have a few things from Luellen that we received the queen of all witcheries which is a book I have been dying to get my hands on for quite a while excellent book excellent book we also have a couple things from author Christopher Hughes that both of us very much enjoy and a new book that's not quite out yet about cycles and Seasons so but before we get into those I wanted to talk to you about the thing that's coming up on Saturday the 14th solar eclipse so there's a lot of eclipses what else is coming up yeah isn't there enough there's a lunar eclipse later in the month too you know there's something unsettling about when there's like a full moon and a lunar eclipse right before Friday the 13th Friday the 13th right before s I'm like oh wow our world's colliding here like it's very crazy energy it's pretty pretty wild I feel like I need like like to wear like cinnamon draped from my shirt and Pentacles all around me like Rosemary and Bay and Sage everywhere I'm just going to sit in the corner and sip some tea and hope for the best here folks there you go I've put a salt circle around my entire house and and it seems like the information I'm seeing online about the energy of this time and what you should or shouldn't do is just as chaotic oh lord it's like you ask 10 different people you get 10 different answers truly talking to witches what do they say it's like hurting cats it's one of those impossible things to get us all to agree on one thing absolutely but you know take the Dual energy that's how I look at it you know there is there is some power in solar energy um a lot of cleansing power actually take advantage of that use the solar eclipse to do solar work and then when that lunar eclipse goes rolling around do the same thing and do some deep lunar work like don't don't be afraid of it just work with the EB and flow you know I'm with you I think that it is a very intense energy and having both the sun and the weird just happening in the same month right before s that's the weird part yeah right after Friday the 13th it's just kind of kind of intense energy but I do think that you can do a couple different things with it this solar eclipse because the sun and the moon are there you have that Duality at the exact same moment so if you want to do spells rituals that have to do with Duality or facing yourself or facing your opposite self that's a great time to do it absolutely also another good spell to do is to uncover that which is hidden because the moon comes in and asserts her emotional energy during this very light bright time and she covers things up and then reveals them again so it's a time where you can go into to that dark side and find something that needs to be revealed and bring it to the light so those are good things to do in my opinion I I definitely don't think that either of these eclipses or or things that people should be leery of or should shy away from doing magic because I have seen a lot of that online they're like don't do anything during the solar lunar eclipse and I'm like that's that's poppy  here folks I agree energy is energy just know what you're working with if you're G to charge crystals under an eclipse a solar eclipse no what you're getting into exactly label that it's like working with a Ouija board I ain't telling you not to work with a Ouija board I'm just telling you know what you're doing right if you're GNA  around you're GNA find out right right and we are big proponents to around and find don't get us wrong but just just just know that that's what you're doing that's right and I'm sorry I have to take a quick break but did you see what I like to have loose tea mostly I get like loose teas but do you see my little tea it's a sword I have to show you this I have the cutest I think I outdone you I I understand that you have a really really really pretty sword is it is it a te defuser uhuh I have a cat that hangs off the inside of your cup that's [Music] adorable he's made out of silicone and you pull him apart and put the tea in and he hangs on your cup with his little paws that is very cute that is I do love your sword I do love your sword I just think is the worst part is the worst part is is that the cat I have a beautiful kitty who thinks it's a mouse and there was a time where the cat actually attacked the teacup oh nobody got burned nothing got spilled but my my little cat diffuser was floating in my tea because the C my real cat was knocking it thinking it was some Mouse oh my goodness the things they get up to but yeah lunar eclipses solar eclipses just know what you're getting into with the energy energy is energy people I'm not going to tell you don't do magic now or don't do ritual now because that's in my opinion that's ridiculous just know what you're getting into know what energy you are working with and I I personally the way I'm looking at it as with these two things happening is the veil is becoming the thinnest um I'm trying to be very cautious and aware of my workings so that nothing backfires nothing goes nuts so cuckoo it's just definitely a time to be cognizant of what you're doing and what your intentions are because what you're doing if your intentions are different it's going with your intentions so make sure those things are aligned right now historically eclipses like this have been viewed as bad Omens they have almost always historically been feared and people have been frightened of this energy it's all what you make of it but keep that in mind that that type of energy is out there as well and it's pretty strong in a lot of people so that's going to be prevalent too in anything that you do and speaking of being scared of what's in the sky shall wow oh wow you sent me a picture that freaked me out and I had to smoke a big fat bowl all by myself and the whole time I'm like what the is that what the is that what does it mean so tell us what exactly did you send to freak me out so badly well you know this is crazy and and the best part is is I have like an extension of the story that you haven't even heard yet so you know two nights ago I happen to go out for a little bit and unfortunately as we all know it's getting dark early I hate that's another reason for the solarium I'm going to miss the sun man I know right so this is about 7:30 8 o'clock I happen to go out and and I come back and I just happen as I get out of the car look up in the sky it's something I do it's just a habit and I see going across the sky the only way I can describe it is it was going west to east from like England to the ocean um because I'm within a few miles of the ocean and I could tell it was moving in the direction of going out to see equally spaced apart and there's like 20 dots in a row now what 20 now listen see at first I thought starlink but then you said 20 in a row about 20 25 yeah and the picture you sent that doesn't look like starlink so I have a really good cellular phone I have that Samsung Galaxy 21 I know there's better versions out right now but this has a bitching camera and I am able to zoom in on the craters of the Moon with this camera okay I'm zooming in on whatever these dots are and nothing is coming in clear so they are definitely first of all further away than the moon freaky decky they get to about where in my mind you know I'm sitting on land here and what it looks like about to where it's over the ocean and as they go one by one are disappearing I'm like what the holy so my boyfriend obviously is with me he was driving and I'm yelling I'm like look at this and he's like what is that I'm like I swear it's aliens he thinks I'm crazy and he's like it can't be aliens I'm like it's aliens man so one by one definitely freaky all 20 25 of them in a perfect straight line in a formation single file going across Jets what in that kind of formation where the hell are they going and why are they so high that my camera can't zoom when it my camera can zoom to the Moon surface good that's all I'm saying so any of you listeners out there if you know what that was over Salem Massachusetts tell me in October please email us back onck at gmail.com put theum in the title it gets better it gets better oh all right so the picture you sent me had me like that was so weird what happened after that we decide to get away from Salem for the evening because Salem in October is just like it's like Time Square on New Year's Eve people so we decided to take a nice ride out to Glo Oster so we're driving he's driving I'm not driving um he's driving and you know I'm one of those people in the car where I'm just all looking around you know what's going on what's up in the sky no  Sherlock same freaking thing at the same time of night it was about 7:30 8 o'clock but this time we were not home we were more towards Gloucester and we see the same thing about 20 25 of them in a solid straight line going towards the ocean and one by one they disappeared two freaking nights in a row I have not found anything on the news I have not found anything on Facebook and I'm freaked out because what you can't tell me we're the only two people in Massachusetts that are seeing this all right crazy I'm email us back on the broomstick gmail.com if you know what that was please tell me it has some sort of mundane explanation because otherwise it's aliens it's aliens I'm going right to aliens but two nights two nights in a row single file across the sky and definitely further away than the moon it's all I'm saying that picture was just wild very trippy very I'm freaked I'm freaked me too please email and tell us but so if you're smoking a joint hit your joint take a big go of tea because that's what I'm gonna do and we're gonna calm down a little bit and we're gonna talk some really good books like these we we've got some really good things to talk about we do and I'm going to start out because I have been wanting this book ever since I heard Jack chanic on another podcast and I am so sorry I can't remember which one but I love listening to this man talk he is a he has a doctorate in philosophy I believe and he just is very interesting I'm just very I will buy any of his books at this point tell us again the name of the book the book that I'm talking about is Queen of all witcheries a biography of the goddess and it's written by Jack chanic and I really enjoyed this book quite a bit honestly if you have read Ronald Hutton if you have read Gardner if you've read Crowley if you've read Ann Murray some of the the earlier things then this is going to be all familiar territory to you it's basically talking about the goddess capital T capital G the goddess the goddess the goddess the one the archetype that encompasses all of the goddesses he explains it a little better in his book theism polytheism soft polytheism but basically a lot of witches and pagans talk about the goddess in capitals when they're referring to the Earth Mother the goddess of all the great mother and and this book is basically a history of her now I mentioned some other people because you can read those books those very historical Toms about the historical goddess but they're really boring if you want if you want my honest opinion they're interesting but they're pretty academic and they're pretty dry they're also kind of outdated and so Jack chanik queen of all witcheries brings all of that historical data you know he did his research he did his reading and he updated the history of the Goddess for now because some of that stuff was very colonialist some of it very misogynistic you know and a little out modernized it he modernized it and he brought it all into a very easyto read excellent read book I really really enjoyed it I like that it has accompanying ritual suggestions which I like to point out our suggest s you can always take anything you find out of a book a ritual a spell a potion a concoction and tailor it to your own self and needs so I like to call them ritual suggestions this book is chalk full of them and I love that about this and it's good too like you mentioned you can rewrite them Jack himself has also Rewritten them for a group and also for solitary practitioners and so that will show you a little bit how something can be modified from a group ritual to a solitary if you if you needed to do that for those of you that have been on the path for a while or have read these historical books it will be familiar ground but still worth a read and anyone who's not familiar with the historical goddess worship highly recommend I know that I I I totally agree with you 110% about everything you've said about this book I sense a butt coming uhuh I just wanted to quickly talk about another book kedwin the Celtic goddess of inspiration by Christopher Hugh oh I thought you were gonna say something bad about Queen of all witcheries no no that book rocks all right no okay I was getting all defensive for nothing then no because you you were like well you know that there's these books about individual goddesses they kind of outdated and boring until you read kedwin okay this this book this book is phenomenal Christopher Hughes he is the chief of Angley Druid or a member of the order of BS ovates and Druids he's a Welsh scholar tarot Creator and a multi-book author this guy is all things Welsh and right now I love everything he's got same 100% agree dear Christopher make more this is the greatest stuff I've touched all of his stuff like no this this book is phenomenal extremely well thought out well researched for anybody who's studying kedwin or Celtic deities or Mythos this is a must have on your bookshelf I love exercises with books like I said with queen of all rich witcheries why do I have a hard time saying that title queen of all witcheries um what I like about both books is it's not just reading material per se there are exercises there are rituals and kedwin is chalk full of different exercises different meditations things to kind of get you you are immersing yourself in kerwin's cauldron when you read this book this is taking you to kedwin herself and I love it these are definitely exercises that invigorate your soul if kedwin is what you're looking to go into oh yeah I so agree kedwin has a special place in my heart I've mentioned in past recordings that my first magical name was kedwin you know she is one of the goddess of witches and she's the goddess of knowledge and the goddess of the cauldron and having a book just on her to be honest especially when I saw how big this book is because like how many pages is this book this book is we're looking at roughly about 300 yeah so 300 solid pages of academic writing on kedwin I thought I was going to slog through this book Absol you couldn't put it down could you because I I couldn't I am reading it again for the second time because I absolutely love it it's well written it's in depth it really feeds my soul for for all the detail and information that I want in a very well-presented way and like you said the exercises very much go along with the text and help so much for me to kind of get reconnected and you know as I'm currently studying the mabinogion I find that his chapter relating kodwin to the mabinogion kind of was a little more enlightening than I expected it to be because his perspective versus the Ford version of the mogon that I'm reading you got old text versus a new a new way of thinking about it and and that kind of opened some some doors and enlightened me with some things the way he talks about I think he said in the book he coined the phrase world tree where he talks about the mabinogion as a world tree and all the Welsh Tales is not just the branches that we know of them but kind of there's branches off branches and then this branch has a little twig off it this way and leaves grow in this way it gives you this perspective of Welsh history that's that I think is unparallel right now and in an easy to understand way so it's academic but yet easy to understand and it's something that the everyday reader can consume and eat up this knowledge like nobody's business you don't have to be a scholar to understand this book I love love love love five stars yeah but like I said you do get you do get a great glimpse of Welsh mythology as well as the kedwin story in it so it's it's almost a twofer for me and again the exercises and stuff topnotch topnotch well while we're on Christopher Hughes let's go to the soul divination tool that we have in this month's Hall OMG this is something you specifically asked for this is something that you have wanted and I know just the other year you were looking high and low for one of these and could not find it so Christopher must have heard you on the astrop plane he did he has created along with the most awesome artist right now Aaron O Brown who's from uh Buffalo New York by the way go upstate New York that's right they have together created the U tide tarot this is brand new this is just out right now 2023 put out by lellan worldwide and this is everything I have spent the last three years looking for people it's true she has I am an I'm I'm what they like to lightly call a Tarot addict do they have a word for the level of addiction that is your tarot collection it's called you got issues lady stop buying tarot deex it's called she has a spreadsheet that even I have access to in order to keep track of the many decks that she has how many are we up to now sh about 178 but at least the list is alphabetical which by the way thank you to my oldest child for alphabetizing it for me and it now has the Ule TI tarot at the very end this thing is phenomenal I have legit for the last three years been looking for a Christmas themed Ule themed type Tarot deck you know I am I am a witch to the core Pagan is they but I love Christmas we everybody who knows me knows that and all I wanted for my exensive tarot collection was a quote unquote Christmas deck um and Christopher Hughes has delivered an awesome fashion this thing candy canes would you say in candy cane fashion I think one of the things I love about it is the suits check this out I mean this is like such spectacular yel tide fashion candles equals wands good cheer equals cups canes are the swords and the gifts are the pentacle cards this is beautiful it's got It's Chuck full of Christmas trees and U tide trees I love a good decorated tree the accompanying book with it the the cards themselves phenomenal artwork is great but this comes with the most amazing book and I cannot even slight the book a bit full color pictures of every C he definitely takes the time there are candy cane green and red striped gorgeous borders on most of the pages in the book it is seeped in Ule tide this is this is the most seasonal deck you're goingon to get but he definitely takes the time to associate the tarot with Ule tied themes in Christmas themes and kind of try to tie the U tide season into the tarot and into the specific cards and meanings I've actually done two readings with this deck so far I don't want to say it made me feel very happy and jovial but kinda like it's a fun deck not okay maybe not something I would use for like some hardcore serious Shadow work reading but this is a fun fun deck and I am so in love with this okay I'm going to give kind of an opposite review that's okay because I love Christopher Hughes and everything he touches however this deck for me Falls very squarely under too gimmicky to really use I love the artwork it's stunningly gorgeous I love how the major Arcana has been redone the lightning tree for the Tower with the Christmas tree and the clearing with the lightning hitting it that's gorgeous the list for what is that Justice I mean that's pretty wild mistletoe for the lovers the Simplicity of the Ace of canes with just a beautiful candy cane hanging from a tree the artwork is stunning the cards feel good it's full there's no border it's full color cards from edge to edge they're great cards however great paper great paper by the way they use good stock however this would fall under like the Hocus Pocus tarot or the Jedi tarot or something like that for me it's it's something that's interesting and I might do a reading around Ule for fun with it but it's not something I can take seriously you know what I think part of it is too though because I've known you for a hundred years giving away our age I know right I am a fanatic for the Ule tide season I have been known to put up nine Christmas trees fully decorated I take it to a different level yes whereas you just don't take it to the level I do for me finally a Tarot deck for the Most Wonderful Time of the Year yes so I think that we both have valid points I am just more in love with it than you are just because it's more my thing than it is yours absolutely and I think that's okay beautiful deck absolutely stunning and the book is lovely descriptions that Christopher has written fabulous spot I love this guy he's top-notch work all the way around yes and aerin oi Brown gorgeous artwork it is a little sad honestly I did think that the artwork seemed a little bit sad for a holiday deck for a u dck really I'm not sure I got that is is it just that you felt that the depictions weren't like cheery and happy yeah and it seemed it seemed a little more on the side yeah look at the five of gifts I mean some of those cards are sad well some tarot cards are sad let's face it I see what you're saying but like if you look at the six and seven of gifts they're pretty happy to be getting those gifts I think I think maybe it's just we just have different perceptions of how much we love the U tide season and I just it's my thing and not your thing and that's okay but I love it it's a beautiful deck I like what I was going for when I originally was looking for a Christmas themed deck is I have a ostara themed deck and I also have a sa themed deck and I was like wouldn't it be great to have one for every season but no one did one so I'm pleased I'm happy and I love it perfect the last book that we're talking about today is a book that I was very interested in Reading U because it deals with two things that are very close to my heart genus locai which is the spirit of place and also with Cycles big and small cycles and the book is called season songs rediscovering the Magic in the cycles of Nature and it's by Emma Katherine and when is this coming out this book is coming out in December of this year so December 2023 this will be out and it is just in time for youle just in time for you that's right it make a perfect gift and I do think that this book would be a fabulous gift for any beginner witch Pagan Heathen because it does very much delve into the cycles of the seasons and how you can live your life in harmony with the cycles of the day with the lunar cycles and with the solar cycles of the seasons the major wheel of the Year Cycles she gives wonderful rituals and spells and meditations on how to connect with those Cycles I very much enjoyed her book it was a very easy read it was very easy to get into you know and it connects two things that I'm very interested in right now spirits of place and and following the natural cycles of your life again we're going to probably have a differing opinion I I wasn't in love with this and I think part of it was I found it difficult to read there are just certain styles of writing that flow with some people and certain styles of writing that don't and this style of writing was just difficult for me so I had a hard time struggling through it I think there's good content in there I think the message is good I just personally had a hard time reading this this particular author she did have a very casual very personal kind of laidback style I liked that it seemed like I said very easy to read and it felt very much like she was a friend talking to you about you know there was some personal anecdotes in there and she related these Cycles to personal things in her life and things that you could find in your life so I can see where some people might not particularly Vibe with that writing style but I thought I found it very easy and personal would you say I would I would say it kind of you know kind of hit it it kind of read more I don't want to say it read more like a journal but like oh that's kind of a good Jal sure yeah it seemed very like I said it seemed very personal so kind of Journal is a good way to put it and and so maybe if you don't like that style of writing that pacing might throw you off a little bit but I loved her meditations as you know I've I've studied hypnotherapy and meditation the verbiage that she uses you know kind of getting you to use many senses when she writes out these meditations and these script scripts I I very much enjoyed it I think it would definitely work well for someone who's getting into learning about how to live their life in accordance with with the seasons and with the Cycles I think this is definitely something that even though I struggled uh to get through it I think people should take the time and give it a shot um because again it like you said it can get you on the path to balancing yourself with the earth and the seasons and the cycles and I again think this would be a great U tide gift to is the season it's coming out right in December for someone who has kind of struggled with meditation in the past I think that might been another another thing that got me caught up with the book um is meditations aren't my forte uh so so I I do think it's worth a read it was just a struggle for me personally but for sure any first year students or beginner students looking for an animistic perspective talking about the cycle of seasons and genus lokai anyone who is is also a nerd at heart because the author said she's a nerd and again I related very strongly to that but good book so I think these are all books that I'm going to keep on my bookshelf I'm not so sure about this Tarot deck I'm going to give it another try especially as we get a little closer to you all I'm going to give season songs another try um but I think all in all even though we maybe had some differing opinions I think we got four quality products that people should definitely take a look at um again queen of all richer witch again Queen of All witcheries by Jack chanik season songs by Emma Katherine and Christopher Hughes rocking it out with two things we've got the utide tarot and then we've got kedwin Celtic goddess of inspiration so all four of these I think mus haves and totally worth you taking a check out at yeah get those wherever you get your books or tarot decks your local metaphysical shop and these are all from lell and worldwide you can get them there or online as well and my tea is gone and my joint has been gone for a minute so it's time to hang up our witch hats for the night I think we will see you next time in the solarium keep it witchy
