welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and this is the fourth episode of The Elemental Magic series and for this episode will be waiting into the magic of water water is the elements of intuition healing and emotion from the holy Wells of account to the dark banks of the River Styx water has long been part of our collective subconscious will explore the wisdom of water through its magical correspondences it's limited symbolism and it's deeply personal connection to our bodies and minds but wait I'm sure she'll and before we dive into the water like what I did that before we dive into the water we want to talk a little bit about a wonderful fabulous upcoming event Pagan Pride day it is going to be Pagan Pride day all across the world throughout the month of September so we want to take a moment and talk about what is Pagan Pride day where did it come from where is it headed and what are we doing for  Layla you and I have celebrated this for a very long time going back to the first Pagan Pride we ever attended was in 2001 almost to the beginning so far it is from what we looked it up not too long ago and found out that Pagan Pride there's rumors that has started in the early 90s like right around 1992 but there's really no documented evidence of that the first time there's really any documentation of a pagan Pride it was in the late 90s like right around 1998 and that was what three or four years before we went to our first Pagan Pride day which happened to be the very first New York City Pagan pride and sadly it was shortly after the September 11th attacks in New York city so there was really a sense of wanting to come together that solidarity  connection amongst which has like it was a deep deep experience I think both emotionally magically mentally the whole thing to it and I'm going to post pictures of baby which cell and Layla at our Pagan Pride day in New York City back in 2001 there are also going to be some 9/11 Memorial pictures in that as well because the two are intrinsically tied together in our memories wow you have pictures of me from sending posts had bright red hair  play remember that hair and I loved it I can't wait this year Pagan Pride we are going back to Central New York this group has been running a pagan Pride day for quite a few years now and we do a phenomenal job like a lot of groups you know they have their glitches and their issues mostly due to the fact that there's just a couple of them are some glitch free issue phrase saying I don't know where you're going cuz it's nowhere I've been but there won't be any vendors pretty much any Pagan Pride that you go to you're going to find a lot of interesting things going are you going to be able to meet people learn new things and buy pretty shiny things in common theme among Pagan Pride days that I think is awesome is there's generally a food drive a non-perishable canned food drive where they ask you to donate Goods  folks in need so if you are heading out to your local Pagan Pride days sometime in the month of September you know take a take a few extra fingers with you and donate it to those who don't necessarily have as much as we all do and take some time and and check out the local boobs a lot of times these Pagan fries will have not only vendors but they'll have groups from your local area that provide services maybe they provide local rituals or the local study groups you might be able to find cousins or different events in your area so check that out as definitely a great way to find like-minded people in your area also I would be remiss if I didn't say this another fun reason to go to these is the shopping is vendors are phenomenal and let me tell you I know that the man in the blue truck can get it to you in 2 days but you are not supporting your community and your local pagans that way  go to these things look at these peoples where's and if you're going to spend the dollars anyway spend them local with some of your local community because you will find one-of-a-kind items handmade items very witchee Wachee things but you will also find alter tools and some ritual supplies that you may need to snag up while you're there not everybody is lucky enough to have pagan shop in their area so might be a good way to apply up shell who goes to 15 on your lunch break I'm not I'm just super jealous  just the season folks I know you're all coming to Salem because that's what everybody does this time of year do you need any shopping tips let me know a time for all of these Pagan events to go to Salem but there's Pagan Pride events at it just seems to be that kind of year and if you are looking for connection these are great ways to connect with folks whether it's trying to find a a working coven or just a community or just people to make you not feel alone in this crazy world and to bring it back around 2 episode of topic ball is also considered to be the season of water so happy to see what I did there bring it all the way back and yeah and you know it's kind of funny because you just mentioned that you all of a sudden have the storm in your area is funny because it's not funny it's ironic that this is kind of that water time but it's also the time when is hurricane season  thunderstorms are a lot of rain is is Shifting in now and so it's almost like the Earth feels like it's it it's water phase right now you know when I sent you videos of this and we'll see if we can get some posted but I went down the other night to the shore we had a storm coming in here in the North Shore Massachusetts and there was a way of Psych there is an energy that comes in with that water it's Indescribable it's it it's this powerful it's almost like this loving cleansing force that will snap your neck in a heartbeat water has moods you know you look out at a beautiful Lake and it's classy and it's smooth and it's perfect and then you can see all the way down to the bottom and it looks so gentle and nice but then you look at Niagara Falls and the water is pouring down the sides and pound you to a pulp in a second  these different mood it's not only a shape changer in that it can go from glassy and clear to waves crashing in a heartbeat but water takes the shape of whatever you put it into and water is the only element that has all the different forms of matter just normally you can normally on the planet Earth find water in a liquid or gas or solid form and that's pretty much how I keep going back to that site I saw the other day at the beach water can be this loving and comforting cleansing thing that can engulf you and love and care but in the next breath that same water can be what takes you out you know you don't pay attention to those emotions those feelings and the elemental pieces of water that can really destroy it from the inside out they say that were made up mostly of water here is humans. 60% I mean this is the element that we should be the most attuned to it is  tied to our emotional self and I think that sometimes not enough care is taken towards that and I think people shy away from the water element because I feel like it's a reflection of ourselves yeah water is the element of our emotions of our deep subconscious and of our mind your brain itself is surrounded by water and when we talked about water taking on intention or taking on the shape of things that you put it into you know that goes back to the doctrine of signatures water is very malleable water is something that you can mold if you choose to do it so is that your emotional state and like you said a lot of times we don't choose to control that we don't choose to work with the water you know we try to ignore it or just glanced along the surface because it's easier like a skipping rock look at that pretty glass surface and not look at what's underneath and underneath water is teeming with so much  just kind of right themselves here but because our bodies are made up of water and because they can be influenced by things like say the moon pulls on the ties right and influences that water and turns it into those crashing waves well we are 60% water if we don't think the moon tugs on us I mean I think that would be silly to think that it doesn't I think most emergency room in police departments would agree with you on that theory so if we intentionally instead of ignoring it if we go into the depths of that water if we have our emotions you know we can really handle that into a good direction and get a lot of magic and energy out of it but I think like you said it's it's easy to stay on the surface and you know what I'm thinking of working with water I mean that's the stool but as far as tools that kind of lead you down that water mindset without having actual water I think of mirror  magic when I think of water I think maybe because that that surface of the mirror looks like that glass surface of a lake or or of a river or on occasion that glass surface of the ocean so this is a time where I find mirror magic to be very prevalent is when I'm working with water energies Works beautifully water wants to reflect what it shown much like a mirror does and it will happily take the shape of whatever you directed into so if you work with those qualities of divination purposely like for example scrying or working with water from ear spells you can shape the energy of that water into whatever magical tool you need are there any other tools that represent water that you like to use show vessels when I think of West alter tools and picking up vessels whether it's a cauldron or a bowl a dish a seashell dish  obviously things associated with the ocean and with with rivers and lakes and streams would be things I would potentially use on on my altar rocks is kind of an earth thing but if I put something out of a river or the ocean that may tend to be in my West quadrant of my altar as well as well glass of created by fire its Earth and fire but because it has been shaped and molded by that water carries the energy of water with it so stones that have been shaped by water glass that has been shaped even have bits of pottery that have been shaped by the water because water and time is extremely powerful you don't notice the changes that water is making as it relentlessly carbs through a roof over Years you'll see that it has changed the course of that River because it just keeps coming it just keeps going and if you don't watch it will change  the course of things that will change the shape of things because it is powerful even if it is kind of slow moving but things that I like to work with with water you mentioned earlier mirrors and because that clean your surface yeah that reflective surface with water is really great to use as a as a scrying mirror because you have that connection with the subconscious with the deep brain and so by scrying into that same as you would with fire gazing or any other type of scrying to the nation to soften your face in a relax your mind and just left those images, and it works very well because of water strong connection to your subconscious mind is also number 842 on what you can do with all that stocked up saved Moon water that is on your shelf for under your dresser that you're like what do I do with this now I'm absolutely you know that I take everything back to Devon  but I truly do and I think that for a lot of newer folks that haven't tried a lot of different methods of divination the best way to know what you're good at and what you like the mostest try them also this might be a good push to try water divination or or mere divination I mean that square intuition in our divination lives and also because water is very much a liminal space when you go through that surface you're in a whole nother World basically inside water the Celts very much feel that Holy Wells can be liminal spaces between here and another world they have a lot of association with holy rivers in holy Lakes deeply associated with land Spirits the Celts weren't the only people to think that water was a liminal space the Greeks did as well the Greeks and the Romans with the River Styx they had the whole idea that in order to get from this world into the  after all she had to cross the river I believe she was a goddess at one point I mean when were born there's the whole birth Waters right you're born in a rush of water and so they felt it when you died you also had to cross water the water itself is that liminal between life and death kind of space so it makes divination or scrying or any type of intuitive work very easy I can be a portal into that other side the obvious one that I've been thinking of that you didn't mention was Avalon you know you have to get in the boat and go through the church and the Priestess Parts the mess and then you go instead of Glastonbury Tor across the water you go to Avalon Water is very much Associated especially with women with feminine with the spirit and I think a lot of it has to do with you know from the womb you are in the waters of the womb a lot of associations there and again the waters around the brain so it until  the brain life and death water is associated with all of these things let's say one wants to get a better connection with water what would be one suggestion you would give to folks on a way they could work with the water the element of water the easiest one ritual bath get yourself into the water get your body in the water get wet you know actually ritual bath was going to be in my top two and with that what I think it is most effective for me take some flower petals sometimes it can all be rose petals folks sometimes it can be but not always flower petals some ritual oil obviously you're going to want to cleanse your bath prior to getting in and just get in and just kind of soak it all in and maybe whatever Royals you put in your ritual bathroom in flower petals for that  maybe to a means to whatever and you're looking at you know you looking for clarity or are you looking for a vision of the next steps you should take you know what is the purpose of that bath which may dictate what you put into that bath but get into the bath even if you just need a good cleansing if you just need a good cleansing showers and I do not mean that in in the take a shower you know you'll get clothes, take a shower but like there's something to be said for like when that water is just blowing at you from the head down it's just yes your kind of washing away all the literal dirt and grime but you're getting all that figurative it's almost I I look at it almost sometimes it's like an aura cleanse you know it's like showering your aura showering your space you know a good time to be able to to cut all the Ty's off yet  washing yourself you're washing yourself of those ties from that day or what have you I always like to take a shower after I've seen all the residual spiritual eckhoff me you know aside from the dirt and grime I think showers just in and of themselves are a spiritual cleansing said aside from a physical cleansing method hours are one of those amazing like-for-like magic spells that are perfect because it's so easy to visualize step in the shower water is coming down from your crown and it's flowing down your body and as it flows down your body it carries with it all the negativity all the crime all the dirt is so easy to visualize it's actually happening with this little bugger making that visual connection is super super easy with a shower so I love  showers and baths for cleansing purposes spiritual cleansing purposes for that reason and also because it's so easy to feel that water when you're feeling the physical aspect of water you're feeling the spiritual and magical aspects of it as well it can heat you up it can cool you down it can make you hydrated it can drown you it can cleanse you it can make you feel purified and uplifted it can pull you down so all these things that you feel when you're in water or with water are how you can work with it magically and do you remember she'll back when we were little witchling when we first went to a festival interesting Lee enough Brushwood folklore Center they used to have a group that went there very large group called The Church of all worlds I remember the Church of all worlds  grizzled old dudes and somebody cups of water in their hands turn to the person next to them and poured it into their hands and said water shared is life shared and the person that gave the water to see exactly it so that went around the hot tub and so when it got to us we had learned the call-and-response by that point but I had heard that originally in a book I read because I was a major nerd as a kid and I read Heinlein Stranger in a Strange Land and that's where that phrase came from the church of all worlds was created from the book Stranger in a Strange Land by over on cell and friends and it became a major movement it is still a movement I just want to support from hand to hand in that particular it was Pagan soup enough at that point there is no way in all the freaking way  host of how you would have gotten me to drink any of that water or even put my face in it I would have literally licked do off of grass before drinking a hot tub water if you can barely get me into a hot tub at a festival leave anyways that was the first place I remember seeing water very prominently displayed in a pagan ritual and it was very very important to them but water shared is lifeshare we are water you know we'd need water to survive when we're sharing water we're sharing a little bit of ourselves and this is water that has been drank and evaporated rain down upon the Earth grown into something else and through the cycle or Millennia your drinking water that dinosaurs drink this water has been around for a while and so it's that deep history it's best subconscious it's the past it's that slow mo  knowledge you know all of this is there so when you're drinking this water you're literally drinking history you're sharing life with everyone that has ever been on this planet and everyone that ever will be on this planet I think you're starting to shed some light into the review some of the reasons why I've never really been a water Drinker this right you're kind of making it less appealing is this time goes on I think of it and blesses swapping Spit with Hitler and more like a mountain I guess yeah oh God I don't know the Earth itself something cooler I don't know but I think that water is definitely an element that people shy away from that really should be I think delved into more you know you got that that mental part of air you've got that Solid Ground and part of Earth you've got that  passionate Drive of fire you need to bring that emotional sense of water into things there's four elements for a reason because we require that balance and I I think that water is always the one that came to get shunned a little bit because there is an air of mystery that can be scary but I think it should be equally delved into his as the other elements I think some of it may come from a fear of self-reflection people to tend to get nervous when things get too deep it's definitely a lot going on underneath the surface most of the time like with fire it's pretty cut-and-dry like we spoke about before you know fire it's there it's in your face it's can't be messed where is water there's just so much unknown in mystery our memories and our Deep Emotions you know it's scary in there lying around in your brain  yeah so I think that's why I sometimes we kind of shy away from it a little bit but one of the ways that I found that made working with water easier for me was which is like Moon water right absolutely everybody's got that shit out on their porches on their window sills and then not a damn one knows what to do with it afterwards so we get our cute little jar we put some water in it and we set Our intention over the water right we're like for this full moon I want charge this water with the power of the Moon and we put it out under the full moon and it gets charged and we save this phone moon is the energized mood and so I have this energized full moon water why don't we do that with ourselves if I'm 60% water why can't I put myself out under the full moon and charge myself  with the power of that full moon energy and self-love or motivation or charge myself with whatever energy intention I want in charge of the water in this cute little jar you should be absolutely I think we tend to ignore things are easier in the fire of action and outward emotion Earth that your body that are that your breath these things like you said are easy to see they're out there they're right there and our subconscious and our emotions are so much harder to work with and I think we tend to skip over that so on the next full moon set the intention that we more comfortable with the deeper parts of our magical brain and in our subconscious and treat ourselves as they're really cool jar holding the water and put ourselves out under the full moon to absorb of all of that beautiful energy still working with water there is an element of self-care that is that  you're saying exactly what I'm saying bubble bath with candles and herbs Adorn myself with crystals and herbs and oils and ghosts and sacred holy and badass if you call that self-care that's exactly what I'm doing and put yourself in front of the Moon people that's what we're saying  intentions for you you know instead of setting out that mood but you're not going to forget what it was for that that's such a great idea because I think that people sometimes tend to forget themselves in this whole mix of magic absolutely I've made Super Moon water there's been times where we've had outrageous thunder and lightning storms where I've I've done other person. I have a couple jobs full of water that I need to do something with so I am just as guilty as every other person that uses for Moon water usually depend on the energy of the moon but in general it's for purification spell work and for offering and you also mentioned stormwater and that's collected the same way that you would collect Moon Water by putting water out to absorb the energy of that storm or better yet  by putting out a container to let the storm itself fill that container with water from the storm storm water is full of the raw energy of that weather event it carries the same amount of power that Tempest did and in my opinion the more powerful the storm the more powerful the water and it's great when you need that wild Untamed energy of a storm for protection or big motivation power through something whenever you need that powerful thunder and lightning if there's anything that you would want son type energy for growth Vitality success motivation power Clarity all these things there's a lot of different types of water water is great for holding on to energy and taking the shape of what your intention is so there are a ton of different kinds of water  Aunty during the summer where you put the water out on the you know put it out on the deck and let it sit with tea bags under the sun I love that I love that so much we used to do that when I was a kid and I just love that but I don't necessarily think of that is some water because its teeth at I'm drinking but you're absolutely right at the T in there that corresponds to what you want in your life you know you want some energize peace in your life to some chamomile in meant to have a calm day where you get it done put that in the Sun and add that energize energy to the Sun so when you make your tea put it out in the sun with the intention of gathering that energy because water easily pulls and things like that it very easily poles in those energies and those intentions and it also has a lot of properties by itself you know we talked about taking showers to cleanse ourselves if you're cleansing  or if you want to get something away from you running water weather real running water of a river or your faucet or your toilet is a great way to Paul energies away from you if you magical properties of running water are change and are pulling things away it's cleansing you have no idea how many bay leaves write somebody's name on a piece of toilet paper and flush it is a very simple way to get them out of your life not just the symbology of the toilet getting that piece of shit to go away but also the symbology of the running water because running water is magical folk magic says that evil spirits can't cross running water so by using that you get that negativity away from you I have a funniest a quick funny story so it my awesome awesome part time job at one of the witchy stores downtown the big boss has a rule and he's going to laugh when he hears me  so his Rule and it involves water in the bathroom toilet seat always has to be closed why would you ask why is it so imperative that he insists the toilet seat be closed cuz he doesn't want the demons coming up man keep them demons down whatever the demons are that's up to you to imagine but keep the demons down keep the seat down because you know that's another thing people always talk about how energy use and in spirit energy scan travel Spirit travel through water protections looking up to see you off your space you would be remiss if you forgot about water lines and water connections cuz just as much as electrical lines can be a conduit for spirits to move about water can be a conduit for spirits to move about too and my boss does not want no bulshit coming out of that toilet  sound water is definitely a conduit for Spiritual energy for Spirits in our previous podcast we looked into Supernatural events and hauntings around the country I was very very surprised at how often a lot of these haunted places were on top of or very close to running water some sort of correlation it's definitely a conduit for Spirit movement so keep the toilet lid down my friends but you know also same thing when you're cleansing you know if your cleansing your space warding off space just as much as you would cleanse and seal mirrors in window ways you would do the same with faucets your toilette Etc an opening into your house they don't realize that a heat vent or a water pipe or an electrical outlet isn't opening into your house and so if you are being very serious about Warden your house people  cleanse and seal all openings of their home so yeah we don't always think about those those are just some of the things about water that sometimes people forget about because water is the one cuz no one wants to deal with that emotional when he wants to deal with that emotional shit we all want to get around that but that's the one that we really need to work with our bodies are so much water our brains are so much water by connecting with that by controlling that in harnessing that we can start to make it work for us and help us achieve our goals Waters powerful water wheels are one of the first ways that people made energy so will you know if you can harness that power it might feel slow at first but you get that Rushing Water going in there's not a lot I can stop whole wall of water that's one way to raise a lot of energy for a spell working I absolutely love water you know like I was saying before that energy that you get at the ocean you know if so  loving and caring but yet like kind of a jekyll-and-hyde it can be so destructive and horrible and you know when you look at the earth the earth is covered mostly in water we don't know what the hell is under there so it's also water is the ocean is kind of that that last mysterious all the Mysteries that are left it seems in this world are in the water right now it's been deep it's those deep dark depths that were very scared of the ones in our brain and the ones on the planet but there are also those ones that have those hidden secret jewels and gems and nuggets of wisdom and wonder in amazement is probably my favorite offering to make to any deities any land Spirit pretty much anybody that you offer water to except for maybe a purifier spirit is going to be appreciative of that water  because water shared is Life share its it makes up so much of what's on this planet it makes up pretty much everything and we all need it in some way to survive so by sharing water so you're basically saying I respect you I respect your life and that's that's a beautiful thing and so it makes a very easy simple offering to your ancestors or to your deities or or to your Spirit guides I see people all the time that are like I made this offering of food what do I do with it now or I may just offering how do I dispose of it with water you don't ever have to worry about that you can just let it evaporate you can put it out on the earth that is something that's always accepted I like the water is probably the easiest offering it is probably my second go to for offering as you are for a weed I'm not going to lie I usually roll a joint with other herbs with the intention of making the smoke my offering  I look at it as something to mean something to me but water is is definitely my second go to cuz like you said it's something that it's almost a representation of giving a part of myself as that offering you know going back to the we are made up 60% of water it's the thought of giving an offering of a piece of yourself a piece of life just makes me want to go get a drink yeah I'm kind of all right well I'm going to go to the ocean I'm going to close all my windows against this major storm that's moving in
